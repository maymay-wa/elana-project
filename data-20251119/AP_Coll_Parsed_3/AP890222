busy schedule with a long roster of foreign leaders who came to 
attend the funeral on friday bush was wearing a dark blue suit with 
a red striped tie and mrs bush wore a black coat in the 45degree 
chill 
an hour earlier french president francois mitterrand arrived at 
haneda bush and the french leader planned to have lunch at the us 
ambassadors mansion in central tokyo 
police said traffic on expressways was 50 percent below normal 
thursday morning and 20 to 30 percent lower than normal on city 
streets because many drivers decided not to brave the heavy security 
roadblocks 
on wednesday a list of 71 arriving foreign leaders included king 
hussein of jordan king juan carlos of spain and indonesian 
president suharto dignitaries representing 163 countries will be on 
hand for the state funeral for hirohito who died jan 7 at age 87

leaders bush meets prime minister noboru takeshita thursday and 
mrs bush will take tea with takeshitas wife naoko 
emperor akihito and empress michiko who have made daily visits 
to join in a vigil in the chamber in the imperial palace where 
hirohitos coffin lies will meet each of the visiting dignitaries 
in audiences and functions scheduled through tuesday 
as part of the weeks funeral diplomacy takeshita met 
wednesday with early arrivals including finnish president mauno 
koivisto soviet vice president anatoly lukyanov and president 
marshal mobutu sese seko of zaire he was scheduled to see 40 
foreign dignitaries before sunday 
japanese and soviet officials meanwhile agreed to continue 
meetings in march and may aimed at resolving the old dispute over 
sovietheld islands north of japan 
the talks were not on concrete issues and did not bear concrete 
fruit but positive progress was made in the sense that both 
sides agreed to continue meetings said a senior foreign ministry 
official speaking on condition he not be identified 
japanese authorities determined to prevent disruptions of this 
unprecedented opportunity for diplomatic contacts began strict 
inspections of mail and cargo shipments 
security at the airports where foreign dignitaries were arriving 
was tightened following the discovery tuesday of timed projectile 
launchers near the new tokyo international airport at narita 40 
miles northeast of tokyo 
police said the launchers apparently were set by radical groups 
seeking to disrupt funeral events but news reports said their 
projectiles did not contain explosive charges on wednesday 7000 
uniformed and plainclothes police were deployed in the area 
officials said 
in all 32000 police will mobilized throughout the city on 
friday 
authorities conducted doublechecks of baggage at airports cargo 
and mail shipments were inspected and restricted and some 
commercial flights were been canceled to accommodate arriving 
foreign delegations 
teams of 10 to 20 policemen manned vehicle checkpoints throughout 
the city while others kept a constant surveillance over central 
tokyo and the routes to the airports some officers poked into 
garbage set out at curbside and others searched roadside bushes 
a powerful explosion feb 3 at togo shrine in central tokyo 
believed to have been carried out by extremists occurred in a 
carefully patrolled area about a halfmile from the shinjuku 
imperial gardens where the funeral will be held 
projectiles similar to those found at narita were launched in 
april 1986 apparently in an attempt to disrupt plans for 
celebrating the 60th year of hirohitos reign and the following 
month when the leaders of seven major industralized democracies met 
in tokyo

with his car repairman 
bridges entered the plea tuesday in los angeles county municipal 
court and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for march 23 the

bush will spend two nights in the hotel most likely in the 
imperial suite used by then president reagan during the 1986 
economic summit the hilltop site of the 27yearold hotel was owned 
by the noble okura family which had run one of the big prewar 
industrial combines called zaibatsu 
the 888room hotel across the street from the us embassy and 
ambassadors residence just finished a threeyear refurbishment 
last september the management says the us delegation is taking 
about 400 of the okuras rooms and 13 other foreign delegations to 
the funeral of emperor hirohito also will be housed there

the palace where hirohito spent part of his young manhood and 
early married life before he ascended the throne in 1926 was 
completed in 1909 to be the crown princes residence and was such a 
grand building that the meiji emperor 18681912 was said to be 
unwilling to visit it 
modeled on the palace at versailles and the louvre akasaka 
palace is a grand example of architecture in the late meiji period 
when japan then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation was 
trying to outdo the west most of the building materials and 
furnishings were imported 
the palace which sits in its own large park was restored in the 
1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and to 
hold major conferences such as the 1986 economic summit prime 
minister noboru takeshita will host a reception there following the 
hirohito funeral

ara dunomalyans large sad eyes took on 
a gleam and he suppressed a proud grin as he toddled along the 
corridor of yerevans orthopedic center showing off his mobility 
with an artificial leg and a cane 
the 4yearold has triumphed over tragedy learning to walk and 
smile again after the dec 7 earthquake that crushed his left leg 
and took the lives of his mother and brother 
the innocence of childhood has allowed him to forget the horror 
of the day it rained concrete in his native town of spitak but the 
armenian and west german adults who have nursed him through trauma 
have longer memories and more fragile hearts 
eyes welled up with tears among the circle of grownup spectators 
when the motherless tot completed his performance for visiting 
foreigners by slipping a downy arm around the neck of a reporter who 
stooped to watch at his eye level brushing her cheek with a kiss 
children forget pain more easily than adults the childs 
grandfather mikhail dunomalyan said as ara hobbled off behind a 
brigade of wheelchairs bearing legless children through an obstacle 
course of nurses and technicians 
the orthopedic center on a hill overlooking the smogshrouded 
armenian capital has been helped by a prosthesis workshop set up by 
the west german red cross 
orthopedic technician kristof blum of saarbruecken works in the 
room filled with childsized rubber hands plastic knee joints 
artificial feet and connecting braces that slap visitors in the face 
with the reality and breadth of the suffering inflicted by the 
disaster 
blum and a halfdozen armenian assistants put in long days in the 
laboratory custommaking prostheses and working through the list of 
amputees that lengthens daily as word of the clinics work spreads 
through the distant backward villages hit hardest by the earthquake 
a despondent spitak father approached a visiting red cross 
inspection team monday to inquire if his crippled 15yearold 
daughter could be sent back with them to west germany for treatment 
this happens every day people wanting to send their children 
abroad for the same treatment weve worked to provide here blum 
said they all want what is best for their children and they 
believe that it lies far away but what they fail to understand is 
the need for the family to be close by to help during the recovery 
period sometimes a mother or father is all these children have 
left 
the clinics hallways and stairwells are crowded with idle and 
homeless relatives of the patients brought here from makeshift 
hospitals set up in the earthquake zone to treat the more than 
31000 injured 
relief efforts in the 10 weeks since the disaster have 
concentrated on the immediate tasks of medical care and food supply 
and the provision of new housing for the estimated 100000 left 
homeless will take at least two years 
the relatives of those hospitalized spend their days caring for 
the patients and their nights in tent cities and temporary shelters 
aras ready to go home now but he has no home to go to said 
ilya osepyan director of the 250bed orthopedic clinic that has 
treated thousands of victims 
we are trying to arrange temporary shelter for those who have 
recovered at a childrens sanatorium but the adults have to be 
accommodated too the doctor said 
blum has fitted more than 30 children with artificial limbs since 
he arrived a month ago as well as 50 adults more than 300 people 
are awaiting prostheses and the clinic expects to fulfill that need 
within six months 
the childrens prostheses must be replaced as they grow so we 
expect to keep volunteers here for at least two years or until a 
local staff can be trained to take over the work blum said 
the prosthesis center is one of several projects taken on by the 
west german red cross under the loosely organized disaster recovery 
plan being developed by the soviet government 
worldwide donations that generated a record foreign contribution 
for disaster relief have slowed to a trickle but international red 
cross societies and church organizations have collected hundreds of 
millions of dollars for longterm relief and are negotiating with 
moscow and yerevan authorities over how the money can best be spent 
the west german red cross has built a field hospital in the city 
of stepanavan where 80 percent of the buildings were destroyed and 
plans to reconstruct the village of kursali near spitak with the 
help of volunteers from the soviet republic of estonia 
the tears have dried and everyone will eventually be treated 
osepyan told the west germans who toured the prosthesis workshop and 
recovery wards but it will take years to bring armenia back to a 
state that could be considered normal

the governor offered on tuesday to lead 
negotiations aimed at ending a twoday walkout at staterun general 
hospital that had national guardsmen in combat fatigues caring for 
hundreds of patients 
gov edward d diprete made the offer to joseph g fargnoli 
president of the union representing the hospitals nurses and 
attendants as the two met privately for about an hour said nanci 
martin dipretes spokeswoman 
the governors going to hold a meeting at 10 am tomorrow in 
his office for both sides martin said previous negotiations have 
seen dipretes aides shuttling between both sides but this meeting 
would be face to face she said 
fargnoli made no commitment to diprete that the workers would 
return martin said fargnoli still had to report to the unions 
executive committee which would decide on further action union 
spokesman henry griggs said 
earlier tuesday a judge gave the strikers 24 hours to end their 
walkout the second job action in three weeks in a dispute over 
staffing superior court judge antonio s almeida granted the 
states request for a backtowork order citing a risk of 
irreparable harm to patients 
diprete called out the national guard on sunday for the second 
time in three weeks after a walkout by scores of workers over 
staffing levels talks broke down friday 
state officials had warned that patients lives were threatened 
and hospital administrator james p benedict said he was ready to 
empty out entire units 
the governor visited the hospital and said he was willing to keep 
the guard on duty as long as they need people here he said he 
was satisfied with the patient care 
sixtyeight guardsmen including seven with nursing training 
were at the hospital benedict said about 40 were working at the 
neighboring institute of mental health where union workers also 
failed to show said a guard spokesman 
guardsmen spent much of their time bathing and feeding patients 
at the 480bed hospital which serves primarily chronically ill 
patients needing longterm care 
the guardsmen are paid an average of 60 per day said capt john 
loughlin a guard spokesman 
a fourday sickout by union members ended jan 31 when diprete 
called out the guard 
the workers are angry at what they claim is the states failure 
to fill vacancies the state in an effort to cut overtime costs 
has refused in many cases to bring in additional workers to replace 
employees who call in sick 
staffing is the prerogative of management diprete said 
were on the threshold of what will be a milestone of philosophy 
of who operates the hospital 
benedict said 16 acutecare patients had been moved to other 
hospitals and six more would be shipped out about 410 patients 
were at the hospital 
ill be contacting more facilities than ive contacted already 
in hopes of appealing to them to take patients more rapidly for 
us the hospital director said we could begin to empty out 
entire units if need be 
thirtytwo of 85 normally scheduled attendants were on duty for 
the morning and afternoon shift twentyfour of 32 nurses were on 
duty for the morning shift and 20 for the afternoon shift some 
workers had been held over from previous shifts 
any emergency can happen at any time so i feel the patients 
lives are in danger said hospital medical director dr rajnikant 
shah he said half the patients were in medical danger

aflcio leaders offered praise for labor 
secretary elizabeth dole after their first meeting despite 
disagreements on proposals to raise the minimum wage and expand 
child care and parental leave opportunities 
im sure that there will be some areas where we disagree and 
will pursue our best efforts in the congress but i have a high 
regard for the secretary of labor for secretary dole federation 
president lane kirkland said tuesday after the second day of the 
aflcios annual meeting 
for her part mrs dole emerged from the meeting with the labor 
groups executive council with a promise that she would open her 
door to organized labor something union leaders say was missing 
during the reagan administration 
nonetheless there were several evident disagreements between the 
positions of the administration and labor particularly over whether 
legislation to increase the minimum wage from 335 to 465 an hour 
should contain a provision allowing for a lower training wage for 
youths 
mrs dole said bushs support hinged on inclusion of the training 
wage something labor leaders fervently oppose 
the two sides agreed to work together on an issue mrs dole 
raised studying ways to establish portable pension systems so 
workers who change jobs frequently because of the changing economy 
can amass a retirement fund 
neither side offered specifics of how such a program would work 
but kirkland thanked mrs dole for raising the issue and said labor 
would offer its ideas to her 
mrs dole also promised a thorough review of a proposal released 
by the department before she took office to lift a nearly 
50yearold ban on industrial homework in the womens apparel 
industry but she said she was reluctant to even consider 
reestablishing several similar bans in the garment industry that 
were lifted during the reagan years a request the executive council 
had made on monday 
whether the cordial relationship between labor and the bush 
administration lasts could be determined in the next 10 days when 
bush likely will decide whether to name an emergency board to 
intervene in stalled negotiations between eastern airlines and 9000 
members of the international association of machinists 
the machinists are scheduled to strike march 4 but the aflcio 
has asked bush to intervene a move that would automatically push 
back the strike deadline 60 days 
mrs dole said bush was awaiting advice from the labor and 
transportation departments before making a decision

the brumby rocker a classic chair on 
southern porches for nearly a century and a fixture in jimmy 
carters white house will rock into history when production ends 
later this month 
carole melson who revived manufacture of the highbacked 
caneseated rocker in 1972 said supplies of airdried oak boards 
needed for the rocker have dwindled in the past two years nearly 
all commercially available hardwood is kilndried 
so even though there are customers for the chairs which cost 
745 to 845 she decided to stop production at the end of the month 
im fighting a losing battle here mrs melson said i 
dont want to substitute its better to retire it than to mess it 
up 
the chair one of the oldest unchanged products still made in 
georgia has been called a southern icon jimmy carter took a brumby 
to the white house with him when he was president 
lt gov zell miller who has a brumby in his office said the 
decision to stop making them was a shame 
i wish i had more than one he said its one reason that i 
stay so mellow and in such good humor 
donald c peirce decorative arts curator at the atlanta high 
museum of art which has a brumby in its furniture collection said 
mrs melson was sort of reviving a craft tradition its sad to 
see something like that no longer available 
the brumby chair co started as a barrelmaking operation shortly 
after the civil war mrs melson said the first rocker likely was 
built by 1875 and the design was put into production around 1890 
she said 
at its peak the company employed hundreds of workers at its 
marietta plant and produced thousands of rockers a day the company 
closed during world war ii she said 
mrs melson said she discovered an old brumby in the 1960s when 
she was looking for a comfortable chair in which to rock her 
children to sleep 
i had to rock them by the hour she said 
she and her husband frank were so taken with the chair that 
they decided to bring it back and make it under license from the 
familyowned brumby chair co which existed only on paper 
her husband died shortly before the couples rocker shop in 
marietta opened in 1972

a navajo tribal judge tuesday barred 
the ruling council of the countrys largest indian nation from 
ousting its chairman his brotherinlaw who has been accused in 
congressional testimony of corruption 
the tribal council had tried to place chairman peter macdonald 
and his associate vice chairman johnny thompson on administrative 
leave as a result of the judges action thompson apparently became 
temporary chairman of the councils winter meeting which had tried 
to choose different leaders to preside over the battle over 
macdonalds fate 
tribal district judge harry brown macdonalds brotherinlaw 
issued the temporary restraining order said geoffrey standing bear 
macdonalds attorney brown scheduled a hearing for friday to 
determine whether to permanently halt the councils decision to 
place macdonald and thompson on paid leave standing bear said 
brown found that the council failed to follow the correct 
procedure for removing a chairman from office last friday night 
when it voted 4913 against macdonald and thompson standing bear 
said 
the chairman is entitled to his constitutional rights he 
added 
standing bear would not answer questions about why he went to a 
judge in kayenta about 140 miles by indirect roads from the tribal 
capital when he could have sought the order in any district court 
he acknowledged that macdonald and brown are married to sisters 
and said brown expected to be overruled by another judge because of 
the conflict 
council members nevertheless were advised by navajo attorney 
general michael upshaw to obey the order of the court upshaw 
refused to comment further but said he would answer written 
questions from the council on the legality of further procedures 
after browns order was read chairmandesignate marshall plummer 
stood up thompson sat down and plummer squatted at the right of 
thompsons chair 
the subtle transfer of power was indicated by thompsons 
remaining seated said councilman leonard haskie of tohachi nm 
marshall plummer stepped aside out of respect for the court and 
only did that because of the court order haskie said we plan 
to consult with our attorneys on our next course of action because 
the navajo nation cannot continue at a standstill 
macdonald was in window rock but did not attend the meeting his 
staff said 
a us senate committee heard testimony earlier this month that 
macdonald took kickbacks and gifts particularly in a deal in which 
a phoenix oilman made 72 million profit from the sale of the big 
boquillas ranch to the tribe

el salvadors leftist rebels offered 
tuesday to lay down their weapons if the military is sharply cut 
the police force reorganized and next months presidential elections 
postponed by at least four months 
the rebels proposed the compromise during a meeting with 
representatives with salvadoran political parties who said they 
would see president jose napoleon duarte on wednesday and asked him 
to meet with rebels on the offer 
it was the first time the rebels had offered to lay down their 
arms last month they offered for the first time to participate in 
national elections 
delegates of the 13 political parties issued a declaration 
tuesday night saying they were committed to consider the offer of 
the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front and to offer 
our contribution in whatever is necessary to the peace process as 
long as the government accepts the possibility of realizing the 
contents of the proposal 
the parties had met for two days to discuss how to end a 
nineyear civil war that has claimed 70000 lives 
the fronts offer attempted to address a major stumbling block in 
the talks the constitutional requirement that duarte leave office 
by june 1 by proposing an interim president 
there was no immediate response from the government 
the rebel proposal appears aimed at neutralizing el salvadors 
rightistdominated military which has warned publicly it might 
seize power in a coup if duarte does not step down as scheduled 
i would say in general that the government has to talk now that 
they cannnot refuse or evade direct talks with the fmln said 
ruben zamora of the the leftist democratic convergence a coalition 
of six small parties 
the offer was made as guerrillas in el salvador attacked the 
countrys principal army base and an engineering detachment leaving 
eight dead and 17 injured 
reports from san salvador said the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance or arena was standing firm against postponing 
the march 19 vote which it is favored to win but deputy chairman 
jose francisco merino lopez said the party would not tip its hand 
the arena and guerrilla representatives met for talks tuesday 
morning but both groups refused to disclose details 
at an afternoon news conference one arena delegate jose 
francisco guerrero called the guerrilla attitude sincere but 
would not say whether the party favored or rejected postponement of 
the election 
peace is very distant but the distance is not so great said 
guerrero with the cooperation of the fmln and ours we can achieve 
peace in the short term 
guillermo ungo presidential candidate of the democratic 
convergence told reporters here the new guerrilla proposal was a 
very important change that would give us a better chance for peace 
but ungo said he did not see any possibility of achieving 
concrete results the rebels themselves appeared pessimistic about 
the prospects of their offer 
for reactionaries such as arena it would seem that the meeting 
with the fmln is more an opportunity for dilatory maneuvers than the 
mature response that the people demand for a viable means of 
pointing the country toward peace they said in a tuesday 
broadcast on the clandestine radio venceremos 
rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only 
continue but will escalate the radio said 
essentially the guerrilla front reduced its original request for 
a postponement by two months in january the front asked for a 
sixmonth postponement after a ceasefire goes into force 
the fmln broadened the scope of the talks here with its call for 
a ceasefire for cutting the armed forces from its current strength 
of about 56000 to its 1978 level of 12000 and for a merging of 
three police forces into a single force 
the proposal also called for members of death squads be brought 
to justice many slayings have been attributed to death squads 
allegedly linked to arena a charge arena denies 
both sides at the talks here have acknowledged that even if they 
reach an accord they would still confront the problem of pursuading 
the military and the government to go along 
a text of the proposal distributed here and in san salvador 
called for the establishment of three multiparty commissions to 
negotiate an end to the fighting rewrite the countrys election 
laws and setting up international verification of the entire peace 
process 
the front proposed a march 19 deadline for the commissions to end 
their work it suggested the national legislature choose an 
independent provisional president to rule the country after june 1 
when the constitution says duarte must leave office 
as one way around the constitutional issue on elections the 
fmln proposes the legislative assembly name an independent as 
provisional president with the agreement of the political parties 
and the explicit stipulation that his term runs until the 
elections the guerrilla proposal said 
the other major party represented at this mountain resort about 
40 miles southeast of mexico city are the incumbent christian 
democrats running second in polls the democratic convergence is 
running a weak third

a 57yearold man who admitted setting up bogus 
federal programs to entice young children to participate in 
socalled scientific experiments was convicted of 12 counts of 
sexually abusing children 
an allegheny county jury deliberated 5 hours tuesday before 
deciding eugene allen of suburban wilkinsburg was guilty of all 
charges including sexual abuse of children indecent assault and 
corrupting the morals of a minor 
allen a traveling salesman who dropped out of high school 
photographed two children aged 8 and 9 while catheterizing them 
and using a selfinvented device called a kidney machine on them 
he claimed his research and experiments with the device which he 
had advertised as federally sponsored were legitimate efforts to 
detect kidney failure in children 
dr norman t welford former deputy director for the us food 
and drug administration testified the machine which was heated up 
when in use would have cooked the children if it had operated 
as allen intended 
allens experiments on the children were filmed in his basement 
and at a cottage in rural cochranton 
testifying in his own defense tuesday allen said he videotaped 
and photographed hundreds of encounters with children and stored the 
tapes under floorboards in his house for my own sexual pleasure 
he said he thought about seeking medical help but was too 
embarrassed 
allen faces 55 to 111 years in jail

education secretary lauro cavazos told a house 
panel he knew neither his exact budget nor how he would pay for 
president bushs 441 million in new education programs prompting 
one lawmaker to complain of deception by the white house 
initially education officials said the 441 million for bushs 
new programs would come on top of former president reagans proposed 
219 billion education budget for fiscal 1990 but cavazos backed 
off that tuesday during an appearance before the house 
appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human resources and 
education 
the only thing that we have today that is solid is the 219 
billion cavazos told subcommittee chairman william natcher dky 
cavazos added there would be no set number until after 
negotiations with congress were completed 
the administration testimony prompted rep david obey dwis to 
complain 
all the critical decisions have been postponed to a later date 
in order to pretend that a process is moving forward when in fact it 
is not there is a very important deception going on here 
democrats are becoming increasingly irritated over bushs failure 
to specify spending cuts to comply with deficit reduction 
requirements instead bush sent congress a series of initiatives 
including the 10 education programs costing 441 million and said 
cuts would be negotiated later with congress 
bush in presenting a 116 trillion budget has said cuts must 
come from a pool of discretionary programs worth 136 billion in the 
current budget by freezing that figure for 1990 budget makers will 
have to trim 10 billion to 11 billion in what would have been 
normal growth in the programs 
many of them are educational programs 
i can understand why you might be chafing a little bit about 
the numbers deputy education undersecretary charles kolb told 
members of the panel but ambiguity is inherent in this process 
i think the president has made it absolutely clear as to where 
his priorities lie in terms of education kolb said 
well he may have made it clear to you but let me tell you 
something i have no idea where this money is supposed to come 
from obey interrupted 
it is certainly legitimate to question whether those are in 
fact real initiatives or public relations initiatives which might 
become real at a later date only if other spending cuts can be found 
in your department obey said 
reagan recommended that 24 programs be eliminated and the 
resulting 750 million in savings be shifted to several large 
programs serving the disadvantaged cavazos embraced that plan as 
well as bushs new programs most of them stemming from campaign 
promises

baker said tuesday that the united states has a responsibility to 
speak out against irans threats but he refused to criticize the 
us corporations and bookstores that now refuse to sell the book 
the book is viewed by many moslems as blasphemous while author 
salman rushdie has said he did not intend to insult fellow moslems 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has refused to accept the 
apology and has ordered the writer killed 
bakers restrained comments contrasted with the heated 
denunciations of terrorism issued repeatedly by former secretary of 
state george shultz 
baker discussed the book controversy during testimony before the 
house foreign affairs committee several congressmen were far more 
critical of the us booksellers that have pulled the book in 
response to the iranian threats 
rep robert torricelli dnj said that while the bookstore 
companies may have legitimate concerns he argued that they are 
setting a dangerous precedent 
american publishers and book distributors are at this moment on 
the front lines of defending our fundamental freedoms to speak and 
to publish it appears to me that they have done a grave national 
disservice torricelli said 
rep tom lantos dcalif asserted that spineless american 
bookchains are trembling before these terrorist threats of the 
ayatollah 
some of the nations largest chains such as b dalton and barnes 
amp noble took the satanic verses off the shelves but they 
refuse to say whether they will continue to sell the book 
waldenbooks has removed the book from shelves but will continue to 
sell it upon request 
im not sure its our job to sit here in judgment on those 
people we have spoken out we will continue to do so we will 
continue to work quietly with our allies with respect to issues of 
terrorism and statesponsored terrorism like this baker told the 
committee 
i do think its incumbent upon us as a government to continue 
to pursue a policy that rules out concessions to terrorists but it 
seems to me that concessions to terrorists may be different than 
wellfounded fears on the part of private citizens about their own 
welfare and safety 
president bush said tuesday that such bookstore owners should be 
given the protection of the law 
bush condemned irans death decree against the british novelist 
as deeply offensive to the norm of civilized behavior and warned 
that tehran would be held accountable for any actions against 
american interests

president bush is making his sixth visit to 
china this week on previous trips he found the streets dusty the 
architecture reminiscent of hollywood and the chinese inattentive to 
his desires to see high officialdom 
he also concluded that his guest room probably was bugged 
in looking forward the preelection autobiography he wrote 
with journalist victor gold in 1987 bush recalled some diplomatic 
code words from his first visit to china he wrote that when an 
official said it was not convenient to meet with him that meant 
he would see the official when hell freezes over 
if it was possible but might take a while it might be five 
to 20 years 
on this visit of course chinese officials will find it both 
convenient and possible to meet with the american president who 
first went to beijing as us diplomatic envoy in the fall of 1974 
and served 16 months 
bush and his wife barbara paid an unofficial return visit in 
1977 
then in a 1980 trip as presidential candidate ronald reagans 
running mate he tried not very successfully to ease chinese 
anxieties over reagans policy of close ties with the government on 
taiwan 
in 1982 bush visited again as president reagans vice president 
and chinese officials said their meetings gave new momentum to 
stalemated talks on chinese objections to us arms sales to the 
taiwanese 
in 1985 back in beijing on another presidential mission he 
found the chinese still irritated by american support for taiwan 
but responded that the administration was reducing its arms sales to 
the nationalist chinese 
today the issues are different and bush told reporters at a 
jan 27 news conference that on a nostalgic basis needless to say 
barbara and i are looking forward in a very personal way to 
going back to beijing 
the president in his book had an observation on the security 
afforded a visiting american official 
he had 15 security officers with him on his 1985 visit and is 
expected to be accompanied by a full secret service contingent when 
he arrives this time in 1974 however he questioned whether 
visiting secretary of state henry kissinger needed all the 
bodyguards he brought with him 
i stopped counting after half a dozen he said the number 
did seem excessive in a country so tightly controlled that the 
american secretary of states security was virtually guaranteed by 
his hosts 
he also found the chinese capital dusty 
for all beijings historic grandeur a month there had reminded 
barbara and me of life on east seventh street in odessa texas in 
1948 he wrote in his account of the kissinger visit like 
odessa the chinese capital lies in the center of a great plain 
unpaved side streets make for limited visibility when the wind kicks 
up 
there was also a suggestion that the chinese had bugged the guest 
house where bush stayed during the kissinger visit 
according to bushs account his wife finished addressing an 
envelope then looked around for some way to affix a glueless 
chinese stamp to it and commented everythings here but the 
glue 
bush said that he and john holdridge his deputy chief of 
mission were the only other people in the room but the next day 
there was a bottle of glue on the desk 
he also recalled being taken with kissinger on a visit to the 
nearby city of suzhou and driven down an empty boulevard while he 
saw masses of people huddled on side streets held back by 
barricades an eerie even frightening demonstration of how a 
totalitarian government can control its population 
bush found the us diplomatic compound in beijing reminiscent 
of southern california architecture in the 1920s sunset boulevard 
one part spanish one part oriental 
the envoy was provided by the us government with a chrysler 
sedan but he and mrs bush took up a mode of transportation more 
common among the beijing chinese they rode bicycles 
the minister who baptized the bushs 16yearold daughter 
dorothy in 1975 still serves as pastor of chongwenmen christian 
church where bush may attend services during his twoday visit

experts inside the internal revenue service are 
recommending a thorough overhaul of the 150 separate civil penalties 
that can be imposed on people who make tax mistakes 
although the proposals have not been approved by the irs or 
higher federal agencies most of the suggestions have been endorsed 
by irs commissioner lawrence b gibbs he says the present 
crazyquilt penalty system is difficult for taxpayers to understand 
and the irs to enforce 
while the merit of each individual penalty can be defended 
when taken together they sometimes produce unintended results and 
have a combined impact that can be too severe gibbs said tuesday 
in presenting an irs task force report on penalties to a house ways 
and means subcommittee 
if taxpayers do not understand why they are being penalized he 
said compliance with the tax laws can suffer 
when the 1954 tax overhaul was enacted there were only 14 civil 
penalties most taxpayers will never encounter the bulk of todays 
150 penalties which are used to punish behavior ranging from 
defacing a stamp on a liquor bottle to fraudulently failing to 
report income 
the american institute of certified public accountants 
recommended that congress streamline irs penalty procedures but take 
its time creating new penalties 
now that the interest paid by individual taxpayers is no longer 
fully deductible while the interest received from the government 
is fully taxable it does not seem that this differential is 
necessary logical or fair said arthur s hoffman chairman of 
the organizations tax division it is a major irritant to many 
taxpayers and is generally perceived as patently inequitable 
chief judge arthur l nims iii of the us tax court asked 
congress to increase the penalty that the court may impose on 
taxpayers who file frivolous tax suits raising the 5000 penalty 
would discourage taxshelter suits he said he also recommended the 
court be permitted to penalize lawyers who draw such suits 
gibbs said that if the irs taskforce report should become law 
it would result in considerably fewer separate penalties as for 
simplification he promised only that the new system would not be 
more difficult to comprehend than the present one 
a typical low or middleincome taxpayer is likely to encounter 
only three or four of the 150 penalties for example failing to 
file a return or to pay taxes owed can result in a penalty a filing 
error caused by negligence can bring another fraud can mean still 
another 
in 1986 the irs imposed 229 million penalties for 69 billion 
but 49 percent of the dollar amount was wiped out usually as a 
result of negotiations with taxpayers 
for the irs the biggest problem is with informational returns 
such as the requirement that employers and financial institutions 
file reports of wages or interest paid about 6 million payers send 
the irs 1 billion documents failing to include the correct social 
security number or filing the documents late can result in a penalty 
on the payer of 50 per document 
the group also proposed that a person who is entitled to a refund 
be subject to a 100 penalty for failing to file a return 
apparently many taxpayers in that category now do not file gibbs 
said the absence of a penalty results in expenditure of irs 
resources to secure a return and inhibits an audit to determine the 
persons claim

nearly a million americans depend on the export 
of farm goods for their jobs according to an agriculture department 
study 
in calendar 1987 an estimated 903000 jobs were generated by 
us agricutural exports valued at 286 billion more than a third 
of the nations harvested cropland was used to produce for foreign 
buyers 
william edmondson of the departments economic research service 
said farmers and their workers accounted for about 380000 of the 
jobs linked to exports the other 523000 were outside the farm 
sector but were directly or indirectly related to the processing and 
distribution of farm exports 
edmondson whose analysis was prepared for the march issue of 
farmline magazine said the total business activity created by farm 
exports far exceeds the actual sales 
by his reckoning each dollar received from agricultural exports 
in 1987 stimulated another 165 of output in the us economy 
for example the report said farmers buy machinery and 
chemicals to produce exported crops cattle producers buy feed to 
produce exported animal products and farm products need to be 
processed packaged and transported to their destinations 
as a result the nearly 29 billion in agricultural exports in 
1987 was said to fuel an additional 472 billion in supporting 
activities 
this additional economic activity included 72 billion in the 
farm sector 37 billion in the food processing sector 152 
billion in other manufacturing sectors 58 billion in trade and 
transportation and 153 billion in other services the report 
said 
farm exports have long been regarded as a major force in the us 
economy ranging far beyond the fields and granaries of farmers 
themselves in the early 1980s when exports were considerably 
larger the impact was even greater 
in the peak year of 1981 when 433 billion worth of exports 
were sold exportrelated employment was estimated at 12 million 
about a third higher than the 1987 figure the report said us 
farm exports fell by about a third between 1981 and 1986

the agriculture department says the us wheat 
stockpile will be whittled down this spring to one of the smallest 
inventories since the end of world war ii 
by june 1 the beginning of the 198990 wheat marketing year the 
inventory may be about 534 million bushels the smallest since the 
mid1970s the departments economic research service said tuesday 
that would be less than half of the june 1 1988 carryover of 126 
billion bushels 
measured against total use the june 1 wheat reserve of 534 
million bushels would be about 21 percent of the 256 billion 
bushels consumed domestically and exported in 198889 the lowest 
stockstouse ratio since the 17 percent of 197374 
prior to that the last time the stockstouse ratio was below 
20 percent was at the end of world war ii the report said 
the average farm price of wheat in the 198889 marketing year is 
forecast to range from 365 to 380 per bushel more than 1 above 
last season 
in the early 1970s the soviet union bought huge amounts of us 
wheat which helped drain off the stockpile by the end of the 
197374 marketing year the wheat reserve was down to 3401 million 
bushels compared with total needs that year of 197 billion bushels 
drought cut into the 1988 wheat harvest and there has been brisk 
export demand the past couple of years 
plantings of winter wheat last fall for the 1989 harvest were up 
sharply but the crop has been hurt by dry conditions in large areas 
of the great plains 
the increase is attributed to higher wheat prices and the 
lowering of federal program acreage reduction requirements from 
275 percent to 10 percent the report said 
winter wheat accounts for about threefourths of total us wheat 
production with the remainder coming from springplanted crops the 
report said plantings of the 1989 spring wheat and durum crops in 
coming months are also expected to be up sharply

a supreme court ruling permitting states to use 
antiracketeering laws against adult bookstores could have a silver 
lining for supporters of freedom of expression says an expert on 
first amendment issues 
im quite encouraged said bruce ennis a lawyer who has 
argued many high court cases involving freedom of speech and freedom 
of the press 
the justices by a 63 vote said states may use 
antiracketeering laws to crack down on adult bookstores 
but they also barred states from employing such tough 
crimefighting statutes to shut down the stores before trials are 
held to determine whether any of the material sold is obscene 
left unanswered is whether the antiracketeering laws permit 
confiscation of bookstore inventories including nonpornographic 
material after there is a judgment that the stores sold obscene 
items 
ennis said he is heartened that the three dissenters tuesday 
would prohibit such posttrial seizures he said he is confident at 
least two other justices would join in barring such blanket 
confiscation of property when the high court addresses that issue 
i think well pick up at least two votes he said 
but law enforcement officials said tuesdays court ruling 
upholding an indiana antiracketeering statute is a big victory for 
them 
we won the war said stephen m sims an indiana prosecutor 
who conceded that bookstore owners won some subbattles 
indiana attorney general linley e pearson said i think the 
real reason that you have the crackdown in these kinds of cases is 
because the people do not want adult bookstores in their 
neighborhood 
the law that was upheld tuesday indianas racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations act rico is patterned after a federal 
statute aimed primarily at organized crime most states have similar 
antiracketeering laws and in 19 states besides indiana the law can 
be used to battle pornography 
a presidential commission on pornography appointed during ronald 
reagans administration urged all states to take similar steps to 
limit the spread of sexually explicit material 
in a dissenting opinion justice john paul stevens said the 
indiana law violates freedom of expression by allowing authorities 
to seize the contents of a bookstore and padlock its doors after a 
trial in which two books films or magazines sold there have been 
judged obscene 
the law arms prosecutors not with scalpels to excise obscene 
portions of an adult bookstores inventory but with sickles to mow 
down the entire undesired use stevens said 
noting that the courts majority did not decide whether 
posttrial seizures of property are constitutional he said the 
justices should have resolved that issue by ruling that such 
confiscation of property in obscenity cases is unlawful 
stevens was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
indianas rico law provides for up to eight years in prison and a 
10000 fine for each offense 
a second related law provides civil penalties that permit 
authorities to seize property owned by anyone convicted of a rico 
offense 
the justices were unanimous tuesday in ruling that such property 
seizures may not take place before trial 
indiana authorities said the 19 other states with 
antiracketeering laws that apply to obscenity are arizona 
california colorado connecticut delaware florida georgia 
hawaii idaho new jersey north dakota new york north carolina 
ohio oregon rhode island utah washington and wisconsin 
the indiana law was challenged by fort wayne bookstores inc one 
of its stores was shut down in march 1984 law enforcement officials 
padlocked it and seized its inventory 
tuesdays ruling allows the state to proceed with a trial against 
the bookstore owners even though the pretrial seizure of the 
property was overturned 
in other action the court 
refused to kill a 90 million lawsuit against television 
evangelist jimmy swaggart and others filed by marvin gorman a 
defrocked evangelist swaggart had accused of adultery in 1986 
allowed kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law as 
altered by a federal judge last year the law requires girls under 
the age of 18 to notify their parents or obtain a judges consent 
before having an abortion 
ruled by a 63 vote in a texas case that states may not give 
preferential treatment to religious publications by exempting them 
from taxes imposed on other books magazines and newspapers

national republican officials are prepared to 
denounce klansmanturnedrepublican state lawmaker david duke with a 
resolution likely to be approved by the partys executive committee 
on friday 
at the direction of party chairman lee atwater and the apparent 
concurrence of president bush a resolution was drawn up tuesday 
declaring that while duke may be a registered republican he is not 
a republican in gesture deed or belief 
in louisiana where duke won election to the state legislature 
the republican reception was more accommodating 
i dont understand what lee atwater is talking about said 
gop state rep art sour censure him for what the only control we 
have over him is what hes done since hes been a republican 
we will see if mr duke is what he says he is or what the media 
says he is added state rep peppi bruneau gop caucus chairman 
if hes what he says he is he has no problem he got to the house 
the same way everybody else did 
the louisiana legislature is convening for a special session and 
there is a challenge to seating duke but members of both parties 
predicted that the move would fail and that he would become one of 
18 republicans in the 105member chamber 
at the national party headquarters an antiduke resolution 
already was ready for adoption by the partys executive council on 
friday 
the resolution declared that the republican national committee 
and the republican party reject and condemn david duke his beliefs 
and the hate and fear he promotes 
in addition the resolution declares that duke will not be 
considered a member of the republican party and will not receive any 
aid or assistance of any kind whatsoever from the republican 
national committee duke may be a republican in party registration 
but he is not a republican in gesture deed or belief 
citing dukes former roles as grand dragon of the ku klux klan 
and founder of the national association for the advancement of white 
people the resolution said duke and these groups preach 
doctrines of racial religious and ethnic hatred bigotry and 
discrimination against american citizens which are abhorrent to the 
american tradition and have no place in the republican party 
duke 38 defeated home builder john treen 63 in saturdays 
election for a seat in the louisiana house despite endorsements for 
treen by bush former president reagan and the most powerful 
political figures in the suburban new orleans area both candidates 
were registered republicans 
duke has scoffed at threats to deny him national republican party 
money saying he never received any during his successful 
legislative campaign he also has said he is as much a 
republican as anyone 
at a news conference tuesday bush conceded his endorsement of 
dukes opponent might have been viewed by louisiana voters as 
improper or overkill 
but the president said i did what i did because of 
principle he said dukes record is one of racism and bigotry 
atwater who last week severely criticized duke said tuesday 
that he now wants to avoid getting into a public debate with the 
former klan leader 
it plays right into his hands what he wants is to get into a 
prolonged argument with me on television any other kind of media 
hes a very effective demagogue and im not going to give him 
an opportunity to do that any more

secretary of state james a baker iii says the 
peace plan drafted by central american presidents is a good 
beginning but lacks deadlines or any means of enforcing compliance 
if nicaragua reneges 
but a key democratic senator says the plan issued last week by 
the presidents of el salvador costa rica guatemala honduras and 
nicaragua stands on its own merits and will proceed with or without 
the united states 
baker told the house foreign affairs committee on tuesday the 
peace plan is flawed because it fails to account for what he said is 
nicaraguas record of broken promises specifically pledges to 
permit free elections and a free press and to liberate political 
prisoners 
he said any participation by the sandinista government in a new 
peace agreement should be monitored with the best verification we 
can get because the promises have been made more than once and 
broken more than once 
a carrotandstick approach with the imposition of specific 
deadlines is needed to spur the sandinistas to keep their word 
baker said 
what is lacking is a mechanism for enforcement to translate 
these principles into reality he said we need to establish 
timelines for performance and we have to develop incentives and 
disincentives to improve the prospects for such compliance in the 
first place 
baker called again for the end to partisan battling in congress 
over central american policy and aid to antisandinista contra 
forces now located in camps along honduras border with nicaragua 
but sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate 
foreign relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere said baker 
appeared to be treating the fivenation accord in a backhanded 
fashion 
when i hear statements that this is not a satisfactory plan i 
get the feeling we think the plan doesnt go into effect unless we 
say its ok he said this plan is not contingent on anything 
this plan goes forward whether we like it or not 
dodd said however that if nicaragua makes substantial progress 
toward meeting its promises of democratization in the coming weeks 
congress will convert future aid for the contra rebels into 
relocation assistance rather than humanitarian supplies to maintain 
them as a military force in their border camps 
baker said the decision by the central american presidents to 
address the future of the contras and their honduran camps 
themselves and to make a specific proposal within 90 days leaves the 
situation vague 
the proposal cannot be judged until you know what the plan 
is he said 
but we will not abandon the democratic resistance as we give 
diplomacy a chance baker said 
turning to el salvador baker said he believes the united states 
lacks the luxury not to recognize any government that emerges 
from upcoming elections there even if those elections are won by 
the rightist arena party 
he also said while there has been significant improvement in 
respect for civil rights in el salvador over the last eight years 
there has been some recent regression including murders 
possibly committed by uniformed members of the armed forces

suffolk county new york state and the town 
of southampton withheld information from the nuclear regulatory 
commission and should be dismissed from licensing proceedings for 
the shoreham power plant say lawyers for the long island lighting 
co 
the issue before this commission ultimately is who is in charge 
here said donald p irwin a lawyer for lilco which owns 
shoreham 
irwin argued tuesday that the state and local governments 
deliberately defied the licensing board in an attempt to keep the 
shoreham case in a legal morass that has lasted for 3 years 
but a lawyer for suffolk herbert brown said the county did not 
show bad faith when officials refused to speculate before a 
licensing panel what they would do in the event of an accident at 
the shoreham plant 
because the county has no evacuation plan they could not say 
what they would do he reasoned 
the nrc is considering whether to dismiss the state and local 
governments from the shoreham licensing proceedings nrc spokesman 
frank ingram said he did not know when a decision might come 
if the state and local governments are dismissed theoretically 
no objections would remain to licensing shoreham

the nation should react to the greenhouse 
effect on global warming by using natural gas instead of coal and by 
developing safe and publicly acceptable nuclear power a house 
panel was told 
robert m white president of the national academy of 
engineering said tuesday these are among measures needed to prevent 
further buildup of greenhouse gases that could be responsible for 
global warming 
white and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists still 
do not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other human 
activities will cause significant temperature changes leading to 
heat waves and drought 
one witness university of virginia professor patrick j 
michaels told a house energy and commerce subcommittee it would be 
more prudent to await more study before making drastic policy 
decisions 
our policy should be commensurate with the state of our 
scientific knowledge the professor of environmental sciences told 
the energy and power subcommittee 
michaels said climate experts have a clouded vision of future 
global warming and added basing sweeping environmental policy 
on such uncertainties is especially risky even if the policy is 
otherwise rational

a congressional report says fish and wildlife 
service officials ordered a changes in a report in an effort to keep 
the spotted owl off the endangered list 
the general accounting office an arm of congress said officials 
ignored scientific evidence and ordered revisions in a study 
prepared by biologists in the agencys northwest regional office 
scientists had concluded that unless logging was slowed in ancient 
forests of the northwest the owl could face extinction 
the timber industry in the northwest has opposed any effort to 
name the owl a threatened or endangered species fearing that such a 
move would disrupt logging in public forests environmentalists have 
advocated protecting the owl as part of their campaign to halt 
logging of old growth forests 
while changes are an inevitable part of any draft report review 
process the nature of the changes made in this case and the way 
they were made raise questions about whether objectivity was 
maintained the gao said 
the fish and wildlife service an interior department agency 
which determines what should be designated for protection as 
threatened or endangered is required to consider only biological 
factors in making its decision

the bulgarian businessmen checking into the 
europejski hotel shook their heads in disbelief when they saw the 
redandwhite lettered sign saying solidarity press office hotel 
club 1st floor 
a bellhop sensing the concern of his guests over the prospect of 
ordering a drink in a room occupied by polands leading opposition 
group guided the bulgarian guests to a bar in the other direction 
upstairs in the club normally reserved for hotel guests 
only the bartender also appeared a bit confused by the news 
conferences the free trade union movement holds after its nearly 
daily talks with authorities on restoring solidaritys legal status 
and ending polands acute economic crisis 
its really interesting to listen but its bad for business 
these journalists have to work and they dont drink said 
kazimierz krajewski 
solidarity has had no offices in warsaw since it was crushed in a 
december 1981 military crackdown and subsequently outlawed 
so it had to ask the government to find a place for it to hold 
news conferences during the socalled roundtable talks that began 
feb 6 
authorities first offered solidarity offices at nearby warsaw 
university but the rooms were too small and there were not enough 
telephones 
finally the governmentbacked patriotic movement for national 
rebirth a national unity organization rented rooms for the 
opposition in the europejski 
its a great improvisation said kazimierz woycicki 
organizer of the press office 
dozens of union activists have pitched in to run the press 
service compiling news bulletins and monitoring official coverage 
of the talks 
every afternoon solidarity press aides redecorate the 
rosecolored room a solidarity banner is hung on the wall and piles 
of stillbanned underground newspapers are placed on a coffee table 
the underground press which has thrived despite communist 
authorities attempts to quash it and since the roundtable talks 
began its press corps has turned out in force for the flurry of 
solidarity and official news conferences 
the addition of these alternative journalists and questions 
from curious solidarity activists who clog the room often cause the 
news conferences to drag on for as long as two hours sending some 
western journalists to the bar or back to their offices 
from time to time its difficult for us some solidarity 
activists dont always know what a press conference is and they try 
to start a discussion rather than asking pointed questions said 
woycicki himself a journalist for a churchaffiliated monthly 
solidarity has opened its conferences to the statecontrolled 
media and is keeping careful tabs on the way the roundtable talks 
are being covered 
every morning at 9 am woycicki solidarity national spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz and several other solidarity spokesmen analyze 
official newspapers and watch televison news reports on videotape 
they are especially interested in how other communist countries 
are covering the round table 
the journalists from tass the official soviet news agency 
showed a big interest in our job we have quite free relations with 
them woycicki said 
for the underground press reporting on the roundtable talks has 
offered them freedom unknown since solidarity had its own press 
during its 16month legal existence 
i can imagine a better situation with typewriters and 
telephones but i am not going to grumble said krzystof leski a 
journalist of the underground weekly tygodnik mazowsze who is 
trying to coordinate coverage of news conferences by the opposition 
press 
government news conferences at the official interpress club just 
across victory square offer simultaneous translation for foreign 
journalists and better working conditions 
but attendance there has been lower and the proceedings seem dull 
in comparison to the bustle at the europejski where only the 
barkeeper seems anxious for it all to end

diaper services are hoping that a newfound 
concern with the environment might help the cloth variety stage a 
comeback against disposables 
perhaps no other product has had such an impact on child rearing 
as the plastic and cellulose disposable diaper but critics say the 
disposable diaper which does not decay when buried has been adding 
to the countrys garbage problems since their use became widespread 
in the 1970s 
an estimated 18 billion such diapers are used and disposed of 
each year according to a new study that was commissioned by the 
trade group for diaper service companies the disposable diapers 
accounted for an estimated 36 million tons of waste last year 
about 2 percent of all waste buried in landfills said the report by 
carl lehrburger an expert in waste management 
lehrburger was planning to discuss the results today at a news 
conference 
although lehrburger insists that the national association of 
diaper services had no editorial control over the study he 
nevertheless recommends as an immediate step that parents be 
encouraged to shift to cloth diapers beyond that he suggests that 
governments consider a tax on disposable diapers and at the same 
time provide tax incentives for the diaper service industry to 
encourage such a switch 
in the coming months the cloth diaper advocates plan to press the 
environmental concerns as they lobby environmental groups as well as 
state and local officials said john shiffert executive director of 
the association in a telephone interview tuesday from its 
philadelphia headquarters 
while at least 21 states have debated legislation in recent years 
limiting or banning plastic packaging waste only in two states 
oregon and washington have the debates focused specifically on 
disposable diapers acknowledges lehrburger in both states the 
legislation affecting diapers failed 
disposable diaper manufacturers have in the past disputed the 
claim that soiled diapers pose a health hazard and have suggested 
the impact of disposable diapers on the landfill problem is being 
exaggerated 
officials of both procter amp gamble and kimberlyclark which 
together account for 80 percent of the disposable diaper sales 
could not be reached tuesday 
lehrburger in his report estimates that about 2 percent of the 
wastes put into landfills comes from disposable diapers and as 
states and local governments impose recycling requirements on other 
garbage such as bottles and paper these diapers will account for an 
even higher percentage of the total wastes buried 
as a society we have been sold on the idea of disposability 
without full recognition of the costs associated with this 
convenience writes lehrburger 
the report he continues hopefully will be the beginning 
point for a public policy debate over the benefits and drawbacks 
of what many parents of young children have come to consider an 
indispensable product

the first us lawmaker to visit paraguay since 
the coup earlier this month says the south american nations new 
leader is vowing to rid the country of its reputation as a haven for 
thieves and scoundrels 
rep bruce a morrison dconn said tuesday that he met for an 
hour last week with gen andres rodriguez who ousted president 
alfredo stroessner in a coup feb 3 
in our conversation the provisional president was very 
specific morrison said he even assured me that he is willing 
to receive requests from those who hunt war criminals because he 
wants to end paraguays historic reputation as a haven for exnazis 
drug dealers and third world dictators 
the congressman said rodriguez also promised to help fight drug 
trafficking paraguay is known as a key moneylaundering center for 
cocaine profits 
but morrison who later in the day briefed state department 
officials on his visit said the bush administration should base 
its policies toward paraguay on future actions not promises 
also on tuesday the political council of the organization of 
american states adopted a resolution that the rodriguez government 
guarantee a process of democratization with true participation of 
all the political parties in clean and impeccable elections 
a special envoy of the new paraguayan government accepted the 
unanimous resolution 
the council acted after a paraguayan opposition leader domingo 
laino suggested that holding elections too early would ensure 
return to power of stroessners colorado party laino noted that the 
oas human rights commission has declared that paraguays political 
structure is seriously tilted toward the colorado 
laino said the christian democratic party and his own liberal 
party are illegal and the current law forbids the establishment of 
alliances or electoral fronts

the chicago board of trade should broaden its 
review of futures contracts daily trading activity and traders in 
order to do a better job of detecting abuses a government agency 
has concluded 
the commodity futures trading commission which reviewed the 
activities of the worlds largest futures market from july 1987 to 
april 1988 said the boards routine computer surveillance program 
was inadequate 
the cftc called for modifications to the program 
a similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last review 
of the board of trade in 1986 but received little public attention 
however the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in chicago 
is reviewing evidence from a twoyear fbi undercover investigation 
of widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
in reaction to the fbi investigation congress is closely 
scrutinizing both the chicago markets and the commissions oversight 
of them the agencys legislative authorization expires sept 30 and 
congress may demand reforms before passing it 
in response to the report board of trade officials noted that 
the exchanges directors voted earlier this month to spend 1 
million this year to improve the exchanges computerized trade 
reconstruction system which is designed to catch improper trades 
officials estimated then that the system was already about 90 
percent effective in catching abuses they said the upgrade would 
increase the systems effectiveness to 100 percent 
they also noted that over the past three years the exchange has 
expanded its investigative office by 75 percent 
we are always looking for constructive criticism about our rule 
enforcement record from the cftc board of trade president thomas 
r donovan said in a statement 
the cftc report took note of the improvements but said it is 
too soon to evaluate the changes

both sides claimed victory but promised appeals 
after a judge recommended a 1152 million judgment against amoco 
corp for the massive oilspill damage from the 1978 wreck of a 
supertanker off france 
tuesdays decision by retired us district judge frank mcgarr 
was the latest round in a legal battle pitting the government of 
france and about 90 other plaintiffs against chicagobased amoco 
while were gratified for some of the plaintiffs this is still 
only a small portion of the actual damages said attorney barry 
kingham who represented the towns associations of oystermen and 
fishermen hoteliers and the two french counties most affected by 
the spill from the amoco cadiz 
the judge is looking at the cleanup costs but he has 
consistently failed to recognize the harm goes beyond that 
kingham added that will be the basis of our appeal 
amoco attorney frank cicero said the recommendation by mcgarr 
vindicates amocos position from the outset the damage claims 
have been exaggerated 
now wed like to get the judgment in place then go ahead and 
appeal he said 
but a final judgment may still be far in the future 
mcgarr who retired from the federal bench after the original 
ruling but continues to serve as special master in the case 
scheduled a march 14 hearing on yet another possible revision 
when it is completed mcgarr will forward a finished draft of his 
recommendation to us district judge charles norgle who will enter 
a final judgment 
in january 1988 mcgarr recommended 852 million in damages 
against amoco after appeals from plaintiffs he increased the 
amount by 30 million tuesday 
the largest recommended increase went to the government of 
france which is now in line for an award of 444 million compared 
with 319 million in the original ruling 13 months ago 
at the lower end of the revisions were some 100 french towns 
whose commerce and wellbeing were affected by the spill that 
created an oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long killing 
thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures and washing waves 
of thick black tar along 100 miles of coast 
the towns had received 73 million in the original judgment and 
sought an additional 8 million but received only an additional 
200000 
interest will be added to each award 
the cash figures in the original award as well as tuesdays 
recommendation were in french francs attorneys for both sides said 
the combined awards now total about 115 million 61 million in 
actual damages and 54 million to 60 million in interest 
in previous rulings mcgarr assessed liability to both amoco and 
astilleros espanoles sa the spanish firm that built the amoco 
cadiz and defaulted by refusing to recognize the district courts 
jurisdiction 
amoco is continuing with litigation to recover the entire cost of 
the judgment from astilleros said company attorney cicero 
anywhere we can find assets we can sue to collect those assets 
for the judgment he said 
amocos shares rose 375 cents tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange to close at 77125 
the amoco cadiz ran aground two miles off the brittany coast 
march 16 1978 the huge tanker which had lost the use of its 
rudder had been under tow through the english channel by a 
germanowned tug when the towlines snapped in hurricaneforce winds 
and heavy seas and the ship became impaled along the rocks off 
northwest france

the military officers whose mutiny 
helped propel corazon aquino to power initially planned to set up a 
provisional government and hold new elections to replace ferdinand 
marcos as president a key conspirator said today 
but navy capt rex robles said thendefense minister juan ponce 
enrile leader of the mutineers decided mrs aquino should instead 
be sworn in as president to prevent marcos from a making legal claim 
to the office 
robles made the remarks during an interview on radio station dzrh 
on the third anniversary of the mutiny which triggered the popular 
uprising that drove marcos from power on feb 25 1986 
us officials first refused to support the mutineers and did so 
only after it became clear that marcos was finished robles said 
he said the reform the armed forces movement had planned to 
launch a coup against marcos in december 1985 but postponed the move 
after he called a snap election for feb 7 1986 
so we decided to postpone until sometime after elections 
around april or may in the summer robles said but the 
conspirators advanced their plans after public outrage over massive 
cheating in the election in which both marcos and mrs aquino 
claimed victory 
if we succeeded in ousting marcos or asking him to step down 
our plan was we would set up a transition council either five to 
seven members robles said our agreement was whoever joined the 
transition council would not run in the election which we would hold 
because it would be unfair 
when it appeared the mutiny would succeed robles said civilian 
and military opponents met to discuss how to establish the legal 
authority of a postmarcos government 
according to robles enrile told the gathering it is necessary 
to swear mrs aquino into office right now several politicians 
were shocked by the suggestion 
but robles said enrile argued that by swearing in mrs aquino 
first marcos would have to play catchup and would lack legal 
authority 
it was sen enriles idea robles said they were not 
prepared to accept that concept that you must beat marcos to the 
presidency 
the national assembly certified marcos as the election winner 
several days before the mutiny but he had not taken his oath 
marcos took his oath on feb 25 1986 soon after mrs aquino was 
sworn in he fled manila hours later aboard a us helicopter and 
departed before dawn the next day for exile in hawaii 
movement members frequently have complained that they were never 
given credit for their role in ousting marcos the reform movement 
included former lt col gregorio gringo honasan sought in the 
violent august 1987 attempt to topple mrs aquino 
enrile was fired as defense minister on nov 23 1986 after an 
alleged coup plot by his followers he was elected as the only 
opposition member of the senate in may 1987

to head off inflation he was to testify again today 
some market players had expected him to suggest higher interest 
rates said a dealer with a major commercial bank in tokyo speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
such expectations helped push the dollar up by 140 yen on 
tuesday higher us interest rates make dollardenominated 
investments more attractive to foreigners 
meanwhile bank of japan governor satoshi sumita told a news 
conference today that he sees the dollar remaining steady against 
the yen and that he expects no major changes in japanese or us

italian priests are leading prayers for rain argentina is 
rationing electricity and reservoirs in the united states are 
dropping as seemingly unrelated weather in several regions of the 
world has led to drought 
the problem is critical in southern europe where about 25 
percent of the normal amount of rain has fallen since dec 1 and in 
the south american countries of argentina uruguay and paraguay 
officials say 
in northwestern spain drinking wells have dried up in some towns 
in galicia and potable water has had to be brought in by truck 
water is being rationed in other towns in the region weather 
records in oviedo the capital of asturias show its the worst 
drought since 1876 
electricity in buenos aires is shut off for up to three hours a 
day in different sections of the capital because river levels are 
too low for hydroelectric plants to operate at full power 
in the united states the agriculture departments chief 
meteorologist norton strommen said a recurrence of last years 
severe drought is unlikely however the northeast coast has had a 
dry winter and officials in new york and boston are worrying about 
water shortages 
extremely dry weather has also hit southern florida and water 
usage is being restricted in several towns along the gulf of mexico 
severe to extreme drought conditions are also persisting in large 
sections of the countrys midwest and west turning the winter wheat 
crop yellow in some areas 
peter newhouse a cereal crop expert at the un food and 
agricultural organization in rome said the agency is worried the 
droughts will hurt the worlds grain production 
this year is crucial more than any other year because poor crop 
production in the last two years has brought stock levels down 
nearly to those of the world food crisis in the early 1970s an 
unprecedented 200 million tons are needed to rebuild stocks to the 
minimum levels needed for global food security newhouse said 
most of africa where large regions are perennially parched is 
enjoying a relatively wet year however with replenishing rains 
falling even in the normally dry sahel region south of the sahara 
desert 
africa has been for the most part pretty good says dave 
miskus a meteorologist with the us climate analysis center in 
washington dc the only really dry area has been southern 
zimbabwe and northeastern south africa 
but along the mediterranean coast of europe the skies have 
produced little if any rain since dec 1 forcing some cities in 
italy to ration water and prompting priests to add weekly prayers 
for rain to roman catholic church services 
rainfall has ranged from less than 10 percent to less than 50 
percent of normal in spain portugal italy yugoslavia and greece 
weather officials say 
those areas along the mediterranean coast should be getting 
most of their rain at this time of year but that whole region has 
been extremely dry some parts of italy have had no precipitation at 
all since christmas said miskus who tracks worldwide weather 
patterns 
since late december dry weather has spread north through most of 
the rest of europe with large regions receiving less than two 
inches of rain and some areas less than one inch the scandinavian 
countries west germany parts of poland scotland ireland and 
england have largely been spared from the dry weather 
meteorologists blame the drought on a strong ridge of high 
pressure over central europe since december preventing 
mediterranean storms from forming or intensifying 
yet while some regions of the world are enduring prolonged dry 
spells simultaneously weather experts dont believe there is a 
single phenomenon linking these events 
i dont think it has a unifying cause to it said robert 
harnack a professor of meteorology at rutgers university in new 
brunswick nj in any given year with the world as big as it is 
there are always places going in one extreme or the other i have no 
reason to believe this year is any more abnormal than other years 
in the southern alps unseasonably warm temperatures and a lack 
of precipitation combined to hurt business this winter for ski 
resorts forcing some to close because there wasnt enough snow 
in northern italy fruit growers and ski resort operators have 
asked the government for emergency relief funds 
agricultural losses have been estimated at 15 billion as low 
lake levels prevent farmers from irrigating their crops in several 
regions 
water rationing is in effect in several hardhit areas including 
genoa and sardinia 
in the sardinian city of iglesias residents receive water only 
in fivehour periods from monday through friday in the northern 
port city of olbia residents who use water for nondomestic 
purposes such as washing cars face fines of up to 1 million lire 
750 
crop production in portugal has been hurt and government 
officials have blamed the drought for increased food prices in 
lisbon reservoirs north of the tagus river running through central 
portugal are only 28 percent full 
in spain forest fires have increased because of the dry 
conditions and have ravaged more than 4048 acres of woods and 
meadows in asturias since jan 1 more than all the land burned in 
fires there last year 
in galicia the regions legendary green fields have turned ochre 
because the region has received 30 percent of its normal amount of 
rainfall from november through january the least amount of rain in 
30 years weather officials say 
farmers and cattle ranchers also are desperate for water in a 
large chunk of the south american continent from june 1 to feb 18 
miskus said precipitation has been from 20 percent to 50 percent of 
normal in northern argentina uruguay eastern paraguay southern 
brazil and southeastern bolivia 
in buenos aires night sports and music events have been 
canceled and hours have been reduced for subways and television 
broadcasting the drought has shriveled crops and forced ranchers in 
neighboring uruguay to sell or slaughter cows because they dont 
have enough feed 
normally they get most of their precipitation in the summer 
miskus said its been almost a sixmonth drought down there

a federal recommendation to give chemotherapy to 
all victims of early breast cancer will mean needlessly treating 
65000 women at a cost of 338 million to improve the outlook for 
just 5000 others a new analysis concludes 
until recently drug and hormone therapy were given exclusively 
to women whose tumors had spread to their lymph nodes those whose 
cancer had not visibly progressed beyond their breasts were treated 
with surgery and radiation therapy alone 
however four new studies suggest that even those with early 
breast cancer could benefit from chemotherapy drug treatment the 
therapy somewhat improves their chances of remaining cancerfree 
during the years immediately after their surgery although there is 
no evidence that they ultimately live any longer 
three of the studies conducted in the united states were the 
basis of an unusual recommendation last may by the national cancer 
institute without revealing details of the studies the agency sent 
letters to cancer specialists suggesting that they give drug therapy 
to all breast cancer patients 
but dr merrill i feldman of university hospital in boston 
coauthor of one of the studies said there is a lot of 
resistance to treating women who are node negative who dont 
show evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes 
many people didnt feel that the alert from the nci was 
documented by enough evidence to justify it he said it still 
doesnt justify putting all women on this unless they fit the 
strict criteria of the women in these studies 
the details of those studies plus one conducted in europe are 
finally being published in thursdays issue of the new england 
journal of medicine 
in general the studies found that about 80 percent of the women 
getting drug treatment were still free of disease after about four 
years compared with about 72 percent of those who were not treated 
there was no significant difference however in the death rates 
between the two groups 
but for doctors the dilemma is knowing whom to treat about 70 
percent of women with early breast cancer are cured of breast cancer 
with surgery or radiation alone many physicians are reluctant to 
treat everyone when only a small minority could possibly benefit 
yet there is no way at present to know who really needs the 
medicines 
in an editorial in the journal dr william l mcguire of the 
university of texas health science center at san antonio noted that 
if doctors used drug therapy to treat all 70000 women diagnosed 
each year with early breast cancer they would prevent recurrence in 
5040 of them the rest would have been treated needlessly and the 
therapy would have cost 338 million as many as 50 to 100 women 
would die from the treatment itself 
i would argue that the cost considerably outweighs the benefits 
of treating all nodenegative patients especially in the absence of 
a proved survival benefit mcguire wrote 
but in another editorial dr vincent t devita jr of memorial 
sloankettering cancer center a former head of the cancer 
institute said the studies document an impressive reduction in 
the risk of recurrence he recommended that drug treatment be 
offered to all breast cancer patients except those with very small 
tumors 
several experts agreed that the decision to use the medicines 
should be left up to the patient and not be made by the physician 
alone 
the mistake would be for doctors to automatically give the drug 
without explaining the unresolved issues about whether there will be 
a survival advantage and the possible longterm side effects said 
dr nicholas robert of new england medical center a coauthor of 
one of the studies 
robert said he would consider drug treatment for somewhat more 
than half of women with early breast cancer while feldman said it 
might be reasonable for about 70 percent 
the four studies published were 
the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project or 
nsabp treated 679 women with tumors that did not respond to 
hormones after four years 80 percent of those getting a threedrug 
combination were cancerfree compared with 71 percent in a 
comparison group 
a second nsabp study treated 2644 women with tumors sensitive 
to hormones after five years 83 percent getting the synthetic 
hormone tamoxifen were cancerfree versus 77 percent in a 
comparison group 
a multihospital study directed by dr edward g mansour of 
cleveland metropolitan general hospital treated 403 women with large 
tumors after three years 84 percent getting a fourdrug 
combination and 69 percent in a comparison group were still free of 
cancer 
the ludwig breast cancer study group in europe treated 1275 
women with early breast cancer after four years 77 percent of 
those who received a fourdrug combination were cancerfree as were 
73 percent in a comparison group

a month after offering to participate in 
national elections el salvadors leftist rebels say they will lay 
down their weapons if the armed forces are cut and next months 
presidential vote is postponed 
leaders of the countrys political parties to whom the rebel 
farabundo marti liberation front made the offer on tuesday said it 
seemed to reflect a sincere guerrilla desire for peace 
they said in a resolution that they would today meet with 
president jose napoleon duarte and ask him to immediately engage the 
rebels in talks 
the rebel and political leaders had met for two days the first 
such meeting of its kind in an effort to end a nineyear civil war 
that has claimed 70000 lives most of them civilian 
representatives of the 13 parties agreed late tuesday to press 
their usbacked government to discuss the new rebel offer directly 
with its authors who were for the first time offering to lay down 
their arms 
we are going to press right away for a meeting with the 
executive branch and legislative branch said francisco merino 
vice presidential candidate for the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance or arena 
arena has been leading in the presidential polls and along with 
duarte and the military has opposed any arrangement that would 
postpone the vote 
in el salvador on monday guerrillas attacked the countrys 
principal army base and an engineering detachment leaving eight 
dead and 17 injured 
rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only 
continue but will escalate rebel radio declared 
guerrilla leaders were clearly pleased with the outcome of the 
meeting their last talks with the government fell apart after the 
murder of human rights leader herbert anaya sanabria in october 1987 
the parties have opened the possibility of a national 
consensus rebel commander schafik jorge handal told a news 
conference after the meeting at a resort complex in this town 40 
miles south of mexico city 
the rebels are calling for an agreement with the government on a 
ceasefire electoral reforms and postponing the march 19 vote at 
least four months to give them a chance to enter the political 
process peacefully 
they are also calling for cutting the armed forces from 56000 
members to 12000 and for consolidating the national police the 
national guard and treasury police under civilian authority 
in return the guerrillas offer to lay down their arms and end 
their decadelong election boycott 
the proposal of the fmln is very clear theyre searching for 
peace said julio adolfo rey prendes presidential candidate of 
the centrist authentic christian movement this is the first time 
that such a thing has happened the catalyst for the oaxtepec 
gathering was a january 23 rebel proposal to take part in the 
elections and respect their outcome if the voting were postponed by 
six months 
duarte the military and arena which recently wrested control of 
the national assembly from the presidents christian democrats have 
scorned the january proposal 
now however arena is party to tuesdays agreement to consider 
the expanded peace plan and duarte must confront the public pressure 
of his countrys most powerful political party 
i would say in general that the government has to talk now 
that they cannot refuse or evade talks with the fmln said ruben 
zamora head of the democratic convergence a coalition of small 
leftist parties 
duarte who is suffering from terminal cancer will also be 
pressured to reign in a battlehardened military with a long history 
of human rights abuses 
last week defense minister gen eugenio vides casanova said if 
the elections were postponed and duarte stayed in power past june 1 
when his constitutional term ends the army might intervene

when is a bookstore legally liable for terrorism 
the bookstore chains that pulled the satanic verses off their 
shelves probably did so with at least one eye on lawsuits filed 
against pan am after a terrorist bomb blew up the airlines flight 
103 last year 
the companies waldenbooks and b dalton said concern for 
employees and customers safety mandated withdrawal of the novel 
the ayatollah khomeini had pronounced the book sufficiently 
blasphemous to warrant a death sentence for its author salman 
rushdie and those involved with its publication 
waldenbooks said its store managers had received bomb threats 
legal experts say the companies undoubtedly had another cause for 
concern their potential liability if someone were injured or killed 
in a terrorist attack 
the companies might be concerned about their employees and 
they might be concerned about themselves said george gabel of 
jacksonville fla chairman of the american bar associations 
committee on defamation 
spokesmen for the companies declined to say what role if any 
the threat of lawsuits played in their decision or on exactly what 
information they based their actions but in an article tuesday on 
the oped page of the new york times waldenbooks president harry 
hoffman referred to the fate of flight 103 and the 259 people aboard 
saying that his decision to remove the novel followed real 
threats made against the lives of real people hoffman added we 
have only to contemplate the downing of the pan am flight to be 
reminded that such threats may be taken seriously 
in that case the airline was informed by the government that 
bomb threats had been made against pan am jetliners flying to the 
united states from frankfurt west germany us diplomatic 
personnel were notified of the threats but the general public was 
not 
flight 103 from frankfurt to new york blew up over the village of 
lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing all 259 aboard some of the 
victims relatives have sued claiming pan am should have disclosed 
the threats 
in the satanic verses case the ayatollah sentenced to death 
its author salman rushdie and all those involved in its 
publication who were aware of its content 
legal experts said that a lawyer could legitimately interpret 
publication to mean distribution and give his client sound 
albeit rather conservative advice get the book off the shelf and 
out of the windows 
but they also said a bookstore that wants to keep selling the 
book could do so without running an unreasonable legal risk 
assume the worst a store continues to display and sell the book 
a bomb explodes and a customer is hurt he sues the store for 
negligence claiming that the bookseller had shirked his common law 
duty of reasonable care by continuing to sell the book despite 
threats 
the customers case hinges on the immediacy of khomeinis threat 
and the reasonableness of the stores response was the threat 
directed at bookstores in general or merely publishers was it too 
remote to be credible did the store post some sort of warning of 
its own to customers 
several prominent lawyers said they liked the stores chances in 
a legal fight 
i dont see a specific warning having been given here by 
khomeini said robert bohner a brooklyn attorney who has 
represented plaintiffs in many negligence cases the chances of 
liability in a case like this are probably rather slim 
gabel said that given the number of book stores in the country 
and the wording of khomeinis statement i would think a bookstore 
would be fairly safe 
andrew c hecker jr a philadelphia attorney who heads the abas 
committee on torts said the question is whether a company must 
heed every warning it gets it might be that if every warning were 
heeded you could not conduct your business 
hecker said the bookstore might also rely to some extent on the 
public policy favoring freedom of speech 
although it has been invoked repeatedly over the past few days 
the first amendment is largely irrelevant in the satanic verses 
case it protects americans against action by their government not 
by bookstores or ayatollahs and it cant excuse negligence by 
merchants 
but a bookstore facing a negligence suit for refusing to suppress 
a book would probably be in better legal shape than one being sued 
because it failed to clean the ice off its front steps 
its the publics right to have access to this book versus the 
ability of a foreign potentate to create enough terror to suppress 
it bohner said where are we going to draw the line a court 
would have to address that somewhere 
but where 
thats a question that has kept me up at night hecker said 
every instinct says you dont want to give into this threat but 
your heart goes out to people who are hurt i dont know how you 
resolve the issue

a state university that held a sexuality week 
featuring a condom dance and a lecture on the female erogenous 
zone drew complaints from a senior state senator who called the 
school a center of carnal knowledge 
republican state sen james donovan chairman of the senates 
education committee said tuesday the state university of new york 
at albany terribly misplaced its spending priorities by holding 
sexuality week 
but a spokeswoman for the university noting that only 38 
students attended the condom dance said its wrong to criticize 
the universitys morals 
it was a weeklong series of programs designed to teach students 
how to be responsible sexual partners and how their behavior affects 
relationships with other christine mcknight spokeswoman for the 
university said of sexuality week 
donovan however said every taxpaying citizen of new york 
should be aware of sexuality week 
suny albany has always been a pillar of the state university 
system the senator said but instead of becoming an institution 
known for its academic prowess it is becoming a center of carnal 
knowledge 
all of us agree that we must combat aids and that education 
about sex can contribute heavily to this fight donovan said i 
cannot believe that the state of new york and its university system 
believe that condom dances are the solution 
students attending the condom dance were given free condoms 
and treated to four hours of sexually explicit music donovan 
said another event of sexuality week was a 15minute film and 
lecture on the socalled g spot a supposed female erogenous 
zone 
mcknight said most of the programs were funded by student 
organizations like the student association and interfraternity 
council she said she wasnt sure if any university funds were used 
for events 
sexuality week is held on other campuses across the country to 
highlight issues of safe sex during the week of valentines day 
mcknight said its the fifth straight year its been held at suny 
albany and hasnt been a controversy in the past she said 
people who came to see the presentation on the g spot 
expecting a dirty movie instead saw a very informative film and 
lecture she said 
and the turnout for the condom dance was disappointing 
she said probably because it was held just before a threeday 
holiday weekend

in the largest heroin raid in us history 
police and federal agents tracked 1 billion worth of the drug from 
southeast asia to two homes in new york city where it was hidden 
inside hundreds of tires 
the 800pound seizure made the notorious french connection 
case seem modest by comparison and showcased the rise of asian drug 
smugglers authorities said tuesday 
us attorney andrew maloney said operation white mare and 
some other recent cases provide clear proof that the chinese are 
responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the heroin that is smuggled into 
new york 
since 1985 the supply of heroin from asia has increased and 
asian drug rings have supplanted heroin operations run by 
traditional american organized crime families the prosecutor said 
at a news conference held to announce the seizure 
the 800 pounds with a street value estimated at more than 1 
billion would supply 40 to 50 percent of all the heroin needed 
for some 200000 addicts on an annual basis in new york city he 
said 
authorities say investigators set out 18 months ago to identify 
major chinese heroin distribution and import networks operating in 
the metropolitan area working on a tip from an informant an 
asianamerican fbi undercover agent infiltrated the ring 
the investigation culminated in raids monday night and tuesday 
morning when 17 people were arrested and 3 million in cash was 
seized in addition to the drugs 
another nine people were arrested in hong kong today authorities 
said 
officials said the 800 pounds originated as much of the us 
heroin supply does in the golden triangle the rugged 
borderlands of burma thailand and laos 
from there the heroin was tracked to hong kong where it was 
packed inside small hollow rubber tires designed for carts the 264 
boxes of tires were smuggled into los angeles and trucked to new 
york where they were found in rented trucks outside two homes in 
queens according to james m fox an assistant fbi director 
however hong kong officials believed the heroin was shipped 
directly from thailand to the united states said chris cantley 
acting chief staff officer of the police narcotics bureau in hong 
kong 
basically in this whole affair the organizational brains were 
in hong kong he said 
charges are expected to be filed thursday against some or all of 
the nine hong kong chinese arrested in a predawn sweep today 
cantley said he said us authorities may seek extradition of some 
of the suspects 
thirtyone people from new york los angeles detroit san 
francisco hong kong singapore toronto calgary and vancouver were 
named in a criminal complaint filed with the us district court in 
brooklyn 
of those 14 were already jailed in detroit buffalo toronto and 
hong kong and the other 17 were arrested here during the three 
raids 
the investigation identified fok leung woo also known as peter 
woo a longtime resident and businessman in manhattans chinatown 
as the rings leader woo is former chairman of the chinatown 
democratic club maloney said 
woo was not so much the head of an operation as he was a 
broker an entrepreneur who brought people together fox said 
maloney whose office had prosecuted some of the french 
connection cases said the 800 pounds of heroin seized monday is 
an unheardof amount 
other major heroin busts in the united states include the seizure 
of 570 pounds of heroin allegedly imported from asia by kon 
yuleung who was arrested last year the pizza connection case 
in which 200 pounds of heroin imported through sicily was seized 
and the french connection case in which 70 pounds of heroin 
imported through marseilles were seized between 1968 and 1971

at least a dozen central american refugees 
have been detained and hundreds more kept waiting under a new 
federal immigration policy of quickly evaluating applications for 
political asylum 
the new policy went into effect slowly tuesday the day after it 
was announced by immigration and naturalization service officials 
who said they wanted to discourage central americans from entering 
the united states with frivolous applications for asylum 
by tuesday afternoon only 45 central americans half from 
nicaragua were under review while 200 others waited to be processed 
two state department advisers recommended denying asylum to 25 of 
the 45 and the others were still under consideration ins spokesman 
mario ortiz said he said the ins decided to detain at least 12 of 
the 25 pending deportation hearings 
ins district director omer sewell said the addition of 500 
federal workers in the brownsville area the main entry point for 
central american asylum seekers will help as the new process is 
phased in during the next few weeks 
but critics say it already is operating at inhumane speed and 
they have expressed outrage at ins plans to hold rejected applicants 
in tents erected inside a minimumsecurity prison 
the catholic bishops of texas charged that they foresaw the 
creation of the largest concentration camp on us soil since the 
incarceration of japaneseamericans during world war ii 
only immigrants who can show persecution are entitled to asylum 
those who come to better themselves economically can be deported 
the ins maintains that most central americans arriving in south 
texas do not qualify for refugee status 
under the new plan asylum applicants may get an answer on the 
same day they apply but they are subject to immediate arrest and 
detention if denied asylum 
before tuesday applications could take weeks to process and 
aliens were released on their own recognizance while they awaited 
appeals or deportation 
the ins began erecting tents at its rural port isabel service 
processing center here in case the number of detainees at the 
facility exceeds bed space the agency said as many as 5000 could 
be detained in large circuslike tents within the 315acre facility 
that is surrounded by a 7foot fence topped with barbed wire 
many of the applicants showing up at the center tuesday were 
unaware that they were subject to arrest if their cases were denied 
we didnt know about it said luis vasquez 29 from el 
salvador adding he would take his chances anyway 
i just cant go back to nicaragua said manuela diaz who 
started crying while talking about conditions in her homeland 
the applicants entering the facility generally paid little 
attention to six people who were fasting across the road from the 
center in protest of the new procedures 
the three salvadorans and three roman catholic nuns from south 
texas said they would remain there until the government granted 
regugee status to salvadorans and halted military aid to that 
country 
the texas catholic conference said the new policy ignores the 
facts of life in central america that are causing the massive influx 
of refugees to our country 
the ins statement speaks of frivolous applications 
apparently any applications by people who have suffered dreadfully 
from civil war are frivolous it said in a statement 
brownsville immigration attorney linda yanez said 15 attorneys 
had formed a group called the cameron county pro bono project to 
defend those denied asylum 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas called the new policy a real step 
forward but termed it a shortterm solution to what may not be a 
shortterm problem 
the ins obviously believes it can reduce the flow of central 
american immigration by sending a nofreeride signal that may be 
the case bentsen said but weve got 40000 contras in honduras 
and the prospect of a detention camp in south texas may not be 
enough to deter them from making the trip north

tony awardwinning actress phyllis frelich is 
leading a coalition of deaf and hearingimpaired groups in 
condemning use of a nonhandicapped woman on cbstvs the 
equalizer 
miss frelich who is hearingimpaired complained tuesday that a 
hearing actress cynthia nixon portrays a deaf woman in a march 8 
episode titled silent fury 
they say they could not find a hearingimpaired actress capable 
of carrying the role miss frelich said we know better 
would anybody even consider hiring a white actress to paint her 
face black and pretend to be black of course not then why do they 
do the same thing to us why must we be subjected to this insulting 
and demeaning discrimination she said 
the actress who won a tony in children of a lesser god on 
broadway has launched a monthlong letterwriting campaign 
targeting cbs president kim lemasters and the equalizer producer 
james mcadams to prevent the episode from being aired 
mcadams the series executive producer said the producers hired 
a hearingimpaired man to play miss nixons hearingimpaired fiance 
and they auditioned several deaf actresses in the new york area but 
could not find someone who was right for the role 
howie seago has the leading guest role of the boyfriend and there 
are several deaf actors in supporting roles mcadams said 
we did earnestly look for a hearingimpaired person mcadams 
said if we didnt consider any deaf actresses if we slammed the 
door in their face then theyd have a point 
he said frelichs protest could discourage other producers from 
making programs about handicapped people

navajo chairman peter macdonald ousted 
last week by the tribal council has been reinstated by order of his 
brotherinlaw a tribal judge 
tribal judge harry brown issued a temporary restraining order 
tuesday overturning the councils ouster of macdonald who has been 
accused of corruption and vice chairman johnny thompson 
a short time later thompson presented the court order to the 
council and was seated as chairman pro tem in macdonalds absence 
the council then recessed its winter meeting until today 
geoffrey standing bear macdonalds attorney said brown 
scheduled a showcause hearing friday morning to determine whether 
to permanently order the council not to place macdonald and thompson 
on administrative leave 
brown found that the council failed to follow the correct 
procedure for removing a chairman from office last friday when it 
voted 4913 against macdonald and thompson standing bear said 
the chairman is entitled to his constitutional rights he 
added 
john chapela a lawyer who heads a recall movement against 
macdonald complained that the order was issued in kayenta about 
140 miles from the tribal capital of window rock 
legal matters affecting the navajo tribe have to brought before 
the window rock court chapela said otherwise it would look as 
if people were shopping around to find the most favorable court 
standing bear said he avoided the window rock court because 
navajo tribal police chief bill kellogg suggested that there was 
potential for unrest there 
noting that brown and macdonald are married to sisters standing

a sharp earthquake struck beneath the 
pacific ocean about 120 miles southwest of alaska but apparently 
went unnoticed early today officials said 
alec medbery of the alaska tsunami warning center said the 
temblor hit at 125 am registering 58 on the openended richter 
scale 
medbery said he called the national weather service station in 
kodiak at the states southern edge but was told no one there felt 
the quake and the observatory received no calls of inquiry or 
reports of damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every 
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude a 
reading of 65 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 
55 
a quake of 5 can cause considerable damage and one registering 6 
is capable of causing severe damage 
the 1964 alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 84 on the 
richter scale

boris yeltsin the ousted moscow communist party 
chief and outspoken critic of party conservatives won a spot today 
on the ballot to represent the capital in the new national 
legislature radio moscow said 
yeltsin who lost the party job in november 1987 after 
complaining about the slow pace of reform received 532 votes at an 
electoral committee meeting that ended before dawn at the ornate 
house of unions in downtown moscow 
yevgeny brakov director of the giant zil automotive plant 
received 570 votes and will compete with yeltsin for one spot in the 
march 26 elections 
both were chosen by committee members from a field of 10 
potential candidates to represent moscow 
the committee made its decision after the two candidates 
presented campaign platforms in the chandelierlit redandwhite 
hall of columns 
yeltsin 57 and brakov both support restructuring and 
democratization but propose different solutions to specific 
problems the radio said 
under an law approved in december twothird of the seats in the 
new 2250member congress of peoples deputies will be filled by 
candidates nominated in the workplace and chosen by voters on a 
territorial basis 
the rest of the deputies are to be chosen by party union 
professional and other officially recognized groups 
the new congress will meet annually and choose the soviet 
president and members of a new smaller and more active sitting 
parliament 
yeltsin told the committee members before they approved his 
candidacy that he staunchly supports president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policies both at home and abroad 
from the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics i 
fully support him he said in a sevenminute speech interrupted 
six times by applause from the viewpoint of the strategy of 
internal politics fully 
but he said from the viewpoint of tactics i have my own 
opinion 
brakov 51 presented a mainstream program also supporting 
gorbachevs reforms and focusing on the need for better supplies of 
food and consumer goods a line more likely to be acceptable to 
communist party officials 
he was nominated by 33 workers groups compared to 19 for yeltsin 
because election law permits candidates to be nominated in more 
than one geographical area early in the campaign yeltsin also has 
been nominated in sverdlovsk where he could stand a better chance 
of election 
until he was removed as a nonvoting member of the ruling 
communist party politburo a year ago yeltsin was one of the 
strongest backers of gorbachevs policies of perestroika and 
glasnost or openness 
at the time gorbachev accused him of being overly ambitious and 
blaming others for his mistakes 
hospitalized with heart trouble after he was sacked as the moscow 
party chief yeltsin said at the meeting that he was physically 
healthy and ready to fight

two rap music groups nominated for grammy 
awards say they are boycotting tonights ceremonies because they are 
insulted their new category was shunted off the the live television 
broadcast 
the real grammy award is the chance to appear on the grammy 
awards show with its audience of 100 million americans said will 
fresh prince smith in a statement rap music is simply too big 
to be overlooked like this 
the categories of rap and heavy metal were added to the 76 
divisions of awards for the cbstv show the 31st edition of the 
grammys the show is hosted by billy crystal and produced by pierre 
cossette 
folksinger tracy chapman and vocal gymnast bobby mcferrin lead 
the nominees if miss chapman sweeps in her six nominated 
categories she will be the first artist to win six trophies in one 
night since roger miller did it in 1966 for his single king of the 
road 
fifteen of the awards are being televised including the hard 
rock and heavy metal for which the group metallica is a nominee 
along with iggy pop janes addiction jethro tull and acdc 
there will be a rap performance by kool moe dee but that award 
category will be called during the usually fastpaced pretelevised 
ceremony in which most of the awards are given 
rappers say its an insult and at least two nominated duos 
saltnpepa and dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince plan to boycott 
the show 
among other musicians slated to perform are whitney houston the 
manhattan transfer luther vandross kool moe dee sinead oconnor 
linda ronstadt melissa etheridge toni childs tracy chapman and 
itzhak perlman 
special tributes also were set for jazz country and western and 
gospel music 
metallica is set to perform their new single one from the 
nominated album and justice for all the group is popular 
with heavy metal fans but the bands uncompromising lyrics have 
kept it from the wider radio airplay enjoyed by hard rock groups 
like bon jovi 
no one was more surprised than metallica members to learn they 
had been asked to perform one member said 
weve been very stubborn to make sure things would be done our 
way and that we wouldnt have to give up creative control 
metallica member lars ulrich told the associated press 
its great we have been able to take this attitude all the way 
to performing live on the grammys and to be nominated knowing its 
all being done on our terms he said 
for the top nominees miss chapman was named in the best song 
record and female pop performance categories for fast car she 
also was nominated for best new artist and her selftitled album 
was nominated for the years best lp and best contemporary folk 
performance 
mcferrin already a grammy veteran with five awards had 
nominations for best song record and pop male vocal for dont 
worry be happy his no 1 single mcferrin who uses no 
instrument except his own voice and body also was nominated for 
best male jazz vocal performance for the song brothers and a 
best album nomination for simple pleasures 
another contender for top awards was singer anita baker with four 
nominations for her one eligible song giving you the best that i 
got which competed with miss chapman and mcferrin in the record 
and song categories the tune also received best female rhythm and 
blues performance and best overall rhythm and blues song performance

the company representing the disbanded 
beatles has sued apple computer inc challenging its use of the 
apple trademark on some of its products a newspaper reported 
in a lawsuit filed tuesday in london apple corps ltd accused 
the silicon valley computer company of violating a secret 1981 
agreement under which the beatles company allowed apple computer to 
use the trademark on computer products the san francisco chronicle 
reported 
the agreement retained the right of apple corps to use the fruit 
as a trademark in its music business and apple computer promised 
not to enter that field according to the chronicle which said a 
draft copy of the lawsuit was filed in the chancery division of 
britains high court of justice 
over the past few years however the computer company has 
developed topselling new hardware with music synthesizing 
capabilities and the beatles company claims those products break 
apple computers promise 
the lawsuit asks the court for an injunction to bar apple 
computer from breaching the agreement and seeks unspecified damages 
legal fees and interest 
the computer company however does not believe it is in breach 
of the agreement a company spokeswoman said but company officials 
would not comment in detail on the suit because they had not yet 
seen it she said 
under the agreement reached in november 1981 apple computer 
founded in 1977 paid the beatles an unknown amount for the right to 
keep using its famous apple trademark 
apple corps had been founded ten years earlier and its activities 
included releases under the apple label and a chain of clothing 
stores 
steve wozniak a cofounder of apple computer said on tuesday he 
was not aware of the agreement 
i never heard anything about a fuss over the name said 
wozniak who is no longer associated with apple computer 
the other cofounder was steve jobs and some company histories 
trace the name to his recollections of working in the oregon apple 
country where he became convinced apples are a perfect food 
the beatles pop group broke up in 1970 but the londonbased 
company still represents the busines interests of the three 
surviving members of the beatles and the estate of the late john 
lennon 
wayne cooper a san francisco lawyer representing the beatles 
company in the dispute said negotiations between apple corps and 
the computer company broke down at a meeting in london feb 13

security checks intensified today after the 
discovery of two projectiles on launchers aimed at the runway of a 
tokyo airport where dignitaries have begun arriving for emperor 
hirohitos funeral officials said 
an unprecedented number of foreign dignitaries are streaming into 
japan for fridays state funeral for hirohito which radical groups 
have threatened to disrupt 
on tuesday police discovered timers set on two mortarlike 
projectiles on explosivecharged launchers aimed at the runway at 
narita airport police would not disclose when the projectiles were 
set for launching 
as a result authorities stepped up security at narita and haneda 
airports where 71 foreign delegations were to arrive today 
in all dignitaries representing 163 countries were expected for 
the funeral including president bush who arrives thursday 
the launchers apparently were set by radicals but local news 
reports said today that the projectiles themselves did not contain 
explosive charges the weapons were discovered in a field about 650 
yards from the southern tip of the airport a foreign ministry 
official said the launchers were 36 inches long and the projectiles 
8 inches long and 2 inches in diameter 
similar projectiles were launched in april 1986 apparently in an 
attempt to disrupt plans for celebrating the 60th year of emperor 
hirohitos reign and in may 1986 when the leaders of seven major 
industralized democracies were meeting in tokyo 
today was the first day for a series of funeral diplomacy 
meetings with world leaders in tokyo preceding the funeral of 
hirohito who died jan 7 at age 87 after a 62year reign 
strict personal and luggage inspections were enforced today at 
narita airport and 7000 uniformed and plainclothed police patrolled 
the area 
passenger luggage underwent doublechecks and the kyodo news 
service reported a security effort more intense than that at the 
seoul olympics 
prime minister noboru takeshita met with finnish president mauno 
koivisto at the akasaka state guesthouse and was scheduled to meet 
separately with soviet vice president anatoly lukyanov and president 
marshal mobutu sese seko of zaire later today 
takeshita will meet with about 40 of the 55 heads of state who 
will attend the funeral including bush and president francois 
mitterrand of france 
leftist groups opposed to the monarchy have vowed to disrupt the 
funeral and one hinted it might launch a bomb attack to disrupt the 
funeral but said a direct attack on the ceremonies of the 13hour 
funeral would be difficult because of the 32000strong police force 
that will guard it 
a spokesman for kakurokyo or the revolutionary workerss 
association who refused to be identified said his group would more 
likely bomb another target such as a shinto shrine as a symbol of 
its opposition to the monarchy 
inspections of mail entering and leaving japan feb 2226 will be 
stricter than usual and mail delivery and pickup delayed for several 
days due to slowed traffic and increased security checks around 
tokyo said ministry of posts and telecommunications official 
fukushi kitahara 
friday is also a national holiday and most of the countrys post 
offices will be closed 
the arrivals of dignitaries and representatives of international 
organizations forced airlines to cancel 54 domestic flights 
inconveniencing an estimated 5000 passengers planning travel during

the foreign ministers of the soviet union and 
israel met today for 2 hours but failed to bridge differences on 
how to peacefully resolve the middle east crisis 
eduard shevardnadze and his israeli counterpart moshe arens met 
at the soviet embassy overlooking the nile river and agreed to 
discuss their differences further at a later date they didnt say 
where or when 
shevardnadze on a 10day middle east tour told reporters 
tuesday he would try to persuade israel to enter negotiations with 
the palestine liberation organization which the jewish state 
considers a terrorist group 
the soviet union severed ties with israel after the 1967 
arabisraeli war and has been a major arab supporter tentative 
sovietisraeli contacts began only recently and both ministers 
appeared to regret the long break in communication 
the worst thing is not to have a dialogue shevardnadze said 
arens referred to the long dry spell 20 years of not talking 
together 
our conclusion is that we want to meet some more arens said 
we have to extend contacts we have to find ways to present our 
views i think we are creating a basis for understanding possibly 
for agreement 
todays talks with arens however brought no breakthrough for 
shevardnadze to convey to plo chairman yasser arafat at a meeting 
scheduled this evening 
we cannot say that we have come to a solution on all aspects 
but that was not our expectation to expect that would be naive 
shevardnadze said after the meeting 
fundamentally we agreed to continue contacts at foreign 
ministers level and other levels shevardnadze added there are 
differences between us different views and we will continue 
discussions 
arens said israel and the soviet union are in a process of 
building a foundation of understanding 
he repeated israels position on the need for direct talks with 
arab partners on peace 
israel made peace salaam with egypt arens said if the 
rest of the arab world followed egypts example and made direct 
contacts we will have peace egypt and israel signed a peace 
treaty in 1979 the only one between an arab country and the jewish 
state 
the soviet minister noted israelis importance in bringing peace 
to the region 
the state of israel is a most important factor in the 
settlement without good will from israel there can be no solution 
for the problem another aspect is that without the soviet union 
also no peace shevardnadze said 
he said that sovietisraeli experts would meet in a few days to 
discuss the issues in depth 
neither minister referred to speculation the cairo meeting could 
set the stage for restoration of relations between the soviet union 
and israel 
yasser abedrabbo head of the plos information department and a 
member of the organizations 15man executive committee said the 
soviets should not renew relations unless israel accepts an 
international conference 
like the arabs the soviet union wants an international peace 
conference sponsored by the united nations which would be attended 
by the plo and other regional parties as well as the five permanent 
members of the security council 
israel opposes this fearing such a conference would be 
prejudiced against it but israel has said it would accept a 
conference under the aegis of the soviet union and the united states 
shevardnadze said that even had he agreed with arens on an 
international peace conference that would not mean the conference 
would be held immediately 
he said the soviet union is discussing the middle east with the 
united states and that the subject will figure in his scheduled 
march 6 meeting with us secretary of state james baker iii 
i am a natural optimist this is the only way shevardnadze 
said the conflict has to be resolved 
arens flew home early this afternoon arafat arrived about half 
an hour later to meet with the soviet minister

two eggs laid by captive pairs of endangered 
california condors have been placed in incubation while anxious 
scientists wait to learn whether either one is fertile zoo 
officials said 
the newest egg discovered tuesday at the san diego wild animal 
park was produced by condors un1 and ac4 one day after an egg was 
found at the states other breeding station at the los angeles zoo 
park spokesman tom hanscom said 
weve had in hand 18 eggs and this one is on the small side 
but weve seen healthy birds hatch from smaller eggs he said 
both eggs must incubate for about a week before keepers will be 
able to tell whether theyre fertile if so a chick could hatch in 
about two months if there are no complications officials said 
the egg found monday at the los angeles zoo was removed tuesday 
from the plywood nest box of male cuyama and female cachuma when 
both vultures were away from it zoo spokeswoman lora lamarca said 
the 8ounce egg about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide was 
placed in a padded wooden box with hot water bottles to keep it warm 
during the trip to the states other condor breeding station at the 
wild animal park 
the egg was transferred to the northern san diego county park 
because the los angeles zoo is installing new incubation facilities 
lamarca said 
dr mike wallace curator of birds at los angeles zoo said after 
the egg was laid monday that he hoped to collect as many as three 
eggs from cuyama and cachuma during the january through april laying 
season 
the condors recycle their mating habits if their nest loses an 
egg and the female usually takes a month to produce another egg he 
said 
all 28 california condors known to remain alive are in captivity 
half at the los angeles zoo and half at the wild animal park near 
escondido the condor eggs discovered this week are among the only 
three laid in captivity

iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
said today the western reaction to his execution order against 
author salman rushdie proves that opening iranian contacts to the 
rest of the world was wrong 
khomeini also lashed out at the liberals or pragmatists in 
the islamic republic who support greater contacts with other 
nations and vowed he would never cede power to them 
at the beginning of the revolution we gave posts to people who 
were not totally with us in ideology and the bitter results of that 
are plainly evident khomeini was quoted as saying by tehran radio 
as long as i am here i will not let the government fall into 
the hands of the liberals khomeini said 
he did not mention anyone by name parliament speaker hashemi 
rafasnjani and president ali khamenei are leaders of what is 
perceived as the pragmatic faction in government 
publication of rushdies the satanic verses was a sign from 
god that policies supported by the liberals will not work the 
patriarch said 
those who believe that if we act in a pragmatic way they the 
east and west will humanely reciprocate and will respect the 
nation islam and moslems to them this is an example khomeini 
said 
god wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer 
think in simplistic ways he said 
excerpts of the speech were carried on tehran radio and monitored 
in nicosia 
khomeini warned that economic sanctions against iran will not 
sway his death ruling against rushdie who lives in london and has 
been in hiding since the execution order was given feb 14 
the european community norway sweden and canada have withdrawn 
their envoys to tehran 
several other european countries have threatened to cancel visits 
by trade delegations and president bush noted the american 
sanctions already in place when asked about us reaction to the 
execution order 
a west german television station reported today that the cabinet 
was considering economic sanctions because of the rushdie death 
threat west germany is irans most important trading partner 
the pragmatists in iran say its future development hinges on more 
freedom inside the country and greater contact with other nations 
in addition to foreign expertise and perhaps financing needed for 
postwar reconstruction the pragmatists have said iran needs more 
liberal policies internally so the society could develop in a 
hightech era 
their efforts to open iranian contacts with the rest of the world 
since the august ceasefire in the iraniraq war have been 
undermined by khomeinis death sentence 
when khamenei said on friday that rushdie might be pardoned if he 
apologized khomeini quickly reaffirmed the execution order 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes their religion by 
portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggesting that he wrote the koran the holy book of islam rather 
than receiving it from god 
khameini ending a threeday visit to yugoslavia said in a news 
conference in belgrade that the concept of freedom of speech should 
not be confused with freedom to insult the more than 1 billion 
moslems throughout the world 
over the past few days we have been witnessing a very ugly 
event which will in all likelihood continue to excite public and 
moslem opinion throughout the world khamenei said in remarks 
carried by the official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia 
khamenei said western governments could not profess belief in 
freedom of speech at the same as accepting the insult to all 
moslems irna reported 
there is no solution to the rushdie affair the president 
said an arrow has been shot and is unerringly aimed at its 
target

a new law authorizes health officials to order 
aids tests for any chinese deemed at risk of contracting the disease 
and to place all sufferers in quarantine officials at the public 
health ministry said today 
sun xinhua of the ministrys disease prevention department said 
major eastern cities including beijing shanghai and canton 
already have begun sample testing of chinese whose jobs bring them 
into contact with foreigners such as hotel workers and tour guides 
sun said that under the new law if local authorities want 
someone to be tested he must be tested he has no right to refuse 
he said authorities also might order testing of people who came 
into contact with a known aids sufferer and they too would have 
no right to refuse 
nan junhua another official in the same department who helped 
draft the law said it gave the government authority to test the 
countrys entire 109 billion people if need be but he said 
widespread testing was not needed because few chinese are at any 
risk of being exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
if any chinese is found to be an aids sufferer he will be 
quarantined and will not be allowed to continue working or going to 
school nan said more than a dozen foreigners have been expelled 
over the last few years after it was discovered they had aids or had 
been exposed to it 
china which is practically aidsfree has stressed erecting 
barriers to the aids virus entering the country rather than testing 
its own people 
however as chinas traditional mores against casual sex have 
weakened and other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonhorrea 
have reappeared some medical experts have pressed for wider aids 
testing 
only two chinese are known to have died from aids a man who had 
visited new york and a hemophiliac boy who reportedly was infected 
by an imported blood product four other chinese who used imported 
blood products have tested positive for the virus but have not 
developed the disease 
china since has banned imports of blood products last year it 
began requiring chinese who return after more than a year abroad to 
be tested for aids foreigners who come to china for more than a 
year also must be tested 
no cure has been found for aids which is caused by a virus that 
attacks the bodys immune system leaving it vulnerable to 
infections the virus most often is transmitted through sexual 
contact contaminated blood or sharing contaminated hypodermic 
needles 
chinas new infectious disease prevention law takes effect in 
september it was approved tuesday by the national peoples 
congress 135member standing committee which meets between annual 
sessions of the full congress 
in addition to aids the laws testing mandate also covers the 
plague cholera and 34 other infectious diseases sun said china 
previously had only administrative regulations covering infectious 
disease testing and treatment

the citys new law banning ownership of 
semiautomatic assault weapons will hurt lawabiding gun owners more 
than criminals gun control opponents complained 
over the next couple of weeks i think you will find a lot of 
spontaneous outrage to it by gun owners and sportsmen said 
charles h cunningham ohio liaison for the national rifle 
association he said tuesday the nras legal branch would soon 
review the ordinance 
several cities passed laws banning semiautomatic weapons after a 
gunman used an assault rifle to kill five children and wound 30 
other people at a school playground in stockton calif on jan 17 
wilmette ill became only the fifth municipality in the nation 
to ban handguns when its village board unanimously adopted such an 
ordinance tuesday the ordinance requires handgun owners to turn 
their weapons into police for safekeeping they could reclaim them 
if they move out of the chicago suburb 
the cleveland city council passed the ordinance 200 friday city 
law director marilyn zack signed it into law tuesday as acting mayor 
in the absence of mayor george v voinovich who is vacationing she 
also signed into law with the mayors approval an ordinance 
allowing some police officers to carry 9mm pistols a more potent 
weapon than the ones police now carry 
the city council passed both gun measures after a public hearing 
in which police made a plea for help in their struggle against drug 
traffickers 
at a news conference tuesday to voice concern about the gun law 
william bash technical adviser to the sportsmen and firearms 
counsel estimated that more than 75 percent of city gun owners 
would be affected by the change 
police commander robert bolton said a common gun that would fall 
under the new laws restrictions would be a semiautomatic action 
centerfire rifle or carbine that accepts a detachable magazine with 
a capacity or 20 rounds or more 
other guns banned are semiautomatic shotguns with a magazine 
capacity of more than six rounds and semiautomatic handguns that are 
designed to accept a detachable magazine holding more that 20 
bullets 
richard horvath an attorney for the city said gun owners will 
have until march 3 to take their guns out of cleveland or make them 
inoperable 
under a mandatory sentence provision a violation is a 
firstdegree misdemeanor that calls for six months in jail and a 
1000 fine

an official chinese newspaper today accused 
japans prime minister of trying to whitewash japanese aggression 
during world war ii 
japans ambassador to china apologized for any misunderstanding 
over prime minister noboru takeshitas statement and said japan 
recognized the great harm it inflicted on other asian countries 
during the war 
the china daily commentary criticized takeshitas speech last 
week to japans parliament in which he said future historians must 
decide whether japan was the aggressor in the war 
the newspaper said it was surprised that takeshita should make 
such cynical utterances and would rather resort to sophistry 
than speak the truth 
such an absurd approach to such an important issue by a 
japanese leader will smear the image of japan as a trustworthy 
member of the world community and may lead the japanese people 
astray once more the commentary said 
it often happens that we have friends who bow deeply and smile 
courteously and talk nicely at meeting you but their friendship 
proves dubious by their actions behind your back 
on monday a chinese legislator accused prime minister noboru 
takeshita of a gross deception that nobody will believe 
more than 10 million chinese lost their lives during japans 
193745 invasion of the chinese mainland 
japanese ambassador toshijiro nakajima in a meeting with vice 
foreign minister liu shuqing today expressed regret that 
takeshitas comments had not been correctly conveyed 
liu said china acted with restraint in responding to takeshitas 
statement but may not be so tolerant if such pronouncements are 
made again in the future 
japanese sources said nakajima went to the foreign ministry on 
orders of takeshita to clarify the japanese position 
the sources said nakajima said japan caused serious harm to its 
asian neighbors during the war and must recognize that it is 
regarded internationally as the aggressor 
under a communique issued when diplomatic ties were established 
in 1972 japan accepted responsibility for the wartime suffering it 
caused 
the china daily commentary was written by zhang huimin head of 
its opinion page 
he said we are willing to let bygones be bygones and make 
friends with the japanese so long as they repent of their past 
behavior 
but he said those recalcitrants who try to whitewash 
japans past war crimes fill me with anger and repugnance for 
many shocking memories of the early years are still vivid in my 
mind 
the writer related how as a child he hid terrorstricken in 
a cave during japanese bombing raids and saw the gutted charred 
houses and heaps of rubble left by invading japanese troops 
sinojapanese relations today are generally good japan is 
chinas biggest trading partner outside hong kong and most important 
source of foreign credit 
japans chief government spokesman keizo obuchi said monday 
that takeshita had spoken about the misery japan caused to other 
asian countries during the war and that there had been a 
misunderstanding of his intentions when he said that future 
historians should decide on japans role as an aggressor

a former sheriff has filed an 8 million 
libel suit against the makers of the movie mississippi burning 
claiming he was portrayed unfavorably in the film 
they have sure done some terrible harm the former neshoba 
county sheriff lawrence rainey 65 said today in a telephone 
interview from his home in meridian everybody all over the south 
knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is 
referring to me 
rainey who now works for a blackowned security guard service 
was sheriff at the time of the 1964 slayings of three civil rights 
workers near philadelphia the deaths prompted an fbi investigations 
that led to conspiracy charges being filed against 18 men including 
rainey who was later acquitted 
the movie an orion pictures release is a fictional account of 
the slayings of michael schwerner james chaney and andrew goodman 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court at meridian 
charges defamation of character libel and invasion of privacy 
attorney james g mcintyre said 
mcintyre who defended rainey in the 1967 conspiracy trial 
described his client as a man trying to make a living the best way 
he can a man trying to live out his life peaceably 
a person answering the phone at orion pictures offices in new 
york today said no one was immediately available for comment calls 
to orions offices in los angeles were answered by a recording 
mcintyre said he had received no response from orion on his 
demand several weeks ago that the makers correct what he described 
as untruths in the film including the actions of the sheriff at the 
time 
rainey said the film falsely portrayed his activities and 
attitude during the period and had wronged the people of neshoba 
county 
what they said happened and what they did to me certainly 
wasnt right and something ought to be done about it the former 
sheriff said 
rainey said he had been catching some playback from those who 
had seen the film and his employer has been catching some of it 
too

foreign trade failed to make headway in 1988 due to 
production of shoddy goods a fluctuating international economy and 
a failure of joint ventures to perform as expected a newspaper said 
today 
last year did not see any considerable rise in soviet foreign 
trade estimated at 132 billion rubles 2138 billion the 
government herald said 
it said a drop in prices for basic fuel and raw materials and 
growing protectionist trends in western countries made international 
markets unfavorable for soviet goods over the past three years 
the article focusing on the problem of exporting goods said 
very few sovietmade items were immune to the fluctuations of 
international money markets 
meanwhile soviet industry continues producing planes 
vehicles tractors and agricultural machines whose specifications 
differ very little from previous models and which are inferior to 
western types the government herald said 
economic relations with socialist states also proved 
unsatisfactory the newspaper said new forms of cooperation have 
not yet produced any returns and direct ties between socialist 
countries have turned into a means to exchange deficit items it 
said 
further compounding the foreign trade problem is the slow pace at 
which joint ventures get under way the newspaper said 
despite the economic promise of joint enterprises business 
circles in foreign countries tried to set up ventures which would 
not require any substantial investments the newspaper said 
it said initial capital of 81 joint ventures out of a total of 
192 proposed ranged from only 32400 to 162 million 
to revitalize foreign trade the newspaper said it is necessary 
to improve the fundamental democratization of foreign economic 
ties and to introduce new methods of economic management

police sgt ron flathers since benjamin franklins picture is on 
the 100 bill we say it was raining benjies from heaven 
the first cash storm was reported at 9 pm monday when 50000 
to 100000 was found along four miles of a parkway a short time 
later about 10000 in bills were reported fluttering along the 
costa mesa freeway 
then on tuesday morning 200000 more littered the san diego 
freeway in san clemente

communist authorities today 
arrested a spokesman from the charter 77 human rights group a 
dissident said one day after a cofounder of the group was 
sentenced to nine months in jail 
tomas hradilek was detained in his hometown of lipnik nad becvou 
200 miles east of prague and charged with inciting rebellion and 
damaging czechoslovakias image said dissident anna sabatova 
there was no official confirmation but authorities in this 
communist country do not routinely report arrests if convicted 
hradilek could be imprisoned up to five years ms sabatova said 
the charges are based on two letters he wrote last month to 
communist party chief milos jakes and to president gustav husak 
protesting the violence police used to break up peaceful gatherings 
in prague 
this is glasnost in czechoslovakia said fellow charter 77 
activist vaclav maly referring to the greater openness soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev has advocated but which has failed to 
take hold in czechoslovakia 
maly said todays detention means all three spokesmen for the 
movement are in police custody charter 77 the soviet blocs 
oldest unofficial human rights organization was formed in january 
1977 it was named for the document issued by founding members

officials hope the prospect of fines and jail will 
wipe out the practice of washing car windshields and then begging 
motorists for payment 
under a dade county ordinance approved tuesday by the metrodade 
commission people arrested for windshield washing along roadways 
could face a 500 fine and up to 60 days in jail beginning next week 
the ordinance is particularly aimed at miami where as in other 
cities homeless people wash windshields of cars stopped at traffic 
lights to earn spare change miami did not specifically outlaw the 
practice but police have arrested washers occasionally on charges 
of impeding traffic 
in august the fatal shooting of a windshield washer by a miami 
police officer rekindled demands to rid the streets of the washers 
a dade circuit court judge will hear evidence today to determine 
whether the officer acted properly the officer claims he shot the 
washer in selfdefense when he lunged at him with a knife 
motorists in dade are afraid of these men said metrodade 
commissioner jorge valdes who sponsored the ordinance after he said 
his wife was frightened when a washer approached their car 
i think its very important that we work for the public safety 
of the citizens no matter what the consequences valdes said 
commissioners barbara carey and charles dusseau voted against the 
restriction both wanted the washers gone but thought the penalties 
too harsh 
county manager joaquin avino said its unlikely that violators 
would spend much time in jail 
cells are already too crowded with more serious criminals 
what you basically have is a revolving door avino said they 
would be booked and released on their own recognizance 
i think the ordinance will give enforcement more teeth miami 
police spokesman ray lang said

states may not prohibit political party leaders 
from endorsing primary election candidates the supreme court ruled 
today 
the justices by an 80 vote struck down such a california law 
as an impermissible infringement of constitutionally protected 
freedom of speech 
the court also struck down as unconstitutional california laws 
limiting the term of office for party leaders and dictating the 
makeup of state party central committees 
a federal appeals court had thrown out key california election 
laws and todays decision upheld that ruling 
the challenged california election laws burden the first 
amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association 
of political parties and their members without serving a compelling 
state interest justice thurgood marshall wrote for the court 
in overturning the ban on primary election endorsements marshall 
said that attempts to preserve party unity and protect voters from 
confusion and undue influence cannot justify such a prohibition 
he said the state also failed to prove that its regulation of 
political parties leadership structure was necessary to ensure 
orderly and fair elections 
justice john paul stevens did not join marshalls opinion but in 
a separate concurring opinion also voted to strike down the 
california laws chief justice william h rehnquist did not 
participate in the case for unannounced reasons 
california revamped its election laws around the turn of the 
century to break the grip on political parties by wealthy special 
interests particularly the southern pacific railroad co 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals in its ruling last 
year said such laws as the ban on primary election endorsements now 
have the effect of undermining the parties main goals 
agreeing with the appeals court today marshall said depriving 
a political party to endorse suffocates its freedom of speech and 
association 
he added the endorsement ban prevents parties from promoting 
candidates at the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common 
principles may be translated into concerted action and hence to 
political power in the community 
the case is eu vs san francisco county democratic central 
committee 871269

strained egyptianisraeli relations showed 
strong signs of improvement today when the countries agreed on 
compensation in a border dispute and egypts foreign minister 
accepted an invitation to visit israel 
the thaw coincided with the approach of the 10th anniversary of 
the neighbors peace treaty the first and only one between an arab 
nation and the jewish state 
visiting israeli foreign minister moshe arens spoke of increased 
confidence and said the march 26 1979 peace treaty ending 30 years 
of war between the two nations is the foundation stone for an 
overall arabisraeli settlement 
the agreement announced tuesday night by tourism minister fuad 
sultan removed the major obstacle to egypts recovery of the taba 
enclave awarded by international arbitration in september 
under the agreement egypt will pay 37 million little more 
than half the initial claim to the israeli owners of the 
aviyasonesta beach hotel in taba 
if the hotel earns more than 63 million a year the owners will 
get that amount up to a ceiling of 3 million a year 
sultan said egypt also will pay 115 million for rafi nelson 
village a cafeteria with tourist cabanas on taba beach 
the 250acre enclave overlooks the red seas gulf of aqaba at the 
southern end of the egyptianisraeli frontier 
president hosni mubarak said last month that compensation was the 
main impediment to implementing the arbitration ruling 
still being discussed are access to taba for israelis and 
delineation of the frontier from the final border marker to the 
beach a stretch of 150 yards egyptian and israeli officials said 
only minor differences remain 
information minister safwat elsherif told reporters that final 
agreement is expected by the end of february at a meeting in taba of 
egyptian israeli and us representatives elsherif said egypt 
will take over after taba on march 15 after israel withdraws 
israel refused to relinquish taba when it completed its 
withdrawal from egypts sinai peninsula in april 1982 bilateral 
talks failed and the dispute was referred to arbitrators in geneva 
in 1986 
after meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
today arens said his egyptian counterpart esmat abdelmeguid had 
accepted his invitation to visit israel at a date to be fixed later

gov edward d diprete today urged union 
leaders to end a walkout at the state general hospital where for a 
third day national guard troops substituted for striking nurses and 
attendants 
the first facetoface talks between hospital and union officials 
began less than five hours before a judges 3 pm backtowork 
order was to take effect union leaders did not say whether they 
would comply with the order 
i believe that the elements for the settlement are right 
now there diprete told the negotiators but he added its 
going to take some work 
national guard troops in combat fatigues took over for the 
striking attendants and licensed practical nurses when the walkout 
began sunday night at the 410patient hospital which provides 
longterm care for the chronically ill union leaders have 
complained about staffing changes at the facility 
nanci martin dipretes press secretary said talks between the 
union and officials of the state department of mental health 
retardation and hospitals would be mediated by diprete aide robert 
k vincent and state labor director bernard singleton 
todays negotiations followed a private hourlong meeting between 
diprete and union president joseph g fargnoli on tuesday night 
martin said 
the governor is hoping that both sides will discuss this she 
said the governor is going to be available 
fargnoli made no commitment that the workers would return to 
their jobs martin said 
about 120 guardsmen including seven with nurses training worked 
at the hospital and the neighboring institute of mental health where 
union members also failed to show up for their jobs said capt john 
loughlin a guard spokesman 
when you join the guard you realize theres a possibility 
youll be called out to something you may not be totally familiar 
with or may not be totally thrilled about loughlin said 
sue carberry a registered nurse who reported to work said that 
although the combat fatigueclad guardsmen helped to bathe feed and 
dress patients if they dont have someone to tell them what to do 
its difficult 
i can change my sons diaper but its a little different 
changing someone elses said sgt al topp i couldnt do it if 
i worked here full time 
diprete said during a hospital visit that he was willing to keep 
the guard out as long as they need people here he said he was 
satisfied with the patient care 
martin the governors spokeswoman declined to say if diprete 
prepared concessions to the union but said he directed hospital 
officials to continue staffing patterns that the state imposed last 
week to curb overtime prompting the walkout 
about a third of 85 normally scheduled attendants and about half 
of the nurses reported for work tuesday hospital administrator 
james benedict said 
benedict said 22 acutecare patients were at or would be moved to 
other area hospitals 
the hospitals medical director dr rajnikant shah said about 
half the patients were in medical danger 
ill be contacting more facilities than ive contacted already 
in hopes of appealing to them to take patients more rapidly for us 
we could begin to empty out entire units if need be benedict 
said 
a fourday sickout by union members ended jan 31 when diprete 
called out the guard and threatened to fire employees who failed to 
report for work 
the members of local 1350 of the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees claim the state has failed to fill 
vacant staff positions at the hospital called for in their contract 
the state in an effort to cut overtime costs has refused in many 
cases to bring in additional workers to replace employees who call 
in sick

president bush is still assessing his options 
in the middle east and his meetings this week with arab and israeli 
leaders are unlikely to produce new us initiatives to end the 
conflict in the region analysts say 
bush departed today for japan and the funeral of emperor 
hirohito while there he will meet with king hussein of jordan and 
presidents hosni mubarak of egypt and chaim herzog of israel as 
well as other world leaders 
preparations also are under way to line up visits to the united 
states in march and april by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
hussein and mubarak sources said 
at a news conference tuesday bush told reporters that he would 
not be rushed into formulating a policy toward the middle east 
simply because soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is 
engaging in highprofile diplomacy in the region 
bush said he wants to take his first mideast step to be a 
prudent one i dont want to be stampeded by the fact that the 
soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the middle east he said 
bush has talked before about pursuing a goslow policy in the 
middle east 
you crawl before you walk bush said a week after his 
inauguration when asked whether the time had come for secretary of 
state james a baker iii to meet with plo chairman yasser arafat 
there is no policy said mideast expert judith kipper of the 
brookings institution at least in part because key positions still 
remain unfilled at the state department 
apart from supporting the reagan administrations decision to end 
a 13year boycott of direct contacts with arafats plo bush has 
said little to indicate how and whether his mideast policy might 
contrast with the shuttle diplomacy pursued without success by the 
previous administration 
in fact baker last week told european diplomats he thought that 
they too should move carefully in the area of mideast peace 
offensives 
a baker aide describing the secretarys response to a survey of 
the situation by a european community team quoted baker responding 
that this is an area that if you dont prepare an initiative in 
the right way if you push too hard on the wrong level and on the 
wrong issues the possibilities that are there might be preempted 
in small bits and pieces some general bush administration 
mideast policy principles have begun to emerge 
vice president dan quayle told the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith on feb 10 that the united states would not try to 
impose a settlement on israel which has been stung by the american 
opening to the plo 
bush administration officials believe israel must show more 
flexibility in ending the violence in the occupied territories of 
the west bank and gaza strip the state department criticized israel 
in its recentlyreleased human rights report saying shamirs 
government had used unnecessary force in quelling palestinian 
violence in the territories 
baker said at his confirmation hearings that he is opposed to an 
independent palestinian state 
further complicating the bush administrations formulation of its 
mideast strategy is a new and more aggressive role by the soviet 
union 
shevardnadze said in damascus syria last week that the kremlin 
will push for an international peace conference on the mideast under 
the auspices of the united nations 
several mideast scholars in this country complain that the reagan 
administration gave only lip service to the notion of an 
international conference with soviet participation and say the us 
government did not genuinely support that concept in the last eight 
years 
what remains obscure is whether bush will follow the reagan 
administration approach of trying to set up arabisraeli 
negotiations and what role the plo would play in such talks 
the effort failed despite four trips to the region by former 
secretary of state george p shultz and several separate missions 
by former assistant secretary of state richard murphy 
israel vehemently opposes us dealings with the plo and 
administration officials say foreign minister moshe arens will meet 
with baker in the second week of march 
but israeli embassy spokesman yossi gal said we expect to be 
working very closely with the administration 
several private experts disagreed on whether bushs cautious 
approach was the correct one 
it would be a grave mistake on the part of the administration 
to move too fast said neil pickett of the hudson institute 
i am hoping for a cautious and methodical approach he said 
but i am very aware of the pressures on him bush not to do 
that 
samih farsoun an american university professor said however 
there seems to be an international consensus that the us drags 
its feet 
the time for a us peace settlement is now and the auspices 
for it is the united nations he said i think it is time to 
move forward because the plo has come around 
ms kipper who recently returned from a mideast tour said the 
administration has shown little enthusiasm for new peace initiatives 
because they would like to see the israelis come up with new ideas 
in the occupied territories 
there are very real differences between the united states and 
israel she said ms kipper said that the opening to the plo has 
transformed a dormant policy difference into an active policy 
difference

the supreme court today sidestepped deciding 
whether a criminal defendants right to be tried by his peers is 
violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their 
race 
by a 72 vote the justices ruled against frank d teague 
sentenced to 30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a chicago 
supermarket and for the attempted murder of police officers shot 
after the robbery 
four justices one vote short of the majority needed to set 
binding legal precedent said teague should not be allowed to raise 
the representativejury issue 
the four led by justice sandra day oconnor said federal courts 
should not establish new constitutional guidelines when ruling on 
socalled habeas corpus appeals by criminal defendants 
such appeals attack a defendants state court conviction or 
sentence on grounds that federal constitutional rights were 
violated the appeals always follow unsuccessful state court appeals 
by the defendants 
the justices in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may disqualify 
potential jurors based on their race the court said such tactics 
violate equalprotection rights 
but a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive effect 
of the 1986 ruling the court said previously that the 1986 ruling 
does not apply to convicted criminals who like teague had 
exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to when the 1986 
ruling was announced 
teagues habeas corpus appeal did not raise the equalprotection 
issue but instead attacked a prosecutors exclusion of 10 potential 
black jurors on grounds that it violated teagues right to a jury 
selected from a crosssection of the community 
teague who is black was convicted in 1978 by an allwhite jury 
if teague were to win on the fair crosssection challenge he 
would be entitled to a new trial even though the high courts 1986 
ruling came too late to help him 
past supreme court rulings have applied the sixth amendments 
fair crosssection requirement to pools of potential jurors but not 
to juries actually selected 
oconnor said the court should not decide whether the fair 
crosssection requirement applies to selected juries as well because 
that ruling could not apply to teague 
her opinion was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
also voted to uphold teagues conviction but for differing reasons 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
the case is teague vs lane 875259

a top plo official said today his organization 
supports a palestinian state alongside israel and said the 
palestinian national charter calling for destruction of the jewish 
state is open to discussion 
salah khalaf yasser arafats no 2 man spoke on a videotape 
smuggled into israel from tunis tunisia the tape was shown at a 
middle east peace symposium in jerusalem 
in an unusual direct appeal to israel khalaf known by his nom 
de guerre abu iyad assured his audience the plo recognizes the 
jewish state and deplores violence 
we have arrived at a truth that we hope the israeli leaders 
will arrive at before it is too late this is the truth which says 
that two peoples and two states must coexist in this land khalaf 
said 
all other matters are open to discussion our covenant and 
yours can be discussed khalaf said 
the convenant refers to the palestinian national charter 
khalaf called for direct ploisraeli talks before an 
international middle east peace conference proposed most recently by 
the soviet union 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization and refuses to 
hold direct negotiations with it 
the 15minute videotape was screened at a symposium on the 
arabisraeli conflict organized by the international center for 
peace in the middle east a private tel aviv think tank headed by 
former israeli foreign minister abba eban of the labor party 
the appeal followed demands by liberal israelis that the plo deal 
directly with israel instead of seeking western support for its 
positions the united states opened a dialogue with the plo in 
december after arafat recognized israel and renounced terrorism 
the people of israel have a fear that arafat is addressing 
europe and the us state department and not the real or imaginary 
fears of the israeli people shlomo avineri an israeli political 
scientist told the symposium earlier i hope he arafat will one 
day talk to our people 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir reiterated his refusal to 
negotiate with the plo i see it the plo as a stumbling block on 
the road to peace a very serious obstacle he said on israel army 
radio in a telephone interview from paris 
khalaf who spoke in arabic said the plo supported a palestinian 
state alongside israel 
the real issue is not negotiations in which israel seeks this 
piece of land and we seek that piece of land this is a small 
geographic area without much elbow room we do not seek to have a 
berlin wall or any other wall separating us khalaf said 
addressing himself to every child in israel to every woman and 
every man he said the plo was genuine in our desire for a 
strategic peace a peace in which we shall bring security and 
stability to this region

hundreds of authors marched outside the iranian mission to the 
united nations today as outraged writers stepped up their protests 
over the reaction to salman rushdies novel the satanic verses 
i write controversial books what publisher is now going to 
take chances with a controversial book asked activist abbie 
hoffman one of about 300 writers marching in a driving rainstorm 
outside the mission in new york city 
the members of the national writers union on the sidewalk across 
from the mission carried signs which said free speech is 
fundamental and hands off our constitution 
union president alec dubro was rebuffed by building security at 
the mission when he attempted to deliver a letter there expressing 
outrage at the death threats toward rushdie 
the writers then marched on two fifth avenue book stores b 
daltons and barnes amp noble both stores are owned by b dalton one 
of the chains that has pulled the book from its shelves in several 
cities 
to see book stores caving in like that to demagoguery is 
horrifying these are the largest booksellers in the country 
said author laura shapiro they exist in honor of freedom of the 
press for them to be so cowardly is despicable 
writers union locals also planned rallies today in boston 
washington chicago minneapolis and san francisco 
a group of prominent authors including norman mailer susan 
sontag joan didion el doctorow robert caro and gay talese 
scheduled a public reading of the book in manhattan today 
in dover del a high school english teacher says she has 
encouraged her students to spend part of today protesting outside a 
waldenbooks store that chain the nations largest has also 
withdrawn of the book satanic verses from display on its shelves 
its not against waldenbooks but the position of leadership 
the us has failed to take making it necessary for them to drop the 
promotion of sales of the book said dover high school teacher 
phyllis levitt 
irans religious leader ayatollah khomeini has placed a bounty 
on rushdies head saying the satanic verses blasphemes islam 
khomeini also threatened anyone involved in the books publication 
weve never seen writers as deeply outraged as theyve been 
over this issue said alec dubro president of the national 
writers union he blamed the craven response of the chains as 
well as the threats themselves 
the chains cited their employees safety as the reason for 
removing the book the threats also prompted rushdie to cancel a 
us promotional tour and go into hiding with his wife 
americanborn novelist marianne wiggins 
ms wiggins was reported today to have canceled a similar 
sevencity us tour to promote her new novel john dollar 
because so many bookstores have stopped selling satanic 
verses out of fear of violence a trio of yale university 
graduates has set up a tollfree number 18005447475 through 
which anyone may order the book 
we were discussing this and decided its kind of scary that the 
book is relatively unavailable to the american public said one of 
the men kevin kiernan of new york a lot of people just dont 
know what is in the book and people want to see what is in the 
book 
kiernan said theyll sell the book for the retail price 1995 
he said they have made arrangements with the books publisher 
viking penguin but he did not yet know how long it would take to 
fill an order 
in a telegram the eastern branch of the writers guild of america 
told len riggio chairman of b dalton and barnes amp noble that the 
group strongly protests your removal of the salman rushdie book 
from the shelves of your stores 
intimidation and fear generated by those who do not believe in 
our system of free speech cannot justify your company imposing a new 
form of censorship it said 
we believe your action sets a dangerous precedent under which 
any type of literary material could be forced out of circulation if 
threats are made against the distributors broadcasters or 
exhibitors of that material the telegram said

the nation 
feb 11 
the arizona republic phoenix ariz on drug tests 
the nuclear regulatory commission is headed in the right 
direction with its move toward a rule requiring random drug and 
alcohol testing of employees at all us nuclear power plants 
given the risks and the magnitude of mishaps it is frightening 
to think that workers at such critical jobs would not be closely 
monitored and certainly the monitoring should include regular 
checks for evidence of substance abuse 
implementation of the proposed regulation which would apply to 
all utilities operating or building atomic power stations hinges on 
final approval by the nrc which is expected to rule in about a 
month and official publication of the rule which could take an 
additional month 
the possibility more likely a probability also exists of a 
timeconsuming legal challenge 
the mere thought of an alcoholimpaired or a drughigh technician 
loose in the operational section of a nuclear power plant is 
chilling let the testing begin

walla walla wash unionbulletin on gun lobbyists 
the national rifle association had sen howard metzenbaum in its 
crosshairs and missed politicians around the country should take 
notice 
the nra considered by many to wield the power of an 800pound 
gorilla may be nothing more than a monkey on the back of 
politicians 
the nra and other gun lobbyists base their political clout on the 
support from millions of hunters and other gun owners across the 
nation who fear they will lose their weapons 
thankfully the american people would not stand for politicians 
taking away hunters guns or restricting their use 
however the truth is most americans whether gun owners or not 
do not object to an appropriate and reasonable form of gun control 
specifically legislation aimed at banning semiautomatic assault 
weapons 
metzenbaum now pushing legislation to halt sales of ak47s 
israelimade uzis and a host of other militarystyle weapons has 
challenged the nra and not been hurt despite being an nra target in 
last falls election metzenbaum easily won reelection to his 
senate seat from ohio 
its time for other lawmakers to follow metzenbaums lead and 
toss the nra monkey off their backs

membership is outraged by her obvious complicity in the 
abduction and slaying of the boy who was involved in black activist 
causes the child was allegely abducted by members of the mandela 
united football club the gang of rogues and thugs who act as 
bodyguards for mrs mandela 
in all three young activists were allegedly killed by these 
outlaws and two more have disappeared and may be dead 
while we abhor the horrors of apartheid the bulldozing of black 
townships the racist oppression and the murders of men like steven 
biko who was much more moderate than mandela we also abhor the 
type of marxist dictatorship the mandelas seek to replace with it 
the winnie mandelas of south africa cannot be allowed to prevail 
the people of her country black and white deserve better

philadelphia daily news on gun control 
president bush is absolutely not backing a federal ban on 
sales of semiautomatic weapons 
bush supports the tortured logic of the national rifle 
association that assault rifles like the ak47 used in the recent 
killings of five schoolchildren in stockton calif can be used for 
hunting or target practice 
that could probably also be said about flame throwers and grenade 
launchers but thats no reason to make those things readily 
available to any nut who can afford the price 
bush wants the states to punish criminals more severely 
presidential leadership is needed to make it harder to buy guns 
that are used primarily to shoot people and to better screen those 
who buy these guns 
theres no way to get to a kinder gentler nation with an ak47 on 
the shoulder of every homicidal maniac in creation 
the president must realize that and its time he said it

forum fargo nd on a new tax on gasoline 
the drive to reduce the nations staggering budget deficit has 
some members of congress and the bush administration seriously 
considering imposition of a 50centpergallon excise tax on 
gasoline 
thats the wrong approach for at least three reasons 
first such a tax would unfairly place a larger part of the 
burden of deficit reduction on rural states while drivers in the 
wideopen west pile up more miles on the road than do travelers in 
urban states where mass transit is available the additional revenue 
from the gasoline tax would go for deficit reduction rather than 
highway and bridge maintenance 
second there is convincing evidence additional motor fuels taxes 
inhibit economic growth the department of energy estimated in 1987 
that a 25centpergallon tax would cut the gross national product 
about 5 percent 
and finally higher gasoline taxes would be regressive 
especially unfair to lower income people who spend a larger fraction 
of their incomes on motor fuels than do more affluent drivers

hobbs nm daily newssun on parental choice and public schools 
already 13 states give parents the option of selecting superior 
schools where their children can receive a good education president 
bush moreover endorses this freemarket strategy of getting the 
most from us public schools 
the biggest obstacle to this reform is the 17million member 
national education association the nations largest teachers union 
nea lobbyists contend that open enrollment would further divide 
students along economic lines thereby consigning low income 
children to educational ghettos 
such an argument is nonsense as free choice would liberate 
disadvantaged youngsters from inferior ghetto schools 
what the nea really fears is that its members would have to be 
more accountable to the public 
parental choice may not be a cureall for the malady afflicting 
many of the nations public schools but it is the most effective 
means of motivating those schools to offer much more to their 
students

the huntsville ala times on the satanic verses 
irans extreme reaction to the salman rushdie novel the 
satanic verses should not surprise anyone 
the islamic fundamentalists who have ruled the country for a 
decade have imposed the same intolerance at home killing torturing 
and imprisoning even the mildest of dissenters 
remember it was irans stated intent to export the islamic 
revolution that directly led to the long bitter war with iraq iran 
couldnt defeat iraq so now it looks elsewhere 
it seems so basic but it bears repeating iran cannot dictate to 
the world what books it may read or what ideas it may discuss every 
culture would like to see all of humanity molded in its likeness 
but freedom of expression must remain a common bond in the 
brotherhood of man 
perhaps iran will someday return to its senses

st louis postdispatch on a usjapan fighter plane 
last fall the usjapan fighter plane deal appeared set but 
the bush administration has delayed a final decision for a month 
with different departments arguing whether the plan should go ahead 
at all 
these second thoughts are warranted 
the latest deal involves general dynamics and mitsubishi in the 
fsx ground attack fighter based on the f16 the pentagon and the 
state department more interested in shortterm political goals 
gave the japanese very liberal terms too liberal argue the critics 
of the 12 billion in development costs the united states will 
get only 35 to 40 percent of the subcontracts while japan will get 
the rest as well as all production 
but what is even more troubling is that tokyo will also get 
access to composite material and building technology that could 
allow it to expand its aviation industry allowing it to compete 
with the us 
the critics are right the deal should be renegotiated the 
present arrangement harms american interests both in the short and 
the long term

the evening sun baltimore on refugees 
the problem of refugees is as old as the problem of human 
conflict currently more than 13 million people around the world 
need protection and assistance after fleeing their homes because of 
wars and insurrections political oppression or economic hardship 
yet according to a study from the worldwatch institute in 
washington dc that sobering figure will soon be exceeded by a 
less traditional category of refugees people displaced from their 
homes because of environmental disasters 
those disasters may be sudden like the 1986 nuclear accident at 
chernobyl other disasters are more gradual such as the 
impoverishment of productive farmland in subsaharan africa 
in many parts of africa and asia land that is still usable has 
been strained to the point that it can no longer yield enough to 
guarantee a suitable diet 
the result is malnutrition a warning sign that migration the 
most drastic response to environmental degradation is likely to be 
the inhabitants next response

los angeles times on south african racism and poverty in south 
africa 
an extraordinary eightyear study has detailed more 
thoroughly than ever before the appalling depths of south africas 
poverty the pervasive suffering of its black majority and the 
inexorable change taking place that may or may not lead to 
democracy and liberation from racism 
the report coauthored by south africans francis wilson and 
mamphela ramphele rejects the presentday strategy of their 
government to eliminate piecemeal some of the elements of apartheid 
 
the agony of south africa is due primarily to the fact that 
those with political power have left no room for those who would 
change the society to use legitimate democratic channels to do so 
wilson and ramphele write 
wilson is a professor of economics at the university of cape 
town ramphele is also on the faculty there and is a celebrated 
figure in efforts to end apartheid 
they share the credit with 450 others scholars researchers 
experts in special fields who generated about 300 separate study 
papers that were the basis for the final report 
it is already on sale in south africa and will be available soon 
in american bookstores it is required reading for anyone who would 
seek to understand south africa and try to facilitate the cause of 
justice there

the journal providence ri on winnie mandela 
among south africas repressed black majority winnie mandela has 
stood for years as a proud symbol of the fight against the countrys 
hated system of apartheid 
last week however her prestige was shattered when fellow 
apartheid foes denounced her saying her increasingly erratic 
behavior was injuring their cause 
mrs mandela who in 1986 had endorsed the practice of murdering 
black informers and government collaborators had become too 
militant for many other black leaders 
she became a publicity hound built an enormous mansion in soweto 
and organized tough bodyguards into a socalled soccer club 
hers became a cult of personal power run amok 
while it may have pained black south africans to spurn a woman 
they had once admired they correctly saw that their cause was too 
precious to risk for anyones personal ambition 
perhaps from a distorted sense of loyalty to her jailed husband 
and his quiet crusade winnie mandela overreached herself

postbulletin rochester minn on the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan 
like the us departure from vietnam the exodus of soviet forces 
from afghanistan will not bring peace to that devastated land 
in fact the soviet armys departure is only the prelude for what 
may be even more savage fighting between the government and 
guerrilla forces 
the parallels with vietnam are remarkable soviet soldiers 
returning home have reported that the public is indifferent and does 
not appreciate their service 
the united states went to vietnam to stop the spread of 
communism but left with the entire country under communist 
domination the soviets went to afghanistan to support a communist 
puppet regime but left that regime to its fate at the hands of a 
large and confident guerrilla force 
the lesson of the past two decades is one that has been learned 
before wars often are fought for the wrong reason and create 
disasters greater than the ones they were designed to prevent 
the soviets have left afghanistan the disaster they leave behind 
will be a cruel burden for the people of afghanistan and for those 
who support them for decades to come

just two days after sleet and snow blanketed north carolina 
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms swept through the state killing 
one person injuring more than a dozen and teaching 227 
schoolchildren the value of being prepared 
meanwhile floodwaters receded in kentucky and tennessee where 
something new began falling from the sky snow 
flurries began swirling around nashville early today as 
temperatures dropped into the 20s throughout tennessee bringing a 
reprieve from the heavy rains that have plagued the region for more 
than a week most of kentucky also got light snowfall overnight 
a clash between warm and cold air was blamed for the severe 
weather tuesday in north carolina where a construction worker died 
in the collapse of a house he was building near lillington about 25 
miles south of raleigh four people were injured in that incident 
the national weather service said there were apparently some 
tornadoes in the state but could not confirm individual accounts of 
twisters 
in anson county just north of the south carolina border the 
storm destroyed a cable television business sent a tree crashing 
through the roof of a house blew over two airplanes at an airport 
ripped the tin roof off a service station and tore part of the roof 
off the morven elementary school where pupils went through a storm 
drill last week 
we had just had our tornado drill last week so that children 
knew exactly what to do said gloria truman the school secretary 
they were out of the classroom and in the hallway in about 15 
seconds they were perfect you could not ask for them to be any 
better 
one of the 227 children fourthgrader shannon short 9 recalled 
the storm in vivid detail 
it was thundering and the glass was bumping and then the top of 
the ceiling started shaking thats when it started she said 
the rain was splashing on the windows it sounded like rocks we 
had to get out because the rain was falling in on our classroom 
about 30 miles north in moore county several trailers 
overturned injuring four people while to the east in richmond 
county wind tore half the roof off a motel in rockingham 
in kentucky crews doubled their efforts to pump flood water from 
lebanon junction a town south of louisville that has been inundated 
by the recent floods national guard sgt ian lamb said a second 
heavyduty water pump was flown in by helicopter and lowered onto a 
rainsoaked levee that was too soft to support a truck 
about 150 families left their homes in calhoun livermore and 
rumsey in mclean county in western kentucky because of flooding from 
the green river said don armstrong a spokesman for the state 
division of disaster and emergency services the river was expected 
to crest at 10 feet above flood level by friday 
authorities said flooding may have been to blame for the death of 
a woman whose body was found tuesday night in 18 inches of water in 
her basement in larue county 
in western tennessee about a dozen people were expected to begin 
cleaning up today in the town of obion where nearly 400 people were 
evacuated after a levee on the obion river burst 
schools were closed tuesday in four tennessee counties where 
roads were under water but reopened today when they cleared 
however authorities said they were confident that the flooding 
threat was passing with the end of the rains virtually all of 
tennessees swollen rivers had either passed flood stage or were 
expected to by friday forecasters said

a cargo ship carrying 17 people sank in the 
atlantic ocean early today and rescuers battling 90 mph winds and 
rough seas recovered four bodies and searched for the 13 other crew 
members the coast guard said 
us longrange helicopters british planes and ships and a 
danish fishing vessel joined the search for survivors from the 
panamanianregistered secil angola which sank 350 miles west of 
scotland 
at midday a royal air force plane returning to britain spotted 
nine life jackets in the water and flight lt jim mcleod said 
survivors were possible 
the danish vessel the hordagutt recovered the bodies the coast 
guard said officials said the search was contining 
mcleod said winds up to 90 mph combined with snow flurries and 
40foot waves made it difficult to see anything on the water 
the secil angola carrying salt from spain to iceland sank at 
730 am after losing its forward hatch covering and taking on 
water the coast guard said 
the first distress call came at about midnight said coast guard 
spokesman john griffiths in clyde scotland 
at 6 am the ships captain sent a last desperate message 
there is great danger helicopters please hurry 
an raf nimrod maritime reconaissance aircraft the first on the 
scene reported the stricken vessel was awash just above the 
surface of the water at 720 am said griffiths 
minutes later the pilot reported radio contact has been lost the 
ship had turned on its side and sank 
griffiths said the nimrod dropped three life rafts and other 
rescue equipment onto the water 
when helicopters reached the area one crewman was lowered by 
cable to search each dinghy and life raft for survivors said a 
spokesman at the rescue coordination center at pitreavie scotland 
on these dinghies the canopies inflate automatically he 
said speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom 
if you are inside in these kind of conditions you dont 
poke your head out of the slot he said they would not hear the 
aircraft so the winchman has to go down to look at each one 
individually 
the crewman had only one hour to complete his search before the 
helicopter operating at maximum range was forced to return to 
britain to refuel he said 
the rescue center requested help from the us air force which 
sent two longrange helicopters with midair refueling capabilities 
from keflavik iceland 550 miles away 
our helicopters had to refuel in air twice said lt matthew 
hamilton they encountered some really bad weather about 730 had 
to fly around it which added about 100 miles to their trip 
when british officials initially indicated they thought there 
were no survivors the american aircraft returned to base he said 
based on the water temperature and the sea state and the 
weather we decided that it was best that we turn around and come 
back he said

the supreme court in a victory for the federal 
government today made it easier for some creditors to collect more 
money from those who declare bankruptcy 
the court by a 54 ruling in a case from detroit said the 
government is entitled to certain interest payments on taxes owed by 
a bankrupt company 
the case stems from a petition filed by ron pair enterprises 
before a bankruptcy judge in detroit in 1984 
the government said the company owed it 53278 in taxes 
penalties and interest accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcy 
petition 
the company agreed to pay the amount but refused to pay 
additional interest accrued after the filing of the petition 
the government said the company should pay the postfiling 
interest because the collateral tax liens on company property that 
secure the debt owed the government exceed the amount of the 
original debt 
the supreme court today agreed and overturned a ruling by the 
6th us circuit court of appeals against the government 
justice harry a blackmun in his opinion for the court said the 
bankruptcy code which was revised by congress in 1978 permit 
postfiling interest payments in such cases 
the internal revenue service has filed secured claims in 
bankruptcy proceeding totaling more than 730 million from 1982 
through 1986 including 186 million in 1986 alone federal 
officials said state and local governments and private creditors 
also have millions of dollars at stake 
joining blackmun were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting were justices sandra day oconnor william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and john paul stevens

the supreme court ruled today that public 
officials may not be sued when their alleged gross negligence 
permits a child to be abused by a parent 
by a 63 vote the justices said a state does not have a 
constitutional duty to protect people including abused children 
who are not in the states custody 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
as a general matterwe conclude that a states failure to 
protect an individual against private violence simply does not 
constitute a violation of the constitutions due process clause 
in other matters taken up today 
the court ruled that states may not prohibit political party 
leaders from endorsing primary election candidates the justices by 
an 80 vote struck down a california law as an impermissible 
infringement of constitutionally protected freedom of speech the 
court also struck down as unconstitutional california laws limiting 
the term of office for party leaders and dictating the makeup of 
state party central committees 
the justices sidestepped deciding whether a criminal 
defendants right to be tried by his peers is violated when 
prosecutors disqualify potential jurors based on their race by a 
72 vote the justices ruled against frank d teague sentenced to 
30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a chicago supermarket 
and for the attempted murder of police officers shot after the 
robbery four justices one vote short of the majority needed to 
set binding legal precedent said teague should not be allowed to 
raise the representativejury issue 
the court in a victory for the federal government made it 
easier for some creditors to collect more money from those who 
declare bankruptcy the court by a 54 ruling in a case from 
detroit said the government is entitled to certain interest 
payments on taxes owed by a bankrupt company 
in the childabuse case the court rejected an appeal on behalf 
of a wisconsin boy joshua deshaney who since age 4 has been 
seriously and permanently brain damaged from beatings by his father 
in an unusual emotional dissent justice harry a blackmun 
exclaimed poor joshua it is a sad commentary upon american life 
and constitutional principlesthat this child joshua deshaney 
now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundly 
retarded and without an opportunity to sue the state 
social workers were accused of violating joshuas constitutional 
rights by failing to come to his rescue after they had repeated 
evidence he was being beaten 
but rehnquist said the states awareness of the boys plight does 
not mean it has a duty to protect him 
only when the state takes a person into its custody and holds 
him there against his will does the constitution require officials 
to take responsibility for the individuals safety and wellbeing 
rehnquist said 
while the state may have been aware of the dangers that joshua 
faced in the free world it played no part in their creation nor did 
it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them he said 
nor does the fact that the boy was once in the states custody 
change the situation the chief justice added the state does not 
become the permanent guarantor of an individuals safety by having 
once offered him shelter he said 
joining rehnquist were justices byron r white john paul 
stevens sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall joined blackmun in 
dissent 
a suit in joshuas behalf was filed against the winnebago county 
wis department of social services and two of its employees 
the boy first came to the attention of the welfare agency when he 
was brought to a hospital in 1983 with cuts and bruises 
the girlfriend of joshuas father said the boy was injured in an 
attack by another child 
officials suspected he was being abused by adults and a social 
worker ann kenmeter was assigned to the case 
joshua was returned to the custody of his father randy deshaney 
with a recommendation that deshaneys girlfriend move out of the 
house because deshaney had hinted she might be abusing the boy 
deshaneys former wife and joshuas mother melody deshaney was 
living in cheyenne wyo where the couple had been divorced 
a month after the first hospital visit joshua again was treated 
for suspicious injuries 
ms kenmeter visited the deshaney home on several occasions and 
noticed bumps on johsuas head the boy also was treated again at a 
hospital for various bruises and injuries also deshaneys 
girlfriend still was living at the home 
ms kenmeter visited the deshaney home on march 7 1984 and was 
told that several days earlier joshua had fainted in the bathroom 
for no apparent reason but according to court records the social 
worker did not ask to see the boy 
the following day joshua was treated at a hospital for head 
injuries that destroyed half his brain leaving him profoundly 
retarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life 
the boys father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 
two to four years in prison 
the county social services department and its employees were sued 
by joshuas mother on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty 
without due process 
todays supreme court ruling upheld a federal appeals court 
decision that threw out the suit

congressional democrats resumed their criticism 
of president bushs 116 trillion budget today accusing the 
administration of sidestepping needed decisions on savings 
richard g darman the administrations budget director defended 
the fiscal 1990 blueprint before the house budget committee today 
but the panels chairman rep leon panetta dcalif said bushs 
call for deficit savings over a wide range of programs without 
specifying where spending would be cut was inadequate 
these are important to the country and to the american 
people panetta said of the domestic programs that could face 
spending reductions the public is entitled to know where the 
president stands on these crucial programs 
republicans on the budget committee defended the proposal 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota the panels ranking republican 
said he believed bush had presented a pretty complete budget 
picture within 19 days of the inauguration 
darman told the senate budget panel on tuesday that the best way 
for bush and the democraticcontrolled congress to work out a budget 
was by negotiating 
we must come to an executivelegislative agreement darman 
told the senators to that end as a matter of practical reality 
we must negotiate 
but darman ran into a torrent of criticism over the budget that 
bush presented to congress on feb 9 
much of it focused on what is becoming known as the budgets 
black box a collection of more than 1000 programs mostly in 
domestic areas that the president wants to hold to the same 136 
billion spending total in effect for this year 
the proposal would save 10 billion to 11 billion from budget 
growth that would occur otherwise but democrats say bushs budget 
leaves congress with the painful job of selecting programs to cut 
where are the cuts going to come from asked panel chairman 
jim sasser dtenn we dont know the bush administration has yet 
to tell us 
darman for the first time indicated that the administration 
considered the black box approach to be among the items that 
could be negotiated 
thats one option he said of the grouping of programs 
another option is one that says if youve got ideas for priorities 
that need to be funded wed like to see those 
lawmakers also repeated charges that the assumptions bush used 
about the economys expected performance were so optimistic that 
they would unrealistically diminish the amount of savings needed to 
satisfy the grammrudman deficit reduction law that legislation 
requires a deficit of no greater than 100 billion next year or 
automatic spending cuts are triggered 
sen j bennett johnson dla said that since there are no 
elections this year and thus no immediate pressures on legislators 
seeking reelection we ought to do some serious budgeteering 
he said that many lawmakers however are not willing to engage in 
a charade 
republicans jumped to darmans support including sen pete v 
domenici rnm the senior republican on the committee who said 
he disagreed with the democrats on the need for fine detail 
i dont think we have to know the details but rather an overall 
view he said 
and sen warren rudman rnh said past budgets proposed by 
president reagan were usually pronounced dead on arrival 
yours is still quivering so i guess youre ahead he told 
darman 
administration and congressional officials have held several 
meetings already to discuss bushs budget and more will be held 
sasser told reporters after tuesdays hearing 
in the most recent session tuesday morning at the white house 
bush senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine house speaker 
jim wright dtexas and others spent most of their time talking 
about the budget process rather than specific program or spendng 
decisions participants said

began a weeklong strike that will halt garbage collection and leave 
parks without attendants 
if you dont find a solution greece will stink went the 
cry from more than 5000 demonstrators outside the interior ministry 
the strike began with a march to press demands for a collective 
wage agreement and salary increases 
dimitris mihalopoulos president of the union of municipal 
workers said they were striking because the socialist government 
reneged on a promise to settle the dispute 
we are the people who rain or snow from daylight to midnight 
clean the cities its not fair that more than 6000 of us should 
not have a collective wage agreement mihalopoulos said 
the strike also includes city clerks recordkeepers and road 
workers 
mihalopoulos said the workers average monthly salary of about 
400 was not enough to support a family 
a similar strike last year resulted in piles of uncollected 
garbage rotting on streets radio stations asked residents to keep 
their garbage at home during the strike

a controversial plan to pay for fire fighting 
on public land is only a starting point for negotiations with 
congress on ways to trim the federal budget an agriculture 
department analyst said today 
the plan was proposed in the reagan budget sent to congress in 
january and has been endorsed by president bush as part of the 
ongoing talks with capitol hill on ways to reduce spending 
under the reagan proposal part of the receipts collected by the 
agriculture and interior departments for timber sales mining 
recreation and other feepaid activities that normally go to the 
states would be used to pay firefighting bills 
the plan was not directly addressed by bush in his message to 
congress or in documents provided by the office of management and 
budget but it wasnt overruled either said mike mcdonald of 
the usdas budget office 
white house budget director richard darman calls the reagan 
budget proposals a starting point for negotiations in congress 
mcdonald said in a telephone interview 
for many years the forest service has kicked back 25 percent of 
its annual receipts to the states in the 1988 fiscal year that 
ended last sept 30 for example more than 318 million went to 41 
states and puerto rico oregon led with 1445 million 
mcdonald said that under the plan estimated fire costs would be 
deducted from estimated total national receipts the remainder then 
would be apportioned to the states where the forests are located 
as it stands now each states share of forest revenues would be 
reduced by 184 percent 
ive been telling people that whatever you got last year 
presuming that receipts are relatively steady the 
receiptsharing payment probably would be about 184 percent less 
under the reagan proposal mcdonald said 
that is also the starting point for the bush proposal he said 
the only difference betweena the two is the reagan proposal was 
more firm as part of the presidents budget mcdonald said the 
bush proposal is merely a starting point for negotiation 
using the formula of 184 percent this years state shares of 
the forest earnings assumming receipts are about the same as in 
1988 would be reduced to less than 260 million from 318 million 
oregons share would drop to about 118 million from 145 million 
last year

former ku klux klan leader david duke was 
sworn in as a member of the louisiana house today after surviving 
two lastminute attempts to block him from taking his seat 
duke a republican had overcome opposition by president bush 
former president reagan other prominent party leaders to defeat 
homebuilder john treen in saturdays election in metairie a nearly 
allwhite suburb of new orleans 
i love this country and i love this state and i am anxious to 
get to work and solve the problems of this state duke told a 
packed house chamber today 
duke took the oath of office at 1035 am after the house voted 
6933 to table a motion by a freshman representative to investigate 
dukes credentials 
louisianas house and senate convened today for a special session 
to consider rewriting the states tax code 
about 30 minutes before the legislature convened state district 
judge clarence mcmanus rejected a motion by treen to block duke from 
taking his seat treen also a republican had contended that duke 
did not meet residency requirements 
odon bacque an independent legislator from lafayette then asked 
the house to investigate whether duke was a legal resident of the 
district as he was called to the podium to receive the oath of 
office but the house voted to table the motion clearing the way 
for duke 38 to be sworn in 
men of principle must stand when principles are placed in 
jeopardy and now is such a time bacque told the house 
but democratic rep john alario urged the house to table the 
motion clearing the way for duke to take his seat 
i stand here today not to defend mr duke but to defend 
democracy i am confident there is a super majority in this 
legislature who will stand for equal justice for all no matter who 
is elected to its membership alario said 
duke accused bacque of engaging in political chicanery 
dukes 227vote margin of victory was certified tuesday by the 
secretary of states office in baton rouge after the votes were 
counted 
treen says duke lived in a home a few blocks outside his district 
and kept an apartment in the district so he could run there state 
law requires a candidate to have lived in the district he wants to 
represent for at least a year 
duke declined to say whether he had two addresses but said he met 
the residency requirements in every respect its a frivolous 
challenge 
at a news conference in baton rouge he said he had changed since 
his days in the klan and promised to silence his critics with his 
work in the legislature 
im just really proud to live in america said duke im 
also looking forward to an end to the hoopla 
duke left the klan in 1980 but remains the president of the 
national association for the advancement of white people which he 
describes as a civil rights group for everyone 
im certainly not the david duke i was during my years in the 
klan but im certain ive grown like all people do mentally 
spiritually he said i believe in the civil rights of all 
people i think the criticism ive endured will be muted by my 
activities in the house of representatives 
national republican party officials disagree with louisiana gop 
leaders over how to respond to dukes election under national party 
chairman lee atwaters direction a resolution was prepared 
declaring that duke was not a republican in gesture deed or 
belief 
the resolution was expected to be adopted by the partys 
11member executive council which will confer by telephone friday 
but members of the republican caucus at the louisiana house said 
there were no plans to bar duke from their ranks if he was sworn in 
duke joined the gop a few days before declaring his candidacy 
treen is a longtime republican who was backed by president bush and 
former president reagan 
bush said in washington that the unprecedented highlevel 
endorsements may have helped duke inadvertantly he said voters may 
have considered his letter of support improper or overkill but 
added that dukes record is one of racism and bigotry and im 
sorry i just felt i had to speak out

the parents of two children who were sexually 
attacked on the cherokee indian reservation said today that gaps in 
federal laws covering indian crimes made prosecution of the 
offenders a fouryear nightmare 
larry blythe told a special senate investigating subcommittee 
that his 2yearold daughter and 6yearold son were raped in 1984 
on the reservation in western north carolina 
he said trials were held and the abusers convicted but their 
life sentences were overturned on appeal because the prosecutors had 
used a state law to obtain the convictions 
state laws do not apply to crimes on indian reservations 
in a second trial prosecutors searched the federal statutes for 
language that referred to the rapes and could not find wording that 
applied to such a crime against a boy 
the defendant pleaded guilty last spring to assault causing 
bodily harm and got a 10year sentence blythe said 
he said federal statutes have since been amended for cases like 
his childrens but similar loopholes could exist for other types of 
crimes 
id like to see them pass a law that the federal act affects 
any crime on the reservations he said 
on tuesday an fbi agent testified that child molesters gravitate 
to indian reservation schools because background checks are lax and 
there are no laws requiring officials to report suspected cases of 
sex abuse 
david small supervisory special agent in phoenix told the panel 
that molesters also seek teaching jobs on reservations because they 
usually are in remote areas making it easy to prey on children 
earlier tuesday a former teacher testified in a video tape that 
he molested boys at the cherokee elementary school in western north 
carolina for 14 years before being caught 
the teacher paul wade price is serving a 10year sentence at 
butner federal correctional institution after pleading guilty in 
1986 to one count of child molestation in the taped interview he 
said he molested at least 25 boys ages 8 to 12 
congress in 1974 passed a law saying states would lose federal 
funds if they did not enact statutes making it a crime to withhold 
information about suspected child sex abuse in schools but state 
law does not apply to indian reservations where bia schools are 
totally federally financed the federal government lacks such a law 
child sex abuse on reservations is the topic of hearings this 
week by a special unit of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs which also has been looking into corruption in indian 
contracting procedures and organized crime involvement in gaming 
operations on reservations 
after hearing from price and two mothers whose sons were molested 
by him the committee listened to eight witnesses from law 
enforcement agencies and the indian affairs bureau who all said the 
federal government should pass a law requiring that cases of 
suspected child sex abuse be reported 
witnesses from the bia said that despite a new policy requiring 
school personnel to report cases of sex abuse the bia does not get 
much information william mehojah bia branch chief for indian 
elementary and secondary school programs said no disciplinary 
action has ever been taken for failure to report 
robert haley general chairman of the indian law enforcement 
section of the international association of chiefs of police said 
investigation of child abuse cases are sometimes hampered by the 
refusal of tribes to let the children off the reservation to testify 
he said us attorneys should be given the power to get the 
testimony 
mehojah said many teachers have gone to work before background 
checks were complete because of paperwork delays 
other testimony indicated that even when schools are warned about 
the history of a potential teacher that teacher may get hired 
anyway 
arthur justice dean of education at the university of south 
carolinaspartanburg testified that he had been instrumental in 
removing price as a seventh grade teacher in 1972 from another 
school and had warned the cherokee school officials about him but 
14 years passed before price was removed 
ollie locust a teachers aide at cherokee elementary said she 
saw price fondling a boy in the hallway and told the school 
principal but nothing was done 
teacher betty brintnall and ms locust said it was common 
knowledge around the school that price had a penchant for young 
boys but no action was taken until a mother complained 
agent small said he knew of other cases in which indian school 
administrators knew that a teacher had been molesting students but 
would not tell the next school system that hired him 
its an easy out said sen dennis deconcini dariz who 
chairs the special investigative committee let the person 
resign 
i never have seen a more clear failure of government 
responsibility to us citizens than we have seen in the last few 
days said sen john mccain rariz a committee member what 
is so tragic in this case is that they are little children

supports moves to isolate the islamic republic 
khomeini said the western reaction proved it was wrong for iran 
to open contacts to the rest of the world 
a conference of moslem theologians in saudi arabia said rushdie 
who was born into a moslem family should stand trial in an islamic 
country for his novel the satanic verses a saudi newspaper 
reported today 
rushdies wife american novelist marianne wiggins canceled a 
us bookpromotion tour to stay with her husband who is in hiding 
in britain she had planned the tour to promote john dollar her 
latest novel 
antiterrorist police today guarded a plant in cles italy where 
the satanic verses was being printed and italians placed 
hundreds of orders for it as a publisher prepared to release a 
second run of the controversial book 
west germany irans biggest trading partner said today it had 
canceled two visits by cabinet ministers to iran and it called on 
the security council to take up the issue 
a west german television network said the cabinet also discussed 
further measures against iran if the mullahs adhere to the 
execution order against rushdie then economic sanctions will no 
longer be ruled out the zdf network reported 
west germany already has decided to remove its ambassador from 
tehran as part of an action by the 12 european economic community 
countries 
bush said on tuesday he supported the eec decision and told a 
news conference in washington that no matter how offensive rushdies 
book may be to moslems inciting murder and offering rewards for 
its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized 
behavior 
khomeini who issued a death sentence on rushdie on feb 14 said 
economic sanctions will not change his stance and he said 
publication of the satanic verses was a sign from god that iran 
should not reach out to western nations 
god wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer 
think in simplistic ways he said 
hundreds of literary figures marched outside the iranian mission 
to the united nations in new york this morning and then to two fifth 
avenue book stores b daltons and barnes amp noble which have 
pulled the satanic verses from their shelves

should be tried in absentia in an islamic state for his 
misleading allegations against islam the londonbased newspaper 
alsharq alawsat reported 
many moslems say the satanic verses is sacrilegious because 
it casts doubt on central tenets of the islamic faith the book for 
example portrays the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggests he wrote the koran the holy book of islam rather than 
receiving it from god 
nicholas browne britains charges daffaires in iran returned

clandestinely for years came out into the open wednesday to enroll 
in the first school of jewish studies in the country since stalins 
time 
the opening of the judaic studies center is the event weve 
been awaiting all our conscious lives said yuriel neishtadt who 
sported a full black beard and wore a handwoven religious skull cap 
neishtadt 31 said he secretly studied hebrew and jewish prayers 
with small groups of friends 
until recently soviets were jailed for teaching hebrew among 
the most prominent teachers was josef begun who served more than 
three years in prison on charges of antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda before being released exactly two years ago he 
emigrated to israel in january 1988 
in a symmetry of history permitted by president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms neishtadt and other soviet jews will be taking 
classes from descendants of some of the countrys jewish leaders 
rabbi gedalya rabinowitz director of yeshiva oholei yitzhak in 
jerusalem told about 200 people gathered for the opening that his 
great grandfathers great grandfather had established a jewish 
school in moscow 150 years ago 
and now i am here 150 years later at the inauguration of a new 
house of study and prayer said the graybearded rabinowitz he 
then gave the centers first lecture about customs of the 
springtime holiday of passover 
rabbi joel poupko director of judaica for the jewish community 
centers of chicago said his grandfather headed a yeshiva in the 
russian city of yelets but was imprisoned under dictator josef 
stalin in 1926 
it is some 63 years later and we give thanks to almighty 
god poupko told the audience at the house of scientists 
the jewish center known as a yeshiva will be housed elsewhere 
in moscow in an apartment complex owned by the soviet academy of 
sciences on the soviet side the center is organized by the academy 
of world civilizations a branch of a genevabased group of 
scientists known as the world laboratory on the western side help 
comes from the aleph society a group of philanthropists in israel 
and the united states that supports the work of rabbi adin 
steinsaltz one of the worlds most prominent specialists on the 
jewish talmud and a teacher at the new center 
the center with an initial enrollment of 80 students will train 
rabbis and scholars in the bible the talmud jewish law and history 
another of the visiting scholars david berger a history 
professor at brooklyn college said he helped interview prospective 
students and was almost brought to tears one man in his 20s who had 
studied with his father began his interview by citing from memory a 
passage from the torah in hebrew berger said 
theres a level of commitment that is really remarkable and you 
dont see it in the west where we take things for granted berger 
said 
but one student who was chosen accused the soviet government of 
supporting the center purely for propagandistic purposes and 
said some wouldbe classmates were discouraged from enrolling the 
student spoke on condition of anonymity 
gorbachev has opened many doors for jews and other religious 
groups and has promised changes in a 1929 law prohibiting religious 
classes for the young 
for the soviet unions estimated 18 million jews the 
liberalization has meant an increase in emigration the opening last 
week of the first jewish cultural center in the soviet union in more 
than 50 years greater tolerance of religious celebrations and less 
repression of jewish activists 
on tuesday leaders of the washingtonbased bnai brith group 
once villified in the soviet press and popular literature 
presented a founding charter for a branch to 40 moscow jews said 
spokesman daniel mariaschin 
steinsaltz said the soviet union was once the jewish 
heartland of the world and the center could help restore that 
status 
however he cited a jewish saying that cautions every 
beginning should be judged by what comes after

it is against chinas legal principles to stir up public 
opinion in an attempt to overturn independent jurisdiction by 
soliciting signatures the official xinhua news agency quoted an 
unidentified justice ministry official as saying 
it was the first government response to a series of calls by 
chinese intellectuals for the release of political prisoners 
especially activist wei jingsheng who has been jailed since 1979 
leading dissident fang lizhi first suggested an amnesty last 
month in an open letter to senior leader deng xiaoping last week 
33 intellectuals including some of chinas most famous writers and 
thinkers sent the government and ruling communist party a second 
letter appealing for an amnesty 
since then nearly 50 more people have signed a petition

liu 64 a nieman fellow at harvard university is the most 
famous of the chinese who have signed in the united states he was 
fired as a reporter for chinas leading newspaper the peoples 
daily and kicked out of the communist party in 1987 because of his 
crusade against government corruption 
i know the authorities will not be too happy about this but i 
dont think they can do anything to us hong said of the petition

chineselanguage newspapers in new york 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international

we are trying to get 20000 he said there are more than 
30000 chinese studying in the united states with dozens more 
scholars visiting to lecture or do research 
the call for a political amnesty comes during one of the most 
lively periods of political debate in china in a decade for several

a 78yearold man who fatally shot his 
bedridden wife and then swallowed a handful of pills was sentenced 
today to two years of house arrest 
frank j reinl also was placed on 10 years of probation by adams 
county circuit judge raymond gieringer whose voice cracked and who 
paused several times during an hourlong sentencing hearing 
sir what you did was absolutely wrong the court cannot 
condone it the judge said you may have considered it an 
ultimate act of love i believe you did but it was wrong 
before he was sentenced reinl cried trying to explain briefly 
why he killed his wife 
i realized she could not be alone for a single second he 
told the judge 
he described how his wife who had suffered a series of strokes 
and had been released from a hospital six days before the shooting 
kept getting out of bed to go to the bathroom every few seconds 
reinl pleaded guilty in november to one count of seconddegree 
murder in the feb 8 1988 shooting of his wife rose 73 
shortly before the shooting reinl had lost more than 30 pounds 
and learned he had progressive leukemia defense attorney gary 
kryshak said 
there is nothing that this court is going to do that is going 
to punish frank reinl more than the fact that he has to live with 
what he did kryshak said 
adams county district attorney mark thibodeau agreed saying it 
was obvious that he loved his wife reinl had been meticulous in her 
care since she suffered her first stroke in june 1987 and called the 
doctor to the point of being bothersome he said 
but the prosecutor said what reinl did was still wrong and a 
message had to be sent to the public that it would not be condoned 
it would serve no purpose to put you in prison the prisons are 
already full the judge told reinl but his court must send a 
message that its not ok to take a life not even a loved one 
he also ordered reinl to pay 5000 to start a crime prevention 
fund noting that the presentence report indicated he was a man of 
some means

the former chairman of the house intelligence 
committee testified today that he wasnt satisfied with white house 
denials of news reports that oliver l north was helping nicaraguan 
rebels in defiance of a congressional ban on such assistance 
rep lee hamilton dind testified that thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane assured him in two letters and a 1985 
committee briefing that neither north nor other national security 
council aides was helping the contra guerrillas 
were you satisfied with the response prosecutor john w 
keker asked hamilton the leadoff witness at norths trial in us 
district court 
no i was not hamilton replied the press stories 
continued in large numbers it was of great interest to congress 
the inquiries were first made in august 1985 following news 
reports that north was helping raise money for the contras and 
giving the rebels tactical military advice despite prohibitions on 
us aid first enacted by congress in the socalled boland amendment 
of 1984 
this was the most controversial matter of policy in washington 
at the time hamilton testified it was not possible for me to 
go onto the floor of the house of representatives without members 
asking me about the news stories 
prosecutors are trying to show that north then a marine 
lieutenant colonel serving on the nsc staff subverted the processes 
of government by helping mcfarlane draft false answers to letters 
from congress inquiring about the news reports of his activities 
accurate answers to congressional inquiries are needed hamilton 
said because we cant fulfill our responsibility unless we have 
accurate information from the executive branch 
keker asked hamilton whether its all right to go and lie to 
the intelligence committee 
no the lawmaker replied 
the question and answer drew a defense objection that was 
sustained by judge gerhard a gesell 
north is charged among other things with obstructing 
congressional inquiries into his activities in 1985 and 1986 
mcfarlane who is expected to testify as a prosecution witness has 
pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information 
from congress 
following further reports of his activities the committee 
questioned north directly during an aug 6 1986 meeting in the 
white house situation room hamilton said 
colonel north insisted they had not violated the boland 
amendment and that they had not assisted the contras by raising 
money and had not provided any military advice to the contras he 
said recalling the meeting 
my recollection is clear that colonel north insisted there was 
no violation of the boland amendment the congressman said 
hamilton said the news reports about norths fundraising 
activities sparked enormous interest among house members because 
the debate in this country through a large part of the 1980s was 
on whether or not the contras should be funded by the united states 
government 
that became a very controversial debate hamilton said 
culminating in the passage of the boland amendment that prohibited 
us intelligence agencies from using money to help the contras 
under defense crossexamination hamilton conceded that the 
series of boland amendments were a confusing set of laws but 
insisted that there was throughout that period of time a 
prohibition of any aid for military or paramilitary activities 
he also dismissed a suggestion by norths chief defense lawyer 
brendan v sullivan jr that the boland amendment did not apply to 
the nsc 
i do not recall anyone saying to me this language does not 
apply to the national security council hamilton said the 
letter mr mcfarlane wrote to me specifically said that the language 
did apply and i accepted that 
it was only after this period that supporters of contra aid 
claimed that the amendment did not apply to the nsc hamilton said 
he conceded however that i do not read that language as 
applying to the president of the united states provided the chief 
executive does not use the cia the defense department or other 
intelligence agencies to aid the contras 
during direct examination keker tried to undercut the claim in 
tuesdays opening argument by sullivan that congress couldnt be 
trusted with secrets because it leaked like a sieve 
hamilton said the white house shared secrets with the 
intelligence committee throughout his twoyear tenure as its 
chairman those secrets were carefully guarded by the 16member 
panel he said 
i am not aware of any information that i was not permitted to 
see hamilton said i was never refused a request for 
information 
north is charged with nine felony counts of lying to congress and 
to a presidential investigation of the irancontra affair 
he also is charged with illegally using a taxexempt foundation 
to raise private donations to arm the contras and with two counts 
alleging he personally profited from the irancontra affair 
north faces up to 60 years in prison and fines totaling 3 
million if convicted on all counts

the state department expressed deep regret 
wednesday over the sentencing of a dissident czech playwright 
calling it bitter testimony to the lack of human rights in 
czechoslovakia 
vaclav havel a human rights activist was sentenced tuesday to a 
ninemonth prison term after he was convicted of inciting people to 
attend what czech authorities regarded as an antigovernment 
demonstration last month 
state department spokesman charles redman said that the 
administration had strongly urged the czechoslovak government last 
week to drop the charges against havel and to enter into a dialogue 
with dissident groups in czechoslovakia 
mr havels trial yesterday and his ninemonth sentence are 
bitter testimony to the lack of respect for fundamental human rights 
in czechoslovakia redman said 
he noted in particular that much of the governments case on the 
incitement charge against havel apparently involved his interviews 
with western media including radio free europe 
ironically redman said these interviews were intended by havel 
to head off a reported plan by a group to repeat a 1969 act of 
selfimmolation by jan palach a student who was protesting the 
soviet invasion of czechoslovakia the previous year 
havel had been thwarted in his efforts to use czechoslovak 
media to appeal to this group not to commit such an act and had 
turned in frustration to western media which routinely provide 
information of broad interest to czechoslovak public opinion which 
official media do not carry redman said 
were also troubled by reports that even more individuals may 
face charges arising from last months peaceful demonstration in 
prague we again urge the czechoslovak government to abandon the 
confrontational practices of the past

we are in the land of caitanya they shouted as they ran from 
an aeroflot plane into calcutta airports arrival lounge 
caitanya is the 14th century indian hindu philosopher whose 
teachings are followed by devotees around the world 
under the leadership of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the kremlin has sought to portray itself as more tolerant of 
religions 
although soviet law does not forbid the practicing of religion 
it requires that religious groups be registered with the state hare 
krishnas have said in the past that authorities have refused to 
register them or failed to respond to their requests for 
registration they have claimed that hare krishnas have been jailed 
or placed in psychiatric hospitals as recently as august 1987 
gorbachevs perestroika and glasnost has really worked we are 
here thanks to the new policy of our leader said olga kiscleva a 
moscow teacher and poet in her early 30s 
she said she joined the hare krishna movement nearly 18 years ago 
the pilgrims said they were the first followers of the soviet 
unions international society for krishna consciousness iskcon 
allowed to make a foreign visit 
at a news conference ms kiscleva and other members of the group 
said their movement had only recently attained tolerance in the 
soviet union 
until april 1988 iskcon was virtually banned in the soviet 
union ms kiscleva said during that period many of the iskcon 
followers were jailed then came may 1988 when iskcon was given 
soviet official recognition we are now free to practice our 
religion publicly 
she said there were 450 initiated iskcon devotees in the 
soviet union and at least 10000 other hare krishna followers 
they are living in 60 different cities and preaching the iskcon 
philosophy she said 
their ranks included writers artists teachers engineers and 
scientists ms kiscleva said 
ours is the first group to visit india the birthplace of lord 
caitanya many more will follow she added 
the chant of hare krishna praise krishna was 
recommended by caitanya as the simplest form of prayer to the hindu 
deity krishna who personifies the ideal child lover and 
philosopher is revered as one of the 10 incarnations of lord 
vishnu a member of hinduisms supreme trinity of gods 
the soviets plan to spend a few days in calcutta and then embark 
on a tour of temples in india they are scheduled to return to 
moscow on april 15

she calls me charlie and thats fine said 
charles h price ii us ambassador to the court of st jamess 
i always refer to her as prime minister 
price was talking about the relationship he has forged with 
margaret thatcher during a 5year spell as ambassador to the reagan 
administrations close ally 
he said the first call he got at the embassy on the night of the 
pan am air disaster was from mrs thatcher offering him a ride to 
the crash site in lockerbie scotland 
he ended up going on his own but mrs thatchers gesture was a 
measure of how considerate and thoughtful she is he said 
price 57 returns this month to his native kansas city mo to 
resume his banking career as an executive and chairmandesignate of 
ameribanc inc his successor is president bushs nominee henry 
catto a onetime us chief of protocol 
ronald reagans man in margaret thatchers britain has had a us 
foreign service plum an imposing embassy in grosvenor square and an 
elegant residence winfield house in 12 acres of private grounds in 
regents park and an angloamerican relationship that has seldom 
been closer 
yet his years of service were a trying time for the united 
states and its west european allies 
the 1987 treaty to remove the superpowers medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles from europe raised old west european 
anxieties about america loosening the mutual defense 
responsibilities within the nato alliance european economic 
community moves to dismantle internal trade barriers by 1992 raised 
us fears of a fortress europe looming to keep out us goods 
price predicts that in the next few years the bush 
administration driven by pressure in congress to make the europeans 
pay more for their defense will fulfill one of mrs thatchers 
worst fears and reduce the 325000 us troops in europe 
burdensharing said price of the arguments about defense 
spending within the alliance is a real issue which is potentially 
divisive 
when americans think about the fact that the cost of 
maintaining that troop presence is larger than the combined 
contribution of all the other allies that becomes a very simplistic 
thing that politicians can latch on to quickly in the fact of the 
federal budget deficit problem adds price 
i would not necessarily be surprised if in the course of the 
next 23 years there was an american troop reduction 
on trade relations price is more optimistic despite a current 
dispute over an eec ban on hormonetreated us beef that has the 
seeds of a damaging trade war 
price returns home a committed anglophile unshaken by 
demonstrations over nuclear arms and the biggest protest this decade 
at the embassy when 6000 people converged after the 1986 us 
bombing of libya mrs thatcher provoked a domestic uproar by 
allowing the bombers to fly from british bases 
price who built up an inherited candy business in kansas city 
and branched into banking was named ambassador to belgium at the 
start of reagans first term he arrived in london in 1983 to 
replace john louis who made little impact as ambassador 
price often has been a gobetween and he traveled regularly on 
the british prime ministers plane as the thatcherreagan rapport 
grew 
aides said he displayed a keen grasp of issues praise not 
always given by career diplomats who sometimes grumble that 
political appointee ambassadors are illinformed figureheads 
enjoying the fruits of their election campaign contributions 
the prices are leaving winfield house a gift of a sculpture of 
barbara hutton the woolworth heiress who built the beautiful 
neogeorgian house 50 years ago and gave it to the united states as 
a residence for the ambassador in 1946

president bushs nomination of john tower to 
become defense secretary ran into fresh difficulty today when two 
democratic senators said the latest fbi background report does not 
end questions about towers drinking habits 
it is not the clean bill of health that one would have us 
believe sen j james exon dneb told reporters 
if he tower hadnt touched anything but a couple of glasses 
of wine at dinner since 1982 i wouldnt be concerned there are 
parts of the report that indicate that several people dont think 
thats the case exon said 
sen carl levin dmich also questioned anonymous white house 
officials who have been quoted in published reports in recent days 
as saying the report found tower had a drinking problem in the 1970s 
but no longer does 
that is not an accurate description of that file said levin 
the democrats spoke with reporters as many republicans taking 
their cue from bush were rallying around tower 
sen john mccain rariz said this morning on nbcs today 
program that he believed the tide was turning in towers favor 
adding so far there has been no substance to this veritable 
blizzard of allegations that we have seen 
levin and exon both are members of the senate armed services 
committee which scheduled a closeddoor meeting today to discuss 
the latest fbi report 
the panel had tentatively been expected to vote on the nomination 
thursday and sen john warner rva the committees senior 
republican said he hoped that would still be the case 
bush gave tower a strong vote of confidence on tuesday and said 
the fbi report had gunned down the allegations against tower 
but sen alan dixon dill said on nbc this morning he had 
reservations about taking a vote thursday 
id have to say theres a lot of hearsay and innuendo in there 
the fbis latest background report on towers activities on the 
other hand there are some substantive things that i think need 
further evaluation dixon said 
the report included some damaging allegations dixon said 
including recent statements not things from the 1970s 
unfortunately by people that refuse to be identified the 
allegations were mostly regarding towers personal actions rather 
than his business connections he said 
mccain said he had reviewed the fbis findings on allegations of 
drinking problems womanizing and financial irregularities and saw 
nothing to disqualify the former senator from the pentagon job 
weve been at this now for 10 weeks were starting to affect 
national security this process could go on forever we need a 
secretary of defense mccain said today 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman declined tuesday to 
say how he intends to vote saying i want to hear what other 
people think too 
sen tim wirth dcolo circulated a letter he wrote four days 
ago to the denver post in which he said he was troubled by some 
allegations against tower an aide said he had no further 
information on wirths views 
on tuesday morning bush used a news conference to announce that 
the fbi had gunned down the allegations made against tower 
what i got from it was that there has been a very unfair 
treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo over and over again 
rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up the president said 
the president said he was convinced that tower is not only 
capable of doing this job but will do it in an outstanding way 
even some of towers closest aides have conceded the former 
senator drank too much in the 1970s but insist that is no longer 
true asked about that and whether the texan had undergone 
treatment bush said i say there is no evidence of any kind of 
the disease alcoholism none none whatsoever 
within hours of bushs public embrace of tower republicans began 
echoing their president 
we ought to have a unanimous vote for tower said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo said he had a reaction of deep 
personal anger that the system which permitted so many 
unsubstantiated charges 
wallop an armed services committee member said the report 
contained lots of opinion but no place in there where there is 
corroboration documentation or any kind of substantiation 
one dissenting republican voice belonged to rep mickey edwards 
of oklahoma 
edwards said tower has lost the credibility he needs to lead the 
pentagon because he has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
consulting fees from defense contractors since leaving the senate in 
1985 i dont think that has anything to do with who hes sleeping 
with or whether he has one glass of wine before he goes to bed or 
two edwards said 
with most of the attention focused on the senate committee a 
house subcommittee called a closeddoor session for today to hear 
from berne indahl a state department security officer sources say 
indahl has told investigators previously that he learned of 
allegations of womanizing against tower when he conducted a security 
investigation in 1986 of the us delegation to arms control talks 
in geneva tower was chairman of the delegation at the time 
despite the report nunn has said previously the armed services 
committee checked out reports of towers actions in geneva and was 
satisfied there had been no security breaches

state officials have found 
potentially dangerous levels of mercury in largemouth bass from the 
everglades but are waiting for additional test results before 
issuing health warnings 
the discovery comes at the height of the season in the everglades 
and on nearby lake okeechobee one of the top bassfishing spots in 
the nation 
concentrations of the heavy metal were more than double federal 
safety guidelines the department of health and rehabilitative 
services said this week 
the samples were taken in november a second set of samples was 
requested earlier this month 
personally i dont think id eat any of those fish until the 
results come in and hrs says its safe said frank morello a 
state fisheries supervisor 
mercury can cause birth defects and affect the nervous system 
causing poor coordination numbness deafness and impairment of the 
sense of taste and smell although experts say it takes longterm 
exposure to high levels to cause problems 
additional test results will not be available for two to three 
weeks said dr thomas atkeson hrs program manager for 
environmental epidemiology 
a period of two or three weeks is not going to make a 
difference in anybodys life id like to see a more robust data set 
before making a decision he said 
officials said they dont know the source of the mercury but plan 
to look at past use of nowbanned pesticides by sugar growers 
illegal dumping of electronic components and air pollution 
hrs the state department of environmental regulation and the 
florida game and fresh water fish commission have formed a mercury 
contamination task force 
the game commission also found high levels of mercury in four 
alligators that had been killed last week for examination the 
reptiles were taken from the same everglades canals where the 
tainted fish were caught 
the first sample of nine everglades bass showed mercury levels 
ranging from 12 to 34 parts per million a second set of 15 fish 
from the same areas ranged from 15 to 275 parts per million the 
alligators tested had concentrations from 1 part per million to 237 
the federally established level for concern is 1 part per million 
if future tests show the levels to be between 05 and 15 parts 
per million a warning will be issued against eating the fish more 
than once a week said hrs spokesman steve konicki

opposition legislators on wednesday 
rejected the 470 million compensation that union carbide corp 
agreed to pay victims of the 1984 bhopal gas disaster and they 
promised to force the government to fight for more money 
survivors of the worlds worst industrial disaster marched in 
their own protest wednesday as yet another petition was filed this 
one from a social service group seeking 600 million in damages for 
death and injury caused by the lethal cloud of gas that seeped out 
of a storage tank at bhopal pesticide plant 
the 470 million was part of a settlement reached feb 14 between 
the usbased multinational and the indian government which 
originally demanded 3 billion 
is human life so cheap in this country we must accept such a 
low amount said communist party legislator saifuddin chowdhury 
our consciences are not dead and neither are those of the 
victims who are suffering but have come here to show they will not 
be humiliated he said in a special parliamentary debate 
about 2500 gas victims came to new delhi from bhopal to protest 
the settlement wednesday at the boat club a grassy expanse half a 
mile from parliament building they were supported by 500 delhi 
university students 
police prevented them from marching to parliament 
in bhopal 1000 victims marched outside the residence of chief 
minister motilal vorha of madhya pradesh state 
more than 3400 people were killed in the disaster and 20000 
more are listed as seriously affected by the leak of methyl 
isocyanate deaths attributed to it continue at the rate of at least 
one a day 
more than 500000 damage claims have been filed the latest was 
filed wednesday by the association for sociolegal literacy a 
social service group which sought a direction from the supreme court 
ordering union carbide to pay 600 million because the feb 14 order 
rendered the gas victims remediless 
unde the agreement the single payment absolves union carbide 
from any other claims in the disaster indias supreme court long 
ago dismissed criminal charges brought against the danbury 
connbased multinational 
wednesdays parliamentary debate was inconclusive 
madhu dandavate of the opposition janata party said parliament 
was the only forum that could reverse the supreme court order 
we in this house must try to compensate them victims for the 
tremendous suffering dandavate said the settlement is a total 
surrender to union carbide 
if it came to a vote legislators of the governing congress party 
vastly outnumber the opposition and have supported the governments 
argument that a settlement had to be reached quickly to help victims 
who already have suffered for four years 
congress party legislators denied charges during debate that the 
government colluded with union carbide but some agreed the figure 
of 470 million was low 
kn pradhan a legislator from bhopal who was personally 
affected by the leak said i agree the compensation is very low 
but at least it is money in hand what good would 3 billion have 
done after 20 years when the cases were finally settled and all the 
victims dead

supreme court justices sharply questioned 
attorneys wednesday who defended two holiday religious displays 
which a federal appeals court has banned from pennsylvania public 
buildings 
at issue in the case involving the line between church and state 
are a nativity scene displayed inside the main entrance of the 
allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh and a hanukkah menorah at 
another public building a block away 
the supreme courts ruling in the case expected by july may 
also provide guidance to dozens of communities uncertain about the 
legality of using public resources for christmas or hanukkah 
displays or events 
the case presents justice anthony m kennedy with his first 
opportunity to consider how high a wall the constitution requires 
between government and religion 
questions posed by the justices during arguments concerned how 
local officials could be fair to everyone while displaying christian 
and jewish symbols 
county attorney peter buscemi argued that the religious symbols 
were essentially passive and that the case presented no government 
coercion he said the constitution did not require the purging of 
religious symbols by society 
but kennedy asked are all symbols passive would a cross be 
passive 
justice antonin scalia suggested that the county had put itself 
in a difficult position by involving itself in religious symbols 
what if you had an enormous menorah and a little tiny creche 
or an enormous creche and a little tiny menorah scalia asked 
scalia also asked whether local officials by their action would 
be bound to honor requests to include symbols of other religions in 
the displays that fairness theme was echoed by several other 
justices 
how large must the religious group be to be entitled to that 
type of representation asked justice john paul stevens 
it neednt be that large replied nathan lewin an attorney 
for chabad a jewish organization that donated the menorah to the 
city 
in its case the county relies largely on a 1984 decision 
allowing communities nationwide to include nativity scenes in 
officially sponsored holiday displays 
in that ruling the high court let pawtucket ri officials 
place a creche in a christmas display because such decorations as 
santa claus reindeer and snowmen were also included 
but lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one 
and have disallowed various christmas displays deemed too religious 
american civil liberties union attorney roslyn litman argued 
wednesday that to display the nativity scene and menorah the local 
governments had taken a religious stance 
this is not accommodation this is promotion this is not 
neutrality this is favortism she said 
later in an interview she said that i think they the 
justices did seem concerned about the lack of neutrality being 
shown 
the nativity scene is part of the pennsylvania countys christmas 
carol program local officials say it is donated each year by a 
catholic mens organization which permits it to be exhibited along 
with a sign with its owners name on it 
the controversy began when the aclu asked for the removal of the 
nativity scene in 1986 by the county commissioners 
they replied that the display endorsed no particular religion 
and simply expressed the wish of good will to all men 
a later complaint filed by the aclu sought to bar city officials 
from displaying the menorah outside the citycounty building and 
the two cases were eventually combined the menorah was loaned by a 
jewish organization it sat near a christmas tree 
by 21 the 3rd us circuit court of appeals said local 
officials because of the pittsburgh displays have tacitly 
endorsed christianity and judaism and have therefore acted to 
advance religion the decision meant the displays could not be 
shown during the holiday season last year

president bush today launched a hectic 
fiveday mission to the far east his first overseas trip as 
president the white house said the journey might not generate quick 
headlines but would demonstrate that the united states is an 
asian power 
bush traded a predawn washington drizzle for a light snowfall 
here stopping to refuel en route to japan he will also make a 
weekend visit to china and a 4hour stop in south korea 
following the 7hour flight from washington the president spoke 
to several thousand airmen in blue army infantrymen in camouflage 
uniforms and schoolchildren in parkas in a huge hangar at the 
airbase he recalled that one of his predecessors president william 
harrison spoke at his inauguration for 3 hours caught pneumonia 
and was dead within a month i will be brief said bush 
the president was introduced to the friendly crowd by rep don 
young ralaska who said he wanted to welcome mr president and 
mrs president 
it is unusual for an american president to travel overseas just 
33 days after his inauguration but bush decided to go to tokyo to 
represent the united states on friday at the state funeral of 
emperor hirohito who died of cancer at the age of 87 on jan 7 
in his speech here bush noted that elmendorf was the first stop 
18 years ago in a trip that made hirohito the first emperor in 
japanese history to set foot outside his homeland 
bush said he would pay his respects in tokyo and added it is 
as well a measure of our respect for a valued ally and fellow 
democracy that i make this trip 
at each stop bush said i aim to strengthen key 
relationships with our friends and partners in the pacific region 
meanwhile however the white house released a statement by bush 
suggesting he was not interested in a usjapanese free trade 
agreement modeled after a uscanadian pact to eliminate all trade 
fees and import barriers 
bush said that tokyo and washington agree on the need for 
mulilateral and bilateral efforts to create a more open 
international trading system 
we will stress the multilateral approach bush said we are 
always open to new ideas but in our view the key now is to work 
hard for the succeess of international trade talks known as the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
his comment was made in a written response to questions submitted 
by the kyodo news service typically the responses are written by 
the national security council staff 
asked if he agreed with defense secretarydesignate john towers 
view that japan should extend its sea land defense beyond the 
present 1000mile limit bush said we are fully satisfied with 
the mutually agreed division of defense roles and missions in our 
security arrangements 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser on 
tuesday disputed suggestions that bush is making the journey before 
he has a cohesive foreign policy in place 
the president is not trying to make quick headlines 
scowcroft said he said bush wants to develop policies that will 
aid us in where we think wed like to be at the end of the century 
over the next five days bush will travel 18095 miles hell 
spend 36 hours on his plane before returning to washington on monday 
night 
because of the 14hour time difference with washington bush will 
arrive in tokyo at about 1 pm local time on thursday with much of 
the work day ahead of him however his body clock will tell him 
that its 11 pm wednesday at home 
the trip gives bush an opportunity to highlight the american 
profile in asia before a dramatic new chapter in sinosoviet 
relations in may soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will go to 
beijing for talks with chinese leader deng xiaoping the first such 
summit in 30 years 
hirohitos funeral is expected to draw representatives of 154 
countries including 55 heads of state 
taking advantage of the gathering bush will hold more than a 
dozen 15to 30minute meetings in tokyo with kings presidents and 
prime ministers from around the world 
scowcroft said bush will meet with the leaders of egypt israel 
jordan singapore pakistan thailand west germany france 
belgium turkey brazil and nigeria more meetings will be added 
were going to try to see as many as possible so the substance 
will not be extensive scowcroft said he said there will not be 
any decisionmaking meetings 
however the national security adviser said it is important for 
the leaders to have a facetoface opportunity to get at least out 
on the table a few issues for discussions 
after two nights in tokyo bush will fly to beijing where he 
spent 16 months beginning in the fall of 1974 as the us diplomatic 
envoy bush said recently that on a nostalgic basis needless to 
say barbara and i are looking forward in a very personal way to 
going back to beijing 
in beijing bush will confer with chinas four top leaders 
including deng president yang shangkun communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang and premier li peng 
the president will spend two nights in beijing and then fly to 
seoul for a stop of less than five hours scowcroft said bush will 
underscore the partnership of our two countries the solid 
security relationship and our appreciation for the flowering of 
democracy by our old ally 
even so with antiamericanism on the rise in south korea there 
is a good chance of demonstrations in seoul during bushs brief stay

workers at mexican factories just across 
the us border are routinely exposed to toxins because of vague and 
littleenforced safety and environmental laws labor leaders were 
told wednesday 
a report to the aflcio executive council blamed both the us 
and mexican governments for the problems saying mexico has been 
tardy in regulating workplace safety while the united states has 
ignored the abuses because the area is attractive to american 
corporations looking for cheap labor and scant government regulation 
both countries must undertake a massive effort to address this 
alarming situation said the report which prompted a council 
resolution condemning the situation and demanding action from both 
governments 
the study looked at the nearly 800 maquiladoras employing 
approximately 300000 mexicans in the rio grande the term spanish 
for golden twins refers to plants operated by foreign 
corporations most of them american 
the report said that many workers are exposed to toxic chemicals 
such as pcbs and that many locals drink contaminated water from 
storage drums that once held hazardous materials 
communities that get their drinking water from the area have 
unusually high cancer rates and much of the waste that by law 
should be returned to the united states for dumping instead is 
disposed of in mexico the report said 
environmental problems associated with illegal and improper 
dumping of toxins have spilled over into bordering communites in 
texas and california the report said citing californias polluted 
new river as a prime example 
but american companies dont seem deterred it said they 
see increasing opportunity to capitalize on cheap labor and to 
escape stringent health safety and environmental regulations in 
this country by shifting operations to mexico 
the problems are complicated because the operations based in the 
region are those that typically produce dangerous waste such as the 
chemical and electronics industry said the report by leslie kochan 
an oregon department of environmental quality official who formerly 
worked on environmental issues for the texas center for policy study 
in addition the factories are also rife with abuses of workers 
including wages of as little as 290 a day and working conditions 
that resemble the sweatshops of the late 19th and early 20th 
century the report said 
workers often are denied information about the hazardous 
substances they handle and work without protective clothing and 
equipment the report said

the supreme court ruling against a child who 
suffered brain damage from repeated beatings by his father said 
wednesday states generally may not be sued even if they negligently 
fail to shield people from abuse by others 
the 63 decision said public officials have no constitutional 
duty to protect those who are not in state custody the court said 
there is no legal recourse even in the undeniably tragic case 
where officials were aware of the beatings but did not intervene 
the court killed a lawsuit in behalf of joshua deshaney a 
wisconsin boy who since age 4 has been profoundly retarded and is 
expected to remain institutionalized for the rest of his life 
child welfare officials and the state were sued by joshuas 
mother melody deshaney on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty 
without due process 
but chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court 
said nothing in the language of the due process clause itself 
requires the state to protect the life liberty and property of its 
citizens against invasion by private actors 
because the state had no constitutional duty to protect 
joshua against his fathers violence its failure to do so though 
calamitous in hindsight simply does not constitute a violation of 
the due process clause he said 
in an unusual emotional dissent justice harry a blackmun 
exclaimed poor joshua it is a sad commentary upon american life 
and constitutional principles that this child joshua deshaney 
now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundly 
retarded and without an opportunity to sue the state 
blackmun accused the court of sterile formalism for failing 
to grant joshua and his mother an opportunty to seek damages from 
the state 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall also dissented 
brennan said my disagreement with the court arises from its 
failure to see that inaction can be every bit as abusive of power as 
action that oppression can result when a state undertakes a vital 
duty and then ignores it 
rehnquist rejected arguments that the state had a duty to protect 
joshua because it once had given him shelter and because social 
workers suspected he was being abused 
only when the state takes a person into its custody and holds 
him there against his will does the constitution require officials 
to take responsibility for the individuals safety and wellbeing 
rehnquist said 
while the state may have been aware of the dangers that joshua 
faced in the free world it played no part in their creation nor did 
it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them he said 
the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an 
individuals safety by having once offered him shelter rehnquist 
added 
he was joined by justices byron r white john paul stevens 
sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
the suit in joshuas behalf was filed against the winnebago 
county wis department of social services and two of its employees 
the boy first came to the attention of the welfare agency when he 
was brought to a hospital in 1983 at age 4 with cuts and bruises 
joshua was returned to the custody of his father randy deshaney 
of neenah wis and a social worker ann kemmeter was assigned to 
the case 
the boys mother had divorced deshaney and was living in 
cheyenne wyo at the time 
ms kemmeter visited the deshaney home numerous times including 
on march 7 1984 when she was told that several days earlier joshua 
had fainted in the bathroom for no apparent reason according to 
court records she did not ask to see the boy after being told he 
was asleep 
the following day joshua was treated at a hospital for head 
injuries that destroyed half his brain 
ms kemmeter later said i just knew the phone would ring some 
day and joshua would be dead 
the boys father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 
two to four years in prison he was freed on parole after serving 
less than two years 
in another case the high court said states may not prohibit 
political party leaders from endorsing primary election candidates 
by a vote of 80 the court said such a california law impermissibly 
infringes constitutionally protected freedom of speech 
the court also struck down california laws limiting the terms of 
office for party leaders and dictating the makeup of state party 
central committees 
the court also heard arguments in a pittsburgh case over the 
validity of religious displays in government buildings a decision 
is expected by july

members of congress testified today that a 
federal commissions sweeping plan to close 86 military bases and 
partly close five more fails to meet the costeffective goals the 
panel had set 
the members also told the house armed services subcommittee on 
military installations and facilities that they had difficulty 
obtaining information on which the commission based its decisions 
our request for detailed documentation of their findings 
resulted in their sending us a twoinch paper trail with much of the 
pertinent information deleted said sen bill bradley dnj who 
testified on the commissions recommendation to put his states fort 
dix on semiactive status 
unless the department of defense provides the new jersey 
delegation with the facts that back up their decision i will be 
forced to conclude that the commissions report was based on shoddy 
research and that their recommendations are an insult to congress 
bradley said in a prepared statement 
under the commissions plan the government would save 56 
billion over 20 years with the closure of 86 bases the partial 
closure of five and the transfer of operations to 54 other bases 
former defense secretary frank c carlucci approved the plan last 
month congress has 45 days after march 1 to either block the plan 
or allow it to go into effect 
joining bradley was sen frank lautenberg dnj who said the 
decision to reduce fort dix to semiactive status is pennywise and 
pound foolish 
the government has invested 160 million to upgrade fort dix 
since 1980 including 69 million this past year for range 
modernization and a new maintenance shop lautenberg said in a 
statement 
all told 22 members of congress testified before the committee 
about plans to close or reduce bases in their states or districts 
with many saying they had to file freedom of information requests to 
obtain information on the base closing recommendations 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the subcommittee 
said that after the hearings members may still object to the 
closing of certain bases but they ought to be able to do so with a 
complete understanding of why the commission recommended what it 
did 
rep ed madigan rill said the closing of chanute air force 
base in eastern illinois would have a devastating impact on the 
rural area of the state 
and he added for national security reasons i do not have any 
faith in a report that recommends closure of the only base which 
provides minuteman missile maintenance training i do not have faith 
in a report that so falsely states that there would only be a 
moderate economic impact 
closing of the chanute air force base would result in a loss of 
1139 military jobs and 1681 civilian jobs and an estimated 
savings of 687 million annually according to the commissions 
report 
rep terry bruce dill cited the construction of new 
facilities at the base including a weather training facility cold 
storage facility and a regional waste water treatment facility 
all construction of these projects occured within the last six 
years with a price tag of over 66 million bruce said this 
construction would have to be duplicated at the receiving bases 
should chanute be closed 
rep barbara boxer dcalif said according to her estimates 
plans to close the presidio in san francisco will cost the 
taxpayer 26 million more per year to maintain presidio park and the 
6th army at fort carson in colorado and to provide health care to 
military retirees in san francisco than it does now 
closure hurts rather than helps our efforts to cut the 
deficit boxer said

big city life has certain drawbacks whether 
your home is new york city or moscow according to a recent joint 
survey of residents of those and other metropolises 
for instance 33 percent of muscovites and 38 percent of new 
yorkers said they were afraid to go out alone at night on the street 
where they lived 
in addition 38 percent of the moscow residents were unhappy with 
their public transportation as were 36 percent of those surveyed in 
new york twothirds of the muscovites and 64 percent of the new 
yorkers gave their local schools a grade of c d or f 
surveys of sentiments in moscow new york boston detroit and 
san francisco were sponsored by american news media from those 
cities and conducted in moscow with the help of the soviet institute 
of sociology results were reported in late january and early 
february by the sponsoring news organizations 
soviet and american polling experts held a briefing here 
wednesday to shed light on such mysteries as why virtually none of 
the muscovites owned up to heavy drinking and why 17 percent never 
heard of the marxist leader of nicaragua 
about 1000 people each were surveyed by telephone in december in 
moscow and new york and 600 in each of the other us cities the 
surveys had a threepoint margin of error for the moscow and new 
york results and four points for the other cities 
several american reporters veterans of moscow assignments who 
recalled lines outside staterun liquor stores questioned the 
credibility of any survey that depicted muscovites as abstemious 
when asked how often they drank alcohol not even 1 percent of 
the moscow residents said they drank almost every day 5 percent 
responded once or twice a week 17 percent said once or twice a 
month 41 percent said several times a year and 36 percent said 
never 
by contrast 12 percent of the san franciscans 9 percent of 
bostonians 6 percent of new yorkers and 5 percent of detroiters 
owned up to drinking almost daily 
nobody accepted the not drinking figures from moscow on 
face value said john marttila of the boston polling firm of 
marttila amp kiley inc which undertook the surveys with market 
opinion research 
elena bashkirova of the institute of sociology in moscow said the 
soviet antialcoholism drive may be working she also suggested that 
soviets may drink on fewer occasions than americans but more 
heavily 
the surveys found that 67 to 79 percent of the us citizens said 
they were very proud to be americans and 18 to 22 percent of 
the rest were quite proud of their country in moscow 39 
percent said they were very proud to be a soviet citizen and 38 
percent were quite proud 
sixtynine percent of the muscovites said they never went out to 
dinner at a restaurant only 4 to 7 percent of the americans said 
they never dined out a third to a half of the americans said they 
dined out once or twice a week compared with 2 percent of the 
muscovites 
twentythree percent of the muscovites never heard of irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 25 percent never heard of pope john 
paul ii 38 percent knew nothing of libyas moammar gadhafi and 17 
percent were in the dark about nicaraguas daniel ortega 
that surprised us most of all with the level of attention to 
daniel ortega who is every day on soviet television news or mass 
media said bashkirovas colleague valeriy korobeinikov it shows 
people set their own priorities when listening to world news he 
said 
the surveys were funded by the new york daily news wcbstv and 
wcbs radio in new york wcvbtv in boston the detroit free press 
and krontv in san francisco

the federal bureau of investigation on 
wednesday decried the university of michigan law schools decision 
to ban fbi recruiters for a year because a judge found that the 
agency had discriminated against hispanic agents 
we feel very frustrated in this process said milt ahlerich 
assistant fbi director for congressional and public affairs how 
are we to strengthen how are we to get top quality fbi agents 
on board if we are not allowed to come on to top quality campuses 
lee bollinger dean of the university of michigan law school 
said wednesday that he imposed the ban in december which will last 
through the end of the school year in may after several students 
noted that the fbi was being sued in texas by hispanic agents over 
discrimination 
the students said it was in violation of our placement 
antidiscrimination policy for such an organization to be allowed 
to recruit at the school bollinger said 
he said he wrote to fbi director william sessions about it in 
september and almost as soon as he sent the letter the judge in 
texas ruled in favor of the hispanic agents 
this was systemic discrimination not just a single 
situation bollinger said 
sessions wrote him back saying the fbi does not discriminate and 
asking that the agency be allowed to come to the law school to 
recruit bollinger said in december bollinger wrote sessions 
again saying that for this academic year we would not allow our 
facilities to be used by the fbi 
he has still not responded to the dec 19 letter the dean 
said 
francis x beytagh the dean of the ohio state university law 
school told the washington post for a story in wednesdays editions 
that that school imposed a ban on fbi personnel recruiting on campus 
but allowed it to continue distributing employment information 
however ahlerich said the situation at that law school had not 
changed 
we were not on campus doing recruiting meetings before he 
said adding that the fbi has regular contact with the placement 
office there and meets with those seeking jobs at an offcampus 
office 
when the ohio law school expressed concerns we wrote them a 
letter that explained to them our policy he said the 
recruiting practices there have not changed at all 
what triggered the university of michigan law school limitations 
on fbi recruitment was a successful discrimination lawsuit filed by 
fbi agent bernardo matias perez on behalf of 311 hispanic agents 
us district judge lucius d bunton who found last september that 
the fbi had discriminated against the hispanic agents is holding a 
hearing to determine how much the fbi should pay them as 
compensation for denial of promotions and assignments to unrewarding 
and hazardous duties the agents are seeking 92 million 
ahlerich noted that several university of michigan campuses 
including the ann arbor campus where the law school is located 
allow oncampus recruiting by the fbi but he urged the law school 
officials to revisit their decision 
law schools are important to the fbi out of 9500 onboard 
special agents approximately 1300 are lawtrained he said 
we believe that agent applicants that have law training are 
particularly wellsuited to the special agent position he said 
if the bureau is to be sensitive and particularly able to handle 
challenges of sophisticated crime problems that we have in this 
country today including handling of civil rights investigations we 
need very capable sensitive applicants and lawyers fill that role 
in many instances 
over the past three years the fbi has hired about 1855 special 
agents of whom about 320 or 17 percent are trained in law 
according to figures provided by ahlerich 
he said he knows of only one agent who was graduated from the 
university of michigan law school

white house budget director richard darman 
attacked by democrats for playing games when the deficit must be 
cut refused wednesday to reveal president bushs policies on a wide 
swath of domestic programs 
darman repeatedly declined to say what spending levels bush 
wanted next year for programs such as care for poor pregnant women 
veterans education mass transit or even the job training 
partnership act the bill bush cited in choosing dan quayle for his 
vice presidential running mate 
president bushs position is that he wants to negotiate the 
answer to that and you dont like that apparently he told rep 
barbara boxer dcalif during one particularly testy exchange 
during his testimony before the house budget committee 
boxer demanding specifics said that while some of the 
initiatives in the 116 trillion budget bush presented on feb 9 
sounded good we havent really seen the bad parts 
bush placed 136 billion in programs mostly domestic agencies 
together in a flexible freeze with no increase to cover rising 
costs and without endorsing increases or cuts on any particular 
program so long as the total remained the same 
boxer complained that bushs fiscal 1990 budget appeared to 
reward the military establishment with full inflation while you 
kill domestic programs 
darman responded that boxer was applying a double standard 
judging military programs as increased when they go up with 
inflation but calling domestic programs cut when they dont keep 
that pace 
the presidents budget has it the other way around military 
programs were deemed frozen when they were boosted to cover 
inflationary costs domestic programs were frozen when they had no 
increase at all 
darman denied that the hundreds of programs in the 
administrations flexible freeze category were ones that bush 
doesnt care about we just dont care as intensely he said 
budget committee chairman leon panetta criticized darman for 
outlining options but not bush choices in the hundreds of pages of 
documents he was presenting to congress 
there have been too many games played with the deficit issue in 
the past panetta said my concern is when you strip the 
rhetoric aside some of the same games are being played 
he cited optimistic economic forecasts and the assumption that 
congress was going to approve new government fees and selloffs of 
government assets that it has rejected in the past 
darman repeated his request that congress join in negotiations 
with the administration why wait why dont we start right 
away he said 
but panetta said what you have presented may not help 
negotiations it may hurt negotiations 
congress has a deadline of april 15 to produce a final budget

on both sides 
iraq released 255 iranians last month

an american vietnam war veteran who 
recently accompanied a group of us high school students to vietnam 
says the united states owes the vietnamese development assistance 
our knowledge of history heavily tainted with hindsight enables 
veterans like myself as well as civilians to realize that we made 
some very big mistakes as a country said tim porta 44 owner of a 
resort hotel in maine 
we owe it now to the vietnamese people to establish this 
infrastructure that will enable them to go it alone it has to be 
done and really come from the heart and without strings 
attached porta said in an interview tuesday he suggested the 
united states could help pay for badly needed roads 
porta traveled to vietnam with his 18yearold son michael one 
of 17 students on a twoweek educational tour that began feb 2 in 
vietnam the students toured schools and discussed usvietnamese 
relations 
the vietnamese have the intellect the desire tremendous drive 
and 10 years of exposure to a race of people that were light years 
ahead of them and then all of a sudden it went out like a light in 
1975 and then they were left with nothing the elder porta said 
trip organizer stephen knight a history teacher from fairfield 
maine said american textbooks on vietnam were inadequate and that 
traveling was the best way to learn 
as a teacher i would hope that they get a better understanding 
of the problems of the world how poor people are how hard they 
have to work for a living said knight adding that the students 
kept journals during their stay in vietnam 
the students have been studying about vietnam for a year in a 
specially accredited history class taught by knight the students 
averaging about 17 in age came from lawrence high school 
messalonskee high school skowhegan high school waterville high 
school and waynflete high school all in the portland maine area 
despite common complaints about rough toilet paper dirty 
bathrooms and unclean drinking water the students described their 
trip as valuable experience 
i just wanted to see how the people live said michael porta 
even though they dont have a whole lot in their lives a whole 
lot thats positive or to look forward to it seems like the people 
are content happy with what little they do have whereas in america 
everyone wants more 
sixteenyearold heidi holmes said americans have a mirrored 
view from what veterans have told them things are more vivid if you 
see them and learn them for yourself 
college student kevin cloutier 21 who joined the tour said 
americans should bury the past 
i think the americans feel they have to dwell on the war dwell 
on the people who were in the war and our policies even though the 
war is over he said 
we still have to try to analyze what we did over there while 
the vietnamese want to forget that and let bygones by bygones and 
continue the future as friends not enemies cloutier added 
the americans left bangkok on wednesday for home

the energy department cannot complete a major 
analysis of its three idled tritium production reactors at savannah 
river sc before the first one is ready to be restarted a 
department adviser told congress on wednesday 
its probably going to take a lot longer than a year to prove 
that the reactors can safely withstand the most serious plausible 
accident they are expected to face john ahearne told the energy and 
power subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
ahearne a former member of the nuclear regulatory commission is 
chairman of the departments advisory committee on nuclear 
facilities safeguards 
department officials have testified in other hearings that they 
hoped to restart one of the reactors by the end of 1989 this 
restart date has been getting later and later at one point last 
fall the department was saying it hoped to restart one reactor by 
the end of 1988 
when all the other work is complete the secretary of energy will 
have to decide whether to permit the restart weighing the need for 
tritium against the incompleteness of the analysis 
tritium is an essential ingredient in many of the nations 
nuclear weapons it must be replenished every few years because 55 
percent of any starting amount decays in the course of a year just 
when the power of the weapons would decay to an unacceptable point 
is a secret but the boston globe recently reported that pentagon 
officials had said an 18month or twoyear pause in tritium 
production might be tolerable 
the department ordered the savannah river reactors closed last 
year for safety and management upgrading after the operator du pont 
co brought the only active one into full operation at half power 
despite an unexplained power surge during startup 
the most serious plausible accident is what the civilian nuclear 
power industry calls the design basis accident that is the 
worst accident the plant designers have taken into account 
such a hypothetical accident would vary according to the plant 
design and site for instance in one place it might be a tornado 
in another it might be an earthquake 
the savannah river reactors are supposed to be able to shut down 
safely on emergency cooling even if they suffer a double 
guillotine break of a main cooling system pipe a complete break 
in two places that removes a section of pipe and cuts normal coolant 
flow to zero 
until recently ahearne said they have not had the analytical 
capability in the department to prove by calculation that the 
reactors would be safe in such a case 
in 1986 the department cut reactor operations to 75 percent of 
full power because of uncertainty that such a break could be 
handled after a national research council report calling attention 
to the uncertainties the following year power was limited to 50 
percent 
my conclusion is i dont think they are going to have the 
analysis done when theyr ready to restart and thats where the 
subjective judgment of the secretary comes in ahearne said in 
an interview after the hearing 
the nuclear regulatory commission sometimes has permitted 
civilian power plants to start operation before the analysis of the 
design basis accident has been completed if it judged the 
probability of such a accident sufficiently low ahearne said 
its not that unusual in the commercial world he said 
such an analysis is enormously complicated mathematically and 
sometimes cannot be completed until computer models are checked 
against experiments in actual scale models of sections of the 
reactor piping 
chris sankey spokeswoman for the energy department said 
department officials wanted to give james watkins nominated to be 
energy secretary a chance after his expected confirmation to get up 
to speed on all restart issues before it addresses comments like 
ahearnes

a health research group on thursday called for 
a halt to experiments with narcoticlaced lollipops given to 
children to calm them before surgery saying that giving drugs in 
the form of candy sends a dangerous message 
but doctors defended their experiments with the sedative and 
discounted the potential for increased drug abuse they said their 
studies have found that delivering the narcotic fentanyl in a 
lollipop instead of with a needle is less stressful and traumatic 
for children about to undergo general anesthesia 
in this setting a onetime occurence i dont believe that 
were going to be putting the subliminal message into childrens 
heads that candy equals drugs said dr lawrence feld a pediatric 
anesthesiologist at californias stanford university medical center 
who headed one of the studies 
its something that we always have to consider with any kind of 
drug he said in an interview thursday we looked at the risk 
and the benefits and consider it drug abuse potential to be a 
nonissue 
public citizen health research group in a letter to the food and 
drug administration said offering the sedative in lollipop form 
sends children a dangerous message about drugs being candy and 
is of dubious clinical need or safety 
sidney m wolfe director of the health research group said 
giving lollipops laced with a powerful narcotic to children who 
in the words of one research group visibly enjoyed the 
premedication experience as one might expect children sucking 
lollipops to do is a major step in the wrong direction 
fentanyl has been approved by the fda as an injectable drug in 
the studies it is mixed into a hard candy mounted on a stick and 
given to children to suck on before they undergo general anesthesia 
or a painful diagnostic procedure 
the fda has not approved the oral form of the drug except for use 
in the controlled experiments anesta corp of salt lake city 
formed by anesthesiologists and the university of utah to test and 
develop the oral form said the studies began 3 years ago and will 
continue for a year or two more before the company seeks approval to 
market oral fentanyl commercially 
wolfe said approving oral use of the drug which is far stronger 
than morphine and he said is a favorite drug of abuse among 
anesthesiologists and street users would likely increase drug 
abuse 
jeffrey blumer a pediatric pharmacologist at case western 
reserve university school of medicine in ohio who also signed the 
letter to the fda seeking a halt in the studies said the narcotic 
could be administered by means other than injection or lollipop 
such as rectally or through the nose 
in lollipop form he said were giving drugs in a formulation 
that make them attractive to children 
but william moeller president of anesta said the oral form of 
the drug has advantages over sedatives delivered by needle it 
reduces stress in children who are about to undergo anesthesia 
instead of fearing an injection the child simply sucks on the 
lollipop and dozes off and a calm patient is delivered for 
anesthesia also the drugs analgesic properties reduce trauma in 
the patient by reducing the heart rate and blood pressure during the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure he said 
its another way a better way of being able to premedicate and 
induce anesthesia in children said dr theodore stanley an 
anesthesiology professor at the university of utah school of 
medicine and originator of the oral form of fentanyl its less 
stressful and makes anesthesia safer 
the fda discounted concerns about fentanyl lollipops increasing 
drug abuse fda spokesman bill grigg said 
we just dont see any reason to think in doctors hands this 
would lead to any abuse but all those issues would be explored 
before a product was approved 
more than 400 people mostly children have been part of the 
study experiments have been completed at the university of utah 
medical center the university of texas medical center in houston 
and stanford university medical center and other studies are in 
progress at other medical centers moeller declined to identify

a namibian union leader said 
wednesday his compatriots remain deeply suspicious of south african 
intentions in the mineral rich territory despite an independence 
plan set to begin april 1 
namibians can smell their independence in the air said ben 
ulenga general secretary of the powerful mineworkers union of 
namibia 
but he added given the past treachery of the south african 
apartheid regime namibians are very cautious and vigilant 
south africa which has ruled namibia for 74 years is to begin 
implementing a united nations independence plan april 1 leading to 
elections early in november 
officials of the southwest african peoples organization the 
guerrilla movement that has waged a 22year war for independence 
says the south african government is actively working against an 
election victory for them and will attempt to destabilize the 
territory 
namibias future is tied up with events in south africa said 
ulenga a swapo member if the apartheid regime is in power 
indefinitely there will be very little chance for peace and 
stability in namibia 
ulenga who spent nine years in a south african prison for his 
guerrilla activities spoke at a meeting sponsored by tribute 
magazine a blackoriented monthly published in south africa 
swapo is favored to win the elections but has not detailed its 
political and economic policies 
swapo leader sam nujoma has said the organization favors a 
socialist economy but says he foresees a mixed economy initially 
and does not intend to embark immediately on widespread 
nationalization 
the organization has not made clear whether a swapo government 
would tolerate opposition parties such as members of the current 
transitional government 
we can never forget about those who have been working in close 
cooperation with the south africans said ulenga reconciliation 
does not mean condoning the crimes of apartheid the crimes of 
collaboration with apartheid he said of the system of legalized 
race discrimination 
mwilima kupuzo a black namibian serving in the 
soontobedisbanded interim parliament said a swapo government 
will seek to create a oneparty state dedicated to socialism 
kupuzo in the audience while ulenga spoke accused swapo of 
intimidating people into supporting the group 
he represents the democratic turnhalle alliance a multiracial 
coalition that favors a multiparty democracy and free enterprise 
the alliance holds the largest number of seats in the transitional 
government which was established by south africa in 1985 as an 
interim step to independence swapo was banned so it could not 
contest elections

a former mississippi sheriff on wednesday 
said he sued the makers of the movie mississippi burning for 8 
million because they have done me terrible harm and they ought to 
face up to it 
everybody all over the south knows the one they have playing 
the sheriff in that movie is referring to me said lawrence 
rainey 65 who on tuesday filed a libel suit against orion pictures 
in federal court in meridian 
the critically acclaimed movie which has received seven academy 
award nominations is based on the 1964 slayings of three civil 
rights workers in neshoba county rainey was sheriff at the time 
bill bernstein a spokesman for orion in new york said the movie 
maker had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it 
rainey who now works for a blackowned security firm in 
meridian said the character of the sheriff in the film made it 
appear he failed to carry out his responsibilities and was a 
terrible person 
the deaths of michael schwerner james chaney and andrew goodman 
prompted an fbi investigation that led to conspiracy charges against 
18 men including rainey who was acquitted 
in the film the character sheriff stucky is a backwoods lawman 
who disliked blacks stucky is depicted as someone who did not 
participate in the actual killings but helped protect those 
responsible by not investigating 
the charges against rainey followed much the same line with 
officials alleging the sheriff and others conspired to violate the 
civil rights of the victims 
what they said happened and what they did to me certainly 
wasnt right and something ought to be done about it rainey said 
he has said he was innocent of any coverup carried out his 
responsibilities and was not a racist he said he would have never 
made the remarks attributed to the sheriff in the film 
his attorney james g mcintyre who defended rainey in the 1967 
conspiracy trial said he received no response from orion to his 
demand several weeks ago that it correct what he described as 
untruths in the film 
the movie directed by alan parker and starring gene hackman and 
willem dafoe has been criticized by some civil rights activists who 
say it maligns blacks and inaccurately portrays the fbi agents as 
heroes

antiapartheid groups said 
wednesday police officials are exploiting the criminal investigation 
of winnie mandelas bodyguards to create divisions in the black 
community 
activists said police even offered to pay for the funeral of 
14yearold stompie seipei who allegedly was beaten at mrs 
mandelas home in december 
seipeis decomposed body was found in january and two of mrs 
mandelas bodyguards were charged with the killing monday 
police are trying to divide the black community and blame 
stompies death on frictions in black groups said lister skosana 
of the tumahole civic association an antigovernment community 
group from seipeis hometown in central south africa 
the teenagers death is at the center of a growing scandal 
surrounding the wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela and a group of unofficial bodyguards calling 
themselves the mandela united soccer club they lived at her home in 
soweto the sprawling black township outside johannesburg 
one team member jabu sithole and selfdescribed team coach 
jerry richardson have been charged with the killing of seipei and 
abductions and beatings of three other men 
antiapartheid leaders last week accused mandela united of waging 
a reign of terror renounced mrs mandela and urged their 
followers not to associate with her they accused her of 
complicity in the abductions and beatings 
joyce seipei the dead boys mother said at a news conference 
that police offered to pay for his funeral but she declined to 
accept 
police spokesman col steve van rooyen denied police offered to 
pay 
police usually place tight restrictions on funerals of political 
activists limiting the number of mourners to 200 and the ceremony 
to three hours 
skosana said police promised mrs seipei there will be no 
restrictions on her sons funeral saturday van rooyen said he was 
unaware of any restrictions 
police usually are reluctant to comment on investigations and 
court cases but they repeatedly have volunteered information in the 
events surrounding mrs mandela 
when they raided her house sunday they were accompanied by a 
crew from the state television network the video film showed mrs 
mandela in a nightgown and richardson pulling on a pair of pants 
after being awakened and arrested 
mrs seipei refused to comment about mrs mandela saying through 
an interpreter i have not met her and i dont want to meet her 
the african national congress said it believes mandela united was 
infiltrated by the enemy a reference to the south african 
government 
the exiled guerrilla movement based in zambia said it 
previously had urged mrs mandela to disband the group but she had 
refused 
she was left open and vulnerable to committing mistakes which 
the enemy exploited the statement said 
police sometimes boast publicly about their ability to infiltrate 
opposition groups van rooyen declined to comment when asked if 
informers were active in mandela united

the state department said wednesday it regrets 
a lack of progress in informal peace talks on cambodia and called on 
vietnam and authorities in phnom penh to make a major effort to 
address seriously the remaining issues including formation of an 
interim government 
president bush is expected to take up the cambodia matter in his 
talks this weekend with the chinese in beijing said department 
spokesman charles e redman who spoke as bush began a trip to 
japan china and south korea 
redman declining to offer details of bushs planned discussions 
was asked to comment on the end of the latest round of informal 
peace talks among factions seeking power in cambodia 
the talks deadlocked over formation of a provisional government 
to rule in phonm pen until elections can be held and little 
progress was made on establishing a timetable for ending the 
vietnamese occupation 
the chinese supply military aid to the khmer rouge the largest 
faction in a threeparty opposition coalition battling the 
vietnamesesupported government the united states supplies 
nonlethal aid the two noncommunist factions in the coalition 
followers of former head of state prince sihanouk and the khmer

through hanoi moscow supports vietnams occupation of cambodia 
we regret that more progress was not made at the second jakarta 
informal meeting toward achieving an acceptable and comprehensive 
settlement redman said of the peace talks held in indonesia 
redman called on vietnam and the authorities in phnom penh to 
make a major effort to address seriously the remaining issues 
particularly the formation of an interim government preceding 
elections in cambodia and the participation of an international 
presence sufficiently strong to carry out its duties in support of a 
settlement 
while redman did not define what he meant by an international 
presence there have been calls for an international peacekeeping 
force to oversee the withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
he said the united states supports a comprehensive agreement 
to ensure a lasting solution in cambodia 
he argued that sihanouks role was crucial as leader of an 
interim government preceding elections and as the focus for national 
unity 
redman restated us support for the verified and complete 
withdrawal of all vietnamese forces effective safeguards against a 
khmer rouge return to power and restoration of genuine 
selfdetermination to the cambodian people 
he said the united states is involved in close active and 
regular consultations regarding a cambodian settlement with the 
soviet union china the governments of the association of southeast 
asian nations and the noncommunist opposition groups 
we are prepared to support those practical and reasonable 
measures which will help achieve the goal of a free independent 
and peaceful cambodia redman said 
cambodian guerrilla leader prince norodom ranariddh son of 
prince sihanouk has called for the united states to become more 
involved in the negotiations to end the conflict in cambodia 
ranariddh also has told reporters that he believes the impasse 
over cambodia may only be broken after the may summit in beijing 
between soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and chinese leader deng 
xiaoping

james d watkins the designated energy 
secretary told congress wednesday he would assemble within six 
months the nucleus of a new management team to shake up a nuclear 
weapons complex desperately in need of change 
the retired admiral in seeking to become the first career 
military man to head the energy department since it was created in 
1977 also vowed to tackle an array of conventional energy problems 
including growing dependence on foreign oil 
watkins won warm praise from nearly every member of the senate 
energy and natural resources committee during his three hours of 
testimony j bennett johnston dla the committee chairman set a 
vote on the nomination for next wednesday 
watkins 61 spent four decades in the navy capping his career 
with a fouryear stint as chief of naval operations in 1987 he led 
a presidential aids commission to a series of widely praised 
recommendations on what to do about the deadly disease 
he was closely associated with the navys nuclear program but has 
no experience in the conventional energy field which he has called 
his achilles heel 
you come to us with a certain luster said sen howard m 
metzenbaum dohio a strong critic of the energy departments 
handling of the 17site complex in 12 states that develops produces 
and tests the nations nuclear weapons 
the weapons plants key parts of which were built in the 1940s 
and 1950s to develop the worlds first atomic bombs have been 
breaking down in recent months exposing flaws in safety procedures 
technical standards and management widespread contamination of soil 
and groundwater also has been discovered estimates for correcting 
the problems range from 81 billion to 155 billion 
problems relating to safety health and the environment have 
not only been backlogged to intolerable levels but in effect 
hidden from public view until recently watkins said 
he called the energy departments management system antique 
out of date and desperately in need of change he said he 
would put together the fundamental embryo of a new management 
team to impose major changes on the nuclear complex 
the weapons plants are run for the energy department by private 
contractors watkins said the department historically has put too 
much emphasis on meeting nuclear production goals at the expense of 
safety and the environment 
i will organize a management team that understands how to 
motivate people how to achieve and reward excellence and how to 
reject and deal firmly and fairly and swiftly with incompetence 
watkins said 
under the existing department management there is little risk 
in being careless little incentive to excel he said adding that 
he would seek to instill a work attitude that would allow the 
department to regain its public credibility 
watkins was not asked whether he supports the departments 
existing blueprint for modernizing and cleaning up the nuclear 
weapons complex that report issued shortly before president reagan 
left office last month proposed a series of controversial actions 
to revitalize the complex over the next 21 years it put the cleanup 
and modernization cost at 81 billion over that period 
on other subjects watkins said he would 
seek to limit the nations reliance on foreign oil by promoting 
a wide array of actions including using federal funds to develop 
the technology to burn clean coal open up more federal lands to 
oil exploration and give oil drillers new tax breaks 
support efforts mainly by private industry to develop 
methanol or wood alcohol as an alternative to gasoline this would 
sharply reduce the need for crude oil 
try to increase the pool of talent in the energy department and 
to promote creativity in its staff he said his number one 
objective was leading the department to higher standards of 
personal excellence among the work force

david duke a former grand wizard of the 
ku klux klan overcame two lastminute challenges and was sworn into 
the louisiana legislature on wednesday as black lawmakers vowed to 
keep an eye on him 
duke took the oath of office after surviving a lawsuit and an 
attempt by a lawmaker to deny him his house seat in a dispute over 
whether duke was a legal resident of his suburban new orleans 
district which is 996 percent white 
i want to allay fears that i will be divisive or a problem in 
this great body duke told his new colleagues i truly believe 
when we took the pledge of allegiance this morning and we said 
justice for all i believe in that for america 
and i believe that discrimination is wrong and reprehensible 
when it is waged against anyone black or white in this country 
duke 38 smiled broadly and waved before speaker jim dimos 
administered the oath which followed an attempt by rep odon bacque 
to have the house investigate whether duke lived in the metairie 
district a year as required by law opponents have said duke lives a 
couple of blocks outside the district 
earlier wednesday john treen a 63yearold metairie homebuilder 
who fell to duke by 227 votes in saturdays special election lost a 
lastminute lawsuit in state court to block duke from being seated 
for not meeting the residency requirement 
duke also was accepted by the house republicans as one of their 
own despite a move by national party chairman lee atwater to 
repudiate him as a member of the gop an antiduke resolution was 
drawn up tuesday for action on friday by the gop executive council 
president bush and former president reagan had taken the 
extraordinary step of throwing their support to treen a longtime 
republican duke who ran for president in 1988 as a democrat 
joined the gop just a few days before declaring his candidacy for 
the house seat 
duke was cheered by supporters who packed the house chamber on 
wednesday some lined up along the side of the house floor and 
others grabbed seats in the balcony dukes entourage booed house 
members who rose to object to the swearingin but dimos banged his 
gavel and threatened to expel them 
two black house members walked out when duke was sworn in 
this a democracy and no one is above those laws bacque told 
the house the question before us today is is mr duke eligible 
to serve 
democrat rep john alario argued that the time to challenge 
dukes residency was before the election and he asked the house to 
table bacques motion effectively moving to seat duke 
after the motion was approved 6933 bacque said he would have no 
further comment on his action its over he said 
a string of lawmakers many of them black took turns at the 
microphone warning duke that they would be keeping an eye on him 
we are resolved and committed to make sure that racism will not 
become the order of the day said rep cd jones 
duke was also welcomed as a member of the republican legislative 
caucus and met informally with other gop legislators it was a 
nice fit we talked about tax reform said rep jim st raymond 
outside on the capitol steps about 15 young adults marched in 
protest carrying signs reading david dukes a nazi kook and 
chanting 
duke was a grand wizard of the ku klux klan during the 1970s and 
an international spokesman for the group and was founder of the 
national association for the advancement of white people he once 
was photographed in a nazi uniform

editors of the pacific stars and stripes urged 
congress on wednesday to give control of the newspaper to an 
independent civilian editor complaining it now is subjected to 
censorship and browbeating by military officers 
defense department officials and officers contended there is no 
censorship but acknowledged there is a widespread perception that it 
exists they said management changes are not needed 
the comments came at a hearing of the house armed services 
subcommittee on readiness at which representatives of the general 
accounting office said an investigation had found that military 
commanders and their representatives have attempted to influence 
the reporting of news by both the pacific and european editions of 
stars and stripes 
rep earl hutto dfla the subcommittee chairman said he hoped 
the hearing had cleared the air but said no immediate followup 
action was planned 
martin n ferber an official of gaos international affairs 
division said that although the pentagon intended to establish 
guidelines to protect stars and stripes against censorship and 
command influence it has not accomplished this objective 
ferber said the problem is rooted in the fact that stars and 
stripes is a government publication striving simultaneously to 
provide news to us military personnel stationed overseas while 
also acting as an information organ for the armed forces 
this dual purpose he said leads to conflict between civilian 
journalists attempting to exercise constitutional rights of freedom 
of the press and commanders charged with executing a military 
mission 
different expectations by these groups are the primary reason 
allegations of censorship exist ferber said 
he said a survey conducted by the society of professional 
journalists established evidence that was conclusive at stars and 
stripes in the pacific but inconclusive for the european paper 
we found that the content of the news covered in stars and 
stripes compared to the wire services from which the news was 
drawn was consistent with the allegations we investigated ferber 
said 
the current pacific editor of stars and stripes and two former 
editors all said censorship was routine at the newspaper and called 
for civilian control of the editorial product 
i had running skirmishes with various generals and admirals who 
wanted to kill or plant stories in the news columns despite the 
ill effect that such censorship and news management had on the 
newspapers already battered integrity and despite clear military 
regulations that proscribed such abuse said timothy hutchinson 
executive editor of pacific stars and stripes from 1981 to 1984 
this browbeating had been going on for decades in the pacific 
and the results of it were painfully obvious hutchinson said 
staff morale was terrible and circulation was plummeting 
dewey w brackett the current pacific editor for the newspaper 
contended the situation has not changed 
in my judgment pacific starts and stripes today is a wilful 
failure he said the papers independence and integrity has 
been purposely cast aside 
the reason the paper is censored is sadly simple it disturbs 
the generals and admirals brackett said they do not like to 
read negative stories about the us government the defense 
department the military installations and personnel under their 
command or the governments of the asian countries in which they are 
located 
but air force col edwin j montgomery the current commander and 
editor in chief of pacific stars and stripes strongly disagreed 
i have never had anyone no flag officer no ambassador no 
bureaucrat no one force the running or killing of a story nor 
has anyone dictated how a story should be edited or played he 
said 
he said the papers reputation is threatened by the largely 
anonymous but publicly trumpeted allegations that the newspaper is 
censored 
montgomery said he believes that certain civilian employees 
have an agenda and the agenda is to remove all military influence 
over the paper 
he also complained that the gao report to congress was 
seriously flawed and said differences between the european and 
pacific editions of stars and stripes or choices of what news 
service copy was run were editorial judgment affected by such 
things as other stories competing for space 
two senior pentagon officials also said the issue is editorial 
judgement not censorship 
i fervently believe the system we have in place is sound 
said william e hart deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
public affairs 
our paramount objective is to ensure a free flow of news and 
information said jordan e rizer director of the american forces 
information service there has never been a calculated withholding 
of news ever reported to me

the communist party of lithuania has accused a 
grassroots political group of becoming too extreme in its opposition 
to government policies pravda said wednesday 
the communist party newspaper in a report on a lithuanian party 
meeting a day earlier accused some members of the sajudis movement 
of moving from support for party reform to clear opposition 
sajudis part of the peoples front political movement was 
formed in the baltic republic last year to push for greater 
cultural political and economic autonomy from moscow 
at the plenum it was noted that the extreme position started to 
dominate the activity of sajudis at least of several of its leaders 
and members pravda said 
today the movement has started to distance itself from its 
initial proposals consciously or unconsciously a part of sajudis 
openly is nearing the slogans of the clearly antisocialist 
lithuanian liberty league and the socalled party of lithuanian 
democrats the report said referring to groups that advocate 
outright independence for lithuania 
party leaders said the threat of a split on national grounds is 
quite serious in the republic pravda said 
the plenum signified an effort by the party to regain the control 
that has been shaken by the sudden emergence of sajudis and the 
spread of nationalist sentiments 
under pressure from sajudis the small republic has declared 
lithuanian the official language and chosen the flag of the 
independent republic that existed between the world wars as the 
republics official banner 
however authorities were able in november to thwart an effort to 
declare the republic sovereign in all areas except foreign policy 
and defense matters as did estonia another baltic republic 
the kremlin has tried without success to cool the ethnic 
sentiments in the baltic republics and elsewhere in the country 
sajudis has been active in putting forward candidates for 
multiplecandidate elections march 26 for a new nationwide congress 
of peoples deputies sometimes at the expense of partybacked 
candidates pravda said the lithuanian party also criticized many of 
its own members for sympathizing with the organization 
the plenum sharply criticized some official publications and 
lithuanian radio and television for leaning toward sajudis and the 
partys ideological department came under attack for its lack of 
activity 
kremlinled calls for consolidation of ethnic groups into a 
single program supporting moscows policies remain only on paper 
so far pravda said 
the plenum was held on the same day that the republics 
government declared lithuanian the official language making 
official an act passed by its legislature in october 
a week ago lithuanian activists marked the anniversary of the 
declaration of independence from revolutionary russia in 1918 with 
rallies a year earlier a tight police presence had prevented any 
such demonstrations 
ethnic lithuanians make up about 80 percent of the republics 36 
million people the largest such indigenous population in any of the 
three baltic republics

the bush administration on wednesday sent its 
333page savings and loan bailout bill to congress where lawmakers 
from both parties immediately started picking away at its key 
provisions 
members of the senate banking committee attacked provisions to 
raise sampls capital requirements finance the government portion of 
the bailout off the federal budget at an extra cost of 46 
billion to taxpayers and give the treasury department greater 
control over the institutions 
treasury secretary nicholas brady defended the administrations 
plan as stucturally sound and said it assures the emergence of 
a healthy and strong sampl industry 
but senators questioned whether the proposed 90 billion infusion 
of cash 40 billion of it already committed to close or merge 
350 insolvent sampls and pay for rescuing 205 last year would be 
enough to do the job 
garbage in is garbage out said sen john heinz rpa who 
complained about the inaccuracy of past estimates of the bailout 
costs by the federal savings and loan insurance corp the agency 
that insures sampl accounts to 100000 
heinz said the 50 billion estimated cost of closing or merging 
the remaining insolvent thrift institutions assumes that the market 
value of their assets or loans and the collateral backing them 
will shrink by only 83 percent 
in the sampls closed or merged so far he said the government has 
found that the market values of those assets and collateral in 
disposing of them has been 20 percent to 40 percent below what they 
had been listed as on an institutions books 
the administration also assumes in its package that 30year bonds 
to provide 50 billion over the next three years can be financed at 
an annual interest cost of 77 percent compared with the current 
92 percent interest rate for 30year treasury bonds 
brady acknowedged the bonds will have to pay at least onefourth 
of a percentage point higher interest than the treasury securities 
to attract buyers but he predicted the rates will fall if congress 
balances the federal budget 
theres a substantial difference there heinz told him i 
dont see how you can 
over the next 30 years the administration estimates the total 
cost including interest on the borrowed funds for cleaning up 
sampls at roughly 200 billion with about 55 percent of it coming 
from taxpayers 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas and the chairman of the house 
banking committee called the administrations economic assumptions 
rosy and said more realistic ones would show sampl bailout 
spending over the next three decades totaling 335 billion 183 
billion of it from the taxpayers 
taxpayers would save 138 billion if congress directly 
appropriated the money rather than borrow it gonzalez said but he 
conceded that would require a special tax earmarked solely for the 
purpose of financing the savings and loan bailout 
administration policy and political reality may rule out this 
more direct approach he said 
but sen don riegle dmich and the senate banking committee 
chairman said 461 billion in taxpayer costs could be saved if the 
treasury borrowed the money directly rather than through a side 
door mechanism to keep if off the federal budget 
james blum acting director of the congressional budget office 
told the house ways and means committee that the administrations 
offbudget financing plan would boost taxpayerpaid interest 
payments on the bailout plan by 100 million to 200 million a year 
i havent really heard what justifies that premium riegle 
said if there are advantages theyre not obvious to me 
brady said the bailout could be financed as part of the budget 
through regular longterm treasury borrowings but he suggested 
that it would be at a cost of one less trident submarinme or no 
day care if congress went that route and still tried to stay 
within the bounds of the deficitreduction law 
several other provisions of bushs bailout plan also were 
attacked by senators including a measure that would force sampls to 
raise their capital requirements to 6 percent of their outstanding 
loans as banks are now required over the next two years 
republican sen phil gramm of texas where a large bulk of the 
insolvent sampls are located called that unrealistic 
that may be possible in heaven he said whether its 
possible in texas i think is debatable 
sens christopher bond rmo terry sanford dnc and others 
indicated a willingness to push a proposal being advanced by the sampl 
industry to stretch out the timetable for reaching that 6 percent 
capital requirement to five years 
it would be a mistake to think that it the bush proposal is 
going to whip through just as it is sanford said explaining that 
the new capital requirements could destroy some healthy sampls 
sen jake garn rutah and the coauthor of 1982 legislation that 
largely deregulated the industry opposed putting new reregulation 
authority under the treasury department as bush would 
garn acknowledged that he might not have the votes in the senate 
to stop that given the widespread criticism of the way the federal 
home loan bank board and the fslic have regulated sampls 
riegle who introduced the administrations legislative package 
with garn on wednesday said he planned to have a bill ready for 
full action by the senate by the first week in april

the us navy cited 
commanders sacred obligation to help mariners in distress only 
after a captain refused to rescue refugees who later resorted to 
cannibalism the officers lawyer said wednesday 
defense lawyer dan donato cited the obligation during wednesdays 
session of the courtmartial of capt alexander balian former 
skipper of the uss dubuque 
balian 48 of los angeles has been on trial since feb 10 on 
charges of failing to give necessary assistance to more than 80 
refugees he encountered in the south china sea june 9 while en route 
to the persian gulf 
closing arguments in the trial were set for thursday after which 
the case is expected to go to the sixmember jury for navy captains 
thirtyone refugees died and survivors resorted to cannibalism 
before they were rescued by filipino fishermen june 27 after 37 days 
at sea un officials said 
the defense contends navy regulations did not authorize captains 
to rescue refugees if they were not in lifethreatening 
situations 
balian said wednesday that under new regulations issued july 23 a 
captain would be stupid not to pick up refugees found at sea 
navy officials said the order states in part in the 
timetested creed of mariners no truth is more universal more 
sacred than the obligation to assist one another in time of 
distress there is no operations order no exercise no commitment 
no timetable that supersedes this charge 
balian said earlier regulations were not as clear 
on tuesday balian testified he would have rescued the refugees 
if he had been correctly informed of their desperate plight he said 
his executive officer lt cmdr stanley halter told him the 
vietnamese believed they could make it safely to the philippines if 
they received food and water which were provided 
but on wednesday halter denied making such a report to balian 
balian was relieved of his command in august after the vietnamese 
reported the incident to un officials in the philippines 
last thursday he was acquitted of a charge of failing to assist 
a vietnamese who drowned

the commanderinchief and 150 other 
military officers gave the prime minister one week to reform his 
government and work to end the civil war an army spokesman and 
newspapers said wednesday 
military spokesmen denied the ultimatum was a coup threat 
the official sudan news agency said prime minister sadek mahdi 
met throughout wednesday with the disgruntled officers the 
government said the premier called an emergency cabinet meeting for 
thursday and planned to consult leading politicians about the crisis 
the reports appeared a day after defense minister abdelmagid 
khalil a former army general resigned to protest the governments 
refusal to accept a peace agreement negotiated by a major political 
party khalil said mahdis policies have left the country starving 
bankrupt and isolated from potential aid donors 
also tuesday southern rebels said they shelled a government 
stronghold and major refugee center for the first time 
virtually all khartoums papers reported the warning 
memorandum which apparently was issued tuesday but none 
specified what action the military chiefs would take 
the communist party organ almaidan said the army warned it would 
retaliate if mahdi tried to punish the memos signers 
army spokesman brig mohamed osman malik confirmed the officers 
submitted to mahdi a memorandum containing certain demands related 
to our problems and concerns 
asked whether the memo foreshadowed a military takeover malik 
told the associated press no no there is no coup we have 
already tried these coups in the past and the army was the only 
loser 
another military spokesman said army officers had made certain 
demands but he would not characterize them as a coup threat 
newspapers said army gen fathi ahmed ali the 
commanderinchief led the meeting of about 150 officers that 
drafted the memorandum and gave it to mahdi 
the document demanded the government choose between war and 
peace and prepare properly for its choice the newspapers said 
sudan has spent most of its 33 years of independence under 
military rule the longest spell was 16 years under dictator gaafar 
nimeiri whose overthrow in 1985 led to a oneyear transitional 
military government and mahdis election in april 1986 
on tuesday night sudanese rebels said they shelled the 
provincial capital of juba a major refugee center in southern 
sudan destroying a military hospital and other vital targets 
the sudan peoples liberation army broadcast monitored in 
nairobi kenya gave no casualty estimates and did not say when the 
bombardment occurred 
it was the first reported shelling of juba since the revolt began 
in 1983 
there was no comment on the reported shelling from the sudanese 
government in khartoum 725 miles to the north and the broadcast 
could not be confirmed 
juba a city of 150000 people on the white nile river is the 
capital of sudans southernmost province of equatoria more than 
50000 refugees from fighting and famine elsewhere in sudan have 
crowded into juba where they have been supplied with food clothing 
and medicine by the united nations and other relief agencies 
the rebel broadcast urged civilians living near military targets 
around juba to evacuate the rebels also said it had cut road access 
to the city 
the rebels are fighting the mainly moslem government in the north 
to force economic and social reforms in the predominantly christian 
and animist south

the hardworking honeybee is worth at least 
97 billion to farmers not to mention all that sweet stuff that is 
so good on biscuits a new study by cornell university showed 
wednesday 
honeybees are used by the millions to pollinate major crops of 
fruits berries vegetables tree nuts oilseeds and legumes their 
keepers rent them out commercially trucking the bees to crop areas 
the study was prepared by cornell for the national honey board 
which was authorized by congress and established by the agriculture 
department in 1986 to promote honey and honey research all financed 
through a levy on producers 
about a million colonies of bees are involved in commercial crop 
pollination about a third of all us managed colonies the report 
said that is about double the number estimated in the early 1980s 
to a significant degree because of the hard work of the 
honeybee we have abundant food supplies at reasonable prices said 
dan hall manager of the national honey board which is based in 
longmont colo 
commercial pollination ranges from blueberries and cranberries in 
new england to apples in the northwest and new york to almonds in 
california and some citrus in florida 
other major examples cited included alfalfa seed in the west 
melons in texas cucumbers in the carolinas and michigan sunflowers 
in minnesota and seeds for onions carrots celery and other 
vegetables in many states 
frederick hoff of usdas economic research service said that 
many consumers are unaware that honeybees are used to pollinate 
foods they are dependent upon he said the study shows that 
pollination is even more important than we thought 
the cornell study was based on 1985 information and showed that 
the 97 billion in direct benefits represented the dollar value of 
increased crop yields and quality as the result of honeybee crop 
pollination 
crop quality improvements include larger and more uniform size 
desirable shape uniform maturation date and all result in higher 
market value the report said

the disease that gave wc fields one of the most 
famous noses in america can now be treated with a new drug its 
developers said wednesday 
metrogel developed by curatek pharmaceuticals inc of suburban 
elk grove village has won approval from the food and drug 
administration as the first prescription drug in the united states 
specifically for rosacea or adult acne 
the condition which researchers said gave fields his red 
bulbous nose affects people in their 30s and 40s and if 
untreated can lead to significant disfigurement 
most people with rosacea dont even know it is treatable said 
dr jonathan wilkin director of dermatology at ohio state 
university who joined curatek officials at a news conference 
announcing the drug 
fields entrenched the notion that people who have rosacea are 
abusing alcohol wilkin said but he added that while alcohol may 
aggravate the disease rosacea can be just as severe in nondrinkers 
wilkin also said no one really knows what causes the rosacea the 
condition can be reversed if caught in its early stages he said 
in fields case the disorder progressed to what is called 
rhinophyma a condition in which dilated pores on the nose become 
excess tissue that results in a bulbous red appearance wilkin said 
the most common treatment in the past has been oral antibiotics 
which tended to be ineffective or associated with adverse reactions 
like allergies nausea and yeast infections wilkin said you 
could never depend on those products he said 
wilkin said metrogel has little or no side effects 
metrogel with the scientific name metronidazole is a 
waterbased gel that is invisible odorless and can be used under 
makeup 
approved by the fda in november it is available by prescription 
at a cost of 14 to 20 for a oneounce tube said robert j 
borgman president of curatek 
wilkin said women are slightly more susceptible to rosacea than 
men but more severe cases are found in men and heredity also may 
play a role 
people at the greatest risk of rosacea are fairskinned 
individuals who flush easily and their condition may be triggered 
by a variety of factors including spicy foods he said

nov 7 the anniversary of the bolshevik 
revolution in russia will no longer be a redletter day in hungary 
instead hungarians will celebrate march 15 the anniversary of 
the 1848 antiaustrian uprising as a public holiday for the first 
time this year spokesman gyoergy marosan said wednesday 
the council of ministers took the decision at a meeting 
wednesday he said 
the decision to stop marking the anniversary of the 1917 
bolshevik revolution a holiday marked in each of the soviet bloc 
countries is indicative of the degree of independence hungary has 
acquired with its ambitious reform program 
the march 15 anniversary has been marked by small unofficial 
rallies since 1972 since 1983 however increasing numbers of 
people have taken part and last year 10000 people marched through 
the streets calling for democracy a free press and free elections 
these are some of the same demands made by the leaders of the 
1848 uprising to shake off the hapsburg rule although it failed it 
had a longterm effect on the future relations of the 
austrohungarian monarchy and in 1867 the hungarians were given a 
series of unprecedented privileges 
alternative groups have demanded for years that march 15 be 
declared a national holiday as it bears strong national significance 
for hungarians 
official rallies also were conducted in the past with a 
reenactment of the reading of a 12point program for democracy 
issued at the time hungarians wore the national colors on that day 
in december parliament agreed to make march 15 an official 
public holiday it will be celebrated as such this year for the 
first time since the communists came to power in 1948 
last weekend more than 15 independent groups rejected a call by 
the communist party to stage joint celebrations referring to 
previous police force at past independent rallies the state news 
agency mti reported 
on tuesday communist party central committee secretary gyoergy 
fejti said he regretted the decision but said he hoped a joint 
celebration still could be arranged 
for years we the party leadership were accused of 
speaking with the arrogance of power fejti said i would regret 
it if the opposition would speak with another arrogance

stock prices fell sharply wednesday as signs of 
accelerating inflation punctured the optimism that has fueled the 
stock markets recent rally 
stocks suffered from a government report of a jump in consumer 
prices and from a statement by federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan who said he was disturbed by inflations strength 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks skidded 4250 to 
228393 its biggest drop since nov 11 when the widelyfollowed 
index tumbled 4766 
broader measures of stock activity also fell and declining 
issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly 4 to 1 on the new york 
stock exchange 
the labor department said consumer prices rose at an annual rate 
of 72 percent in january propelled by higher costs for gasoline 
poultry fish eggs and tobacco 
the report and greenspans remarks heightened concerns that the 
fed would push interest rates higher to try to hold down inflation 
high shortterm interest rates could drain money away from stocks 
and into higheryielding securities such as treasury bills in 
addition high rates might push the economy into a recession that 
would be bad for stocks 
the stock market had rallied since late last year returning for 
the first time to the levels it held before the october 1987 crash 
analysts said a sense of optimism had returned to wall street

eightfoot rendition of a ballot with the names of candidates 
crossed out and criticized the governments failure to allow 
multiplecandidate elections 
president mikhail s gorbachev meanwhile pushed reforms in soviet 
coal country 
the demonstration by about 500 people in the ukrainian capital 
the fourth in four nights was held under a special decree allowing 
spontaneous meetings concerning the march 26 elections that will 
choose members of a newly formed parliament 
demonstrations normally require government permission and that 
rarely has been forthcoming in the ukraine the republics communist 
party leader vladimir v shcherbitsky is the only holdover on the 
ruling party politburo from the era of leonid i brezhnev and 
tolerates little dissident 
shcherbitskys name and those of other ukranian officials were 
crossed out on the protesters banner resembling a ballot another 
poster read fear why is there only one candidate on the ballot 
oles shevchenko head of the ukrainian group monitoring 
compliance with the helsinki human rights accords said virtually 
all ukrainian leaders are running unopposed and voters seeking an 
alternative will only be able to cross out their names the party 
had promised that the march 26 elections will offer more than one 
candidate for seats in the congress of peoples deputies 
competing demonstrators at wednesdays meeting whom activists 
claimed were government agents held up a banner charging 
nationalism puts the brakes on perestroika gorbachevs policy 
of political and economic reform the sign was printed in ukrainian 
letters but slipped into russian in the middle 
shevchenko said activists were encouraged by gorbachevs 
statements to kiev residents broadcast on television monday night 
suggesting workers throw out bosses who do not support reforms 
gorbachev in the coalmining center of donetsk in the eastern 
ukraine on wednesday told a group of workers those who are trying 
to put a stick through the spokes of perestroika or to puncture the 
tire and let the air out and reduce the movement of perestroika 
are the most dangerous people 
donetsk is just south of dnepropetrovsk the city that was the 
power base of brezhnev who died in 1982 and now is blamed for 
fostering a period of economic and social stagnation and permitting 
widespread corruption 
gorbachevs visit to donetsk on the third day of his stay in the 
ukraine took up 90 minutes of the nightly news program vremya 
which normally is only a 45minute program the news program showed 
gorbachev talking with residents of the city visiting factories and 
holding a session with a group of miners 
workers complained about the inattentiveness of some local 
officials and told the soviet president that the area needs more 
modern mining equipment to dig deeper into its coal veins gorbachev 
preached economic reform technical renewal and selfreliance

us fish and wildlife service officials have 
paid more attention to politics than to protecting the nations 
natural resources a house subcommittee chairman said wednesday in 
pledging that congress will fully investigate allegations of 
mismanagement at the agency 
rep gerry studds dmass made the comments at a hearing a day 
after the general accounting office said top fws officials pressured 
biologists in the agencys northwest regional office into 
sanitizing a study which originally warned the spotted owl was 
threatened by extinction 
we are well aware that serious allegations have been made in 
recent months about the management of the fish and wildlife 
service said studds 
frank dunkle director of the fws told studds the charges are 
unfounded inconsequential and you are on a witch hunt he said 
among the allegations that studds said the gao and the staff of 
the merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries 
wildlife conservation and environment have or would investigate were 
political pressures may have influenced the agencys decision 
not to list the spotted owl as an endangered species 
the regional director in the agencys portland ore office 
was reassigned for essentially political reasons and congress was 
misled about the reasons for the reassignment 
fws officials in the fairbanks ala office were ordered by 
washingtonbased officials to destroy files on a plan which called 
for building a causeway to carry oil drilling equipment to an 
offshore site 
proper procedures were not followed when the agency considered 
the environmental impacts of the two forks dam project in colorado 
agency personnel have been ordered to carry out directives on 
verbal rather than written instructions and employees in at least 
one office were required to sign a pledge that they would not even 
keep a memo on file without approval 
dunkle refused to answer a string of questions from studds about 
whether political concerns should be allowed to take precedence over 
scientific evidence or legal requirements whether agency personnel 
should be transferred because they dont agree with the policy 
preferences of their superiors and whether an open investigation 
of the allegations would be beneficial 
i will respond in writing said dunkle im not sure what 
you are getting at 
im surprised at your defensiveness said studds 
my job is to carry out the laws set forth by congress and i 
have done just that said dunkle 
after the hearing dunkle denied that he had applied any 
political pressure on agency officials who eventually decided not to 
classify the spotted owl as an endangered species 
dunkle told reporters he had not seen the report from gao 
congress investigative arm and declined comment 
gao said fws officials intentionally ignored scientific evidence 
and ordered changes in the study prepared by biologists in the 
agencys pacific northwest regional office 
the fish and wildlife service a department of interior agency 
is required to consider only biological factors in deciding what 
species are designated for protection as threatened or endangered 
the agency concluded in december 1987 that the owl which lives 
only in ancient timber in oregon washington and northern 
california was not endangered 
the timber industry in the northwest has vehemently opposed any 
effort to name the owl a threatened or endangered species fearing 
that such a move would disrupt logging in public forests

the chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee called on the bush administration on wednesday to throw 
its weight behind the peace plan offered last week by central 
americas five presidents 
i view these developments as encouraging and for that reason am 
dismayed by the unenthusiastic reaction of the administration this 
far said sen claiborne pell dri we should be providing a 
fair breeze behind this initiative to make it work 
in the agreement the sandinista government of nicaragua said it 
would hold free elections by february 1990 and release some 3000 
political prisoners if bases used by contra resistance fighters 
inside honduras are dismantled 
other signers included the presidents of honduras costa rica 
guatemala and el salvador 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the house foreign 
affairs committee on tuesday that while the agreement could provide 
a good basis for bringing peace and democracy to nicaragua it lacks 
deadlines and procedures to assure sandinista compliance 
he said the sandinistas have made similar promises in the past 
and have broken them each time 
there are risks involved pell told the senate there are 
no guarantees that the sandinistas will comply with the accord they 
are marxists who have not given up their communist principles but 
the economic realities they face provide significant pressure 
the united states should make known its support for this plan 
to give it the best possible chance of working pell said if it 
fails we should not give cause for that failure to be laid at our 
door 
pell said the united states should restructure aid to the contras 
in ways supporting the accord including providing funds to resettle 
the contras and their families in nicaragua or other countries

dr louis sullivan will tell congress at his 
confirmation hearing that he misspoke his position on abortion 
both in a newspaper interview and to a senator a source close to 
the health and human services secretarydesignate said wednesday 
in his opening statement to the senate finance committee on 
thursday he will say he misrepresented his views when he said he 
supported womens right to abortion and the supreme court decision 
that legalized abortion said the source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
hell say he misspoke the source said hes going to say 
his personal view his public view is that hes against abortion 
with the same exceptions that president bush endorses in cases if 
rape incest and danger to the life of the mother 
finance committee sources said they expect the confirmation 
hearing to go smoothly and that panel members will vote their 
approval following the hearing 
sources close to sullivan who will step down as president of the 
morehouse school of medicine in atlanta to join bushs cabinet say 
the nominee initially was unprepared for the heat that could be 
generated by the emotionpacked issue of abortion 
sullivan riled abortion opponents with remarks he made in an 
interview with an atlanta newspaper shortly after his nomination and 
again when sen bob packwood rore reported the nominee had told 
him he favored retaining the supreme courts roe vs wade decision 
his remarks prompted righttolife groups to demand assurances 
from the bush administration that sullivans policies at the hhs 
would follow those of the president on abortion 
sullivans hearing had been scheduled for earlier this month but 
was put off at the request of the white house because an fbi 
background investigation was still under way and the nominee had not 
finished his financial disclosure report 
two weeks ago sullivan put financial conflict of interest 
concerns to rest when he decided to forfeit nearly 300000 in 
severance pay he could have received if he had cut his ties to the 
medical school he founded 
he was prepared to do that according to a senior administration 
official but was concerned when news reports raised questions about 
the arrangement and decided instead to forgo the money and instead 
take an unpaid leave of absence 
sullivan is expected to be questioned about that decision as 
well as part of the fbi investigation that focused on his connection 
to a former georgia county official convicted of extortion 
unrelated to his extortion conviction reginald eaves was paid 
more than 34000 over four years as a parttime lecturer at 
morehouse while he used his seat on the fulton county commission to 
promote issues that benefited the medical school he gave only two 
lectures 
sullivan will tell congress he made a mistake by hiring 
eaves which is what he said publicly when the arrangement came to 
light last summer according to a source close to the nominee

group will give you 1000 
all you have to do is move the house that is 
the six homes for sale are on property purchased by university 
hospital and must be moved by april the catch is that they may not 
be worth the cost of moving them estimated at 10000 to 30000 
each 
the houses built between 1910 and 1920 are in disrepair and 
have become havens for vagrants making the area dangerous for 
hospital employees said judy skelton a hospital spokeswoman 
we want to work with spar to preserve the houses for historical 
purposes but a lot of our employees have to walk past there from 
the parking lot and its just not safe she said 
university hospital turned the homes over to the preservation 
group which is selling them for 10 each and then funneling 1000

a team of government and private veterinarians 
has cleared the navy of allegations it mistreated dolphins and sea 
lions being trained for various underwater surveillance duties 
the marine mammal commission review team after what it described 
as an extensive survey of navy facilities and practices sharply 
criticized a former navy trainer and other unidentified sources who 
charged last november the service was guilty of animal abuse 
the review team found the allegations to be substantively 
lacking states the commissions report released wednesday by the 
navy 
the team concluded that allegations had been put forward in 
such a way as to create an inaccurate picture the report 
continued 
furthermore the team concluded that had the sole motivation 
underlying the allegations been concern for the health welfare and 
care of the animals the former trainer would have made better use 
than he did of the navys animal care committee 
the program now includes about 115 animals the majority of them 
dolphins and the remainder of them beluga whales the service trains 
the mammals to detect enemy scuba divers and to hunt for underwater 
mines the program began more than 20 years ago 
the washingtonbased marine mammal commission which advises all 
federal agencies on the handling of marine mammals ordered an 
investigation after former navy trainer rick trout charged last 
november he had witnessed incidents of abuse weight loss 
corporal punishment and damage to animals after transport 
trout who no longer works for the navy made the allegations 
during an appearance before the international marine animal trainers 
association meeting in san antonio texas 
to investigate the charges the commission appointed a 
sevenmember review team that included veterinarians or medical 
doctors from the agriculture department the national marine 
fisheries services various university faculties and the chicago 
zoological society 
none of the members had ties to the navy 
after conducting lengthy interviews with trout and other former 
navy employees and then inspecting navy facilities and records the 
review team concluded

a navy dolphin that died after being transported to the persian 
gulf did not succumb to poor training mistreatment mishandling 
or changes in water temperature the dolphin died of bronchial 
pneumonia 
there is no evidence that the nutritional program as it 
presently exists has adversely affected the health and welfare of 
the animals and certainly no evidence of intentional starvation 
the only trainer ever observed using food to bait a dolphin 
during training or dumping fish outside a netted pen as punishment 
was the person making the allegations 
there have been only two isolated incidents within the past 
three years of a trainer slapping or striking a dolphin and in both 
cases the trainers were immediately disciplined 
during the last 22 months three dolphins have died at the 
navys mammal center in san diego the deaths were not related to 
improper training poor handling techniques or inadequate veterinary 
care 
and there is no evidence of animals having been blinded or 
injured or as a result of poor training procedures 
the team did not give the navy a completely clean bill of health 
for example it concluded the navys san diego facility where 
trout worked did a better job than a facility in hawaii of 
ensuring that veterinarians supervised all aspects of care and 
training 
it also criticized delays in the hiring of two additional 
fulltime veterinarians and noted that in the past there has been 
one highlevel person within the pentagon responsible for the marine 
mammal program 
that does not appear to be the case now the team recommends 
that such an assignment be made 
all in all though the navy is following or exceeding federal 
guidelines for the proper handling of marine mammals the team said 
and in some areas such as the ratio of trainers and veterinarians 
to animals and medical care standards and recordkeeping the navys 
performance is as good as or better than in other institutions

postponing the march 19 
presidential election proposed by the rebels as a cornerstone of 
lasting peace appeared no more likely wednesday than before the 
rebels and delegates of political parties met in mexico 
the proposal made by the leftist guerrillas on jan 24 has been 
the subject of intense debate ever since they presented a revised 
proposal monday and tuesday and the political parties said they 
would ask the government to consider it 
but as the debate drags on election time draws closer and the 
level of violence in this small central american country increases 
at a news conference in mexico city the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front said again its offer is good only for a 
limited time guerrilla commander roberto roca said if the 
government refused to talk it will bear the blame for 
continuation of the war 
the war began in 1980 and has killed 70000 people mostly 
civilians 
some politicians described the talks as more a means of keeping 
up appearances and avoiding blame for their failure than a serious 
consideration of the rebel overture 
asked if any better chance existed now for postponing the 
elections hector silva a leader of the leftist democratic 
convergence replied simply no 
the farabundo marti told the politicians it would accept a vote 
as early as july and would observe a ceasefire during a fourmonth 
campaign 
that would still put the election past the june 1 date on which 
the constitution calls for president jose napoleon duarte to step 
down 
the insurgents also said the armed forces now at 56000 men 
would have to be cut to 12000 their size a decade ago 
a highranking government official said the insurgents softened 
their position by accepting an earlier date for elections than 
proposed earlier but hardened it with the stipulation on troop 
reducion 
one bad element of the new position is enough to sink it 
he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the ussupplied and tutored armed forces opposed the proposal 
from the start 
while millions of salvadorans clamor for peace and reject 
violence death and destruction the fmln represented in mexico by 
four terrorist chiefs is launching the most sinister strategic 
plans of marxismleninism in order to obtain power by force of 
arms the defense ministry said in a communique issued wednesday 
the armed forces and the rightist republican national alliance 
or arena consider the guerrilla proposal a ploy arena is favored 
to win next months election and has little motivation to accept a 
delay 
the executive branch and the us embassy also expressed doubts 
about rebel sincerity 
the guerrillas said the war will escalate if their proposal is 
rejected and accused political parties of hiding behind the 
constitution to avoid serious discussion 
party leaders agreed in mexico to continue discussing the plan 
once back in san salvador and said they would press duartes 
government to discuss the new rebel offer directly with its authors 
duarte four weeks ago said resolution of the matter was up to the 
political parties 
asked wednesday if the parties had thrown the ball back to the 
government the government official said its not so much that we 
gave them the ball we loaned it to them to play with for a while 
guerrilla leader shafick handal said the last time the farabundo 
marti sat down with duarte he came to the negotiations emptyhanded 
they didnt propose a thing handal said 
legislator sigifredo ochoa a top arena leader told local radio 
ysu on wednesday there in mexico everyone except us was trying to 
see what advantage they could pull out of this we are the only ones 
who have been clear in our position from the beginning 
asked about possible reduction of government troop strength 
ochoa a retired colonel said im against it it changes the 
essence of the original proposal 
democratic convergence leader silva told the associated press 
that arena was rejecting the proposal without spelling out its 
position 
it is their way of saying no while paying the lowest price 
politically he said 
the rebels meanwhile attacked two major army bases on tuesday 
killing four soldiers and three civilians 
guerrilla sabotage left 60 percent of this massachusettssized 
country without electricity wednesday roca said the guerrillas 
dont intend to stop fighting while they await a decision on their 
proposal 
the operations of the salvadoran army continue for our part 
so will ours said roca

a panamanianregistered freighter hauling a load of 
salt to iceland capsized and sank in violent seas on wednesday and 
all 17 crew members died the coast guard said 
ships rescue planes and helicopters struggled in vain to aid the 
japaneseowned 2625ton sescil angola which sank 350 miles west 
of scotland 
squadron leader bob conolly of the royal air force said crew 
members may have died because they waited too long to abandon ship 
later wednesday clyde coast guard on scotlands west coast said 
a danish fishing boat in the same area also sent a distress call 
another danish fishing vessel responded and was escorting it to 
stornoway in the outer hebrides 
the nunarsuit from godthab greenland with nine crew had its 
bridge windows smashed in by huge waves said a coast guard 
spokesman who by custom was unidentified 
but another danish fishing boat from the same harbor the 
narssalik got there and is steaming with it to stornoway there are 
no casualties he said 
planes and ships searched all day for survivors from the sescil 
angola which was carrying salt from spain to iceland 
when the search was called off at nightfall five bodies had been 
recovered and six more sighted rescue services said 
the freighter had reported water in two holds and the last 
message from the ships unidentified captain said there is great 
danger helicopters please hurry 
conolly captain of a nimrod reconnaissance aircraft that was 
first on the scene advised the crew to launch their lifeboat 
immediately 
the crew did not want to abandon ship they wanted to come off 
by helicopter they held on too long and the boat turned over he 
said 
but he added that weather conditions were so severe that even if 
the crew had abandoned ship earlier their chances of survival might 
have been slim 
the rescue effort involved royal air force teams from scotland 
northern england and wales and us helicopters from iceland 
scottish coast guard officer john griffiths at greenock said the 
freighter sent out its first distress call shortly after midnight 
and the first aircraft to enter the search took off 12 minutes later 
from kinloss in northern scotland 
it arrived over the sescil angola at 2 am and dropped life 
rafts two of which were shredded by the wind and blown away 
the coast guard said the freighter sank at 725 am 
the first royal air force sea king helicopter arrived two hours 
later winchman bob griffths said he was lowered to just above the 
tops of the waves to inspect the life rafts 
no one could have survived he said 
the conditions were horrendous the life rafts were tied 
together in pairs and were shooting up and down on 50foot waves 
there were broken pieces of ship all over the place he said

the former house intelligence committee 
chairman testified wednesday at oliver norths trial that he relied 
on white house denials of reports of us military help to the 
nicaragua contras for more than a year until the irancontra affair 
became known 
rep lee hamilton dind the first prosecution witness said 
thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane twice denied any 
involvement in letters in 1985 and at a committee briefing that year 
a year later hamilton and his committee directly questioned 
north then an aide on the national security council staff about 
whether he had violated the boland amendment a 1984 prohibition 
against us military aid to the contras 
colonel north insisted he had not violated the boland 
amendment that he was not assisting the contras by raising money 
that he had not provided any military advice to the contras 
hamilton said of the aug 6 1986 meeting in the white house 
situation room 
i relied on what colonel north told me at the meeting 
hamilton said i believed what colonel north told me at the 
meeting i did not think there was any credible evidence to the 
contrary 
north was originally charged with conspiracy in the alleged 
scheme to divert money from iran arms sales to aid the nicaraguan 
contras that charge was dropped and he is on trial on 12 felony 
charges that include obstructing congressional inquiries into his 
activities in 1985 and 1986 
the committees inquiries were first made in august 1985 
following news reports that north was helping raise money for the 
contras and giving them tactical military advice despite the 1984 
amendment 
when mcfarlane told me they were not engaged in raising funds 
for the contras and that the national security council was not 
providing military advice i took mr mcfarlanes word for it i 
relied upon what the national security adviser for the president 
told me 
hamilton said he thought that information was accurate honest 
and correct and did not pose questions about the contras to the 
cia or the defense department 
he told the court that congress was disturbed in november 1986 
when it learned the united states had sold arms to iran because it 
ran counter to policy 
we were telling all the world we do not sell arms to terrorist 
nations he said if this was true we were dealing with a 
terrorist nation we were telling the world we did not deal for 
hostages but if this was true we did make concessions to get 
hostages 
the sale of arms to iran violated all we understood to be the 
policy of the us government 
prosecutors are trying to show that north then a marine 
lieutenant colonel serving on the nsc staff subverted the processes 
of government by helping mcfarlane draft false answers to letters 
from congress inquiring about the news reports mcfarlane who is 
expected to testify as a prosecution witness has pleaded guilty to 
four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from congress 
hamilton will return for more testimony thursday the next 
witness will be adolfo calero the political head of the largest 
contra faction the nicaraguan democratic force 
during hamiltons testimony norths wife betsy sat in the 
front row of spectator seats and north wrote on a yellow legal pad 
before the jury was admitted to the courtroom hamilton was 
cautioned not to refer in any way to the public testimony north gave 
in 1987 at a televised hearing of the housesenate committees 
looking into the irancontra affair 
north had immunity for that appearance and his trial must be 
conducted entirely without information gleaned from his earlier 
testimony hamiltons testimony said us district judge gerhard a 
gesell must be solely on what you know of your own knowledge 
hamilton whose committee has oversight over the nations 
intelligence agencies it hears testimony in a specially secure 
room in the capitol said he was not satisfied with the official 
assurances that north and other nsc aides were not vioating the 
boland ban on military aid to the contras 
two months after north denied to the committee that he was 
violating the boland amendment an american c123 cargo plane 
crashed during a supply flight to the contras in nicaragua hamilton 
said he learned about the crash in the press of the three men 
aboard one eugene hasenfus survived and said he had been working 
for the cia 
it caused an enormous stir and concern in washington and 
particularly in congress the congressman said some members 
perceived it as a possible violation of the boland amendment 
hamilton dismissed a suggestion by brendan v sullivan norths 
chief defense lawyer that the boland amendment did not apply to the 
national security council a claim north and the white house have 
made in the past 
i do not recall anyone saying to me this language does not 
apply to the national security council hamilton said the 
letter mr mcfarlane wrote to me specifically said that the language 
did apply and i accepted that 
but hamilton conceded that i do not read that language as 
applying to the president of the united states provided the chief 
executive does not use the cia the defense department or other 
intelligence agencies to aid the contras

the environmental protection agency rewarded a 
superfund siteinspection contractor for subpar work paid contract 
employees to attend conferences and kept some inspection experts 
confined to office work for nearly a year according to an epa 
inspector generals report obtained wednesday 
some contract employees were so frustrated with their inability 
to make onsite inspections that they held mock exercises in a yard 
near their office in an effort to maintain proficiency in sampling 
hazardous materials the report said 
the inspector general also cited an epa official who was so upset 
at paying for contract workers to attend conferences that he wrote 
that the practice might not hold up too well under any type of 
scrutiny congressional inspector general or otherwise 
the contract cited by the inspector general is between epa and 
nus corp of gaithersburg md the company was hired to provide 
field inspection teams to gather information on hazardous waste 
cleanup sites in the agencys regions i through iv headquartered 
respectively in boston new york city philadelphia and atlanta 
the inspector generals report obtained by the associated press 
will be reviewed at a hearing thursday by the house post office and 
civil service committees civil service subcommittee headed by rep 
gerry sikorski dminn 
epa inspector general john c martin estimated the fiveyear 
contract will cost 125 million by its finish 
another inspector generals report to be reviewed by the 
subcommittee criticized the philadelphiabased region iii management 
of epas emergency superfund response program the program uses 
contract employees to respond to environmental emergencies 
the report found that members of a team of groundwater 
hydrologists toxicologists chemists and environmental scientists 
often were used as file clerks 
a geologist who charged 676 hours of his time to administrative 
support told the inspector general he used the time to file reports 
answer telephones update lists and maintain charts 
the inspector generals reports included comments from the epa 
which defended its actions 
regarding the nus contract the agency said the audit covered 
only the first 13 months of a fiveyear contract and failed to list 
major accomplishments of the site inspection program that 
occurred near the end of the first year 
the language depicting agency management as deficient is overly 
strong and inappropriate the epa said 
the epa also disagreed with the emergency response team report 
emphasizing that maintaining good records is within the contracts 
scope of work 
but the agency said that to avoid the appearance of wasteful 
work the clerical tasks will now be handled by personnel from the 
american association of retired persons 
at nus the companys vice president for administration donald 
couchman said we regard that the report as an internal review 
of epa management and we dont consider it appropriate comment at 
this time 
the nations superfund program is designed to clean up hazardous 
waste sites more than 30000 potential sites have been identified 
with 1175 designated for a national priority cleanup list remedial 
action has been completed at 48 sites with some work underway at 
more than half the priority sites according to epa 
nus was hired to provide field inspection teams at the potential 
sites the federal governments primary investigative capability 
within the superfund program according to the inspector generals 
report the firm handles regions i through iv while another 
contractor provides the same services for regions v through x 
the contractor provides preliminary assessments site 
inspections special studies and enforcement support among other 
services 
the inspector general said bostonbased region i in december 
1986 caused severe morale problems at nus by ordering personnel not 
to perform traditional site inspection visits but to gather data 
from state agency files or from consultants working for the 
parties potentially responsible for the hazardous waste 
only a month after coming on board nus employee morale was 
affected since almost all activity was office work the report 
said a series of mock field exercises were conducted outside the 
office to maintain si site inspection expertise 
this led to transfers and resignations by 41 percent of the 
professional contractor staff in region i while performance 
declined at the time of the resignations and transfers the 
inspector generals report said the order against onsite 
inspections lasted for 10 months 
the report said epa was too lenient in evaluating nus 
performance and in giving the company award fees based on 
performance 
one unit of contract employees received laudatory ratings and 
award fees of over 90000 despite the fact that the fit field 
inspection team charged over half its time to support tasks did 
not perform field work and without the regions knowledge nus 
transferred a large segment of the team to work on a state 
contract the report said 
one epa official had these description of nus work poorly 
writtentechnically inaccurateless than satisfactoryfrom 
poor to pathetic 
at the number one superfund site in the country the lipari 
landfill in pitman nj the epa paid a nominal award fee even 
though an epa official was sharply critical of the companys work 
the report said

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
wednesday stepped up his warnings about higher inflation pointedly 
noting a disturbing increase in consumer prices and saying if price 
pressures are not brought under control it will intensify the next 
recession 
appearing for the second consecutive day before a congressional 
committee to explain the feds conduct of monetary policy greenspan 
inserted comments into his prepared testimony to take note of a 
report showing that consumer prices took the biggest jump in two 
years in january 
the 06 percent increase which translated into an annual rate of 
72 percent reflected widespread increases in a variety of goods 
and services 
greenspan noted that wholesale prices also jumped sharply in 
january and blamed both increases in part on higher wage pressures 
in the economy 
since march of last year the fed has been trying to keep the 
economy from overheating by a series of credittightening moves 
which have pushed shortterm interest rates up by about 3 percentage 
points 
greenspan indicated as he had on tuesday before the senate 
banking committee that this credit tightening would continue until 
the fed was satisfied that the economy had slowed enough to lessen 
inflationary pressures 
while critics have charged that the feds credittightening could 
plunge the country into a recession greenspan said he saw no 
current signs of the imbalances that signaled an imminent downturn 
instead he said that the feds efforts to control inflation 
should lengthen the expansion and make the next downturn less severe 
than it would be if inflation gets out of hand requiring the type 
of credit crunch which brought on the severe 198182 recession the 
worst downturn since the great depression 
if inflation reemerges i think a recession will move up on us 
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be 
a prolonged one greenspan said 
president bush has made several comments since taking office to 
the effect that he believed the central bank was overemphasizing 
inflation worries at the risk of slowing economic growth 
but on wednesday michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser 
said that the administration believed that inflation developments 
needed to be monitored closely with swift action taken if it appears 
that inflation is accelerating 
we will not tolerate a rise in inflation boskin said in an 
appearance before the joint economic committee of congress 
however boskin stressed that it would be wrong to read too much 
into one months inflation performance 
greenspan for his part sought to play down any disagreements 
between the administration and the central bank saying as he has in 
the past that quick action to reduce the federal budget deficit 
would be the best tonic for what ails the economy 
i am cautiously optimistic about making progress on the 
deficit because there is sufficient awareness of the problems 
he said 
on another topic greenspan promised to provide a detailed report 
on changes the fed has made in supplying reserves to financially 
troubled savings and loans as part of its effort to deal with the 
sampl crisis 
rep john lafalce dny expressed concern about the credit 
arrangements saying he believed they represented a fundamental 
change in fed policy 
greenspan said the central bank was in the process of 
constructing certain liquidity fallbacks as part of the overall 
sampl rescue effort announced by the bush administration recently 
while all the details have not been worked out greenspan said 
the measures would not differ markedly from procedures the central 
bank has employed in the past to extend credit to financial 
institutions in need

a house military panel on wednesday accused 
pentagon officials of dragging their feet in their new 
congressionally mandated role as the nations leaders in the air and 
sea detection of drug trafficking 
this ought to be your no 1 priority because this is an 
emergency whether you believe it or not said rep nicholas 
mavroules dmass chairman of the house armed services 
investigations subcommittee 
the subcommittees top republican rep larry j hopkins of 
kentucky joined democrats in the chorus of criticism 
we are dead serious about the pentagons active role in the 
drug war even it it means we have to drag you kicking and screaming 
every step of the way hopkins told two pentagon officials at a 
subcommittee hearing 
but the defense department officials rejected the subcommittees 
contention that there was a lack of enthusiasm over the 
antidrug program at the pentagon 
theres no doubt that those of us in the department of defense 
have a role in the war on drugs said lt gen stephen g 
olmstead deputy assistant secretary for drug policy and 
enforcement were enthused 
i sense your frustration that we havent gone faster said 
lt gen thomas w kelly director for operations of the joint 
chiefs of staff but were going to do better and be making 
significant progress over time 
congress in the midst of electionyear antidrug fervor that 
swept capitol hill last year approved 300 million in military 
funds to be devoted exclusively to fighting drug trafficking 
lawmakers on wednesday complained that the pentagon has been too 
slow in filing its plan with congress on how it wants to spend the 
money 
the deadline was jan 1 the plan was not submitted until last 
week and then only after the subcommittee scheduled its hearing 
according to subcommittee aides 
subcommittee members also criticized the spending blueprint as 
much too vague 
the pentagons proposal includes 40 million for the national 
guard 60 million for the creation of a secure communications 
network 130 million for additional radar and other hardware 56 
million in operations and maintenance costs and 13 million in 
research and development 
but the plan provides few specifics when pressed olmstead said 
the military wanted to spend part of the money on three or four 
aerostats or unmanned radarequipped blimps that cost 20 million 
each but he did not provide other details 
any requests for equipment may prove to be a problem 
subcommittee aides said lawmakers who drafted the drug interdiction 
provision last year specified that the money should be used 
exclusively for missions and not for new hardware one aide who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity predicted the plan would be 
rejected by congress 
under the law the pentagon cannot spend any of the 300 million 
until congress approves the militarys spending plan within 60 days 
after it is submitted olmstead promised that the money would begin 
to be spent within hours of congressional approval with the 
national guard receiving top priority 
but lawmakers said there was no reason why the pentagon could not 
use other funds to begin beefing up drug interdiction efforts right 
away 
you have 300 billion the overall military budget to play 
with you can and should use any part of that for this emergency 
mavroules said youve got the money use it use it lets 
push this damn thing 
mavroules vowed to call the defense officials back before the 
panel within five weeks to measure their progress

solidarity leader lech walesa appealed for 
unity wednesday when he addressed 7000 supporters at the unions 
first legal rally in this central textile center in seven years 
behind the scenes walesa launched an attempt to patch up a 
conflict that split lodz solidarity leaders into rival factions 
standing in front of a huge solidarity sign in a hall under the 
grandstands of a football stadium walesa spoke for 10 minutes then 
spent more than an hour answering questions about the historic talks 
that the opposition began with the government feb 6 
if the round table fails we will have great fighting great 
strikes and still bigger inflation he said 
although solidarity has not yet been legalized again the rally 
had permission from local authorities 
police posted near the entrances did not interfere as supporters 
with solidarity banners lined up to enter the stadium gates which 
were supervised by volunteers wearing redandwhite union armbands 
solidarity the first independent union movement in the soviet 
bloc was founded in 1980 and outlawed after the 1981 imposition of 
martial law 
for the past two weeks walesa has traveled poland to explain to 
the unions rankandfile his decision to enter into the discussions 
and appealing for time to let the talks produce results 
people are being restrained only because of the round table 
said zenon kuchler a textile workers and veteran solidarity 
activist if not they would be striking everyone has a stomach 
we have to eat 
spectators who came from the textile mills and clothing 
factories scattered throughout the city and suburbs seemed amazed 
at the sight of the cavernous hall being used again for an official 
solidarity meeting 
this is a second coming said kuchler there was a birth 
and now a rebirth 
walesa told the crowd poland belongs to all of us the problem 
is too serious to try and win something as the party as the 
security forces as slowiks the local solidarity leader group or 
walesas group 
he was referring to lodz solidarity leader andrzej slowiks past 
criticism of walesas leadership including a 1987 decision to use 
union funds given by the us congress to fund a health commission 
that has purchased ambulances for public use 
lets do something so that our factories are not political 
they should be places where we come to work hard and where we are 
paid well walesa said we are not more stupid or worse than the 
rest of europe we are simply badly governed 
gesturing and mixing humor with serious arguments walesa charmed 
the crowd and was frequently interrupted by applause one questioner

the former chairman of the house intelligence 
committee resisted attempts by oliver l norths chief lawyer 
wednesday to prove that congress leaked like a sieve and 
couldnt be trusted with secrets 
rep lee hamilton dind the first prosecution witness against 
the fired national security council aide firmly defended the house 
permanent select committee on intelligences record of protecting 
some of the nations most closely guarded secrets 
from 1984 1985 and 1986 leaks occurred on capital hill as a 
result of members and staff members who provided information said 
norths chief defense attorney brendan v sullivan jr 
the late cia director william casey told me he didnt know 
a single leak from the house intelligence committee hamilton 
replied i will not deny leaks but neither can i prove any such 
leaks 
sullivan is trying to prove that north who is charged with lying 
to congress about his role in the irancontra affair had a 
wellfounded fear of telling lawmakers the truth about covert 
operations 
in his opening statement tuesday sullivan told jurors that it 
was the perception of the national security council and the 
president of the united states that the congress of the united 
states leaked like a sieve 
and sullivan tried to make the same point during lengthy 
crossexamination of hamilton who chaired the intelligence panel 
when it questioned north and thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane about news reports in 1985 and 1986 about covert us 
support of the nicaraguan contras despite a congressional ban 
hamilton acknowledged that selective leaking of classified 
information is a game played by the powerful people in washington to 
influence policy 
information in this town is power hamilton said if you 
control the flow of information you can profoundly affect the 
public policy process if information that is classified is released 
it can somehow impact on public policy 
but hamilton denied a suggestion by sullivan that he threatened 
in a 1985 letter to thensecretary of state george shultz to leak 
information about a secret cia intelligence asset apparently to 
force the intelligence agency to sever its relationship 
i did not threaten to leak anything hamilton said i was 
prepared to follow certain procedures of the house intelligence 
committee to try to release information 
if i had succeeded in that it would have been an authorized 
disclosure and not a leak hamilton said i did not threaten the 
secretary of state with a leak 
the exchange between sullivan and hamilton also highlighted the 
difficulties posed by airing classified information in a public 
trial 
sullivan showed hamilton his letter to shultz which the defense 
attorney described as discussing a mans relationship with the 
cia 
i dont know if i can comment on the contents of this letter 
hamilton said 
you dont have to comment on the mans identity sullivan 
said 
hamilton said he took no action after meeting with shultz the 
secretary agreed with my point of view 
sullivan also questioned hamilton about an instance when the cia 
briefed the house intelligence committee in late 1984 and a report 
about the classified information was published in a newspaper the 
very next day 
i do not assume for a moment that the leak came from capitol 
hill hamilton said there are very experienced people in the 
administration who leak information after it comes to the congress

a special council of afghan resistance 
leaders was suspended for a second day wednesday while a committee 
hammered out plans for an interim government for afghanistan 
the cloistered committee of guerrilla field commanders and 
scholars was handed the job of proposing a provisional government 
after rebel leaders paralyzed by differences failed to make any 
headway rebel sources said 
at the united nations meanwhile the afghan government again 
accused pakistan and the united states of supporting afghan rebel 
raids and asked for un help 
nobody knows where they committee members are not even the 
leaders said wahab a spokesman for the yunis khalis faction of

delays and suspensions have marked the shura since it convened feb 
10 
days of acrimonious debate among the top political leaders of the 
seven major guerrilla parties based in pakistan failed to come up 
with a consensus on an interim government 
it stagnated a rebel spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity delegates to the council have become very fed up with 
too many delays and too much fuss 
shiite afghan guerrillas based in iran where about 2 million 
afghan war refugees live have boycotted the shura alleging unfair 
representation 
the pakistanibased fighters belong to the sunni sect of islam 
as do most of afghanistans 15 million people 
the pakistanbased afghan fighters who are supported by the 
united states are loosely divided into islamic moderates and 
fundamentalists 
the political maneuvering by afghan guerrillas called mujahedeen 
or islamic warriors assumes the ruling communists in kabul will be 
toppled now that moscow has ended its military intervention there 
the guerrillas are fighting to establish an islamic republic in 
afghanistan and they have predicted the government will fall within

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
met with his israeli counterpart and plo chief yasser arafat on 
wednesday and he said peace in the mideast is impossible without 
soviet help and israeli good will 
shevardnadze in his new role as middle east matchmaker held 
separate threehour meetings with israels foreign minister moshe 
arens and arafat who came to the soviet embassy dressed in military 
fatigues and packing a pistol 
radio moscow attacked the united states on wednesday for what it 
called an attempt to undermine shevardnadzes peace mission 
the radios hebrewlanguage broadcast monitored in jerusalem 
said the united states encouraged arens to adopt a tough stand at 
his meeting with shevardnadze it also criticized president bush for 
his statement tuesday that moscows role in the middle east peace 
talks should be limited 
arafat in a departure from previous positions said on wednesday 
that he was willing to hold preliminary talks with israel before the 
convening of a proposed international peace conference 
do you want us to go today to moscow have you another choice 
if they israelis are ready to go just now we are ready he said 
but arens rejected any meeting with arafat or the palestine 
liberation organization which israel regards as terrorist he said 
jordan or palestinians from the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip should serve as negotiators 
talking to arafats organization cannot be conducive to the 
peace process at all arens said the plo is the major obstacle 
to peace in the area at the present time 
shevardnadze told reporters that it will take some time for 
israel to make concessions and accept his proposal for an 
international conference 
i think that sooner or later the israelis will understand that 
this need for flexibility is imperative because the conference 
will also mean guarantees for the security of israel and that 
country needs those guarantees he said 
describing his effort as an act of creative work 
shevardnadze staked out a role for the soviets in efforts to arrange 
peace negotiations his initiative appeared to challenge the united 
statess preeminence as the only effective broker of peace in the 
middle east 
without good will on the part of israel there can be no 
solution to this conflict but without the soviet union there 
can be no peace process shevardnadze said 
at a news conference arens indicated israel was dropping its 
condition that the kremlin renew diplomatic ties before it can 
participate in the search for regional peace 
i dont believe restoring diplomatic relations can or should be 
a precondition he said 
shevardnadze did not announce restoration of diplomatic relations 
with israel as some israeli newspapers had speculated he would 
but the countries set up a mechanism for expanded dialogue aimed 
at reaching a basis of agreement on an approach to middle east 
peacemaking 
despite their pleasant words however there were no signs of a 
narrowing of differences on the biggest obstacles to bringing the 
two sides together convening an international conference and the 
plos role in the peace process 
arens said hours after returning home from cairo that his talks 
with shevardnadze created a basis of understanding despite 
differences of opinion on peace in the middle east 
noting that israel and the soviet union agreed to hold further 
meetings he remarked i have an impression this naturally leads 
to normalization of relations between the two countries 
in jerusalem a top plo official said in a taped message that 
israel should hold direct talks with his group 
the realistic solution is that we live side by side and that we 
walk the path of peace salah khalaf the no 2 man in the plo 
said in a videotape shown at a peace symposium 
but arens repeatedly stressed that israel should negotiate with 
neighboring arab states not with the plo 
arens urged that jordans king hussein speak for the 
palestinians but he said if thats not possible we need to find 
interlocutors amongst residents of the west bank and jordan who 
can speak for the population 
he said its up to arab states in the region to change their 
positions and declare their willingness to talk peace we want 
peace more than any other party but it takes two to tango arens 
said 
an israeli official said on condition of anonymity that 
shevardnadzes 10day trip through the region has given momentum to 
peace efforts nevertheless he said its not yet at a gallop

a top plo official wednesday urged israel to 
hold direct talks with the organization and said the palestinian 
charter calling for destruction of the jewish state is open to 
discussion 
salah khalaf the no 2 man in the palestine liberation 
organization spoke in a videotaped appeal to every child in 
israel every woman and every man the 15minute video was taped 
in tunisia smuggled into israel and screened at a peace symposium 
in jerusalem 
the realistic solution is that we live side by side and that we 
walk the path of peace said khalaf known by his nom de guerre 
abu iyad some people wonder if this coexistence is a first stage 
we answer no we want a definite settlement 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip nine palestinians were 
wounded in clashes with troops arab doctors said 
in the west bank village of beit amin residents found the body 
of muhammed abed suleiman 25 who was suspected of cooperating with 
israeli authorities police said the body was found in a well 
the army said it was checking the reports 
at least 384 palestinians and 16 israelis have been killed since 
the palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and 
gaza strip began in december 1987 
in what appeared to be a conciliatory gesture khalaf diverged 
from previous plo positions and called for direct talks with israel 
in the past the plo has insisted that negotiations be held in the 
framework of an international middle east peace conference 
we believe in direct meetings we are ready for such meetings 
and we say it publicly let the israelis come and meet us secretly 
openly or in any other way we are anxious for such a meeting 
khalaf said speaking in arabic and sitting next to a large 
palestinian flag 
reporters were given a written english translation 
what is important for us is that these meetings and contacts 
and dialogues take place in advance of the conference so that the 
conference itself becomes the form in which to bring our agreement 
to fruition he said 
liberal and leftist israeli legislators have met in recent weeks 
with faisal husseini a top plo supporter in jerusalem and with plo 
officials abroad 
husseini who also spoke at the symposium said he and other 
palestinian notables could not serve as a substitute for talks with 
the plo 
we shall continue to emphasize the indivisibility of the 
palestinian people as well as the necessity of involving the plo in 
any future settlement he said 
as husseini spoke about 10 israelis wearing skullcaps a mark of 
observant jews interrupted his speech 
dirty arab plo garbage shouted one before being dragged out 
by a policeman police later returned to search for bombs 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has rejected the 
international conference and any contacts with the plo which he 
considers a terrorist organization 
khalaf responded to israeli fears the plos moderate stance was 
just a ploy to trick israel 
calling for a palestinian state alongside israel he said all 
other matters are open to discussion our covenant and yours can be 
discussed he was referring to the palestinian national charter 
which calls for the destruction of israel 
does any israeli really believe in his heart that it is 
possible to destroy 5 million palestinians we have asked a similar 
question of ourselves and have concluded that we cannot destroy the 
israelis khalaf said 
the videotape was shown at a symposium on the arabisraeli 
conflict organized by the international center for peace in the 
middle east a private tel aviv think tank headed by former israeli 
foreign minister abba eban

the dominant christian democrats on wednesday elected 
arnaldo forlani as party secretary a position often called the most 
powerful in italian politics 
forlani replaces prime minister ciriaco de mita as party 
secretary despite de mitas statements that forlani is too 
conservative for his government 
in a speech earlier wednesday de mita criticized forlanis call 
for closer links with conservative roman catholic groups and said 
the party could go into an electoral decline as it did in the 
mid1970s 
de mita also said he would remain head of the government only if 
he receives backing for his policies aimed at cutting the huge 
public deficit 
forlanis election marked a return to a more traditional 
leadership of the party de mita is considered part of the partys 
left wing and forlani is a moderate 
the new party secretary promised not to bring down de mitas 
10monthold government a coalition that includes the socialists 
liberals social democrats and republicans 
forlani 63 the only candidate for the post won about 85 
percent of the votes cast by more than 1300 delegates according to 
an announcement by the president of the party congress amintore 
fanfani 
in a speech after his election forlani referred to the 
controversy over de mitas being head of both the party and the 
government some party members felt the arrangement concentrated too 
much power in one persons hands 
what then is the debate about this dichotomy forlani asked 
a cheering crowd of delegates is it for reasons of jealousy 
a thing of personality factions or ambition 
turning to de mita he said i believe that in our relations 
there will never be room for elements of this kind 
as secretary of the christian democrats forlani will direct 
party policy and preside over a vast patronage system that includes 
top jobs in state industry banking and radio and television 
forlani 63 was secretary of the party from 196973 and later 
served eight months as premier resigning in 1981 when italy 
underwent its worst postwar political scandal 
he stepped down as premier when two members of his cabinet were 
linked to the propaganda due p2 masonic lodge which was accused 
of plotting to overthrow italys constitutional system forlani was 
never accused of membership 
the christian democrats have dominated every government for four 
decades

police raided homes in the capital and a 
northern city and rounded up nine associates of a suspect in the 
flight 103 bombing and an attack on a greek cruise ship authorities 
said wednesday 
the suspected swedishbased terrorist cell led by samir muhammed 
khadar was linked to the abu nidal palestinian group said police 
spokesman leif hallberg 
police also displayed an array of weapons they said was 
designated for a planned attack in sweden and were seized in august 
near khadars home 
hallberg told a news conference five people were informed they 
were suspects in a criminal investigation for planning sabotage 
the notice is the first step of an arrest procedure 
we wanted them to know that we are keeping our eyes on them and 
that we dont tolerate terrorism he said 
the roundup of suspects followed searches of homes in stockholm 
and umea 430 miles north of the capital 
hallberg police questioned the group that included men and women 
swedish and foreign nationals including stateless palestinians 
all were released while the investigation continued he said 
the key to the alleged terrorist cell was found after khadar a 
palestinian resident of stockholm posing as a businessman was 
linked to the assault on the greek cruise ship city of poros 
last july 11 in which nine people died 
khadar was identified by greek police as the planner of the 
attack he was originally reported to have died in a car explosion 
in athens hours before the assault but police said wednesday there 
were contradictory reports on whether he was still alive 
other reports linked khadar described as the operations chief of 
the abu nidal group to the december explosion of pan am flight 103 
over scotland which killed 270 people 
reporters were shown an arms cache found in august near khadars 
home in a stockholm suburb near arlanda international airport

ammunition clips 17 f1 hand grenades and two pistols with silencers 
also on display were bags of plastic explosives similar to but 
not identical with the semtex explosives investigators believe were 
used in the pan am bombing 
it is very difficult to get such a large amount of weapons into 
the country hallberg said that is why were convinced they 
were going to be used in an attack within our borders 
about 10 other people were brought in for questioning as 
witnesses halberg said the national tt news agency said one of 
them was khadars finnishborn wife whose name has not been

federal governmental system and staffing 
problems were cited by witnesses who testified wednesday at a senate 
hearing on sexual abuse of children on indian reservations 
its not that child sex abuse is inherently worse among indians 
than elsewhere in society said jane burnley director of the 
justice departments office for victims of crime 
its that the federal government which has jurisdiction over 
indian reservations does not have the mechanisms to respond to the 
problems the way states do she said after she testified before a 
special unit of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
larry blythe told the committee that his 2yearold daughter and 
6yearold son were attacked in 1984 on a cherokee reservation in 
western north carolina 
he said defendants were convicted but their life sentences were 
overturned on appeal because prosecutors had used a state law to 
obtain convictions and state laws do not apply to crimes on indian 
reservations 
in another trial he said prosecutors searched federal statutes 
for provisions referring to rape and while such a crime against 
females was covered similar acts on males were not in his sons 
case a defendant pleaded guilty last spring to assault causing 
bodily harm and got a 10year sentence blythe said 
he said federal statutes have since been amended for cases such 
as those involving his children but that similar loopholes likely 
exist for other types of crimes 
burnley said that since that federal law was amended in 1986 
many more cases of sex abuse on reservations have come to light but 
arranging help for victims has been difficult 
victims compensation has grown tremendously as a way of 
funding treatment for victims of child abuse but not in indian 
country she told the committee 
she said about 2 million for fiscal 1989 was earmarked by the 
federal government for such cases among indians and indians are 
eligible to apply to state governments for money from their victims 
funds but she said indian reservations are usually in remote areas 
where communication and transportation are poor making therapy much 
more difficult than elsewhere in society 
additionally the panel was told the bureau of indian affairs 
and the indian health service do not have staff people on the 
reservations trained to provide therapy for child sex abuse 
it takes time to teach people what happens to children in these 
situations said penny coleman who is with the solicitors office 
of the interior department 
instead of local police she said the fbi investigates the cases 
on reservations but fbi agents are not trained specifically for 
handling child abuse cases and the agency has comparatively small 
staffs for the volume of work in indian crime 
linda guy social services specialist in the bureau of indian 
affairs said there have been so many changes in leadership in her 
department that it is nearly impossible to handle child sex abuse 
cases 
robert delaware acting head of the bureaus social services 
division told the panel he was the sixth acting chief since august 
1986 and that he had little knowledge of the child molestation cases 
i was put there to keep the administrative portion going 
said delaware 
sen thomas daschle dsd a member of the investigating unit 
said that i dont care if you are acting director for one day or 
three months the impression you leave is that it is not your job 
leave it to someone else 
i can understand the frustration of the people on the 
reservation were failing at this daschle said

striking nurses and attendants were divided 
wednesday on whether to obey a backtowork court order but the 
governor said a settlement was near after the two sides negotiated 
for the first time in five days 
gov edward d diprete who called in the national guard to care 
for the 410 patients at general hospital when the walkout began 
sunday night said workers who didnt take up their posts thursday 
morning would be fired 
a hospital spokesman said for the 3 pm shift 32 of 66 
scheduled attendants reported as did 11 of 14 registered nurses and 
8 of 15 licensed practical nurses a judge had set a 3 pm 
backtowork deadline 
people are coming back to work in the spirit of abiding by the 
court order said hospital director james p benedict 
after a union meeting wednesday afternoon some members walked 
out chanting no work no work 
diprete who called both sides together for negotiations at his 
office had said earlier a settlement was possible only if the 
workers ended their threeday walkout 
national guard troops remained at the hospital wednesday thirty 
acutecare patients have been transferred to other facilities 
benedict said 
the hospital provides longterm care for the chronically ill a 
major factor leading to the strike was a complaint about low 
staffing at the hospital 
three hours of talks the first since negotiations broke off 
friday ended with some concessions but no agreement said gerard p 
cobleigh an attorney with local 1350 of the american federation of 
state county and municipal employees there are some numbers they 
have agreed on he said 
diprete who traveled to washington after the meeting said if 
necessary he would bring both sides back to the table no new 
negotiations were scheduled 
i think the ingredients are right here on the table for a 
longlasting settlement to what has been a longterm problem 
diprete said 
he refused to give details but said the states offer of a 
53centanhour pay raise rejected ovewhelmingly by union members 
was still available the increase would have raised attendants 
starting salaries from 16600 to 17600 and nurses starting wages 
from 18800 to 20000 
a hearing before superior court judge antonio almeida who 
imposed the backtowork deadline was scheduled for thursday on the 
states request for sanctions the union estimated possible fines of 
200 per day per person for violating the order 
after the union meeting one member who would not give his name 
said members had voted to stay off the job he said union president 
joseph fargnoli told members a settlement was near and in a few 
days well be going back to work 
henry griggs a union spokesman said no vote had been taken 
fargnoli said he encouraged them to go back to work as 
outlined in the courtorder i guess they decided on an individual 
basis whether or not to report to work 
roberta reels a union member said she would return to her job 
i do want to honor the picket line i really do but the court 
has issued an order for us to go back to work and im going back to 
work she said 
diprete said union members had no choice but to return to work 
the issue on the table right now is is the union going to obey 
the court order he said

including more than 1000 miners occupying their pits since monday 
stayed off the job wednesday in the troubled province of kosovo

the provincial communist leadership held an urgent session 
wednesday afternoon in the regions capital of pristina assessing 
the security situation in kosovo as extremely critical 
fearing a possibility of open ethnic clashes between the albanian 
majority and slav minority in the province a communist party 
organization of yugoslavias federal institutions issued an appeal 
for the use of primarily political means in seeking an urgent 
stop to the politically motivated labor unrest 
responding to miners demands yugoslav communist party chief 
stipe suvar was likely to tour the tense region to try and defuse 
the growing threat of a general strike in the province belgrade 
television said

belgrade declined to specify whether or when suvar would go to 
kosovo saying everything will be known soon 
belgrade radio estimated that more than 10000 ethnic albanians 
stopped work wednesday in virtually all municipalities of the

police officers no longer will 
arrest nonwhites using municipal facilities in violation of local 
segregation laws the state radio reported wednesday 
the radio said officers from now on will enforce provisions of 
the separate amenities act only if they receive a complaint 
in such cases the alleged offender will be asked to provide 
information and will be advised that court procedings may ensue but 
will not be held in custody 
the radio said the new procedures were outlined in a circular 
being distributed to officers by police headquarters 
the separate amenities act adopted in 1953 empowers local and 
provincial officials to segregate public facilities such as parks 
libraries beaches and sports facilities many municipalities have 
opened some of these facilities to all races in recent years many 
other cities and towns maintain segregation 
the governing national party has been widely accused of hypocrisy 
recently because of its harsh criticism of a resegregation campaign 
undertaken in towns where the extremeright conservative party won 
in local elections last fall 
critics noted that the conservative party by restoring 
whitesonly status at parks and other facilities was acting in full 
accordance with the separate amenities act critics also noted that 
public facilities remain segregated in many towns controlled by the 
national party

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and other democrats on wednesday challenged president 
bushs assessment that an fbi report on john tower had gunned 
down allegations against the defense secretarydesignate 
i did not agree with the presidents assessment of this latest 
segment of the fbi report the presidents entitled to his view 
but i think most people reading that would not come to that same 
conclusion said sen sam nunn dga after he chaired a 
threehour closeddoor session of the committee 
nunn said the panel is waiting for more material from the white 
house on the embattled nomination as well as a transcript from a 
separate investigation that a house subcommittee is conducting into 
alleged security lapses in the arms control delegation in geneva in 
1986 while tower was a member 
congressional sources said the subcommittee heard testimony 
wednesday from a former secretary to the arms control delegation who 
said that before her subcommittee appearance she felt she was 
intimidated by white house staff 
deborah baker told the panel that on tuesday she met with white 
house staff who stressed that tower was the presidents nominee and 
emphasized to her the serious implications of her testimony said 
the sources who requested anonymity 
baker served as secretary to retired air force lt col robert 
moser whose request for a department of energy security clearance 
is part of the subcommittees inquiry 
calls to baker who is employed at the white house were not 
immediately returned 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the subcommittee told 
reporters afterward he was particularly troubled that there 
appears to have been an attempt made to limit the testimony of one 
of the witnesses to the committee 
the panel also heard testimony wednesday from berne indahl a 
state department security officer who had been sent to geneva in 
1986 to investigate allegations of security breaches in the us 
delegation 
an office of personnel management review of mosers request for 
the doe security clearance included allegations that tower kept both 
his secretaries in geneva as mistresses said the sources 
indahl on sunday corroborated the review including the charges 
against tower the sources said 
nunn said the committee will meet again in executive session 
thursday and decide whether to vote on the nomination it is my 
hope and i am sure it is senator warners hope that we can vote 
tomorrow afternoon nunn said 
sen jeff bingaman dnm said he thought bush was being 
overly generous in his characterization of the fbi report 
and even the ranking republican on the committee john warner of 
virginia said reasonable men and women could look at these 
stated facts and have differences of opinion 
at least one democrat said he will vote against the nomination 
citing his concerns about towers drinking habits 
ive made a decision not withstanding the expertise of john 
tower on defense matters that after careful consideration its my 
considered judgment that we should look elsewhere for a secretary of 
defense sen james exon dneb told reporters therefore i 
will be voting no 
sen tim wirth dcolo said he was deeply skeptical 
one day after bush said the latest fbi report had gunned down 
the allegations of towers excessive drinking a parade of committee 
democrats said the lengthy background check left them with lingering 
questions about towers drinking 
it is not the clean bill of health that one would have us 
believe exon told reporters 
if he tower hadnt touched anything but a couple of glasses 
of wine at dinner since 1982 i wouldnt be concerned there are 
parts of the reports that indicate that several people dont think 
thats the case exon said 
even senate minority leader bob dole of kansas said bush wasnt 
totally accurate in his assessment of the fbi report but dole 
told reporters theres nothing in that report that any 
fairminded person reading it would disqualify tower 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said the full 
senate would take up the nomination next week 
another democrat sen carl levin of michigan questioned 
anonymous white house officials who have been quoted in published 
reports in recent days as saying the report found tower had a 
drinking problem in the 1970s but no longer does 
that is not an accurate description of that file said levin 
the michigan senator said he is waiting for the white house to 
respond to additional questions that the committee has submitted 
before deciding on the nomination 
republicans were generally supportive of the nominees 
confirmation chances after reviewing the 140page fbi report on 
allegations of towers drinking habits womanizing and business 
irregularities 
sen john mccain rariz said he saw nothing in the report to 
disqualify the former texas senator from serving as head of the 
pentagon 
weve been at this now for 10 weeks were starting to affect 
national security this process could go on forever we need a 
secretary of defense mccain said 
in statements in the senate chamber dole said there had been a 
lot of garbage heaped upon this nominee in the last 30 days enough 
garbage heaped on anybody begins to have an impact after awhile 
but sen alan dixon dill said he had reservations about 
taking a vote thursday 
id have to say theres a lot of hearsay and innuendo in there 
the fbis latest background report on towers activities on the 
other hand there are some substantive things that i think need 
further evaluation dixon said

the justice department must collect and 
publicize data on hate crimes so attacks against people based on 
race religion ethnic background and sexual orientation can be 
fought more effectively lawmakers from both parties said wednesday 
there is prejudice abroad in the land by ignoring it we 
silently condone it said rep barbara b kennelly dconn by 
documenting its existence incident by incident we are forced to 
face its reality whereby we begin to find a solution 
such hate crimes are now reported to the federal government only 
as assaults arson vandalism threats or homicides without details 
of their roots in discrimination 
the house passed the hate crime statistics act last year but the 
measure died in the senate 
congressional aides said the measure failed last year because 
sen jesse helms rnc wanted to strip out mention of sexual 
preference in the final days of the session sen paul simon 
dill the bills senate author refused and time ran out 
but this year advocates are confident the bill will be enacted 
an aide to helms said she did not know what position the 
conservative senator would take on the legislation but supporters 
said they were pushing the measure early to give themselves enough 
time to circumvent any helms opposition 
proponents again vowed not to remove the sexual preference 
language from the bill maine attorney general james tierney warned 
that such a move could send a signal of condoning crimes against 
homosexuals 
simon planned to bring the measure up for a vote in the senate 
judiciary committee as early as next week and mrs kennelly 
predicted easy passage in the house 
baltimore county police col leonard j supenski said the measure 
would have a tangible effect on police trying to cope with hate 
crimes by pointing out problem areas and trends 
we simply must have reliable information said supenski 
who is involved what happened what does it look like where is 
it happening how often to how many victims by whom answers to 
these questions are important in assessing the needs of the victim 
and the community in order to determine appropriate police 
response 
you cant deal with the problem if you dont know the reality

gov gerald l baliles says he will sign a 
measure making virginia the first state in the south to ban school 
spankings but adds that he sometimes used corporal punishment with 
his two children 
it was not ruled out but it was used very rarely baliles 
who has a son in high school and a daughter in college said tuesday 
after the senate voted 2218 to pass a prohibition on corporal 
punishment in public schools 
the measure was approved by the house of delegates earlier this 
month on an 8611 vote 
only 13 other states none in the south have banned school 
paddlings 
almost every local school board in virginia has a policy 
discouraging the practice said rondle e edwards assistant 
superintendent of public instruction 
but virginia law allowed the reasonable use of spankings so 
district policies did not legally prohibit teachers and school 
officials from the practice said del v thomas forehand jr 
sponsor of the ban 
in the senate debate supporters said spanking sends a might 
makes right message to youngsters that violence by authority 
figures is acceptable 
sen mark l earley said the office of civil rights reported 
11301 instances of corporal punishment in virginia schools in 1986 
and 90 percent was directed at children between 5 and 9 years old 
most of those spanked were minority handicapped or learning 
disabled students he said 
sen dudley j emick jr said youngsters who need spanking should 
get it at home not in school 
anyone outside the family who does it is in big trouble at 
the emick household he said 
opponents said the elimination of corporal punishment sends the 
wrong message to parents concerned about increasing discipline 
problems in the classroom 
a whack on the wrist or a spank on the rear is a better 
alternative than putting a disruptive child on the streets said 
sen r edward houck who is an assistant principal 
the virginia education association a lobbying organization for 
teachers and the virginia pta supported forehands bill as did 
associations representing school boards and school administrators 
the measure allows teachers to use physical contact to maintain 
order and control quell a disturbance protect themselves or 
others prevent a student from harming himself or seize weapons or 
illegal drugs 
tommy neal a research analyst with the national conference of 
state legislatures said the 13 states that have banned corporal 
punishment in schools are california hawaii maine massachusetts 
nebraska new hampshire new jersey new york rhode island 
vermont wisconsin michigan and maryland

writers nationwide protested wednesday against 
the islamic death warrant for author salman rushdie and the 
controversy led a book company to reverse its decision to pull the 
the satanic verses from store shelves 
the b dalton bookstore chain and its subsidiary barnes amp noble 
said wednesday afternoon that they would resume selling the book 
because of the urging of an overwhelming majority of its store 
managers and employees 
the announcement came after a day of protest including a march 
on a b dalton and a barnes amp noble store and a reading of 
excerpts from the book 
i write controversial books what publisher is now going to 
take chances with a controversial book asked activist abbie 
hoffman one of about 300 members of the national writers union who 
marched in driving rain outside the iranian mission to the united 
nations 
similar protests were staged in washington and boston with more 
rallies or panel discussions of the book planned later in the day in 
chicago san francisco minneapolis and elsewhere wednesday marked 
the official american publication date of the book which was 
published last fall in britain 
more than 300 people heard some of the nations most celebrated 
writers norman mailer larry mcmurtry gay talese and el 
doctorow among them read from rushdies work 
susan sontag president of the pen american center the writers 
group that sponsored the reading said the threat against rushdie 
was an act of international terrorism against the life of the 
mind against human lives 
she read a statement from rushdies americanborn wife writer 
marianne wiggins who along with her husband is in hiding 
writers everywhere have been weighed and measured by the edict 
from iran ms wiggins said we are a dangerous breed and always 
have been because words outlive their authors only fear can 
stop a writers writing only fear can stop a book from being sold 
mailer lashed out at booksellers who stopped selling the book 
such merchants seem to have more respect for terrorists than for 
culture he said 
security guards searched bags of each person attending the 
reading about two dozen moslems protested across the street with 
signs reading satanic verses is blasphemous and rushdie is a 
friend of satan 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and others in the islamic 
world consider rushdies book blasphemous they have issued death 
threats against the author and his publishers rushie is an 
indianborn moslem living in britain 
at the protest outside the iranian mission security guards 
rebuffed national writers union president alec dubro trying to 
deliver a letter expressing outrage at the death threats 
the writers then marched to two b daltons and barnes amp nobles 
fifth avenue book stores the two chains had pulled the book from 
store shelves in several cities waldenbooks the nations largest 
chain also withdrew the book from display but said in a statement 
wednesday store managers continue selling the books where 
available 
to see book stores caving in like that to demagoguery is 
horrifying said author laura shapiro 
former president carter joined in the criticism of booksellers 
who removed the book from shelves calling it a disgrace 
fundamentalists anonymous a group organized to counter the 
influence of religious fundamentalists called for a fourweek 
boycott of the store chains the overseas press club of america also 
issued a statement condemning the booksellers as having demonstrated 
that terrorism and ignorance do pay 
and carole simpson stern president of the american association 
of university professors said booksellers who suspended sales of 
the book dishonored themselves 
the proper response to a government that proposes a bounty for 
the murder of the author of some book it finds offensive is not to 
suppress the book the proper response is to give that book safe 
sanctuary as will make clear the futility of trying to kill ideas by 
killing authors and burning their books she said 
not all bookstores have followed the lead of the big chains 
the association of american publishers the american booksellers 
association and the american library association took out a 
fullpage ad in wednesdays new york times to declare that they 
would ensure that copies of the satanic verses remain available 
in stores and libraries 
in washington about 75 people including novelist barbara 
raskin protested outside the office of iranian interest irans 
representative in the nations capital 
leaders of the two groups that organized the protest arthur j 
kropp president of people for the american way and noelle mcafee 
of the national writers union were allowed inside to present a 
petition opposing the death threats 
in both boston and san francisco crowds of about 100 people 
picketed peacefully outside b dalton outlets 
elsewhere in massachusetts writers and literary critics planned 
a panel discussion wednesday evening to substitute for a canceled 
appearance by rushdie in cambridge and us rep barney frank said 
he would read passages of the novel into the congressional record to 
show his support for the author

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said wednesday the mounting western 
condemnation of his order to kill novelist salman rushdie has proven 
the futility of normalizing relations with the rest of the world 
irans revolutionary patriarch also declared the publication of 
rushdies the satanic verses was a western plot against islam 
in new york hundreds of writers demonstrated wednesday against 
the order outside the iranian mission to the united nations and at 
two bookstores on fifth avenue b daltons and barnes amp noble 
that pulled the satanic verses from their shelves on friday 
rallies were scheduled in boston washington chicago minneapolis 
and san francisco to coincide with the books official us 
publication date 
later a b dalton spokesman who asked not to be identified 
announced that b dalton and its barnes amp noble subsidiary with 
about 1250 bookstores across the country were reversing 
themselves and will restock the novel 
at the urging of an overwhelming majority of its store managers 
and employees and in light of the statement yesterday by the 
president of the united states we will resume sales of the 
satanic verses he said 
president bush said tuesday he supported west european withdrawal 
of ambassadors from iran on wednesday bush said he found khomeinis 
death threat against rushdie deeply offensive to the norms of 
civilized behavior 
authors in finland and the netherlands also condemned khomeinis 
order wednesday publishers in france west germany greece and 
turkey have canceled plans to publish the book which has been 
banned as blasphemous to islam by at least seven countries 
including india pakistan and egypt 
libya said wednesday it has taken measures to confront 
publication of the novel the dispatch by the official jana agency 
monitored in rome did not elaborate 
a conference of moslem theologians in saudi arabia said the 
author who was born in india into a moslem family should stand 
trial in an islamic country for his novel the saudi newspaper 
alsharq alawsata reported wednesday 
rushdies wife american novelist marianne wiggins canceled a 
us bookpromotion tour to stay with her husband who is in hiding 
in britain she had planned the tour to promote john dollar her 
latest novel 
west germany called on the un security council to take up the 
iranian threats 
west german tv said the cabinet also discussed further 
measures against iran if the mullahs adhere to the execution 
order against rushdie then economic sanctions will no longer be 
ruled out the zdf network reported 
west germany irans biggest trading partner already has decided 
to remove its ambassador from tehran as part of an action by the 12 
european economic community countries 
khomeini said economic sanctions will not change his stance 
the wests stinging reaction has exposed its true nature and 
longstanding hostility so that we can come out of this state of 
naivety tehran radio quoted khomeini as saying 
god wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer 
think in simplistic ways he was quoted by the radio report which 
was monitored in cyprus 
branding critics misled liberals he denounced those who 
still believe that we should revise our policy and diplomatic 
principles that our blunt slogans and war caused the west and 
the east to become pessimistic about us and if we react 
realistically they would reciprocate humanely and would respect 
moslems 
the statement underlined indications that tehrans actions in the 
rushdie controversy stemmed as much from the power struggle in the 
iranian hierarchy than from religious outrage 
hardliners argue such changes will threaten the 10yearold 
islamic republic and bring moral decay 
as long as i am alive i will not let the state fall into the 
hands of liberals as long as i am alive i will never stop 
cutting off the hands of agents of the united states and the 
ussr he was quoted as saying 
at the beginning of the revolution we gave posts to people who 
were not totally with us in ideology and the bitter results of that 
are plainly evident 
he mentioned no names in the statement but it appeared directed 
at several iranian leaders who have in recent weeks called for a 
relaxation of political social and religious restrictions following 
the aug 20 ceasefire in the war against iraq 
president ali khamenei had said friday that khomeinis order 
might be rescinded if rushdie apologized but on wednesday in 
belgrade yugoslavia he said there is no solution 
an arrow has been shot and it is unerringly aimed at its 
target there is nothing more that can be done he said 
iranian clerics have offered 52 million for rushdies murder 
the writer issued an apology saturday but khomeini rejected it 
many moslems say the satanic verses is sacrilegious because 
it casts doubt on central tenets of the islamic faith the book for 
example portrays the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggests he wrote the koran the holy book of islam rather than 
receiving it from god 
in other related developments 
antiterrorist police on wednesday guarded a plant in cles 
italy where the satanic verses was being printed and italians 
placed hundreds of orders for it as a publisher prepared to release 
a second run of the controversial book 
a firebomb was thrown at the dormitory of londons main mosque 
early wednesday and a newspaper reported that detectives were 
investigating whether it was prompted by antimoslem backlash to the 
rushdie affair police refused comment and no one was injured in 
the blaze which caused minor damage 
iran on wednesday called home its ambassador from stockholm in 
apparent reciprocation for swedens withdrawal of its envoy to 
tehran sweden said it will continue to look after british interests 
in iran britain called home all its embassy staff to protest calls 
for the death of rushdie a british citizen

missing an opportunity that may not return he said 
the arab league mediation effort aims to prevent formal partition 
of lebanon into sectarian cantons after more than 13 years of civil 
war the strife between moslems and christians has been compounded 
by parliaments failure to elect a successor to outgoing christian 
president amin gemayel five months ago 
before stepping down sept 22 gemayel appointed michael aoun a 
christian to head an interim cabinet syrianbacked moslem leaders 
rejected the appointment and backed salim hoss who formed a rival

sect the presidency to the maronite christians and the position of 
parliament speaker to a shiite moslem

members of president bushs ethics commission 
agreed wednesday that senior officials of all three branches of 
government should be barred from accepting fees for speeches and 
articles whether or not they get a pay raise 
the evil of honoraria is so great from the appearance of a 
conflict of interest said former attorney general griffin bell 
in proposing a ban on the fees people wonder whos paying all 
these honoraria it undermines confidence in government 
all eight members agreed though there was debate over whether to 
couple this idea with a recommendation for a pay raise 
the tentative conclusions were reached at the third meeting of 
the eightmember panel appointed to recommend ways to stiffen and 
standardize federal ethics laws and rules its final recommendations 
are due on bushs desk march 9 
under enormous public pressure congress recently voted down 50 
percent pay raises for the top officials throughout the government 
even though that recommendation from the quadrennial commission and 
presidents reagan and bush was coupled with a proposal that members 
of congress stop taking honoraria 
the only former congressman on the ethics panel onetime new 
mexico republican sen harrison schmitt said as a practical 
matter there is no way to divorce these issues from the salary 
issue a salary recommendation has been made but as we can all see 
it cant be implemented 
but judy bello general counsel of the us special trade 
representative replied i support the pay raise but i support 
this ban without the pay raise 
former white house counsel lloyd cutler who chaired the 
quadrennial commission agreed honoraria cannot be justified by 
saying that salaries are too low salaries should be dealt with 
directly 
chairman malcolm r wilkey a former federal appellate judge 
summed up the consensus the practice of honoraria has become 
evil well let others deal with pay questions 
if adopted this would produce a larger impact on congress than 
the executive branch executive branch rules already prohibit any 
honoraria for speeches or articles written on the area of ones 
federal job so very few are offered 
members of congress may accept honoraria for speaking or writing 
on their congressional duties the house allows members to receive 
honoraria up to 30 percent of salary and the senate up to 40 percent 
of salary both houses are paid 89500 a year 
among judges wilkey said ive observed excessive teaching and 
writing basically to earn income 
the panel also agreed that top officials in all three branches of 
government should have their outside income limited to 15 percent of 
their salary again this is the current eecutive branch standard 
and is lower than that used in congress 
but bush has said he wants his top officials to receive no 
outside income the panel endorsed letting presidents set higher 
standards administratively to set an ethical tone as wilkey put 
it 
they also agreed that membership on the board of directors of 
commercial entities ought to be prohibited for top officials in 
government 
bell pointed out this would overturn a rule allowing judges 
remain on the board of familyowned companies 
wilkey replied i think it has to be changed a man just has to 
decide whether he wants to be a judge or not that rule fit the 
ethos of 25 years ago but not now 
they agreed that membership by top officials on nonprofit boards 
should be subject to approval by ethics officers 
on accepting lunches from businessmen and journalists they 
agreed the government should have a uniform standard and they 
preferred the executive branch standard which basically bars them 
to that of congress where the senate allows meals under 50 and the 
house meals under 35 
they also agreed that socalled double dipping laws limiting the 
pension that retired military officers can receive if they take 
civilian federal jobs ought to be revised so that military pensions 
were allowed to be taken in full if vested just like corporate 
pensions 
on financial disclosure the panel agreed to recommend more 
reporting than now required for liabilities and for large assets and 
income they suggested an end to the exemptions for reporting 
mortgages on ones home and for debts to relatives 
they also agreed that asset disclosure should say whether the 
value was over 1 million as opposed to over 250000 now and that 
income disclosure should say whether its was more than 250000 as 
opposed to more than 100000 which is the top disclosure category 
now 
at the same time they recommended that the smaller categories on 
disclosure forms be consolidated somewhat to reduce the risk of 
error and the burden of getting appraisals of nonmarketable assets 
as wilkey put this questions whats the effective difference 
whether an asset is worth 5000 to 15000 or worth 15000 to 
50000 why not just 5000 to 50000

a petition filed with the state supreme 
court on wednesday seeks the overturn of two city bans on 
semiautomatic weapons 
the request for a temporary stay of a los angeles ordinance due 
to take effect thursday and a similar measure already in effect in 
stockton claimed the regulations are preempted by state law 
documents filed with the supreme court on behalf of several 
individuals contended california already has a regulatory program 
governing possession of firearms they also cited a 1982 opinion by 
the state attorney general that cities cannot prohibit possession of 
handguns within their municipal areas 
by overruling the los angeles and stockton measures the petition 
said the court would ensure the effectiveness of the states 
firearms laws against unwarranted interference 
the bans on possession of military style assault rifles were 
approved in the wake of the slaying of five children last month by 
partick e purdy who came to a stockton elementary school and 
opened fire with an ak47 semiautomatic weapon

electronic monitoring device 
the monitor was among the conditions imposed on bernt murphy 51 
who was committed to the state hospital near provo following the 
1957 rape and beating of a 5yearold girl for which murphy was 
found incompetent to stand trial 
in june the utah supreme court ruled that murphy must be freed 
from the hospital because he was mistakenly ruled insane by a judge 
in 1957 
on wednesday district judge pat brian ordered murphy transferred 
to opportunity house on the edge of the hospital property he will 
be allowed to come and go during the day but must report back each 
night 
this deals with the most complex and social problems this court 
or any other district court has ever resolved the judge said 
the judge ruled that in addition to wearing the electronic 
monitoring device murphy must return to court every four months for 
review 
the record should be clear the court will not tolerate 
violations of the order even a child knows the difference between 
right and wrong brian warned the court and the community wish 
you well and have every right to expect youll succeed 
murphy estimated to have the mental capacity of an 8yearold 
cried when he heard the decision 
his attorney brooke wells said murphy feared that the 
electronic monitoring device would somehow shock him but calmed down 
after being assured it would not 
murphy his arm around wells shoulders said i feel great and 
im glad to have it over with ill show them i want a job in 
security 
at opportunity house where he had been tentatively housed prior 
to the hearing wednesday murphy has been in charge of janitorial 
duties and a fish pond 
were not unhappy with this we always knew it would be a 
transitional thing and this is just fine wells said were 
going to see how that works this is an important happy day 
wells said murphy has always wanted to prove he can do things on 
his own and the ruling gives him new freedom 
during questioning about the child rape murphy then 19 
admitted to the 1955 slaying of a 23yearold mentally retarded 
woman he had known at the utah state training school for the 
developmentally disabled in american fork 
murphy later denied killing the woman and was found incompetent 
to stand trial on the rape charge he was declared insane in 1972 
doctors at the state hospital said murphy had been cured of his 
insanity and he was tried on the rape charge and found innocent by 
reason of mental illness the slaying was never solved 
in 1985 an appeal was filed on murphys behalf questioning his 
continued confinement at the hospital 
wells had argued that murphy could do well in a group home with 
other retarded adults but state officials believed he still is 
capable of violent behavior 
deputy salt lake county attorney bud ellett said the supreme 
courts ruling and brians actions wednesday had resolved the murphy 
case and there are no plans to pursue any charges 
hes not insane but is retarded he said

opposition parties met wednesday with 
president daniel ortega to discuss electoral reforms and at least 
one party suggested ortega not run for reelection 
the conservative democratic party which has the largest 
opposition representation in the national assembly with 14 deputies 
also asked for absentee balloting for nicaraguans abroad many of 
whom live in miami 
in a communique issued after party officials met with ortega the 
conservative democrats said although reelection is not 
forbidden it would be convenient for the peaceful coexistence in 
the nation that ortega not present his candidacy for reelection 
ortega has hinted he will run again and seems the likeliest 
choice although the ruling sandinista national liberation front has 
not announced an official candidate 
in spurning early elections the conservative democrats echoed 
the view of other parties that they dont have enough time to 
organize effectively for elections in february 1990 
the party also demanded that no state property or employee be 
used for political propaganda that the military be denied the vote 
and that the number of regional votecounting centers be cut in 
half apparently to allow all parties to have observers at all such 
centers 
a faction of the liberal party met with ortega on wednesday 
this central american country of about 3 million people has 15 
legal political parties seven of them are represented in the 
national assembly 
the 14 opposition parties met tuesday night to discuss ortegas 
offer of renewing talks on reforming electoral laws 
most of us decided not to go but we left the option open for 
whoever wants to attend independently alan zambrana of the 
communist party said wednesday his party declined ortegas 
invitation 
ortega has said negotiations would center on the agreement he and 
the presidents of el salvador honduras costa rica and guatemala 
signed on feb 14 in el salvador 
it calls for nicaragua to institute democratic reforms such as 
giving equal air time to the opposition including opposition 
representatives in the supreme electoral council and allowing 
international observers to oversee general elections which ortega 
moved up by 10 months to feb 25 1990 
any dialogue must be with the entire civic opposition 
zambrana a deputy in the assembly said were not going to lend 
ourselves to the sandinistas game of trying to divide us by 
inviting us to bilateral talks 
it does not appear that the sandinistas would have to make much 
of an effort to divide the opposition already existing are three 
liberal parties four socialchristian parties and three 
conservative parties 
the communist party and the marxistleninist popular action 
movement split the far left each has two deputies in the assembly 
mauricio diaz president of the leftofcenter socialchristian 
popular party initially said his party would talk with ortega then 
said a decision had not been made his party has the secondlargest 
opposition representation in the legislature with six deputies 
eric ramirezs socialchristian party is sending two delegates to 
meet with ortega a party official said

all nippon airways of japan announced wenesday 
an order for 20 boeing 747400s and said negotiations are underway 
for boeing 767s that could raise the total value of the two deals to 
as much as 475 billion 
the sale of 747400s for delivery beginning in 1992 came despite 
boeings inability to meet delivery deadlines for the sophisticated 
jumbo jets to other airlines company chairman f a shrontz said 
the seattlebased company hopes to get back on schedule with a new 
delivery plan 
the order added to six 747400s ana ordered in october makes 
the airline the biggest purchaser of the new model japan air lines 
ordered 20 of the same model in july 1987 british airways ordered 
19 in august 1986 
only one 747400 has been delivered to northwest airlines the 
new model takes a smaller crew has a new wing design saves fuel 
can fly further and can be equipped to carry more passengers than 
the 747300 boeing now has 192 orders for the new plane 
all nippon japans largest airline with 102 planes announced at 
a news conference with boeing officials that it will pay 315 
billion for the 747s including spare parts and general electric 
engines the planes are to be used on both domestic and new 
expanding international routes with delivery of from four to six a 
year between 1992 and 1996 
the 747 sale alone is equal to 57 percent of last years us 
trade deficit with japan ana officials noted 
sigeya goto ana executive vice president said the company is 
also negotiating with boeing to purchase 15 to 20 boeing 767s at a 
cost of 12 billion to 16 billion they would also be delivered 
beginning in 1992 
ana flies more than 27 million passengers a year on 66 domestic 
routes and on international flights to washington dc los 
angeles beijing and dalian china guam sydney seoul and hong 
kong 
next year goto said the airline plans to add flights from tokyo 
to bangkok vienna moscow london and stockholm ana became an 
international airline in 1986 with flights to guam he said the 
airline expects a 30 percent increase in international passengers 
this year 
thanks to the healthy yen japanese citizens are travelling the 
world and consumer demand is increasing steadily he said 
goto said the airline is satisfied boeing has implemented new 
manufacturing procedures that would overcome problems the 
manufacturer has had with miswiring in new aircraft he said that 
with the big order double the number of japanese technicians would 
be sent and their stays at boeing plants would be longer in 
overseeing construction of planes ordered by the airlines 
the boeing chairman in a speech before the international 
aviation club after the announcement said delays in 747400 
deliveries have been a disappointment to us 
shrontz said other purchasers are being advised of a new delivery 
schedule 
we looked at the situation the magnitude of the work that was 
ahead of us and decided we would sacrifice schedule to make sure 
that the product that comes out is a quality and defectfree 
product shrontz said 
he said that recent incidents of crosswiring found in the 
emergency systems of several boeing airliners were not due to the 
push to produce 
i will not say it was isolated because we had more than one i 
will say it tended to be random and i dont think it reflects on any 
quality deterioration its clear we did not do an adequate job in 
preventing defects in the system shrontz said 
he said the problem has been fixed and i dont think youll 
see any more of that 
the 747400 includes a stretched upper deck similar to the one on 
the 747300 but can be equipped to carry up to 509 passengers 
instead of 496 for the earlier model alternatively it can be 
outfitted with extra fuel capacity to give it a range of about 8000 
miles which is 1000 miles further 
the new model also have sixfoot winglets that improve fuel 
economy but extend upward at the ends of the wing so the airliners 
do not take up any more space

dallas 
i used to watch him on tv before we met mrs shaw said i 
liked watching him because he was so rough and tough he had a long 
beard and hair all over 
what caught her eye when they met however was the small scars 
that seemed to cover his 6foot2 265pound frame 
so i asked him what happened and he told me they were from 
people in the stands scratching him with their soda bottle caps as 
he went by because he had been so mean inside the ring she said 
ivan thats what we called him really knew how to work up 
the crowd theyd get furious she said 
mrs shaw said her husband loved playing practical jokes

a 16monthold florida boy who received a 
rare liver and small intestine transplant nearly two months ago died 
wednesday 
calvin oliveiras death was caused by a respiratory system 
failure said dr munci kalayoglu who performed the liverintestine 
transplant the boy died at the university of wisconsin hospital and 
clinics 
calvins transplanted liver began to fail tuesday according to 
hospital spokesman greer sutter 
calvin received national attention after his father brazilian 
immigrant carlos oliveira made a tearful plea to florida gov bob 
martinez for help in saving the boys life money for the down 
payment on the operation was quickly raised from private and 
corporate donors 
calvin was the only child of oliveira and his wife adriana who 
worked opposite shifts in restaurants so that they could care for 
the baby 
although calvin continued to receive blood and oxygen kalayoglu 
and the childs parents had agreed monday that there would be no 
attempt to resuscitate calvin if his heart stopped the oliveiras 
referred all questions to kalayoglu a hospital spokesman said 
the liver and intestinal transplant was necessary because the boy 
was born with use of only 5 percent of his intestine the 
intravenous feeding that kept him alive caused his liver to 
deteriorate so severely by december that his only hope was the 
experimental operation kalayoglu said the operation took place 
dec 31 
kalayoglu had expected calvin to be able to use the new intestine 
and go off intravenous feeding a few weeks after the operation but 
a mysterious lung ailment developed 
family friend marge gallece said the long hospitalization made it 
likely that calvins bills would add up to more than 300000 less 
than 200000 has been raised

edward vrdolyak a feisty former alderman who once 
headed the local democratic party declared wednesday that he would 
seek the republican nomination for mayor next week through a 
writein campaign 
ill be your candidate vrdolyak told 400 supporters who 
chanted eddie eddie eddie 
vrdolyak joined the gop in 1987 soon after he unsuccessfully 
sought the mayors chair as a thirdparty candidate in november he 
lost a countywide race for clerk of courts 
i can honestly tell you that i never thought that i would be a 
speaker in front of an audience concerning a political topic 
again he told the crowd gathered at a restaurant wednesday night 
i came out of the november election soundly defeated i was good 
and tired i was soured on politics 
vrdolyak said he decided to run because many of his admirers told 
him you are the reason we came to the republican party 
he pulled out an oversized ballot and showed the crowd how to 
write in his name when they go to the polls during next tuesdays 
primary 
if everybody in this room goes out and gets 20 votes its a 
landslide vrdolyak said 
some observers said vrdolyak win or lose could have a 
significant impact on the mayoral race 
nobody ever pays much attention to the republican party here 
said mike royko the pulitzer prizewinning syndicated columnist 
based at the chicago tribune but he could sure create problems 
the most obvious effect of which would be to siphon off white votes 
from rich daley 
both democratic frontrunner richard m daley cook county 
states attorney and son of the late mayor richard j daley and his 
primary challenger mayor eugene sawyer said wednesday that 
vrdolyak would have minimal impact on their contest 
gop frontrunner dr herbert sohn who was endorsed by the citys 
republican party is taking the offensive addressing the issue at 
local appearances in these terms eddie on feb 28th im going 
to beat you no ones going to push me around 
some political observers are not so sure especially in a primary 
where the gop winner traditionally needs fewer than 10000 votes 
eddies like a cat with nine lives said tom roesser a 
political analyst who is active in corporate and republican circles 
but he hasnt demonstrated an ability to win outside his own 
ward 
vrdolyak 51 earned a reputation as a maverick during the tenure 
of the elder daley when he led a rebellious group of aldermen who 
opposed the administration and came to be known as the young turks 
he held prominent positions in the administrations of subsequent 
mayors michael bilandic and jane byrne 
in 1983 he led a bloc of white aldermen in a series of 
acrimonious city council battles against the late harold washington 
elected earlier that year as the citys first black mayor 
vrdolyak who served 18 years as alderman of the 10th ward a 
gritty predominantly white workingclass enclave on the southeast 
side left the post in 1987 to make a thirdparty mayoral run 
against washington 
washington won reelection with 53 percent to vrdolyaks 42 
percent gop standardbearer don haider trying to break a 
democratic grip on city hall dating back to 1931 wound up with 4 
percent 
washington died in november 1987 an april 4 special general 
election will follow tuesdays party primaries voters are choosing 
a mayor to serve the last two years of washingtons term 
soon after his loss to washington vrdolyak switched to the 
republican party he was defeated by democrat aurelia pucinski in 
last falls cook county clerk race and returned to private law

authorities charged at least 37 people and a 
corporation wednesday with laundering more than 1 billion in 
colombian cocaine profits through jewelry merchants in los angeles 
texas florida and new york 
the 13month drug moneylaundering investigation was the biggest 
of its kind ever undertaken by the government attorney general dick 
thornburgh and treasury secretary nicholas brady said in a statement 
released in washington 
many of those taken into custody were brought to court for bail 
hearings wednesday in connection with the case described in us 
district court documents as a fouryear conspiracy involving 
wholesale jewelry dealers 
the documents said that in addition to arrests on the 
moneylaundering charges the investigation resulted in the seizure 
of 640 pounds of cocaine 
codenamed polar cap the investigation uncovered an operation 
that in the past two years alone laundered an estimated minimum of 
1 billion the justice and treasury departments said 
unlike recent major moneylaundering investigations polar cap 
did not involve the undercover infiltration of the organization by 
law enforcement brady said in the statement 
instead by following the flow of funds through various 
currency transactions reports and electronic and physical 
surveillance the combined law enforcement team was able to uncover 
the sophisticated techniques used to conceal the source and 
disposition of these illegal proceeds 
the investigation involved the drug enforcement administration 
the fbi the customs service the internal revenue service us 
attorneys offices in several cities and numerous state and local law 
enforcement agencies the statement said 
the various agencies involved on wednesday arrested 37 people and 
searched 85 locations in los angeles new york and miami the 
statement said more arrests and searches were expected 
the documents showed much wiretapping was used along with close 
surveillance of the defendants in the complaints authorities 
portrayed the moneylaundering operation as highly sophisticated 
using pagers mobile telephones and coded language 
the federal court documents totaling over 400 pages said the 
conspiracy involved bank accounts in california new york panama 
uruguay and elsewhere 
authorities alleged the defendants many of them family groups 
packed their cocaine proceeds in boxes and shipped them between the 
jewelry stores in new york houston and los angeles 
the documents said that at the ropex corp in los angeles money 
was tallied by highspeed counting machines packed in catalog cases 
and other packages and then transported by armored car to los 
angeles banks for deposit 
from the banks the millions were transferred by wire to various 
locations around the world and were ultimately used to pay narcotics 
suppliers in colombia and elsewhere the documents said 
they said the owners of ropexla created false invoices for the 
sales of huge quantities of gold to fictitious persons in order to 
explain the source of the currency in addition ropex and another 
company ronel refining allegedly engaged in transfers of large 
amounts of gold between themselves in order to reflect new sales 
ronel based in hollywood fla was the corporation accused in 
the complaints 
a call to ropex was answered by a man who refused to comment and 
hung up 
the government was tipped off to the alleged scheme in early 
1988 the documents said when the wells fargo bank in los angeles 
reported that one company had deposited 25 million in a threemonth 
period 
one of those charged was nazareth andonian owner of andonian 
brothers manufacturing co inc which does business as nazareth 
jewelers in downtown los angeles the complaint states andonian also 
has a store in new york and does business internationally under 
other names 
the complaint alleges the andonian firm alone laundered over 500 
million since 1986 a telephone call to the los angeles store was 
answered by a woman who refused comment

a health research group today asked the food 
and drug administration to stop experiments in which children facing 
painful medical procedures are given lollipops laced with a powerful 
narcotic 
public citizen health research group in a letter to the fda 
said the drug in the form of a lollipop sends children a dangerous 
message about drugs being candy and is of dubious clinical need 
or safety 
however both the fda and the anesta corp of salt lake city 
established by anesthesiologists and the university of utah to test 
and develop an oral form of the drug defended the study and 
discounted the potential for drug abuse 
the narcotic fentanyl has been approved by the fda as an 
injectable drug in the fdaapproved study it is mixed with 
sweeteners mounted on a stick like a lollipop and administered 
orally to children before they are given general anesthesia or 
undergo a painful diagnostic procedure

a federal recommendation to give chemotherapy to 
all victims of early breast cancer will mean needlessly treating 
65000 women at a cost of 338 million to improve the outlook for 
just 5000 others a new analysis concludes 
until recently drug and hormone therapy were given exclusively 
to women whose tumors had spread to their lymph nodes those whose 
cancer had not visibly progressed beyond their breasts were treated 
with surgery and radiation therapy alone 
however four new studies suggest that even those with early 
breast cancer could benefit from chemotherapy drug treatment the 
therapy somewhat improves their chances of remaining cancerfree 
during the years immediately after their surgery although there is 
no evidence that they ultimately live any longer 
three of the studies conducted in the united states were the 
basis of an unusual recommendation last may by the national cancer 
institute without revealing details of the studies the agency sent 
letters to cancer specialists suggesting that they give drug therapy 
to all breast cancer patients

in the largest heroin raid in us history 
police and federal agents tracked 1 billion worth of the drug from 
southeast asia to two homes in new york city where it was hidden 
inside hundreds of tires 
the 800pound seizure made the notorious french connection 
case seem modest by comparison and showcased the rise of asian drug 
smugglers authorities said tuesday 
us attorney andrew maloney said operation white mare and 
some other recent cases provide clear proof that the chinese are 
responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the heroin that is smuggled into 
new york 
since 1985 the supply of heroin from asia has increased and 
asian drug rings have supplanted heroin operations run by 
traditional american organized crime families the prosecutor said 
at a news conference held to announce the seizure

fans of author alfred coppel might 
be surprised to know he seldom wears a trench coat de rigueur for 
spies and reporters his favorite subjects 
an even bigger surprise is that he has no practical experience in 
either intelligence work or journalism 
however i did major in journalism at stanford university and 
worked in public relations after world war ii said the author of 
26 books including show me a hero thirty four east and his 
latest a land of mirrors harcourt brace jovanovich 1895 
as for espionage a suggestion that hes been on the 
cloakanddagger circuit only brings a laugh from coppel 67 who 
lives in a twostory rustic home in this exclusive san francisco 
peninsula community 
the writer admits that in the 1950s when caught in a fit of 
patriotism he offered his services to the cia he was interviewed 
but was never contacted again 
coppel a p38 pilot in world war ii wondered why 
in 1961 when a brigade of poor sods stormed ashore at the bay 
of pigs without air cover i stopped asking he said 
the alleged cia connection has haunted coppel and he said he 
has paid a price 
for the last 30 years the critical establishment has become 
less part of the literary world than of the world of media and 
politics he said a conservative writer according to coppel is 
not likely to be invited to appear on network television shows 
the literary establishment suffers from what coppel calls 
slavish liberalism 
for that matter so do most reporters he says just read a 
land of mirrors a tight suspense yarn about the rivalry between 
cia and kgb agents that is rooted in the vietnam war and serves as 
an indictment of the mass media 
the villain is jean thierry a french journalist who uses his job 
as a cover for his kgb work the book is filled with lines such as 
these 
the press hated the whole war effort 
the army was more the enemy than the vietcong 
the media people made a separate peace with the enemy after 
the tet offensive 
dont get the impression that the cia is always sitting pretty 
one of the most repulsive characters in a land of mirrors is cia 
agent charlie blaisdell 
because his books carry a tone of authority its easy to see how 
some people might surmise that coppels been a spy but its just a 
matter of keeping your eyes and ears open claims the author who 
said many of his characters are drawn from life 
my aging gonetofat cia field man is a synthesis of 
intelligence officers i have known he said 
some characters are pure fiction of course but coppel had many 
macho chapters in his life that could have provided him with 
such people who would include his son a green beret in vietnam 
not only was he a fighter pilot coppel still holds a commercial 
pilots license hes also been a race car driver and sail boat 
racer 
but a spy is not on his resume

they look at the floor 
in the turbulent years following the april 1974 coup that ended 
portugals 48year dictatorship and brought independence to its five 
african colonies the memory of the countrys african wars remained 
submerged 
but with the arrival of relative political stability the 
portuguese who sent a generation of young men to fight in angola 
mozambique and guineabissau are beginning to take a look at the 
war years through the arts 
joao botelho a 38yearold graphic illustrator and independent 
filmmaker was among the first to broach the subject in his 1985 
film um adeus portugues a portuguese farewell 
told in the present through a series of flashbacks by the brother 
and wife of a portuguese soldier who died in angola in 1975 the 
film is full of longing and sadness to die in africa and then 
for nothing says the dead mans father 
in another scene a soldier reads by lamplight from a geography 
book to a group of african children the minho the douro the 
tajo he drones citing the names of portuguese rivers they will 
never see 
in the six months since its publication by the circulo de 
leitores and dom quixote press the twovolume os anos da guerra 
the war years has sold more than 50000 copies this is a 
record for a collection of essays poetry short stores and excerpts 
from novels in a country of 10 million inhabitants with the highest 
rate of illiteracy in western europe 
half a dozen publishers turned down the book saying there was no 
interest in the subject in portugal 
for editors joao de melo 40 and joaquim viera 38 the period 
covered in their book marked a time when their generation faced 
obligatory conscription or emigration to avoid the draft 
melo a novelist who spent three years as a medic in angola 
refers to portugals own little vietnam and says the generation 
that succeeded his doesnt know how lucky they are not to have 
been under constant threat of mobilization 
a defense ministry report the first on the 196175 conflict 
says 8920 portuguese soldiers died and another 23233 were wounded 
during the wars for independence in three of portugals five african 
colonies the island colonies of cape verde and sao tome y principe 
achieved independence peacefully 
there are no accurate figures available on the number of africans 
dead and wounded in the conflicts 
some will say we took a long time to come out with these 
facts wrote gen manuel freire themuda barata in his introduction 
to the report published six months ago others will say it comes 
much too soon 
retired gen altino pinto magalhes who served two separate 
stints in angola and now heads the portuguese war veterans league 
says it is a good thing to talk about the war 
in the beginning the portuguese supported the war out of a 
sense of solidarity and patriotism magalhes said but it was 
long 14 years and then there was no victory 
the league has 53000 members of the estimated 800000 portuguese 
who saw service in the african wars 
maj manuel lopes dias a spokesman for the association of armed 
forces disabled adfa says the organizationss 12000 members 
suffer from both physical and pyschological problems some of them 
just recently manifest and many of them aggravated by a painfully 
slow and complicated portuguese bureaucracy 
although war novels came out during the period that began 
feb 4 1961 when african guerrillas attacked a portuguese police 
station in luanda angola the theme of the effect of the colonial 
wars on portuguese society is relatively recent 
lidia jorge one of portugals leading novelists says she wrote 
a costa dos murmurios the coast of whispers because 
those who dont want to confront the pain of this memory created a 
superreality a greater temporal distance that the time that has 
actually passed the novel is set in wartime mozambique 
fernando da costas play um jeep de segunda mao a 
secondhand jeep was one of the first public presentations to 
deal with the wars 
portuguese state televison rtp has never devoted a documentary 
to the subject but did air an hourlong dramatization late last year 
of luis felipe costas short story era uma vez um alferez 
once there was a corporal the story of an engineer drafted 
into the war who steps on what he believes is a land mine is 
exhorted by his captain to be courageous and dies of a heart attack 
from the stress the mine turns out to be a metal clicker

equipped with protective lighting 
filters a library basement at wittenberg university is home to one 
of the nations largest collections of the religious works of martin 
luther leader of the 16th century protestant reformation 
some materials in the collection are more than 500 years old 
some of the documents are kept in a safe all require special 
permission to study 
its a real treasure for scholars said regina entorf 
special collections librarian so many of these things have been 
lost through fire and flood and bombing 
ms entorf said the materials are invaluable to scholars who need 
to trace exact wording of important documents in the intellectual 
history of the western world 
a surprising number of people know that these are here she 
said and we do have people come and study them from time to time 
a lot of these things are irreplaceable 
the collection boasts about 350 books pamphlets and prints 
including all of luthers collected works from the 16th century the 
oldest is a bible printed in 1478 only 23 years after the gutenberg 
bible was printed on the worlds first printing press 
its a very beautiful thing said ms entorf its in the 
safe as is a letter that luther wrote the letter is to a 
parishoner and answers questions about eating meat sacrificed to 
idols 
she said the wittenberg collection is one of the largest in the 
country other luther collections include those at the folger 
shakespeare library in washington and at stanford university 
some of the wittenberg works were part of the original collection 
at the school which was founded in 1845 
of course the people are heavily lutheran said ms entorf 
people just kept these books forever and weve had a lot of gifts 
through the years weve educated pastors from the very beginning of 
our history 
wittenberg takes its name from the university of wittenberg 
founded in germany in 1502 by frederick the wise a lifelong 
protector of luther against the pope 
luther was a professor of theology at the university of 
wittenberg he was the leader of the reformation a religious 
movement that led to a schism in the catholic church and the birth 
of protestantism his translation of the bible into german helped 
create the modern german language 
the wittenberg collection boasts numerous pamphlets written by 
luther 
this is what really spread the reformation throughout europe 
because these would go to pastors in small towns throughout 
europe she said and thats the way the word would spread 
along with the 1478 bible and the original luther letter the 
collection includes a bible luther translated from latin into german 
in 1555 a luther translation of the communion service from latin 
into german and a 1570 church order prescribed by the government on 
how church services were to be conducted 
ms entorf said the wittenberg collection has held up well with 
the bindings being virtually indestructible if they are treated 
properly 
the content is interesting because the original text is here 
and the scholars can trace that back she said but the other 
thing that you have is a lot of history in the bindings so these 
are interesting as artifacts to scholars as well as intellectual 
content 
printing in the 16th century was often done on linen which lasts 
indefinitely covers of the books are made of embossed pigskin or of 
parchment which is dried lambskin 
ms entorf said fluorescent lighting in the library basement has 
special shields to reduce the ultraviolet light and protect the 
works 
we dont have climate control yet but were working on it 
she said you need to keep it the humidity down in the summer 
and up in the winter it has to be level

for her latest movie cbs naked lie 
victoria principals two roles as actress and executive producer 
were occasionally at odds 
there were some things that the executive producer wanted the 
actress to do but as the actress i didnt want to do them she 
said generally the executive producer won 
one day for instance the actress had a scene early in the 
morning and wanted to take the rest of the day off but the 
executive producer felt it was more economical to have her do one 
more scene at the end of the day another time the producer felt 
that since the wardrobe had been made for the actress she should pay 
half price to take it home but the actress wanted it and we gave it 
to her 
she laughed and said im sure the supermarket tabloids will 
take that and the headlines will read victoria principal has fight 
with self for the last few days a tabloid reporters been parked 
outside my house theyve gone through my trash and theyve been 
following me everywhere i go 
naked lie will be telecast this sunday by cbs principal 
stars as a prosecuting attorney whose affair with a judge played by 
james farentino threatens to destroy her career when theyre both 
assigned to a politically explosive case 
the movie is her second since she left dallas after nine 
years on the hit primetime soap opera she had starred as pamela 
barnes ewing 
when she read the screenplay of naked lie she said i 
liked the story i was drawn to its concept which was new to tv at 
the time it had aspects of suspect and jagged edge i felt it 
could be a very tight suspenseful romantic mystery our story is 
very tight which is unusual for tv usually you can drive a truck 
through the plot you dont have to suspend belief 
principal is developing other projects and has deals with nbc and 
abc she is in no hurry to do another series 
i own several properties that i think would make good series 
she said but i want to have deep artistic involvement it would 
have to be done by my company doing a series is a grueling 
lifestyle in order to live that lifestyle it would have to be a 
project i believe in it would have to be one from the heart 
the best of all worlds in terms of lifestyle is a halfhour 
comedy i do have one i like but for onehour dramas outside of 
murder she wrote there are no shows starring women first you 
entertain but if i did a series id want to do something 
meaningful if you can touch someone and cause them to think youve 
reached tvs potential even if you disturb or upset someone as 
long as you make the audience feel something 
at one point in her career she quit acting and became a talent 
agent she began acting again when she needed money to pay for 
tuition for law school she became so successful the second time she 
kept at it it wasnt long before she was cast in dallas her 
only series 
dallas was originally conceived as a kind of romeo and 
juliet meets giant for her and patrick duffy but larry 
hagman as jr ewing became the major focus of the show 
was she bothered at losing the lead role 
whatever concern i had about that was offset by its success 
she answered would i rather be a leading performer in a show that 
runs five weeks or part of an ensemble that runs for many years the 
latter of course because of my years as an agent i have an ability 
to stand back and look at the project as a whole 
principal said there is no chance she will return to dallas 
they might bring pam back but it wont be me she said 
theyve asked me back but thats not where my life is going i 
dont want to live my life in reverse im not bitter and have no 
ill feelings i chose to leave simply because it was in my own best 
interests

ronald reagan used to say that when congress 
wouldnt see the light hed make them feel the heat president bush 
is trying for warmth instead 
bushs first stint of domestic campaigning as president is like 
reagans eight years ago tied tightly to the budget and the 
economy but with a difference reagan sought to pressure a 
halfdemocratic congress its solidly democratic now senate and 
house and the kind of coalition of republicans and conservative 
democrats that delivered for reagan is not in sight for bush 
reagan was campaigning for a right turn from the policies of a 
democratic administration his first postinaugural address was a 
nationally televised speech from the white house in it he declared 
were in the worst economic mess since the depression 
bush is arguing his case for modest change with praise not 
blame for what went before weve made tremendous progress and i 
mean to build on that progress he said in the first of three 
speeches on the budget last week 
the president said his purpose was to talk as directly as 
possible to the american people in speeches to a business group 
in manchester nh legislators in south carolina and college 
students in st louis 
reagans first term economic wares were a 25percent 3year tax 
cut drastic reductions in domestic spending and sharp increases 
for defense 
bush wants a flexible freeze on domestic spending with increases 
for selected social programs to be balanced by cuts in others 
although his budget doesnt say which ones and neither does he 
hed like a tax cut on capital gains but nothing so dramatic as 
reagans income tax reduction and bushs chances of getting the 
reduction he wants are slim to none in the democratic house 
as part of his road show bush told each audience about the items 
for which he wants to increase federal spending the environment 
space the war on drugs education child care help for the 
homeless 
thats starting to irk democrats who say hes taking credit for 
projected increases without saying what he wants cut to pay for it 
in those speeches bush also pressed his call for a lineitem 
veto so he and future presidents can veto specific spending items 
without rejecting an entire appropriations bill that isnt likely 
to happen either because congress would lose its ability to force 
spending upon an administration 
the chairman of the senate budget committee james sasser of 
tennessee remarked that bush wants lineitem veto but wont but 
wont deliver a lineitem budget 
there are other signs of strain but both the administration and 
congress still are talking about cooperation rather than 
confrontation bush stressed that in his speeches making 
bipartisanship a refrain at each stop 
it was a theme at the capitol too you get an a for mood 
sen bennett johnston of louisiana told budget director richard g 
darman 
reagan talked of bipartisanship too during his early days in 
the white house i extend my hand in cooperation and i believe we 
can go forward in a bipartisan manner he said in one of his 
initial messages to congress 
but he had a special definition reagan bipartisanship meant 
republicans plus conservative democrats who were predisposed to go 
along with the white house with that coalition vote he got his 
spending and tax cuts and house democratic leaders couldnt do a 
thing about it the senate was in republican hands 
bush has neither of those advantages his bipartisanship means 
working with the democratic leaders of house and senate not 
confronting them 
pressing his program reagan told a republican crowd the battle 
is on lines are being drawn reagan said that when necessary 
hed go over the heads of congress directly to the voters to get 
support for his proposals 
bush doesnt talk that way he says voters want an end to 
political bickering his white house spokesman said the budget 
speeches were intended to underscore those aims not to pressure 
congress 
its an attempt to explain to the american people that he 
intends to work with the congress said marlin fitzwater the 
white house press secretary all the indications we have are that 
the congress intends to work with us to try to solve this 
problem

all the talk about reviving inflation these days 
has provided little comfort to advocates of gold investments 
the price of gold which is supposed to thrive on inflationary 
worries has instead been slumping hitting 2year lows this month 
hovering lately around 380 an ounce it is down more than 20 
percent from its early1988 high near 500 and off about 7 percent 
since just the beginning of 1989 
even news of a biggerthanexpected 1 percent jump in the 
producer price index of finished goods for january failed to stir 
gold out of its doldrums 
in a strange twist analysts attribute the weakness in gold to 
the alarms sounded about the dangers of inflation by such prominent 
observers as alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve 
recent upward pressure on the producer price index points to a 
modest pickup in the inflation rate during coming months say 
economists at merrill lynch 
but the behavior of gold prices underlines confidence in the 
inflationfighting resolve of the fed and a belief that inflation 
pressures will ultimately be contained 
or as the value line survey put it in its latest quarterly 
appraisal of goldmining stocks the continued assertions by 
chairman greenspan that inflation in the united states is too high 
sends a bearish signal to gold markets 
the concomitant increase in shortterm interest rates that the 
fed has orchestrated serves meanwhile to shore up the dollar 
placing further downward pressure on bullion quotations 
yields at or near 9 percent on virtually riskless investments 
such as treasury bills represent stiff competition for gold 
investments which pay no current return in most of their various 
forms 
dividend yields in the 9 percent range can be had in the american 
depositary receipts of some south african mining companies which 
trade like stocks and can be obtained through just about any broker 
however these stocks are under a cloud because of controversy 
over south africas political policies in particular apartheid 
on top of that high interest rates increase the cost of carrying 
gold on credit as many dealers and other businesses do 
other separate reasons have been advanced for golds slump the 
soviet union which ranks behind only south africa among the biggest 
gold producers of the world is said to have been selling gold in 
large amounts lately 
reports from goldtrading centers in europe suggest that these 
sales are likely to continue as the soviets seek to upgrade their 
industrial production base under the restructuring effort known as 
perestroika 
all in all golds glory days when it soared above 800 an ounce 
at the start of the 1980s seem long past 
yet there is a vocal camp of analysts and advisers who still 
recommend devoting at least a small fraction of ones assets to gold 
as insurance if nothing else against future inflationary outbreaks 
some argue that gold could enjoy a nice rally if for any reason 
policymakers such as greenspan find it tougher than expected to keep 
inflation in check 
we are not turning into gold bugs says james stack editor 
of the advisory letter investech market analyst but recent 
stirrings in inflation could point toward substantial gains in 
gold and gold stocks in the months ahead 
dont look for gold stocks to immediately soar he cautions 
most investors firmly believe that inflation will fade after this 
latest increase in shortterm interest rates itll take a while to 
shake that confidence

katies newborn image filled the big screen 
and her cries from the cradle filled the sound dubbing stage as 
director waris hussein called for louder wailing 
the nbc movie those she left behind focuses on the crisis 
caused by katies arrival the mother dies in childbirth and the 
father is overwhelmed by grief and the responsibility of taking care 
of his new daughter 
im putting in some more baby cries said hussein who sat at 
the control board with several sound technicians 
when we filmed she wasnt crying all the time when the father 
tells her to calm down she wasnt crying we made the baby cry a 
few times but you can only go so far in provoking a child you have 
to go with whatever happens at the time 
those she left behind which nbc will telecast on monday 
stars gary cole as the father joanna kerns as a business associate 
colleen dewhurst as his motherinlaw and mary page keller as the 
mother michael ohara wrote the screenplay 
hussein said he selected dewhurst for the role hed previously 
directed her in two movies and baby makes six his first film 
after moving to california and its sequel baby comes home they 
were about a middleaged couple who have another baby even though 
they have grown children 
to me this is more than just about being a father said 
hussein its about adjustment its about growth im always 
interested in human nature and how it develops a man thinks hes 
shaped his destiny but it suddenly changes and he has to start from 
rock bottom 
its a lifeenhancing experience through his wifes death he 
has to reassess his life and grow many men hide behind a lot of 
macho assertions the wife has the baby and she takes care of it a 
man left in those circumstances is basically a child i think a lot 
of women are going to dig their husbands in the ribs 
hussein said one of the things that attracted him to those she 
left behind was that it was not a cute baby movie 
theres a tendency to do pictures about cute babies he said 
the baby is very pretty but i didnt want the audience to ooh 
and ah over the baby this is going to change peoples concepts 
another thing that appealed to me was that it shows how precarious 
life is it can happen to anybody someones here one minute and 
gone the next 
gary returns to an empty house when that very morning his wife 
asked him if hed be home for dinner the baby still represents his 
wifes death he has to forgive the baby he has to adjust to his 
wifes death its about basic human conditions it has no frills 
it has an honest approach with no false emotions i like the way he 
has to adjust to his motherinlaw 
kerns who stars in abcs growing pains plays an associate 
who helps cole get through the emotional crisis 
they kind of fall for each other she said in an interview 
but it was nice that they didnt ride off into the sunset they 
didnt get together and baby makes three i loved working with 
waris he let the actors act he wasnt in our faces all the time 
hussein also directed the miniseries little gloria happy at 
last and such tv movies as copacabana and when the bough 
breaks 
i tend to gravitate toward character studies he said i 
would hate to be categorized over what i do im not really a 
womans director ive done some things unexpected of me i 
directed coming out of the ice which had only two women in it i 
do have a reputation among certain actresses the director i most 
admire is george cukor who was known as a womans director 
hitchcock for instance is not a director id want to follow 
hussein was born in india but was raised in england and went to 
cambridge university he began as a theater director then became a 
directortrainee at the bbc at 21 he spent seven years at the bbc 
starting with a soap opera and going on to direct the tv version of 
a passage to india in 1965 
when i came to los angeles the biggest thrill for me was seeing 
the studio back lots he said i grew up with american movies

the boeing co isnt looking for scapegoats to 
blame for delays in its 747400 jumbojet program and instead is 
concentrating on getting the project back on track a boeing 
executive says 
some of the problems were simply unkunks insider talk for 
unknowns that cant be planned for said bruce gissing senior vice 
president of boeing commercial airplanes 
lengthy design manufacturing and testing processes along with 
unanticipated airline demand combined to slow production of what is 
the worlds largest commercial jetliner gissing said 
it just blows my mind to try and figure out why we dont 
predict this market better but when you look at all the factors 
that go into it its unbelievable that we can do as well as we 
do gissing said in a recent interview we are dealing with 
thousands of things here that all must mesh together 
the delays forced boeing to push back delivery dates by several 
months for 57 of the 747s due out this year the first time in two 
decades boeing has failed to meet delivery deadlines 
the first 747400 was delivered in late january to northwest 
airlines about a month late other deliveries including those to 
japan airlines and united airlines are running about two months 
late boeing has said about 172 of the jets have been ordered 
one problem delaying delivery is a shortage of workers at 
boeings everett plant where the planes are assembled to ease 
this boeing is borrowing workers with needed skills from elsewhere 
in the corporation he said 
even so gissing said substantial overtime will be needed until 
the program stabilizes the everett plant employes about 17000 
gissing declined to discuss specific problems with the 125 
million hightechnology airplane but said there were signs almost 
from the start that the program would be behind schedule 
the switch to a twoperson cockpit for example required 
electronic systems dramatically different from earlier 747 models 
which require a flight crew of three customers also wanted many 
different configurations of the jet including a choice of pratt amp 
whitney general electric or rollsroyce engines 
each engine requires the 747 to gain a separate certification 
from the federal aviation administration 
gissing said the plane missed its faa certification target date 
in december 
some airlines have said publicly that they will seek compensation 
from boeing for the revenue lost by not taking delivery of the jets 
on schedule 
jal is very upset about the delays and i think that boeing 
should do something about that said tad fujimatsu a new york 
spokesman for japan airlines which learned recently that five of 
its 20 747400s on order would be delayed just exactly what that 
will be is being negotiated by the head office now 
industry watchers however say demands for compensation are 
likely to be tempered by the airlines need to preserve a longterm 
relationship with the worlds largest aircraft manufacturer 
the 747400 can be distinguished from other 747s by its curved 
wingtips and extralong upper deck the jet which can seat up to 
509 passengers depending upon its configuration promises reduced 
fuel consumption while its twomember flight crews will save on 
employee costs 
but critics of the jets including some pilots unions have 
questioned the safety of the smaller crews which do without a 
flight engineer

the nations two biggest automakers concerned 
about rising default rates on car loans they offer through 
subsidiaries are trying to attact more creditworthy buyers through 
new loan programs 
general motors acceptance corp is experimenting with a plan that 
divides potential borrowers into three categories according to 
credit risk while ford motor credit corp is engaged in a similar 
plan 
the gmac system which should be in place nationwide within the 
next few months gives dealers more flexibility in setting the 
amount of monthly payments gmac spokesman john andrews said tuesday 
it will afford us the opportunity of getting some 
higherquality customers he said 
joy wolfe a spokeswoman for ford motor credit said the 
automaker has been experimenting with a preferred customer plan 
since last fall and hopes to make a decision this spring about 
whether to implement it nationwide 
the testing she said has been going on at 35 of the credit 
companys 137 branches and covers up to a third of the ford 
dealerships nationwide 
jack ferry a spokesman for chrysler financial corp said the 
lending arm of chrysler corp envisioned no program similar to 
fords or gms 
gm officials have declined to say how much they have lost on a 
yeartoyear basis because of bad loans but have said their costs 
are increasing last week andrews said gm had boosted its 
automotive loanloss reserve to about 1 billion in 1988 up 21 
percent from 1987s reserve to cover bad loans 
under the gmac quality finance plan a buyer provides a credit 
history to the finance officer at a gm dealership and the buyers 
credit worthiness is determined the buyer then is placed in either 
an a b or c category with a the best loan risk and c the worst 
buyers in the a category who usually have no trouble getting 
loans would be offered lower rates than the rates available under 
conventional gmac loans blevel buyers would have rates roughly the 
same as those determined under current gmac policies 
ccategory buyers may be required to come up with additional 
cosigners higher down payments or higher monthly payments to 
qualify for a gmac loan 
interest rates for the categories vary from city to city and 
could have a spread of 5 percentage points 
the rates also can be affected by whether the dealership is a 
recourse or nonrecourse business a recourse dealership would 
guarantee a loan to gmac in other words if the loan went sour the 
dealership would pick up the cost reducing gmacs potential loss 
and keeping consumer rates down 
a nonrecourse dealer would share any bad loan costs with gmac 
that obligation on gmacs part would increase the rates to the buyer 
andrews said dealers will be briefed on the program during the 
coming months and like participation in gmac itself have the 
option of whether or not to join the program 
one dealer who joined was howard chevrolet inc of west roxbury 
mass there finance manager stu sterling said it appears to be 
working well 
i can say with some certainty that ive saved about 10 percent 
of the deals that i would have lost to a credit union he said 
tuesday when im able to show them a rate only off by a half a 
percent that the monthly payment will only change less than 50 
cents its convenient for the customer

an agreement among independent oil producers to cut 
their oil exports unilaterally by an asyetunspecified amount 
during the second quarter will help opec bolster oil prices in the 
shortterm analysts say 
but the agreement reached tuesday at a oneday meeting in 
london will have little impact on the buoyant supply and weak 
demand in the oil market the analysts said 
i think it means the extension of the oil producers cartel 
even if the countries dont want to commit themselves to opec at 
this stage said philip morgan an oil analyst at the london 
investment firm citicorp scrimgeour vickers 
there was little immediate reaction in the market after the 
group issued a communique early evening outlining its plans the 
spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil was 1630 a barrel up 10 cents from late 
monday 
the group of independent oil producers said that a majority of 
its members agreed to cut their oil exports but it didnt identify 
them nor did it say by how much other participants agreed to 
freeze their exports it said 
specific announcements with respect to the above decisions will 
be made by the respective authorities in the course of next week 
the groups communique said 
participating at talks at the mexican embassy were mexico oman 
malaysia egypt china and angola the communique said also 
attending were observers from the soviet union colombia north 
yemen norway the us state of alaska and the canadian province of 
alberta it said 
the agreement is fairly significant morgan said 
it was important that the independent producers were acting 
unilaterally analysts said doing so because the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has managed to curb its production 
last year independent oil producers offered to cut their output 
by 5 percent if opec agreed to reciprocal cuts opec refused 
some opec members have expressed resentment that independent 
producers enjoy the benefits of the cartels production limits 
without making a contribution 
opecs 13 members are estimated to be producing about 195 
million barrels a day 1 million barrels above their agreed 
production limit but well below their fourthquarter output opec 
has set a target price of 18 a barrel 
the psychological impact on the oil markets will be quite 
strong morgan said but he addedi think the total volume of 
the cuts makes little difference to the whole supply and demand 
question 
james henderson an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd ltd in 
london said basically we see it as fairly positive for the oil 
price shortterm 
basically it will help opec through the seasonal demand 
downturn in the second quarter we still see a dip in the oil price 
but not as dramatically as it would have been 
oil prices will fall to 1450 to 15 a barrel in march and 
april henderson predicted 
the analyst said he expects the independent producers to cut 
exports by 200000 to 300000 barrels a day in the apriljune 
quarter 
but he said a reduction of up to 300000 barrels isnt going 
to have a dramatic effect on the supply and demand balance 
the communique also said some participants will go back to 
their authorities for further consultations in order to determine 
their contribution 
further meetings of technical experts will be convened on a 
regular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the market 
situation as well as compliance with the agreement the statement 
said 
the next such meeting was planned for may 16 and would also 
address the prospects of the second half of the year a period 
viewed by the experts with caution 
the experts expressed the strong wish of their authorities to 
see all oilproducing and exporting countries contributing to market 
stability in a concerted way it said 
individual delegates wouldnt elaborate when they emerged from 
the meeting 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

the taiwanese company that offered made in 
usa labels to american distributors of its us flags says it quit 
the business because even that ploy didnt generate business 
we stopped sales to the united states about two years ago 
because our products were strongly rejected ni fengming general 
manager of ming teh told an interviewer in taipei i guess 
americans hate to see their national flag made by foreigners 
the taiwanese government said tuesday it was looking into the 
labelswitching allegations which amount to a suggestion that 
american importers violate us countryoforigin labeling law 
the us customs service already is looking into the allegations 
both investigations were sparked in part by rep douglas 
applegate dohio who asked for the customs investigation and 
publicized the complaints of a coshocton ohio flag maker 
the colonial flag co provided applegate with a copy of the ming 
teh solicitation which says we can realize why you need to 
remove the original label and replace it 
if possible we suggest you cut off this label after you 
receive the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags 
your own brand name and made in usa signs the 1987 letter 
said we can offer the labels too 
ni who said his company never changed the labels on its flags 
blamed the lack of response to the 1987 solicitation on us 
protectionism the company now makes national flags for canada 
japan west germany and australia he said 
victor chin a spokesman for the taiwanese government office in 
washington confirmed tuesday that countrys board of foreign trade 
is looking into the matter he predicted quick action as an 
example to other companies 
we are very concerned he said we are concerned about our 
image naturally but we are also concerned about our free trade 
practices 
i assume something will happen this week chin said 
also tuesday rep harley staggers jr dwva resubmitted 
legislation that would require that all us flags be made in the 
united states 
i am asking that my colleagues help me to keep our stars and 
stripes raised in the battle against the exploitation of foreign 
countries said staggers who told the house some imported flags 
violate the us flag code 
i have for example a us flag that was made in taiwan he 
said superimposed upon it is a harley davidson motorcycle with 
the words high times written across the gas tank 
chin an assistant in the public affairs arm of the coordination 
council for north american affairs said the taiwanese government 
didnt want to comment on the potential impact of the ban sought by 
staggers

in the week after the shooting stopped in 
their war with iran iraqis went on a 318million shopping spree in 
staterun stores they bought up television sets refrigerators and 
other luxury items the government released from warehouses 
six months later the staterun stores are closed to 
nongovernment employees and their shelves are empty one recently 
had only a few light sockets in its electrical department 
iraqis are beginning to realize that the 60 billion to 70 
billion their country borrowed during the 8year persian gulf war is 
going to affect their wallets for a long time 
no one has come forward to help finance reconstruction although 
neighboring kuwait has said it might offer some aid 
creditors are pressing hard for repayment new laws designed to 
attract private money from iraqis and from around the arab world 
have attracted little interest 
the economic situations very bad salaries are low and prices 
go up and up said mukhtar 34 who recently started a chicken 
farm to try to supplement his familys government incomes 
i think things will stay bad because they have to pay for the 
war it may be five to seven years before it gets better 
diplomats conjecture that iraq is spreading the estimated 10 
billion to 12 billion a year it earns from oil exports too thinly 
by trying to pay for reconstruction buy expensive armaments 
develop heavy industry meet consumer demands and pay off its debts 
iraqi officials maintain the problems are shortterm and that the 
economy will eventually refloat on the 100 billion barrels of oil 
lying under their feet 
im optimistic that the price of oil will hold and iraq will 
remain an important oilproducing country for at least the next 
century said deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoon 
our resources are quite sufficient to pay the debts back its 
just a question of time 
hamdoon confirmed reports that iraq will not have to pay back aid 
from saudi arabia and kuwait estimated by diplomats at about 30 
billion 
our arab brothers are very considerate of the fact that iraq 
was defending not just its own interests but the interests of those 
countries he said 
diplomats said private suppliers in the persian gulf however 
were balking at writing off an estimated 6 billion to 8 billion in 
goods supplied on credit but the kuwaiti government might step in 
to pay that bill 
hamdoon called the 60billion debt figure exaggerated but 
the government will not release any exact figure 
diplomats say uncertainty over the size of the debt an 
overvalued dinar currency and a lack of trust in the governments 
commitment to the private sector are all factors keeping investors 
away 
arab investors really want the iraqis to open their books to 
say what their debts are said one diplomat 
potential investors dislike the discrepancy between the official 
and free market currency exchange rates and worry about the 
availability of foreign exchange diplomats said 
the iraqi dinar sells for about 50 cents on open markets in 
neighboring countries but baghdad fixes its worth at 3 
investors have to exchange at least 50 percent of their foreign 
currency at that official rate 
in addition foreign exchange can be hard to find especially 
with an estimated 2 million egyptian workers in the country who can 
legally send home about 2 billion a year 
harsh attacks in the press on steep price increases caused by 
businessmen passing on the cost of the official exchange rate have 
not encouraged investors 
the price of an automobile tire for example went from 14 dinars 
42 to 100 dinars 300 when private importers took over and 
thefts shot up prices like 625 dinars 1875 at the official 
exchange rate for a small color television unleashes consumer 
charges of extortion government salaries have been fixed at about 
150 dinars 450 a month since the beginning of the war 
iraqi consumers are also railing against shoddy local 
merchandise complaining about everything from heaters that dont 
heat to perfume that has no scent 
president saddam husseins privatization program aimed at 
increasing efficiency and luring back billions of dollars held 
abroad has met with limited success with an estimated 30 to 40 
percent of the staterun companies put on the block actually sold 
small factories have been snapped up but items like luxury 
hotels at 50 million each remain largely unsold state television 
nightly runs 10 minutes of ads for government enterprises on sale 
the state retains control of 80 percent of the economy and plans 
to keep control of heavy industry and the oil sector with the 
exception of gasoline stations 
in the meantime iraqis remain starved for goods 
arab tradition dictates that when a friend admires something you 
own you offer it to him but the offer is customarily refused 
an iraqi visiting from los angeles said he offered his rayban 
sunglasses a crocodile leather belt and an olympus camera to 
friends in iraq 
they took them

pennwalt corp says it will consider further 
restructuring or seek a buyer rather than accept centaur partners 
869 million takeover bid 
in rejecting the 110ashare offer tuesday pennwalt repeated 
earlier allegations that centaur lacked necessary funding and that 
the investor group was looking for shortterm profits rather than an 
acquisition by driving up pennwalts stock price 
the board expressed the view that alternatives superior to the 
centaur offer exist said edwin e tuttle chairman of the 
philadelphiabased pennwalt the board believes that in light of 
the restructuring work commenced in march 1988 it would be 
inappropriate to sell pennwalt to centaur at 110 per share 
the company said its management and the investment firm goldman 
sachs amp co will study the possibility of selling pennwalt to 
someone else or further restructuring the company already sold its 
pharmaceutical division and most of its equipment businesses in 
fighting the takeover attempt 
we will wait to see what proposal if any is offered by 
goldman sachs and pennwalt centaur spokesman jerry seeman said in 
a statement we intend to continue on our course of bringing our 
acquisition proposal to shareholders of pennwalt for a determination 
of whether they will support it 
centaur has forced pennwalt to call a special stockholders 
meeting march 30 when the investment firm will try to replace the 
board with members who support the takeover 
centaur based in new york and bethesda md on feb 14 
increased its 2monthold 100pershare offer to 110 for the 
6982000 shares of outstanding pennwalt stock it does not already 
own 
the latest offer is due to expire march 6 
pennwalt which was trading for about 70 per share in june 1988 
when centaur first made its intentions known closed at 11825 per 
share tuesday up 337

an investor trying to buy the baltimore 
orioles also is heading efforts to buy worlds of wonder inc the 
toy company that rocketed to fleeting success with the talking bear 
teddy ruxpin 
the company which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 14 
months ago announced tuesday it reached a definitive agreement 
to sell the company to a group of new york investors headed by eli 
jacobs 
the sale for an undisclosed amount is subject to us 
bankruptcy court approval but worlds of wonder had no 
expectation the plan would not be approved said anne jordan the 
companys general counsel 
the investors headed by jacobs the majority stockholder of a 
group buying the orioles plan to continue operating worlds of 
wonder in fremont under the same name the company said 
it allows the company to move forward with the plans for a 
revitalized business which we developed over the past year 
stephen j hopkins worlds of wonder chairman and chief executive 
officer said in a statement 
hopkins a corporate turnaround specialist hired after founder 
and president donald kingsborough resigned at the request of 
creditors last year also said he was pleased with worlds of 
wonders showing at the recent toy fair in new york 
analysts could not immediately be reached for comment after the 
tuesday afternoon announcement 
in addition to jacobs whose efforts to buy the orioles must 
still be approved by major league owners the investment group 
includes franklyn s barry jr former president of fisherprice 
toys and david edelman former president of ingram software 
once the reorganization plan is approved a newly formed company 
formed by the investors will acquire the toy companys assets for an 
undisclosed amount of cash notes and preferred stock 
proceeds from the sale will go to its secured creditors algemene 
bank nederland and fist national bank of chicago lead bank for a 
group of five financial institutions the company said 
the new company plans to issue its own stock which would be 
issued only to the investors and creditors jordan said 
the company founded in a trailer in 1985 saw its sales jump to 
300 million within two years with novel hightech toys including 
teddy ruxpin and lazer tag in which players shot each other 
with beams of infrared light 
but the company became plagued by lagging sales and production 
and delivery problems it suffered heavy losses and filed for 
bankruptcy protection in december 1987 the company said in its 
chapter 11 filing that it had 3121 million in liabilities against 
3136 million in assets 
worlds of wonder which continued to promote new toys including 
the skip stik a version of the jump rope announced late last year 
it was talking with investors about a possible sale 
the company has been negotiating the agreement with jacobs and 
the other investors for the past few weeks jordan said 
just before it filed for chapter 11 protection worlds of wonder 
employed about 500 people about 120 people now work for the company 
i think the expectation is that the new investors will build up 
the company and if that happens they probably need to increase the 
workforce jordan said 
the company hoped to file a reorganization plan with the 
bankruptcy court in oakland during the next few weeks and expected 
confirmation hearings within a few months she said

south korea expressed regret wednesday 
over a us government decision that could lead to trade sanctions 
for alleged barriers blocking us sales of telecommunications 
equipment here 
we deeply regret the us governments designation of south 
korea as a country to open negotiations targeting it for possible 
trade sanctions a foreign ministry statement said 
the statement urged the united states to be more prudent in 
applying the 1988 trade act 
trade representative carla hills announced tuesday the us 
government has designated south korea and the european economic 
community for possible trade sanctions if they fail to lower 
barriers against us telecommunications equipment 
hills reportedly took the action following a fivemonth 
investigation under the law which requires the united states to 
open negotiations with countries considered to be blocking sales by 
american exporters 
if negotiations dont succeed in removing trade barriers within a 
year the law requires us officials to impose trade sanctions

treasury secretary nicholas brady delivered 
president bushs plan for cleaning up the savings and loan industry 
to congress today and asked that it be swiftly approved 
noting the presidents feb 9 challenge to congress to pass the 
funding and reform package in 45 days brady said once congress 
acts we will be ready to move to stem the hemorrhaging by closing 
insolvent sampls that pay high interest rates to attract depositors 
fast action will help reduce the industrys cost of funds 
by getting the insolvent institutions resolved out of the 
marketplace and out of the business of needlessly bidding up the 
cost of funds brady said in testimony prepared for the senate 
banking committee the time to act is now 
bushs plan calls for spending 126 billion through 1999 to shut 
down about 350 insolvent institutions and meet commitments from last 
years rescue of 205 others 
the president also wants changes in the regulatory structure 
including one strongly opposed by the sampl industry placing the sampl 
regulatory agency the federal home loan bank board in the treasury 
department 
brady told the committee we do not intend to micromanage the 
revitalized federal home loan bank system but he added 
treasury oversight is essential to ensure that these problems do 
not occur again 
the treasury secretary also outlined two new refinements of the 
plan 
sampl owners are being required to put up more of their own money 
or capital but brady said they would have 10 years to take 
goodwill off their books goodwill is the value an institution 
has as a going concern but many analysts say it shouldnt be 
included in capital because it disappears once an institution is 
liquidated 
brady also said the maximum insurance premium for banks and sampls 
would be 350 per 1000 in deposits the administration previously 
said the maximum would be 750 currently banks pay 83 cents and 
sampls 208 
bradys testimony the first hearing on the plan since bush 
proposed it two weeks ago came amid criticism that it provides too 
little money and is based on rosy economic projections 
the white house office of management and budget released figures 
tuesday showing that the administration is assuming longterm 
interest rates will fall 3 percent in two years to the lowest point 
in 20 years and that savings and loan deposits will grow at an 
annual rate of 72 percent even as the government will be curbing 
highflying fastgrowing institutions 
these assumptions are highly optimistic exceedingly 
optimistic said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va theyre just not realistic 
meanwhile the house ways and means committee was to hear from 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman who 
under bushs plan would oversee deposit insurance for both 
commercial banks and sampls 
analysts are warning that if the administrations interest rate 
projections are off as they believe the government will have to 
spend hundreds of millions of dollars more per year to finance the 
rescue program 
also if the deposit growth is lower than predicted then 
insurance premiums paid by the industry will fall far short of the 
32 billion projected over the next decade that would mean 
taxpayers would have to pay more 
bushs plan calls for raising 50 billion by selling bonds over 
the next three years the bonds will be sold in an offbudget 
arrangement which means the government will have to pay more in 
interest than on normal treasury borrowing 
the omb plan shows the special sampl bonds carrying a rate 03 
percentage points higher than longterm treasury rates thats a 
shade optimistic according to robert litan a banking expert with 
the brookings institution 
more importantly however the government shows longterm 
treasury rates falling from about 92 percent now to 62 percent in 
1991 which would be the lowest rate since 1968 
to say that thats optimistic is the understatement of the 
year litan said 
analysts said the deposit growth projections are in line with the 
rate of the past 10 years but are likely too high if the 
administration follows through with other parts of its reform 
program sampls under the bush plan would not be allowed to grow 
unless their owners put up more of their own money 
theres no way thrift deposits are going to grow that fast in 
light of the capital requirements ely said 
he also said the interest rate projections imply a very low rate 
of inflation and in that unlikely event it would be much harder to 
meet the deposit growth targets

retired adm james d watkins the energy 
secretarydesignate told his senate confirmation hearing today his 
first priority would be to seek major changes in the way the 
government runs its troubled nuclear weapons complex 
watkins said the energy departments defense program has not 
brought itself into line with nearly all other public and private 
nuclear ventures that have now capitalized on lessons learned 
since the 1979 reactor accident at three mile island in pennsylvania 
there is an urgent need to effect a significant change in its 
deeply embedded 35year culture watkins told the senate energy 
and natural resources committee adding that he would seek to make 
the departments nuclear operations better run and more open 
problems relating to safety health and the environment have 
not only been backlogged to intolerable levels but in effect 
hidden from public view until recently he said 
watkins also said he would seek to reduce us dependence on 
foreign oil and to promote greater use of renewable energy sources 
such as solar power 
congressional debate focused in the final five months of the 
reagan administration on the oncesecret nuclear facilities was on 
determining how bad the safety technical and managerial problems 
are at the 17site complex 
recently however the spotlight has begun moving toward the more 
complex and politically sensitive question of how to clean up an 
environmental mess that the government acknowledges was caused in 
part by too much focus on production goals 
the energy departments facilities develop build and test 
nuclear warheads for the pentagon a key link in the network a 
trio of nuclear reactors at savannah river plant in south carolina 
has been shut down since last spring because of safety concerns and 
a series of management and technical problems 
a key dilemma facing watkins if he is confirmed in the post is 
how to get the problem reactors running again in order to assure a 
supply of nuclear materials 
equally pressing however is the issue of cleaning up the 
pollution from past operations the extent of which the government 
acknowledges is not yet known 
billions of gallons of radioactive waste have been dumped into 
soil and groundwater at and around the nuclear plants which have 
been operated under contract by private companies since the late 
1940s while the energy department maintains that public health and 
safety are not yet threatened it says the risks and costs grow 
the longer an environmental cleanup is put off 
watkins said when his nomination was announced jan 12 that he 
was extremely conscious of environmental needs but he made no 
public comments before his senate hearing on a plan developed by the 
reagan administration for modernizing the weapons plants 
environmental groups have been critical of president bushs 
choice of watkins who served a fouryear stint as chief of naval 
operations before ending his 41year military career in 1986 he has 
no experience in the commercial energy field 
we are concerned that the appointment of adm watkins signals 
that cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound national 
energy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclear 
weapons production dan w reicher an attorney with the 
environmental group natural resources defense council said shortly 
after watkins nomination 
watkins 61 studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the 
oak ridge tenn national laboratory one of the energy 
departments key nuclear weapons facilities 
he was an instructor at naval nuclear power training centers in 
1960 and in 1964 when he took command of the nuclearpowered 
submarine snook 
while he enters the energy department at a time of heightened 
concern about the nuclear weapons program watkins also faces tough 
problems in the conventional energy field including a troubled 
commercial nuclear power industry 
chief among the more traditional issues is the united states 
growing dependence on foreign oil caused by rising consumption and 
falling domestic production the reagan administration said rising 
oil imports posed a potential threat to national security but it 
determined that no import restrictions were justified 
the watkins confirmation hearing originally was scheduled for 
feb 2 the white house asked for a postponement citing a delay in 
preparing watkins finanicial disclosure reports and 
longerthanexpected fbi probes of other cabinet nominees

soybean futures prices this morning on the chicago board of trade

an agriculture department report showing unexpectedly high wheat 
exports last week also contributed to the bullish tone analysts

been inspected for export last week about 15 million bushels more 
than the market had expected

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
intensified his warnings about growing inflationary pressures today 
labeling disturbing a new report which showed consumer prices 
shot up in january at their fastest pace in two years 
greenspan who was appearing for the second consecutive day of 
congressional testimony on the central banks handling of monetary 
policy referred to a government report released earlier in the day 
showing that consumer prices climbed by 06 percent in january 
spurred by higher costs for food and energy 
greenspan said that a recent acceleration in wage increases was 
probably the reason that prices at the consumer level were beginning 
to climb more rapidly 
appearing before a house banking subcommittee greenspan repeated 
his belief that the economy is not currently in danger of a 
recession but he said if inflation is allowed to get out of hand 
the next downturn could come suddenly 
if inflation reemerges i think a recession will move up on us 
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be 
a prolonged one he said 
greenspans warning put further distance between the central bank 
and the bush administration which has sought to play down fears 
that the country was about to embark on a new inflationary spiral 
president bush on several occasions has said he believes the 
feds efforts to push interest rates higher are an overreaction and 
run the danger of slowing economic growth 
the fed has so far ignored the comments putting in place just 
last week another round of credittightening consumer prices rose 
44 percent in 1988 and the latest fed move followed an unusually 
bad inflation report on wholesale prices in january 
let me stress that the current rate of inflation let alone an 
increase is not acceptable and our policies are designed to reduce 
inflation in coming years greenspan told the senate budget 
committee on tuesday 
the credittightening moves come at a particularly delicate time 
for the bush administration which based its 116 trillion 1990 
federal budget on assumptions that the economy would continue 
growing at a robust rate with interest rates declining significantly 
that economic forecast has been roundly criticized rep leon 
panetta dcalif and chairman of the house budget committee said 
tuesday that the bush assumptions are more optimistic than even the 
rosy scenario used by david stockman in preparing ronald 
reagans first budget in 1981 
panetta told michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser that 
wildly inflated economic assumptions will come back to haunt us 
and you in august when the administration is required to reassess 
the performance of the economy to determine whether mandatory 
acrosstheboard spending cuts will automatically take effect 
the bush budget is based on an assumption that economic growth 
will accelerate to an annual rate of 35 percent this year up from 
27 percent growth in 1988 as measured from the fourth quarter of 
the previous year 
in economic assumptions released tuesday greenspan said the fed 
is tailoring its policies to support economic growth of between 25 
percent and 3 percent in 1989 a top range that would be a full 
onehalf percentage point below the administrations estimate 
nonetheless both greenspan and the administration tried to 
minimize their disagreements with both sides listing prompt action 
to trim the federal budget deficit as the no 1 economic priority 
greenspan said the important thing is for congress and the 
administration to reach agreement quickly on a credible multiyear 
program to reduce the budget deficit which is expected to hit 163 
billion this year he said such action would reassure financial 
markets and allow interest rates to decline 
boskin testifying before the house budget committee maintained 
that the feds monetary policies are generally consistent with the 
administrations expectations for economic growth 
he also said he did not see any problem on the horizon that 
threatens to end the sixyear economic recovery the longest in 
peacetime history 
we are now at a point in the expansion where an acceleration of 
inflation is a greater risk than it was earlier boskin said 
this risk is real and we certainly do not want inflation to drift 
up into the 7 9 or finally doubledigit rates we saw in the 1970s 
the central bank has been pushing interest rates higher since 
march of last year an effort which has sent a variety of shortterm 
interest rates climbing by about 3 percent the fed believes that it 
is critical to dampen demand by increasing the costs of borrowing in 
light of the nations tight labor markets and high factory operating 
rates

japans largest airline announced today a 315 
billion deal to purchase 20 boeing 747400 airliners the largest 
purchase yet of boeings newest model 
the purchase by all nippon airways including spare parts and 
general electric engines for the airliners amounts to 57 percent 
of last years us trade deficit with japan boeing and ana 
officials said in a joint statement 
the japanese airline now has 78 boeing 747s 767s 737s and 727s 
flying its domestic or international routes ana which is the 
worlds eighth largest airline bought 11 boeing 747s in 1986 and 25 
boeing 767s in 1985 
sigeya goto ana executive vice president said the airline 
operates 747s on both domestic and international routes he said the 
new airliners are needed because of plans to increase the number of 
international flights 
goto also announced that ana was negotiating to purchase 15 to 20 
boeing 767s at a cost of 12 billion to 16 billion to meet 
increasing domestic demand he said delivery of both the 747s and 
767s is expected to begin in 1992 
ana flies more than 27 million passengers a year on 66 domestic 
routes and on international flights to washington dc los 
angeles beijing and dalian china guam sydney seoul and hong 
kong 
next year goto said the airline plans to add flights from tokyo 
to bangkok vienna moscow london and stockholm 
he said the airline selected the boeing 747400 because the 
airliners have a computercontrolled cockpit system that increases 
safety and reduces the work load of the pilots and an improved fuel 
system and advanced aerodynamic design that allow it to fly 1000 
miles further than the current 747s

in us consumer prices in january and a subsequent comment by 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan that he found the increase 
disturbing 
in addition further declines in the level of the british pound

penny stock scams and nonwall street insider 
trading will be the main targets of a new coasttocoast federal 
battle against securities fraud investigators say 
disclosure of offenses to be prosecuted made in telephone 
interviews this week marked the first mention of specific 
objectives for new task forces in six cities formed by attorney 
general dick thornburgh last month 
the justice department is spending 2 million to hire prosecutors 
for the fraud patrols the first permanent structured assault on 
financial corruption in a decade of highly publicized wall street 
crimes they will be based in new york chicago los angeles san 
francisco denver and kansas city mo 
the cases are out here to be done but everybody thinks the only 
place you get prosecutions for these things is the southern district 
of new york said irving einhorn regional administrator for the 
securities and exchange commission in los angeles 
the task forces were first proposed in 1987 by former us 
attorney rudolph w giuliani in new york who secured 50 convictions 
in his fiveyear term and a reputation for strongarm tactics in 
whitecollar prosecutions 
the task forces are expected to employ one highly criticized 
giuliani tactic using the threat of federal racketeering laws to 
extract cooperation from securities fraud targets 
the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc recently agreed 
to pay 650 million to settle criminal securities fraud violations 
but said it did so to avoid a seizure of assets under the 
racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations law known as 
rico the task forces even have been dubbed the six ricoteers 
us attorneys offices in the six cities are hiring 15 
prosecutors and arranging permanent help from the fbi sec 
commodity futures trading commission internal revenue service and 
other agencies 
one task force already has begun an investigation according to a 
progress report submitted to thornburghs office last week said 
david runkel a spokesman for the attorney general he declined to 
elaborate 
investigators said new york cases that have been ignored will get 
attention with the addition of six prosecutors fraud in penny 
stocks inexpensive highrisk stocks traded over the counter also 
will face intense scrutiny 
i have specific cases that would be could be should be 
prosecuted that are only not being prosecuted because there isnt 
someone to assign to them said assistant us attorney bruce 
baird who heads new yorks securities fraud division 
in los angeles a probe of boilerroom telemarketing scams 
resulting in 300 indictments in three years has steered resources 
from other whitecollar crimes the office obtained its first 
insider trading indictment just last week 
look for prosecutions of insider trading stock manipulation and 
penny stock fraud under the new task force assistant us attorney 
terree bowers said 
were still limited in resoures sometimes i feel like im 
fighting the battle of the alamo again said bowers who heads the 
major fraud division in los angeles and is getting three more 
prosecutors 
added the secs einhorn the epidemic is in penny stock fraud 
little manipulations the flybynight operations preying on small 
investors that take the money and run and then disappear 
in the other cities 
san francisco home to the pacific stock exchange is getting 
one prosecutor us attorney joseph p russoniello said fraud 
opportunities are ripe in public offerings by new hightechcompanies 
and in real estate 
chicago deep into probes of its two commodities markets the 
chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange will get 
three prosecutors to target cases on hold said executive assistant 
us attorney daniel gillogly 
denver is getting an extra prosecutor to focus on penny stock 
firms historically concentrated there because of its oil and mining

kansas city has a small commodities market with 259 members 
trading in wheat and stockindex futures that market isnt under 
investigation but us attorney robert g ulrich said hes received 
complaints of stockbroker abuse 
the manhattan us attorneys office which notched more than 20 
securities fraud indictments last year is considered the model for 
the task forces the number of securities prosecutors there has 
grown from three in 1983 to 14 today and other agencies have 
supplied help 
the federal government had not been vigilant enough to create a 
deterrent in that time they didnt know the level of the problem 
said giuliani 
the effort is seen as important because there is no single 
federal agency with jurisdiction to investigate criminal securities 
fraud the sec can bring only civil charges while the irs has both 
civil and criminal powers 
permanently assigning attorneys to securities fraud cases will 
create financial crimebusters outside new york officials said 
theres always been a large body of experts in the us 
attorneys office in the southern district of new york said sec 
enforcement director gary lynch the fact that there will be 
people designated in other offices means theyre going to be 
developing similar expertise

trucks and barges pile 52 million pounds of 
paper cans plastic and other trash daily onto a staten island 
dump building the worlds biggest mountain of garbage toward a 
height rivaling the skyscrapers across the bay in manhattan 
much of that could be recycled and new york officials have begun 
considering a plan to do so elsewhere more and more communities 
are already recycling the trash their citizens throw out 
they have little choice while the new york dump is planned to 
operate 11 more years a third of the nations 6000 garbage dumps 
are expected to shut within five years forcing communities to find 
new ways to dispose of their garbage 
every american man woman and child generates 35 pounds of 
refuse a day adding 160 million tons to the nations trash pile 
each year 
that pile holds 42 percent paper 23 percent food and yard waste 
94 percent glass 92 percent metals 65 percent plastics and 94 
percent other materials according to the us environmental 
protection agency 
ten states already require or soon will require residents to 
separate newspapers glass jars milk cartons tin cans or other 
discarded items for recycling trucks or bins legislators in 33 
states are expected to consider plans to increase recycling this 
year 
people dont want incinerators or dumps near them so they are 
beginning to force their elected officials to start recycling 
programs said cynthia pollock shea a senior researcher at 
worldwatch institute a nonprofit organization that studies 
environmental issues 
recycling is not new in the united states during world war ii 
everybody recycled said barry commoner director of queens 
colleges center for the biology of natural systems people even 
recycled rubber bands and string 
but the efforts to conserve mostly ended with the war now only 
10 percent of the nations garbage is recycled compared to as much 
as 60 percent by some cities in europe and japan 
studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be 
recycled and epa has set a goal of recycling 25 percent in four 
years 
the process of recycling is simple separating usable products 
from the trash processing them so they can be substituted for more 
expensive raw materials at manufacturing plants and returning them 
to the marketplace as parts of new products 
it has not been so easy to put into effect some communities have 
had trouble finding buyers for discarded newspapers glass or 
plastic recycling programs require startup funds and perhaps 
most importantly peoples habits of throwing trash into only one 
can be difficult to change 
still experts predict recycling will eventually become a part of 
the everyday infrastructure of cities and towns 
today trash trucks dominate waste hauling said peter 
grogan director of material recovery for rw beck and associates 
which has helped dozens of communities start recycling programs 
but by the year 2010 were going to see as many recycling trucks 
as dump trucks recycling centers as common as video shops and 
recycling introduced in lesson plans in schools across the country 
among the communities now making it easier for residents to 
recycle trash several are considered international models 
hamburg ny a buffalo suburb started a program in 1981 and 
now claims 98 percent of its 3350 households participate unless 
they want to eat their garbage they better separate it or we wont 
pick it up said ann kankolenski a public works department 
employee she said 34 percent of the trash is recycled and nearly 
all the rest burned 
seattle residents already recycled 24 percent of their garbage 
before the city started its program last year and the city is aiming 
for 60 percent in 10 years even steel garbage cans are being 
recycled 
wilton nh officials say a voluntary sixtown program in 
southwestern new hampshire has 70 percent participation started a 
decade ago the program recycles 42 percent of the garbage brought 
to a center burns 47 percent and buries 11 percent 
even more is possible 
connie leach vermonts recycling director feeds her food scraps 
to worms 
they eat everything up leach said of the little red worms 
that are covered with peat moss in a basement box lined with plastic 
and newspapers the worms digestive system allows them to eat the 
food quickly and so far it hasnt attracted cockroaches or mice 
ive been very surprised at how well it works she said 
leach named recycler of the year in 1987 by the national 
recycling coalition doesnt stop there she recycles all her 
household waste except for some types of plastics junk mail on 
highgrade paper and light bulbs in a month she throws out only 
two small bags 
ed steyh seattles administrator of garbage and recycling 
contracts also goes to great lengths to recycle his trash 
he lives on an island in puget sound where he can recycle only 
tin cans so on his ferry rides to work he takes newspapers glass 
aluminum cans and other items 
i bring them to my inlaws and they recycle it with their 
things steyh said 
solid waste management companies also are expanding into 
recycling creating more markets for recycled materials 
everyone is jumping on the bandwagon said darlene snow 
recycling director for the national solid waste management 
association which represents 2500 companies that handle half of 
the nations household waste and 95 percent of its industrial waste 
she said the industry approached recycling warily they had a 
routine a routine without a lot of regulations then all these 
state laws came she said what happened was that haulers 
nationwide were losing business to recycling 
now industry seminars on the topic are full she said 
the recycling movement also has put in jeopardy some proposed 
trashtoenergy incinerators planned incinerators have been shelved 
in los angeles seattle boston philadelphia and austin texas 
incinerators have been touted as a way to produce energy and 
reduce the amount of garbage but questions persist about the affect 
on air quality and on the disposal of the byproduct of ash laced 
with toxins 
in 1983 new york city proposed what would be the worlds largest 
trashtoenergy incineration system the project which still needs 
federal and state permits faces stiff opposition from 
environmentalists and neighborhood groups 
environmentalists say the solution to the citys garbage crisis 
should be aggressive recycling their goals are 60 percent in 10 
years 90 percent in 20 years currently the city recycles less 
than 1 percent of its trash 
however under legislation proposed earlier this month in new 
york city mandatory recycling would be phased in over five years 
the debate has now changed from what are we going to do about 
the garbage crisis to how much can we recycle said david 
antonioli a staff member with the new york public interest research 
group the earth is not a dump

mountains of scrap tires are being eroded by 
entrepreneurs who are cutting them up for fuel mixing them with 
asphalt to extend highway life and using them to soften airport 
runways 
the pioneers are seeking profitable ways to recycle discarded 
tires and remove a huge trash problem an estimated 240 million 
tires are added to the highly flammable heaps each year 
some tires are recycled the oldfashioned way by retreading but 
only 20 percent are suited for that use a few get new life as 
buffers for marine and truck loading docks some end up in the 
backyard as tire swings 
but most tires just piled up until business people and scientists 
recently stepped up efforts to find new uses 
in cleveland for instance a company is experimenting with 
chopped up tires as a fuel additive in coalfired boilers to see if 
they can reduce acid rain and scrap tires are being used as 
components in septic tank systems 
for some finding new uses for scrap tires is like hauling 
garbage you get paid to take it in and get paid to make it into a 
fuel said anderson b carothers chairman of waste recovery inc 
his company uses scrap tires as a supplemental fuel at three 
woodprocessing plants 
we compete against oil in the northwest against gas in 
louisiana and in the southeast were competing against coal 
carothers said 
waste recovery spent 2 million apiece on plants in portland 
ore houston and atlanta each capable of burning 5 million tires a 
year but the company is not making money yet carothers said 
robert h snyder former research director of uniroyal a 
tiremaker that is now part of uniroyal goodrich tire co spent much 
of his career trying to build a better tire and now is working to 
retire the mountains of leftovers 
its very clear to me that a scrap tire can very well pay for 
its selfdisposal he contends 
snyder a consultant in detroit said much of his current 
research is confidential because he intends to seek patents but he 
said one new use is adding chopped bits of tires to speed up the 
composting of sewage sludge 
its gathering a fair amount of momentum snyder said citing 
community programs in new hampshipe and research at rutgers 
university in new jersey and in us department of agriculture 
laboratories in maryland 
if each of the 250 sludge composting sites in the nation used 
scrap tire chips instead of traditional wood chips to promote the 
process a threeyear supply of scrap tires would be needed snyder 
said 
another trend people in the business foresee is increasing state 
and city regulation of scrap tire disposal carothers said disposal 
costs range from 25 to 50 cents a tire depending on licensing and 
transportation costs 
florida for instance began a 50cent surcharge on each new tire 
sale this year to finance disposal the surcharge will double to 1 
in 1990

greenspan said today in testimony before the house banking committee

there has been a lot of optimism built into the market and 
youre seeing some of that come out said john candela head of

violating a 1981 agreement 
under the agreement the company representing the three surviving 
beatles and the estate of the john lennon allowed apple computer to 
use the apple trademark on some products he said 
but apple corps contends that apple computer violated 
stipulations not to use the trademark on any apparatus 
specifically designed and intended for synthesizing music he said 
over the past few years the computer company has developed 
topselling hardware with music synthesizing capabilities 
apple corps is seeking an injunction to prevent the further sale

wednesday on the chicago board of trade in a surge attributed to 
technical factors in the absence of significant supplyanddemand 
developments 
corn and wheat futures also advanced while oat futures prices 
fell slightly 
the soybean complex repeated a pattern established tuesday 
soybean oil prices rallied first on buying by speculators who trade 
mainly on chart interpretations that triggered sympathetic buying 
in the soybean and soybean meal markets 
it was a very firm close overall said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
wheat futures were supported by signs of heightened export 
demand including talk that the soviet union had submitted a bid for 
400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
at the close wheat was cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 426 a bushel corn was

mexico plans to cut oil exports about 5 
percent and raise some crude prices by 10 cents a barrel starting 
march 1 in an effort to help strengthen world oil prices government 
sources said wednesday 
the disclosures followed tuesdays meeting in london of nonopec 
producing countries including mexico who have pledged to support 
opecs effort to reduce production and raise prices 
a source at the state oil monopoly pemex who insisted on 
anonymity said the government would announce the cuts within the 
next few days 
emilio matar a spokesman for pemex confirmed that the new 
prices would take effect march 1 
the increases would be for the posted price of mexican light 
isthmus sold to the united states and western europe and extralight 
olmec sold to the united states 
energy and mines secretary fernando hiriart told reporters on 
monday that mexico was willing to reduce its exports by 5 to 6 
percent for the rest of this year provided other oil exporting 
countries reduce their sales 
the pemex source said that if other countries honor the london 
agreement mexico would reduce its average daily exports by as much 
as 65000 barrels a day the amount would probably vary from month 
to month but could average about 5 percent lower than january 
exports the source said 
the source did not say which countries exports would be targeted 
for cutbacks 
details of the london agreement have not been released a 
statement issued after tuesdays meeting said that some countries 
would reduce exports while others would freeze sales temporarily and 
that details were forthcoming 
production by mexico the worlds sixth largest crude oil 
producer averages 25 million barrels a day in january it 
exported a total of 13 million barrels a day approximately half 
to the united states japan its principal customer in the far east 
buys an average of 180000 barrels daily 
mexico also imports 58000 barrels daily from the united states 
for some of its northern border region to save transportation costs 
last november the 13member organization of petroleum exporting 
countries agreed to lower its exports to 185 million barrels a day 
in the first half of 1989 to buoy world market prices and called on 
independent producers to make similar cuts mexico is not a member 
of opec but often uses that international cartels pricing 
guidelines 
opec whose production late last year was estimated at 225 
million barrels a day agreed to the new quota after oil prices 
sagged to about 10 a barrel well below the cartels benchmark of 
18 
mexico sets different prices for its crude for the united states 
europe and the far east under longterm contracts with individual 
customers 
the price of heavy maya to the united states averaged 1238 a 
barrel during the first half of january while isthmus averaged 
1586 and olmec 1680 barrel in western europe maya averaged 
1152 and isthmus 1571 a barrel in the far east maya averaged 
1220 and isthmus 1485 a barrel according to the latest pemex 
figures 
pemex sells olmec which it started producing in mid1988 in 
small quantities only to the united states

the nightmare on ad street isnt invincible movie 
fiend freddy krueger but to the advertising industry its just as 
threatening 
this nightmare is state taxes on advertising which have been 
proposed in several states despite the ad industrys major victory 
over floridas ad tax 
fifteen months after a storm of industry criticism forced florida 
to repeal its shortlived and controversial 5 percent tax on 
advertising and a host of other services ad trade groups nervously 
are eyeing connecticut 
the head of the connecticut legislatures taxwriting committee 
says he wants to tax advertising and predicts success there could 
prompt similar taxes in neighboring new york massachusetts and 
rhode island 
its the most threatening situation we have faced since the 
florida fight said dan jaffe who heads the washington office of 
the association of national advertisers a trade and lobbying group 
legislation that advertisers fear could lead to a tax on 
advertising is before a legislative committee in missouri but is not 
expected to go any further foes killed a diiluted advertising sales 
tax plan applying only to political ads earlier this month in 
south dakota 
and in oregon state revenue officials have withdrawn their 
support for a proposal to tax broadcasting companies on the basis of 
viewership in the state 
nonetheless advertisers their agencies and media buyers say 
they must remain vigilant because budgetary pressures are growing in 
many states 
advertisers argue that taxing advertising will make products more 
expensive and depress sales cutting into state tax revenue 
they say taxing advertising would reduce the amount of 
information that gets out to consumers about products and warn that 
states with such taxes risk driving out business and national ad 
spending 
but those arguments are engendering less sympathy in some 
cashstrapped states where a few lawmakers say taxing activities 
such as advertising is preferable to spending cuts and general tax 
hikes 
there is no reason i can see that they should be excluded from 
the tax said sen william dibella a hartford democrat who is 
backing a proposal to subject advertising to the 75 percent sales 
and use tax in connecticut 
dibella chairs the committee that will conduct a hearing next 
month on the proposal terms of which are still being drafted he 
estimated that taxing advertising could generate 110 million to 
120 million annually and said the committee may earmark proceeds 
for politicallyappealing efforts to combat drugs and crime 
dibella said in a telephone interview that he has visited 
lawmakers in florida several times to discuss their experience in 
taxing advertising and other services and said he thinks a similar 
tax could work in connecticut 
the florida tax situation attracted national attention because it 
taxed outofstate services used by floridians companies buying 
advertisements in magazines or the broadcast networks for instance 
were required to pay a tax based on circulation or viewership in 
florida 
the tax enacted in july 1987 was repealed six months later amid 
an outcry that saw ad trade groups cancel conventions planned in the 
state and national advertisers threaten to cut florida ad spending 
dibella said he is unimpressed with arguments that companies 
would quit advertising in connecticut or move out of state if 
advertising were taxed 
this state has one of the highest per capita incomes in the 
nation and i doubt that anybody is going to turn their backs on 
that he said 
in missouri two bills are pending in committee that would end 
exemptions for advertising and a number of other items from the 
state sales tax 
but the sponsor of one of the bills rep karen mccarthy a 
kansas city democrat who chairs the panel handling both measures 
said by telephone she has no intention of moving either bill any 
further this year 
earlier this month a plan to impose the south dakota state sales 
tax on advertising was killed in the state house even after being 
amended to apply only to political advertising 
in oregon the state department of revenue recently withdrew its 
support for a proposal to change the way the state taxes the profits 
of broadcasting companies to include oregon viewership as part of 
the calculation 
jim brown a state revenue official said the department changed 
its mind about the bill due to opposition from local broadcasters 
and a judgment that the proposal was illtimed he said the bill 
probably was dead for the session

warner was convicted in march 1987 of nine criminal charges 
arising from the march 1985 collapse of home state a privately

sears roebuck and cos plans to streamline its 
advertising budget is raising concerns among newspapers that count 
the nations biggest retailer as a major source of revenue industry 
leaders said wednesday 
publishers are expressing uncertainty about the financial impact 
of the proposed changes by sears the nations largest newspaper 
advertiser 
but some newspaper executives who are negotiating with sears say 
they believe the talks will produce agreements beneficial to both 
sides 
sears roebuck and co came to the dance with newspapers the 
fact that they want to continue to dance with newspapers is a very 
heartening thing to me said jerry tilis vice president of 
marketing with knightridder inc which publishes 32 newspapers in 
27 markets 
sears has indicated that in conjunction with a major corporate 
restructuring announced oct 31 that it planned to centralize its 
adbuying and was asking newspaper groups to help by dealing with 
sears at the corporate rather than local level 
from newspaper chains we are requesting corporate contracts 
that will ultimately lead to one order one invoice with a single 
rate that would cover each newspaper application s scott 
harding sears national retail ad manager said in a speech last 
month to a meeting of the international newspaper advertising and 
marketing executives in san francisco 
sears proposals are rooted in its proposed corporate 
restructuring a major part of the restructuring involves 
repositioning sears retail outlets as stores of superstores 
offering more brandname goods at discount prices 
in conjunction sears wants to dramatically increase the 
quality consistency and impact of our print advertising 
costeffectively harding said in the speech to the reston 
vabased trade association 
harding backed up the plea for cooperation with a statement that 
some newspaper publishers have perceived as a threat saying sears 
needs to either reduce its print advertising costs or utilize 
alternatives that provide a more costeffective means of reaching 
consumers 
reggie hall executive director of the international newspaper 
advertising and marketing executives said hardings statement was 
not so much an ultimatum as a financial fact 
in this business there are always alternatives thats why its 
so competitive hall said the yellow pages billboards the 
back of a bus those are all ways of distributing your message 
tilis who said he had been negotiating with sears for about six 
months agreed 
im sort of happy theyre talking to us as opposed to the local 
directmailer or the local cable advertiser he said 
some newspaperchain executives said sears proposals were 
accelerating an existing movement toward industrywide 
standardization of national advertising rates 
gary sherlock executive vice president of newspaper advertising 
with gannett co inc owner of the nations largest chain said his 
company had not determined that complying with sears proposals 
would result in a loss of ad revenue 
tilis said newspaper chains might even find an increase in 
advertising dollars from sears 
we have a vehicle the newspaper that can address most of 
what sears wants to accomplish with their new direction he said 
if we can position ourselves with sears to be the solution 
then i think the answer is yes if were unable to come up with a 
fit then i think the chances of more revenue are not as good 
but what i draw tremendous comfort and confidence from is that 
they need to communicate with a massive audience frequently tilis 
said these arent people saying give me more for less these 
are people who want to forge new partnerships with newspapers

stock prices posted their biggest decline in 
three months today after the government reported a jump in consumer 
prices and the head of the federal reserve said he was disturbed by 
recent inflation trends 
the statement by fed chairman alan greenspan coupled with the 
labor departments report that consumer prices rose at a 72 percent 
annual rate in january raised concerns that the fed would tighten 
interest rates to squelch inflation 
high shortterm interest rates could drain money away from stocks 
and into higheryielding securities such as treasury bills in 
addition high rates might push the economy into a recession that 
would be bad for stocks 
there has been a lot of optimism built into the market and 
youre seeing some of that come out said john candela head of 
fixedincome and commodities trading at ladenburg thalmann amp co 
the 06 percent increase in the consumer price index in january 
was propelled by higher costs for gasoline poultry fish eggs and 
tobacco it followed moderate increases of 03 percent in both 
november and december

consumer prices shot up 06 percent last month 
their fastest rise in two years the government said wednesday in a 
report that analysts cited as fresh evidence of entrenched and 
accelerating inflation 
propelled by higher costs for food energy and a variety of other 
goods and services the seasonally adjusted increase in the consumer 
price index doubled the moderate 03 percent gains of november and 
december the labor department said 
januarys rise if it persisted for 12 months would amount to an 
annual inflation rate of 72 percent a dramatic increase from the 
44 percent posted for both 1988 and 1987 
inflation is accelerating pure and simple said economist 
allen sinai of the boston co it shows some signs of lurching out 
of control any way you cut that report inflation was everywhere 
he predicted the federal reserve board would respond by swiftly 
driving interest rates higher in an attempt to slow the economy and 
dampen inflationary presures 
fed chairman alan greenspan testifying before a house banking 
subcommittee wednesday called januarys gain disturbing and 
said the rising prices were probably the result of accelerating wage 
increases 
financial markets fell sharply as the report and greenspans 
comments fueled fears of inflation and rising interest rates the 
dow jones 30stock average fell 4250 points its steepest drop in 
more than three months 
the market is getting a little bit jittery said economist 
dan seto of nikko securities co international inc in new york 
the market will look for the fed to put more pressure on interest 
rates 
last months 06 percent increase in consumer prices was the 
biggest jump since a 07 percent rise in january 1987 
higher prices for fuels poultry fish and eggs coupled with a 
sharp advance in tobacco prices accounted for much of the price 
acceleration 
food costs were up 07 percent and energy costs rose 08 percent 
even excluding those two volatile categories consumer prices were 
up 05 percent 
increased food prices were attributed in part to aftereffects 
from last summers drought but also to generally higher costs of 
doing business including rising distribution and packaging expenses 
rising energy prices were pinned to higher costs for crude oil 
one of the biggest increases last month came in costs for tobacco 
and other smoking products which jumped 47 percent after major 
cigarette makers raised wholesale prices in december 
the only two bright spots in januarys report were clothing and 
housing costs apparel prices were down 01 percent as retailers 
continued to mark down winter merchandise housing costs rose a 
modest 02 percent 
the concern has to be that while inflations not running away 
here it nonetheless is getting somewhat worse said economist 
lawrence chimerine of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
forecasting firm the trend is upward and thats whats 
distrurbing 
sinai called the report sobering because it is always 
unacceptably high inflation that gets the economy in trouble since 
it inflation drives the federal reserve to raise interest rates 
more than anyone would like or expects 
those higher interest rates damage the economy as part of the 
price of getting inflation down he said 
last months advance left the price index at 1211 percent of its 
198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 
100 during the base period would have cost 12110 in january 60 
cents more than in december 
unlike other figures in the report the overall index is not 
adjusted for seasonal fluctuations 
in another report today the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation increased 
06 percent in january after falling 03 percent in the preceding 
month 
average weekly earnings last month were 32948 in january 43 
percent higher than a year earlier 
even in advance of todays cpi figures worries about inflation 
had been heightened by evidence that the economy entered 1989 with 
strong momentum and by a sharp 1 percent jump in wholesale prices 
during january 
greenspan in congressional testimony tuesday had indicated the 
central bank would continue to push interest rates higher in an 
effort to check inflation 
let me stress that the current rate of inflation let alone an 
increase is not acceptable and our policies are designed to reduce 
inflation in coming years he said 
the labor department gave these other details of january price 
increases 
the increase in food prices was paced by a 16 percent jump in 
costs for meats poultry fish and eggs cereal and bakery product 
prices rose 1 percent and dairy products were up 11 percent 
gasoline costs were up 09 percent during the month after 
dropping 16 percent in december fuel oil costs jumped 43 percent 
while prices for natural gas and electricity were up 03 percent 
newcar prices were up 07 percent while used car costs jumped 
05 percent 
medical care costs rose 08 percent 
the annualized inflation rate is derived from a more precise 
calculation of monthly price changes than the monthly number made 
public by the department

yugo america inc said wednesday it has resumed 
reimbursing dealers for warranty work performed while the 
beleaguered company has been entangled in bankruptcy proceedings 
yugo dealers which have dropped to 260 from 340 a year ago have 
complained that they havent been reimbursed for warranty work or 
rebates authorized by the yugoslavian carmaker 
marcel kole acting chief executive officer said checks totaling 
130000 were mailed for warranty work between jan 31 and feb 15 
covering all claims for work done during the first two weeks of this 
month 
the amount was slightly little less than warranty expenditures 
before yugo america and its parent company global motors inc 
filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws jan 30 
hearings on the petition are being held in newark nj yugo 
ameria is based in upper saddle river nj 
kole said the money was coming from zavodi crevna zastava the 
yugoslavian company that makes the little economy car introduced in 
the united states in 1985 whatever expenses we are incurring 
they are financing he said 
kole said the payments mailed wednesday were for warranty work 
performed after the petition was filed in bankruptcy court warranty 
claims filed with the company before that time are part of 
bankruptcy proceedings 
he also said negotiations are continuing with some unidentified 
us organizations about financing a restructured yugo company 
the yugoslavians are looking for a prospective investor as a 
partner with them kole said they also recognize that they do 
not share the marketing expertise to make this a successful 
venture 
he said offers from three parties are being discussed and two 
groups familiar with us automobile marketing are close to an 
agreement 
kole said there are about 9200 yugos in the hands of dealers and 
another 6000 in the country

officials of the material handling industry asked 
president bush on wednesday to appoint a commission to study how a 
voluntary steel import limit has affected domestic steel prices 
the voluntary restraint agreement was enacted by congress five 
years ago to restrict the import of foreign steel and help the 
domestic steel industry recover from a slump 
we support a strong domestic steel industry said albert 
leffler chief executive officer of the material handling industry 
of america a trade group representing tractor lift truck and robot 
manufacturers but we feel something is wrong 
leffler said the reduced manufacturing capacity of domestic 
steelmakers and reduced imports have caused steel shortages and 
higher steel prices putting his industry at the mercy of the steel 
industry 
the little guy cant question price and quality at the same 
time leffler said during a conference at the industrys trade 
show here he has to take what the steel industry gives him 
officials of the material handling industry say steel prices for 
us manufacturers rose 17 percent in 1988 while prices for the 
auto industry increased only 4 percent 
leffler said the material handling industry which consumes about 
15 percent of domestic steel wants to see some modification in the 
restraint agreement 
he agreed that the us steel industry is healthier since the 
enactment of the voluntary restraint agreement but he said recent 
productivity gains by the industry may have been produced by closing 
obsolete plants and by the devalued dollar 
though the vra program started with the best intentions it has 
created a cartellike atmosphere that is charged with opportunity 
for abuse leffler said the small customer without a voice will 
get lost in the cheers for big steels success 
a bill authorizing the extention of the voluntary restraint 
agreement is currently before congress 
we realize that president bush and many members of congress are 
supporting the extension of the restraint agreement in the fall of 
1989 but they have the time now to rethink and modify the program 
before it is too late laffer said 
he said representatives of the trade group will meet with 
congressional representatives of steel producing states to try to 
influence them to modify the agreement

fear of inflation and higher interest rates 
produced the stock markets worst day in three months wednesday as 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 40 
points 
the 4250point decline in the dow jones average to 228393 
was its biggest drop since a 4766point slide on veterans day 
nov 11 
triggering the decline was the labor departments report that 
consumer prices jumped 06 percent in january it was the biggest 
rise in two years and amounted to an annual rate of 72 percent 
the inflation report worried stock investors because it increased 
the likelihood that the federal reserve would continue to jack up 
shortterm interest rates to discourage borrowing and cool off the 
economy 
high interest rates provide an attractive alternative to stocks 
oneyear treasury bills for example provide a guaranteed annual 
yield of more than 9 percent 
as shortterm rates go up stocks become less attractive quite 
frankly said james v pease managing director for equities at 
mcdonald amp co securities inc in cleveland 
confirming stock owners fears federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan told a house banking subcommittee wednesday that the 
latest inflation report was disturbing and said credit 
tightening would continue until the fed was satisfied that the 
economy had slowed enough to lessen inflationary pressures 
in addition to siphoning money out of stocks the high interest 
rates raise the risk of a recession which would lower corporate 
profits and thus hurt stock prices

nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with

qt wiles stepped down wednesday as 
chairman and chief executive of miniscribe corp as rumors of 
financial troubles that were denied by the company caused heavy 
trading in the stock 
miniscribe a maker of personal computer hard disk drives fell 
50 cents a share to 4 a share in overthecounter trading of more 
than 4 million shares 
wiles 69 resigned during a regular board meeting because his 
family position does not now allow him to spend the time and energy 
required to act as chief executive through another difficult period 
in the industry according to a company statement his resignation 
was effective immediately 
richard p rifenburgh 57 wiles partner at hambrecht amp quist 
venture partners was elected by the board as the new chairman and 
chief executive at wiles suggestion 
spokeswoman jeanne boyd denied one rumor that a major supplier 
had cut off supplies because of nonpayment of bills the company 
conceded that it was late on some bills but had not been cut off 
everything is fine there are no payment problems she said 
the 52week high for the stock was 1375 a share 
miniscribe reported a 1988 fourthquarter loss last week of 146 
million and said continuing losses were expected in the first half 
of this year because of a slowdown in the market 
wiles commented wednesday that after a growth in revenues from 
115 million in 1985 to 603 million in 1988 it was best to 
stabilize the business and prepare for the next expansion period 
wiles resignation comes amid rumors of more layoffs at the 
company miniscribe laid off 240 longmont workers in december and 
employees said they expect another round of layoffs when paychecks 
are handed out friday 
company officials earlier this week declined to comment on the 
layoff rumor

aluminum producers have raised the price of 
sheet used in beverage cans by 6 percent but consumers may have to 
swallow little of that even if can makers fail to stem the metals 
rise industry officials said wednesday 
can makers are likely to fight hard to reject the increases 
announced tuesday first by pittsburghbased aluminum co of america 
and then by reynolds metals co of richmond va the nations 
secondlargest producer behind alcoa 
we meet a lot of resistance to higher prices from bottlers 
said frank dalton spokesman for crown cork amp seal of philadelphia 
wed like to give the aluminum companies a lot of resistance too 
if the increase sticks it would hurt if we could not pass it 
through dalton said 
alcoa blamed the price hike on higher prices for scrap and higher 
labor costs 
alcoa last raised prices on can body stock to 115 per pound in 
january 1988 it now cost will about 122 per pound 
aluminum producers held off raising prices last year because of 
an increased threat from steel as a material for beverage containers 
were still mindful of the competition but with higher metal 
costs and higher labor costs were forced to make the increase 
now alcoa spokesman al posti said 
a pound of aluminum sheet makes 25 cans so the extra eight cents 
per pound means each can would cost a third of a cent more and each 
24can case an extra 76 cents said david moison analyst for 
resource stratigies inc 
i would think that wholesalers retailers and distributors 
would completely miss 7 cents a case moison said 
industry analyst paul steinke of wharton econometrics forecasting 
associates gives the can makers a good chance of turning back at 
least part of the increase 
both alcoa and reynoldsposted record profits in 1988 can 
makers know that consumers know that so i dont think people are 
going to accept it at face value he said there may be some 
increase but not the full 6 percent 
the price move could also be undermined by any economic slowdown 
which many economists expect later this year large additions to 
sheet capacity by alcoa and aluminum co of canada will further 
undermine prices by boosting supply steinke said 
i wouldnt be surprised if the increase was completely eroded 
by the end of summer he said if what im saying is true then 
i think consumers will be pretty immune from it 
but aluminum producers been doing well can makers are being 
pinched by suppliers and customers 
the bottlers have been just beating up on the can makers 
said one can industry executive who spoke on condition he not be 
named 
there used to be a lot of smaller familyowned soft drink 
franchises around the country but pepsi and coke have bought up so 
much of them that these monsters go into negotiations and beat up on 
these guys he said push will come to shove and theyll not 
sell cans at a loss 
j clarence morrison a metals analyst for dean witter reynolds 
said tight supplies made the aluminum price hike a foregone 
conclusion 
can stock is fully sold out for 1989 and probably for the first 
part of 1990 although the price is being raised to 123 here 
japan has been paying as much as 150 per pound and cannot meet its 
demand he said 
the contract price for alumina an intermediate form between 
bauxite and aluminum has doubled from 150 per ton last year to 
300 per ton and the spot market price of alumina has reached 800 
at times morrison said 
the price of used aluminum cans which account for half of the 
metal alcoa uses has been at record levels of 71 cents to 74 cents 
per pound 
alcoa on wednesday raised the price it pays for used cans from 73 
cents to 76 cents a pound posti said

the nations former largest producer of 
steel freight car frames said wednesday it would resume production 
after a sixyear hiatus primarily because of increased demand for 
its product 
the granite city foundry owned by american steel foundries 
closed in 1982 when the railroad supply industry went into a steep 
recession 
but asf president norman berg said at a news conference that the 
chicagobased company plans to reopen the plant may 15 
the railroad products business continues to strengthen he 
said the market is indicating to us that orders for new freight 
cars will continue to gain momentum 
before it closed the foundry led the nation in producing steel 
railroad car side frames and bolsters which form the undercarriages 
of freight cars berg said 
at its peak in 1979 the plant produced 25000 steel freight car 
frames and employed 1500 workers last summer the company recalled 
about 35 former employees to get the facility ready for use 
by early summer an additional 230 employees will be back on the 
job berg said 
since the early 1980s berg said the company has pumped more 
than 14 million into the plant for improvements 
plant manager william donovan said it was impossible to predict 
the number of workers who eventually will regain their jobs since 
the employment level depends on industry demand 
in its first year however donovan said the foundry would have a 
payroll of about 5 million welcome news for this 
steelindustrybased town of 37000 residents across the mississippi 
river from st louis 
this is like a resurrection said mayor von dee cruse noting 
that the average hourly wage at the plant was 10 
the foundry had 850 employees when it closed cruse said since 
then he said some former foundry skilled labor switched to granite 
city steel the towns largest employer with a 3600member work 
force while others found jobs elsewhere 
others who made the foundry their career but had few skills 
remained unemployed said cruse though he could provide no figures 
berg said that while the decision to resume production largely 
was based on the increased demand for railroad products company 
officials looked at other factors 
we asked for and received agreements from our unions on a 
number of necessary workrule changes he said all four of the 
unions have been most cooperative in working with us to reopen this 
foundry 
the company also cited the illinois power co for designing a 
favorable rate structure the foundry uses large amounts of 
electricity 
asf also has plants in alliance ohio east chicago ind and 
hammond ind which will continue their operations berg said asf 
is a division of chicagobased amsted industries inc

american express co is beefing up its marketing 
efforts on campus offering travel bargains and launching a magazine 
for college students who carry the american express card the 
company said wednesday 
researchers say there are about 7 million fulltime college 
students in the united states spending an estimated 44 billion a 
year 
students also have the potential for substantial earnings growth 
once they are graduated and financial service companies are finding 
that it can often pay off to establish a relationship while they are 
still in college 
the market research company collegetrak said 51 percent of 
college students already have one of the major credit or charge 
cards 
citibank the nations largest banking company which has also 
courted the college crowd counts 13 million college students as 
holders of either its visa or mastercard credit cards 
american express said the number of college students holding its 
payments card has doubled to more than 500000 in the past two 
years partly because of relaxed eligibility requirements 
fulltime college students can get an american express card 
without meeting any minimum income requirement and without a parent 
as cosigner provided they do not have a bad credit record the 
annual fee is 55 the same as for regular cardholders and payment 
in full is due every month 
despite the relaxed eligibility requirements people who got the 
american express in college were just as responsible about 
credit as other new cardholders according to ken chenault 
general manager of american express personal card division 
ed skonicki a citibank executive said his bank has had the same 
experience they take responsibility a lot more seriously than you 
would expect he said 
under the new american express program cardholders who are 
fulltime students at a fouryear college will get two vouchers for 
round trips at 99 each between any two domestic destinations served 
by northwest airlines in the 48 contiguous states 
in addition they will get vouchers for reduced rates on 
northwest to specific destinations and bonus mileage toward 
northwests free travel program 
tickets must be purchased with an american express card issued to 
the student named on the voucher 
american express also plans to publish a quarterly lifestyle 
magazine american express connections that will be sent to its 
college student cardholders the magazine will offer tips on travel 
and money management stories about campus theater and the 
professions and mailorder clothing electronics entertainment and 
travel 
american express officials declined to specify how much it was 
spending on the program but said it was a multimillion dollar 
effort

massachusetts leading an effort by the 
northeastern states to dramatically reduce smogcausing gasoline 
emissions sued the environmental protection agency on wednesday for 
delaying action on the states gasoline volatility regulations 
if the epa cant take the lead in forging an aggressive new 
national environmental policy then the very least they can do is 
get out of the way when states like massachusetts take the 
initiative attorney general james shannon said 
the suit asks the epa for an immediate decision on the 
regulations 
the state department of environmental quality engineering 
proposed rules last may requiring gasoline manufacturers to 
reformulate gasoline sold in massachusetts primarily by eliminating 
a butane additive during the summer to reduce smogcausing 
emissions 
under the regulations which massachusetts hoped to impose this 
year gasoline sold in the commonwealth between may 1 and sept 15 
must have a reid vapor pressure of 9 pounds per square inch or less 
compared with the 115 psi common now 
rvp is the measure of a gasolines volatility the lower the rvp 
the less the gasoline evaporates vapors that contribute to the 
formulation of groundlevel ozone 
currently only california has such standards which received epa 
approval since the 1970s but following massachusetts action 
connecticut maine new jersey rhode island and vermont passed 
similar regulations and now all are waiting to see what happens with 
massachusetts application to the epa to implement the gasoline 
restrictions 
each individual state must receive epa approval before the 
regulations can take effect 
massachusetts which had a record 53 days last summer in which 
its air quality exceeded federal health standards from cape cod to 
the western part of the state estimates its gasoline regulations 
could reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds in the air by 
9000 tons a year 
officials have estimated the restrictions implemented regionwide 
could reduce these compounds by more than 150000 tons annually in 
the northeast 
massachusetts submitted its regulations for epa review in july 
in the suit filed wednesday in us district court in boston 
shannon alleged the agency failed to meet federal clean air act 
guidelines requiring a decision in four months 
we have admittedly taken longer than this four months although 
it is arguable whether the four months is a mandatory requirement or 
not epa regional administrator michael deland said in an 
interview 
deland said his office told shannon in explicit terms and this 
was prior to our realization that he was going to be filing a suit 
we would process the massachusetts application by this summers 
ozone season 
delands air quality chief steve perkins said massachusetts 
regulations will be published in the federal register on thursday 
beginning a 30day comment period before the epa and then the office 
of management and budget can make a ruling 
deland said that he personally favors massachusetts regulations 
but he said other factors to consider include whether the state 
regulations would conflict with epas proposal to set a national rvp 
standard of 105 psi under the epas plan the national standard 
would not reach massachusetts 90 psi limit until 1992 
deland said the oil industry contends it will be forced to 
produce more gasoline if it has to eliminate the butane additive 
that commonly makes up about 2 percent of the gasoline sold to 
motorists 
the oil refining industry has said that they are at maximum 
production right now deland said and are predicting all sorts 
of dire consequences come summer under massachusetts plan namely 
gasoline shortages and escalation in gasoline prices 
deland said the massachusetts limit needs to be done in a 
measured way

drexel burnham lambert inc was 
banned wednesday from new jerseys lucrative gaming industry because 
of criminal charges against the investment firm in a major wall 
street scandal 
if a corporation does not have the integrity it should not be 
a part of this industry casino commissioner w david waters said 
the state casino control commission voted 40 to order drexel to 
rescind its current business with three casino holding companies and 
refrain from new business 
the temporary ban applies at least until resolution of the 
criminal case and drexels application for a state license to do 
business in atlantic city 
the new york investment firm has agreed to plead guilty to six 
felonies and pay a record 650 million to settle charges including 
insider trading and other securities fraud violations following a 
twoyear federal investigation 
drexel attorney clive cummis asked the commission to delay action 
until the securities case settlement is approved by the securities 
and exchange commission he said the case would be resolved in a 
month 
state gaming enforcement officials asked the commission jan 31 
to impose the temporary ban on drexel whose expertise in highyield 
bond financing helped build the atlantic city casino industry in the 
last decade 
drexel said it has raised about 28 billion in capital for new 
jersey casinos about 70 percent of the public funds for the 
gambling houses in the process the company has earned more than 
120 million in fees according to state regulators 
drexel was hired by griffin resorts inc last november to help 
former entertainer merv griffin acquire resorts international casino 
hotel in addition it has been doing business with holding 
companies for del webbs claridge casino hotel and the sands hotel amp 
casino 
cummis said drexel officials would meet with the gaming 
enforcement division to determine how it would sever ties with the 
casinos 
industry analysts say drexels ouster would leave a void in 
atlantic city because no other investment companies have financed as 
many bonds for casinos as drexel 
but commission chairman walter read said it may be a leader 
but i dont think its the only one 
cummis contended that drexel should be allowed to continue in 
atlantic city because it had demonstrated a commitment to firing 
employees involved in the fraud scandals 
but eugene schwartz deputy director of the gaming enforcement 
division told the commissioners that promises of a housecleaning 
were not enough to assure the public that drexel should do business 
in the tightly regulated casino industry 
because of the sheer volume of its casino trade drexel in 1987 
was asked to become the first investment company to apply for a 
state gaming license 
drexel agreed despite complaints that gaming oversight would 
amount to overkill because the firm already was tightly regulated by 
the sec

continue to compete until the agreement is voted yes or no at 
that point we will make whatever decisions have to be made he 
said

lotus development corp said wednesday it 
has begun field testing the longdelayed new version of its 
signature spreadsheet computer program lotus 123 
an initial group of about 70 customers nationwide will receive 
the new version known as release 3 during the next two weeks the 
company said 
lotus 123 has been the industrys bestselling spreadsheet 
program used by thousands of large and small businesses for 
accounting since it was introduced in 1983 
but competitors have been gaining because of lotus repeated 
delays in introducing the new version which was originally 
scheduled for shipment early last year and is now due out in the 
spring 
lotus spokeswoman susan earabino called the start of beta or 
field testing a milestone in the development process that puts 
release 3 on schedule for secondquarter shipment 
frank king senior vice president of lotus software products 
group said testers will receive handson product training and 
participate in feedback sessions with lotus development marketing 
and sales teams 
more than 5000 individual testers at several hundred sites 
eventually will try out the new spreadsheet designed for both dos 
and os2 computer operating systems king said 
getting release 3 out by the latest selfimposed deadline is 
widely perceived in the industry as a critical proposition for 
lotus which is dependent on the spreadsheet for an estimated 60 
percent of its sales 
according to international data corp lotus had 512 percent of 
the worldwide market for spreadsheets in the first six months of 
1988 microsoft corp was second with a 20 percent combined share 
for its multiplan and excel spreadsheets 
in an effort to take advantage of lotus delays microsoft corp 
has slashed prices on excel some aggressive retailers are selling 
it for as little as 209 or 286 below the suggested price 
other competitors include quattro from borland international 
inc which functions exactly like 123

the federal communications commission voted 
wednesday to to pull the license of a tiny new york radio station 
saying the owner lied ran a contest where the prize was awarded to 
the station and racially discriminated against a job applicant 
he has 90 days to go off the air or 30 days to appeal to the 
us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit fcc 
spokeswoman rosemary kimball 
the commissioners voted 30 in a closed session not to renew the 
license of catoctin broadcasting corp which runs wbuzam a 
250watt station in fredonia about 35 miles southwest of buffalo 
ny the station is owned by henry serafin 
among the charges against serafin was that he discriminated 
against a black job applicant in 1980 calling her employment agency 
and demanding dont you have any white girls to send me and 
adding that the woman would make charcoal look white 
this was the first time since 1981 that the fcc pulled a 
stations license on character grounds kimball said only about 100 
stations have lost their licenses at renewal since the fcc was 
founded in 1934 
fcc lawyer richard bozzelli said the clock doesnt start on the 
deadlines imposed on serafin until the order is officially issued 
which could take two to four weeks 
serafin in a telephone interview from the station said he would 
appeal 
they wont let me sell he said if you have no license 
youre out of business you have nothing to sell 
although we do not lightly decide to deny renewal of a license 
we will nevertheless reach such a determination where the record 
demonstrates that renewal would not serve the public interest the 
fcc said in announcing its decision an analysis of the record 
here leads us to conclude that this is such a case 
the fcc also found that serafin had lied to the commission about 
the discrimination allegation and about the stations public 
inspection file 
finally the commissioners agreed that catoctin violated fcc 
rules by conducting a contest and failing to award the grand prize 
of a stereo instead keeping it for use at the station 
on wednsday serafin denied all the charges and said the fcc 
picked on him being small being poor he has also maintained 
that he was the victim of a campaign by the national association for 
the advancement of colored people the chautauqua county rural 
ministries inc and a staff member of the local comprehensive 
employment training act office who had an ax to grind the 
black job applicant serafin turned away had been sent to the station 
by ceta 
andrew jay schwartzman a lawyer for the media access project 
which represented groups challenging wbuzs license said the fcc 
only decided to act in the face of repeated threats to get a court 
order to force final action 
theyve stalled all the way even after their own hearing 
officer affirmed our charges of blatant racism nearly three years 
ago he said its about time that the fcc started enforcing the 
law 
the case was originally filed in 1980 but it wasnt until 1986 
that an administrative law judge denied the stations application 
for license renewal the judge walter c miller found that serafin 
was dishonest untrustworthy and unreliable and that he had 
violated a wide variety of commission rules 
serafin appealed the ruling and the case went to an fcc review 
board in 1987 the board concurred with miller and recommended 
outright denial of renewal of a license serafin is not the 
type of person that should be entitled to a public franchise 
the station continued to function under a temporary license as 
serafin appealed to the full commission

john d goeken filed a lawsuit wednesday 
against gte corp one day after he resigned as chief executive of 
the airfone subsidiary he founded 
goekens lawsuit filed in dupage county court contends gte 
breached his employment contract at airfone which provides 
airtoground telephone service to airline passengers 
goeken said in a statement he plans to file a competing 
application for airtoground telephone service with the federal 
communications commission once the airfone case is resolved 
in the lawsuit goeken seeks release from his employment 
agreement and his agreement not to compete with gte he has an 
unpublished number and could not be reached for comment 
stamford connbased gte would not comment on goekens 
allegations because of the pending litigation said spokesman harvey 
greisman reached in new york 
but i can tell you we will vigorously contest the lawsuit he 
has filed he said 
when gte bought oak brookbased airfone in 1986 it contracted 
with goeken to run the company through 1990 his lawsuit says 
gte then stripped goeken of his authority and unjustifiably 
removed his right to control the business and affairs of gte 
airfone the lawsuit alleges 
i am deeply disappointed in gtes failure to perform as 
promised said goeken who also helped start the company that 
became mci communications corp now the nations secondlargest 
longdistance telephone service 
some agency officials have speculated there is not room on the 
airwaves for another service though satellite relay could expand 
the available range 
goeken said it is technologically and economically possible to 
share the limited frequencies available citing the benefits of 
competition 
goeken invented the patented technology used by airfone to 
provide telephone service from airliners moving at speeds exceeding 
500 mph 
airfone began providing telephone service aboard airliners in 
1984 when the system was installed in an american airlines dc10 
by the beginning of this year nearly 1000 aircraft had been 
equipped with the phones 
since 1987 the company also has offered railfone for use in 
commuter and interstate train travel 
goekens lawsuit says that since gte took over complaints about 
airfone service have increased equipment repair is slower and the 
number of calls per aircraft has dropped 
greisman declined to characterize airfones performance and said 
gte does not break out earnings figures for its subsidiaries 
we always believed and continue to believe that it is an 
important acquisition he said 
goeken will be replaced as airfone chairman and chief executive 
by terry parker president of gtes mobile communications group 
greisman said while sumter logan was to continue as president and 
chief operating officer

cancer research as part of a settlement announced wednesday in a 
trademark infringement case brought by an italian gunmaker against 
gms beretta model the automaker also will pay unspecified legal 
and administrative fees associated with the lawsuit filed by 
fabbrica darmi pietro beretta spa beretta said in a statement 
the 500yearold italian company which has registered trademarks 
in this country for the beretta name starting in 1954 sued gm in 
federal court in new york last july seeking 250 million in damages

beretta name for its car line the automaker also must acknowledge 
in its sale catalogs and beretta owners manuals that the name is 
being used with the permission of the italian company the beretta 
statement said 
we believe that this settlement provides an adequate 
conciliatory resolution to both parties of the litigation beretta 
president pier giuseppe beretta said in the statement 
gm spokesmen did not immediately return telephone messages 
seeking comment 
the gunmaker went after gm when the automaker unveiled the 
chevrolet beretta in 1987 despite warning letters from beretta 
lawyers the previous year

business leaders warning of a critical 
shortage of skilled laborers in the next century on wednesday 
embraced plans by sen edward m kennedy to create a 
multibilliondollar education program for prekindergarten children 
investing in our children is not just rhetoric its sound 
business practice although many of our colleagues have yet to make 
that discovery said arnold hiatt chief executive officer of 
stride rite in cambridge mass 
top executives from stride rite general electric co time inc 
and goodyear tire and rubber told the senate labor and human 
resources committee which kennedy chairs that fastadvancing 
technologies require workers with strong educational backgrounds who 
can learn new skills quickly 
kennedys smart start program would have the federal 
government finance much of the effort through grants to state and 
local governments which would decide whether to have the programs 
operated through schools or community organizations 
state and parental participation would be voluntary 
kennedy a massachusetts democrat said programs for children in 
the year before they attend kindergarten have shown that 
participants are twice as likely to be literate twice as likely to 
have a job onethird less likely to drop out of high school and 
half as likely to be on welfare 
one executive who testified wednesday goodyear chairman robert 
mercer told kennedys committee that in our tire plants you 
cant have a guy who cant read or write running a milliondollar 
tire machine todays tire manufacturing is a highly sophisticated 
computercontrolled process 
frank doyle senior vice president at general electric said his 
company is already having difficulty finding job applicants at all 
levels who meet our requirement of either being ready to work or 
ready to train there is little we at ge can do with 
employees who cannot read write or count and who are either 
unwilling or unable to learn 
kennedys proposal would have the federal government cover 70 
percent of the programs costs in the first year 60 percent in the 
second and 50 percent in each of the next three years state and 
local governments would pay the balance of the costs 
the legislation proposes a 500 million federal expenditure next 
year 750 million in 1991 and 1 billion in each of the following 
three years 
all children whose family income is less than 15 percent above 
the federal poverty line could attend the programs without charge 
parents of other children would pay on a sliding scale based on 
family income up to the full cost 
half of all slots would be reserved for poor children

a continued drought this year would push crop 
prices to record highs trigger a new round of food price increases 
and magnify loan losses for farm lenders a government economist 
warned wednesday 
mark drabenstott assistant vice president and economist at the 
federal reserve bank in kansas city mo forecast a bleak outlook 
for agriculture if dry weather again plagues the nations farm belt 
as it did last year 
in testimony before the senate commerce committee drabenstott 
said the effect of the drought of 1988 on farmers agribusiness 
farm lenders and consumers was not as great as had been expected 
he said however that much of agricultures adjustment 
capacity was depleted in 1988 and the effects of continued drought 
in 1989 would be more severe 
the agriculture departments chief meteorologist norton 
strommen has said a recurrence of last years severe drought is 
unlikely drabenstott agreed 
with grain stocks down in the united states from low production 
last year drabenstott said a repeat of last summers drought would 
push crop prices to record or nearrecord levels 
many crop producers added to their 1988 income by selling grain 
inventories built up in earlier years an option that will not be 
available in 1989 drabenstott said in his written testimony 
thus despite the very high grain prices that would accompany 
continued drought smaller crops and depleted inventories would 
probably mean smaller farm income 
higher crop prices also would deliver a severe blow to the 
livestock industry by driving up feed costs drabenstott said 
consumers he added would feel the effects of lower meat production 
for some time 
despite his grim economic analysis drabenstott said the 
possibility of a continued drought appears unlikely 
agricultural records indicate that every year of drought in the 
united states since 1950 has been followed by a year of rebounding 
production and in most cases the increase in production has even 
led to reaccumulation of grain stocks said drabenstott 
however there are concerns that lingering dry conditions in 
portions of the country such as in the winter wheat state of 
kansas could keep some crop production from increasing 
indeed the governments joint agricultural weather facility 
operated by the agriculture and commerce departments said wednesday 
that while rain and snow had improved conditions for winter wheat 
in some growing areas the kansas crop was still in need of snow 
cover and moisture 
as for the drought of 1988 drabenstott said financial 
reserves from recently good farming years and a 39 billion 
federal assistance program helped producers minimize the effects of 
last years poor harvests 
but he suggested that lawmakers could improve agricultures 
ability to adjust to drought by providing farmers more flexibility 
to plant different crops current government programs he said 
often make it more attractive to plant crops based on the federal 
subsidy outlook rather than market conditions

prosecutors asked a judge to fine rockwell 
international corp 5 million for overbilling the air force on a 
sophisticated satellite navigation system 
prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum filed tuesday in us 
district court that the fine is necessary to punish rockwell 
adequately for its egregious contemptuous conduct 
assistant us attorney george newhouse jr called the request 
conservative citing the companys 812 million profit for 1988 
and a projected 176 million profit on its navstar satellite 
production contract alone 
the only rational conclusion that can be drawn from the 
evidence is that corporate officials at rockwell knew about the 
deception knew that the auditors were being told lies and approved 
if not directed that course of action the government said in the 
sentencing memo 
rockwell on wednesday rejected the governments contention 
the prosecutors assertion that higher company officials 
encouraged and countenanced deceiving the government is absolutely 
false charles harff rockwells senior vice president and general 
counsel said in a statement 
top managers werent charged in the criminal case and rockwell 
blames the doublebilling on renegade employees who have been fired 
and prosecuted separately the employees arent accused of profiting 
personally 
rockwell entered a conditional guilty plea in the case jan 19 
which means that if the company succeeds in an appeal of an early 
ruling in the case the plea will be stricken from the record 
in that ruling rockwell failed to persuade a judge to dismiss 
the charges against it on the grounds it had reported the 
doublebilling under a pentagon voluntary disclosure program 
rockwell was charged with conspiracy and contempt in an 
indictment that alleges the company and two employees overbilled the 
air force 446000 for the manufacture of navstar global positioning 
system satellites 
the satellites transmit radio signals that are received by ships 
and planes enabling them to pinpoint their exact location on earth 
the overbilling occurred between october 1982 and march 1986 the 
government said 
in addition to the fine prosecutors asked that rockwell be 
ordered to repay the 446000 that was overbilled and take steps to 
ensure that its employees know the rules of government contracts 
sentencing was scheduled for friday

general motors corp will contribute 500000 to 
cancer research as part of a settlement announced wednesday by an 
italian gunmaker in a trademark infringement case against gms 
beretta model 
the automaker also will pay unspecified legal and administrative 
fees associated with the lawsuit filed by fabbrica darmi pietro 
beretta spa beretta said in a statement 
a gm spokesman however denied that a settlement had been 
reached 
the 500yearold italian company which has registered trademarks 
in this country for the beretta name starting in 1954 sued gm in 
federal court in new york last july seeking 250 million in damages 
the settlement calls for gm to donate 500000 to the beretta 
foundation for cancer research berett a spokesman ralph cole said 
in a statement 
under the agreement gm will be permitted to continue to use the 
beretta name for its chevrolet car line the automaker also must 
acknowledge in its sale catalogs and beretta owners manuals that 
the name is being used with the permission of the italian company 
the beretta statement said 
we believe that this settlement provides an adequate 
conciliatory resolution to both parties of the litigation beretta 
president pier giuseppe beretta said in the statement 
ralph kramer a chevrolet spokesman said the automaker was 
pleased with the settlement but still contends the lawsuit was 
unnecessary 
its been our position and continues to be that no one who 
would come into a showroom to look at a beretta would be confused 
that the firearms company would have something to do with the car 
kramer said but were glad that its over and its behind us 
now 
but gm spokesman david hudgens said later wednesday that 
berettas announcement of a settlement is premature 
we have not signed a settlement agreement with them he said 
we are hopeful the matter will be resolved in the best interests 
of both parties in the near future 
the gunmaker went after gm when the automaker unveiled the 
chevrolet beretta in 1987 despite warning letters from beretta 
lawyers the previous year 
the conflict between the two companies and the beretta name was 
parodied last month by car and driver magazine which did a road 
test comparing the gm sports car with the handgun whose name it 
shared 
the italian company makes luggage clothing cutlery and optical 
equipment as well as target hunting and military guns

unisys corp announced wednesday that it has 
dismissed 1700 people at 60 us locations as part of a major 
restructuring designed to reduce the computer companys work force 
by 3 percent this year 
the company also said from its headquarters in suburban blue bell 
that it will close a component assembly plant in nogales mexico at 
a cost of 400 jobs 
about 190 people at the companys headquarters were released 
wednesday and about 400 more will lose their jobs at the end of 
july when the company consolidates a computerdesign group at the 
headquarters with a larger division in roseville minn unisys said 
the second hardest hit location was the companys santa clara 
calif operation where disk drives are made the approximately 350 
employees affected there opted to work through a 60day notice 
period rather than leave immediately hynes said 
he said the reductions at the companys other us locations 
affected by the cutbacks involved fewer than 100 employees each 
the moves essentially complete the companys plans to streamline 
in 1989 in the face of weak results 
obviously this is a major restructuring that has brought us 
essentially into the range where we told people we wanted to be for 
1989 said j peter hynes a unisys spokesman 
after a presentation last week to securities analysts in new 
york unisys chairman w michael blumenthal said the company planned 
this year to reduce its work force of 93000 by 3 percent or about 
2800 people in addition the company plans to pare more than 500 
million from its inventories by midyear 
to be competitive we have got to reduce costs brutally 
blumenthal said 
about 100 of those released wednesday at the companys 
headquarters were computer design engineers hynes said the rest 
were in administrative and marketing positions 
hynes said only a small number of the affected employees 
would be transferred or rehired 
hynes said all employees released this week will receive six 
weeks pay in addition to a severance package all also are eligible 
for job counseling he said 
hynes said earlier that about 900 of unisys 68000 us 
employees have been offered early retirement so far this year 
on tuesday unisys introduced a longawaited line of mainframe 
computers designed by the engineering group in blue bell the new 
2200 series will replace the companys 1100 line the products 
release was delayed by several months hurting sales as customers 
postponed purchases until the new line was available 
layoffs are not new for the nations thirdlargest computer 
company which is the product of burroughs corps 48 billion 
takeover of sperry in 1986 since the acquisition unisys has pared 
18000 from its payroll through sales of operations and 12000 more 
through early retirements and layoffs 
last years acquisition of convergent inc a california computer 
maker added 3500 to the companys job rolls 
blumenthal acknowledged last week that it had been a tougher 
year than anticipated and that he expected a weakness in sales to 
continue in the first half of 1989 
sales in 1988 increased 2 percent from 1987 to 99 billion 
although unisys profits rose about 18 percent in 1988 most of the 
increase was attributable to lower tax rates not bigger profit 
margins the companys operating profits slumped by nearly 
onequarter in the final quarter of 1988 
at their meeting with wall street analysts thursday senior 
executives said they expected results from the first three months of 
1989 to be poor with no revenue growth largely because of the 
bottoming of the 1100 product cycle 
the second quarter will improve as the new computer line starts 
kicking in revenue while the third and fourth quarters will be 
exceptional they said
