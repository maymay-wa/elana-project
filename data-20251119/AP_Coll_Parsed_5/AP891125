members of drunk drivers against 
driving drunk say they hope their painful experiences will 
encourage others not to flirt with the dangerous pastime of 
drinking and driving 
were like blood brothers said member larry carlisle 
weve been to the pits and now weve been able to get our lives 
back together again and we want to be able to go out into the 
community and tell them and explain to them why drunken drivers 
have to be controlled i think somebody whos been through it three 
times has got a pretty good insight into it 
ddadd made up of about a dozen people including advisers was 
formed three years ago by people who had been sent to the western 
massachusetts correctional center for multiple drunken driving 
offenses group coordinator roz canter said however the group is 
not affiliated with the center which was created to house the 
increased number of people sent to jail when massachusetts 
toughened its drunken driving laws 
ddadd members speak at programs for drunken driving offenders 
about how we got there and the things that brought us to our 
knees carlisle said he said the group does not include anyone 
who was involved in a fatal crash 
my story was that i had a 32year history of abuse of drugs 
and alcohol and i reached a point where i was convicted of three 
duis in the course of 18 months he said 
the loss of his home friends and possessions coupled with a 
barrage of counseling helped him admit to having a problem 
carlisle said 
i was lucky he said i drove many many times under the 
influence of alcohol but fortunately i never hurt any one i 
cracked up cars 
the 51yearold toolanddie maker said he got away with driving 
drunk for more than two decades but tougher driving laws promoted 
by gov michael s dukakis sent him to the correctional center 
its the best thing that dukakis did he said 
despite its masculine sounding acronym there are women in ddadd 
and carlisle said the name wasnt meant as a challenge to the 
wellknown madd mothers against drunk driving 
ddadd was formally incorporated in august under the name former 
drunk drivers against driving drunk canter said 
anne russell assistant director of public affairs at the 
national headquarters of madd in hurst texas said the concept of 
former drunken drivers voluntarily engaging in educational efforts 
appeared to be new 
ellen nepomuceno of the local chapter of madd said she thought 
the appearance of ddadd was a good thing 
they are taking responsibility now for their choices she 
said 
the hardest part for the victim is that drunken drivers 
never really say that theyre sorry but i think to hear a group of 
people that has been driving drunk and are now really saying that 
theyre sorry for what theyve done i think its a big step 
canter said the group has kept a low profile 
basically what they do they dont point the finger at people 
they just share their own personal experiences of what happened to 
them to try to encourage other people to not have to go through the 
things they went through canter said

the quake of 89 rattled the director of an 
organization dedicated to preserving the little shacks that housed 
refugees from the earthquake and fire of 06 
jane cryan who founded the society for the preservation and 
appreciation of san francisco refugee shacks has decided to pull 
up stakes and leave quakeprone california 
this little society born of the quake has died of another 
said cryan who founded the organization after she unknowingly 
bought a refugee shack in the early 1980s 
cryan 47 said the oct 17 earthquake that hit northern 
california threw me for a loop 
i have decided to begin life anew in my home state of 
wisconsin and am returning to my ancestral town of oshkosh said 
cryan who also lost her job as an administrative assistant shortly 
after the quake 
san francisco will undoubtedly undergo seismic upgrades that 
will obliterate the shacks she said i couldnt bear to be 
around to see it 
more than 60 of the 5610 redwood cottages known to exist are 
still standing said cryan the cottages some as small as 10 by 14 
feet were designed by army engineers and built with federal funds 
and donations in public parks and squares there were 11 shack 
camps around the city 
the families were given the cottages when they moved the 
structures to private land 
there was no richter scale when the quake hit on april 18 1906 
but the magnitude was later figured to be 83 the quake and the 
fire that followed killed somewhere from 700 to 2000 people 
last months temblor measured 71 and killed 67 people more 
than half of them on a freeway that collapsed in oakland 
the shacks were put into service after the 1906 quake and fire 
while 25000 people were still living in canvas army tents in parks 
around san francisco 
after living in the shack cities more than 5000 families 
resettled and took their shacks with them dragging them away with 
horses the structures ended up scattered all over the city 
cryan was living in one of the old cottages and didnt even know 
it 
someone told me the house was a refugee cottage and i checked 
it out she said that was about three months after i moved in 
it was three of them joined together i got it recognized as a 
landmark 
cryan has accumulated shack doors windows and other memorabilia 
through the years 
shes passing the societys torch to her friend jo falcon 
who is storing the items that include an architectural model of a 
shack town of 22 cottages 
cryan says the shacks were the original modular housing 
they feel like homes they make you feel safe and cozy even 
though theyre small

prosecutors are asking a federal appeals court 
to revive the criminal case against a former cia station chief in 
central america who was caught up in the irancontra affair 
us district court judge claude hilton in alexandria va 
dismissed criminal charges against joseph fernandez on friday 
ruling fernandez could not get a fair trial because the justice 
department barred use of classified materials considered important 
to the defense 
independent counsel lawrence walshs office quickly filed a 
notice of appeal with the us court of appeals in richmond va 
prosecutors said the ruling places fernandez outside the law 
we believe that all citizens including highranking 
government officials involved in covert operations should be 
accountable to the law said associate independent counsel 
laurence shtasel who is prosecuting the fernandez case 
prosecutors are appealing both the judges ruling friday and his 
july decision to reject proposed substitutions for the secrets 
fernandez assisted former white house aide oliver norths secret 
contra resupply effort during a congressional ban on us military 
aid to the contras the effort in central america was financed 
partly by diverted profits from secret arms sales to iran 
fernandez was charged with two counts of obstruction of justice 
and two counts of making false statements 
attorney general dick thornburgh on wednesday barred courtroom 
use of classified materials fernandez said would prove his case 
the secrets said by the judge to be essential to this 
defendant concern cia stations and programs in central america 
fernandez has claimed some activities to help north were 
intertwined with usassisted plans by costa rica against possible 
invasion by nicaragua fernandez says for example that he did not 
lie when he told the cia inspector general an airstrip built by the 
north network was initiated by the costa rican government 
fernandez said after hiltons ruling friday that he feared cia 
operatives performing legitimate duties could be subjected to a 
politically motivated prosecution 
that is a chilling message to people who put their lives on 
the line every day he said 
irancontra prosecutors have said much of the classified 
information the government is protecting constitutes fictional 
secrets which have been revealed publicly before 
but fernandez said the secrets would compromise national 
security and added that its disclosure would have compromised 
intelligence sources 
thornburgh suggested an agreement could be reached with walsh to 
allow a trial for fernandez 
i continue to believe that this case can be tried without 
compromising the defendants right to a fair trial or the national 
security of this country he said in a statement friday the 
independent counsel and i agree that the district courts earlier 
rejection of substitutions and alternatives to the release of 
classified material constituted reversible error

for east block reform efforts might foreshadow a diminished role 
for nato and warsaw pact forces mrs thatcher said nato is 
absolutely vital to europes continued defense

accord in their examination of all the issues discussed today 
which included the possible topics for bushs dec 23 shipboard

to get her views on the rapid changes in eastern europe and the 
strength of the alliance and everything else 
mrs thatcher in her news conference later described their talks 
as very relaxed very valuable 
bush has sought to assure western allies the united states would 
not act unilaterally on matters of concern to europe such as the 
role of nato promising them no surprises in his talks with 
gorbachev

prodemocracy protests and karel urbanek a former party leader of 
the czech republic was elected to replace the party leader 
mrs thatcher told reporters she hoped to see czechoslovakia 
become a democracy but the wish is not the deed and it does take 
quite a long time to get all the democratic structures into place 
and they must be genuine structures not just a facade she said

a consumer group is warning that stores 
nationwide this holiday season are offering toys that violate 
federal safety standards and pose a choking hazard for young 
children 
on this the biggest shopping day of the year parents should 
not assume that the toys they find on the shelves are safe said 
lucinda sikes consumer director for us public interest research 
group on friday the start of the holiday shopping season 
inadequate funding and staffing for state and federal 
enforcement agencies to monitor dangerous toys are one reason the 
group founded by ralph nader blamed for the availability of the 
items 
sikes said there are particular dangers for children who still 
tend to put things in their mouths 
shoppers should carefully examine toys for small parts that 
break off or are detachable sikes cautioned 
the warnings came as pirg released its first national survey of 
unsafe toys 
efforts to reach several toy manufacturers whose products are 
named in the survey were unsuccessful 
a spokesman for the federal consumer product safety commission 
said the agency would collect and test samples of the toys and 
take appropriate action if needed 
the survey titled small parts big hazards unsafe toys in 
the united states was conducted in october and november in 105 
stores in the district of columbia california connecticut 
maryland minnesota new jersey oregon and virginia 
the report focused on small parts that are regulated by the cpsc 
and which continue to be the leading cause of toyrelated deaths 
to young children the group said 
thirtyfour children died in toyrelated incidents between 
january 1988 and september 1989 according to cpsc figures cited in 
the report 
the report called for mandatory descriptive age labeling 
legislation saying many toys are inappropriately labeled 
currently toy makers voluntarily include age labeling on toys 
however toys intended for children under age three must meet 
federal standards for small parts 
a toy or a toy part that fits into a truncated cylinder with a 
diameter of 125 inches and a depth ranging from 1 to 225 inches 
fails the cpsc small parts test the cylinder is designed to 
replicate a childs windpipe said ken giles spokesman for the 
cpsc 
the toys cited were recommended for children ages 9 months to 
six years or included no age label those recommended for children 
under age three that do not meet the small parts requirements 
violate government standards giles said 
he said the oregon pirg had notified the cpsc about 12 toys it 
found in stores in the state that may pose a small parts hazard 
the national survey is modeled after one conducted annually by the 
oregon group since 1986 
giles said the agency would collect and test samples of the 12 
toys and take appropriate action 
we will do the same for the larger list as soon as we get 
it he added

white house budget director richard darman 
wants to use a novel budget review process to help the bush 
administration meet its deficit reduction goals 
darman head of the office of management and budget has told 
administration officials that omb will use a twotrack approach to 
reviewing their budgets this year that will force them to compete 
with other highpriority programs for a limited pool of extra money 
darmans strategy revealed this week in a letter to agency 
heads leaves federal budget officers scrambling for ways to 
convince the white house to overturn proposed omb cuts in their 
spending requests for the 1991 fiscal year 
many budget officers planned to be at their desks through this 
weekend to meet a monday deadline for submitting their appeals of 
omb decisions on their budgets 
the administration is racing to meet a jan 8 deadline for 
submitting its new budget to congress the first full budget 
submission president bush will get to make last february he 
submitted various revisions to the budget left by former president 
ronald reagan 
federal agencies submitted their initial requests to omb on 
sept 1 last monday they got the news on what reduced funding 
levels omb will be recommending 
the omb proposals were accompanied by a letter from darman 
explaining a new appeal process the agencies must follow in trying 
to overturn budget office decisions 
previously an agency would recommend a very big increase 
darman said in an interview taped friday on the evans amp novak 
for broadcast on the cable news network omb would say no no 
thats too much and then the fight would be within that range and 
there was a tendency for presidents to come along and split the 
difference so you would always be leveling up 
what this is saying is if anybody has ideas for meritorious 
investment as they see it fine lets have them compete against 
all other such good ideas and in the end well take the best 
ideas said darman 
part of the process is similar to previous years agencies will 
be able to negotiate with omb over the proposed spending 
reductions but if an agency decides to carry its appeal to the 
white house darman has added a new twist 
the appeal will automatically toss the program onto a second 
budget track in which the increased spending will be competing with 
other programs that are bidding for higher spending 
in his letter first revealed in fridays washington post 
darman said the agencies seeking increases will have to compete 
with each other for resources that are in a limited pool 
darman assured cabinet secretaries that you will have an 
opportunity to present your views directly to the president prior 
to his decision 
but agency budget officials said darmans strategy puts the 
budget office in a strong negotiating position to defend its 
recommended cuts 
for one thing the amount of time bush will have to devote to 
budget appeal hearings will be limited by other issues the 
president must address such as the upcoming soviet summit given 
the jan 8 deadline for submitting a budget to congress all 
spending decisions will have to be made by middecember 
there will be limited opportunities for even making 
presentations to the president given his travel schedule said 
one budget officer who spoke on condition his name not be used 
in a meeting with reporters earlier in the week darman stressed 
the administration is facing a big challenge in meeting a goal to 
reduced the deficit to 64 billion 
that deficit target is for the 1991 fiscal year which begins 
next oct 1 the administration reached agreement with congress 
this week on 146 billion in deficit cuts aimed at meeting this 
years overall grammrudman deficit target of 100 billion

negotiations to reduce conventional forces in europe 
but the official added overwhelming the agenda is whats 
going on in eastern europe our european friends feel the same 
excitement we do 
despite the rapid moves soviet bloc countries are making towards 
democracy the official said cheneys overall message is to 
reaffirm the need for nato 
he added the united states has pledged to maintain its financial 
commitment to nato through 1990 this comes as the pentagon is 
drawing up plans that would slash planned increases in us defense 
spending by 180 billion in the 19921994 budget years

veterans affairs secretary edward derwinski 
says he wont decide before march whether to grant disability 
payments to vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange 
derwinski said friday he wont make his decision until the 
centers for disease control in atlanta releases the results of a 
study begun in 1985 the study is expected in march 
after a nov 3 advisory committee meeting derwinski had 
promised a decision in a few weeks 
cdc epidemiologists in 1985 launched a major study of the health 
records of thousands of veterans to see if they were at increased 
risk of five types of cancer lymphoma softtissue sarcoma and 
nasal nasopharyngeal and liver cancer 
the advisory committee said after reviewing more than 30 studies 
that it could not find a statistically significant relationship 
between a rare cancer nonhodgkins lymphoma and exposure to the 
chemicals used in the defoliant agent orange 
in may a federal judge in san francisco ruled that the 
department had been too strict in denying disability benefits on 
the grounds there was no proof that those chemicals caused the 
illnesses cited by some 34000 veterans 
instead the judge said the department need only find 
statistically significant associations between exposure and 
illness derwinski decided not to appeal the decision 
derwinski said in a statement friday that several committee 
members had said the cdc study could weigh heavily in their 
recommendations 
i am as determined now to resolve this issue as i was when i 
decided not to appeal the court decision but it is logical to wait 
for a few extra months for the results of the cdc cancer study 
he said 
agent orange used in vietnam to strip vegetation cover used by 
guerrillas has been blamed by veterans groups for many disorders 
particularly cancer because it was contaminated with dioxins a 
byproduct of its manufacture 
some of the 75 dioxin compounds are among the most powerful 
causes of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals but it has 
never been proven they can cause cancer in humans 
exposure to dioxin in high concentrations is known to cause 
chloracne a skin disorder and recent work has led some scientists 
to suspect dioxin may also cause birth defects 
in 1986 congress required the veterans administration to give 
hospital care to any veteran exposed to agent orange in vietnam 
unless the va found some other cause for his disability

like the addict who admits he has a problem a 
casino operator has conceded that compulsive gambling is a disease 
and some of its patrons and employees are infected 
so far harrahs corp stands alone in nevada in its public 
confession that the states no 1 industry and its biggest taxpayer 
is more than recreational fun for up to six million americans 
we didnt know if it existed said william sherman harrahs 
general counsel and chairman of an employee task force that studied 
compulsive gambling for more than a year before recommending the 
company help addicts 
last month harrahs posted signs in its five nevada casinos 
telling people how to get help for gambling problems the company 
also agreed to pay one years costs to operate a hotline to take 
those calls 
our role in the problem gambling issue is not to change 
anyones behavior but simply to provide help for people who might 
have a gambling problem said harrahs president phil satre 
as many as 12 percent of nevada casino employees are compulsive 
gamblers according to some estimates seven percent to 9 percent 
of nevadans share the problem compared to 2 percent to 5 percent 
of the general us population 
to those who find it dicey for a casino owner to be helping 
people overcome a disease that seems to boost business satre 
responds that treatment could diminish employee absenteeism petty 
theft and misconduct 
casinos would be better off without addicted gamblers who are 
trouble because they can run up huge debts and sometimes become 
angry or abusive when on a losing streak he said 
helping employees and guests with this problem is both the 
right thing to do and also a very good businesses decision not 
only for harrahs but for the entire gaming industry satre said 
atlantic city nj casinos have had such hotlines in place 
since gaming began in 1978 and spend 300000 a year to help 
compulsive gamblers in nevada casinos have all but ignored 
gambling addicts since betting was legalized 58 years ago 
for the state which receives more than half its annual revenues 
from casino taxes declaring gambling a problem would be akin to 
admitting some of the golden eggs laid by the gaming goose are 
really fools gold said jerry higgins executive director of the 
gaming industry association 
for now i think most of the casinos are watching the harrahs 
program to see what kind of effect it has he said 
casinos paid 736 million into the state treasury on earnings 
of 121 billion in the julyseptember quarter according to the 
state gaming control board 
dian edwards volunteer executive director of the nevada council 
on compulsive gambling which runs the las vegasbased hotline 
said most nevada casino operators are like the addicted gambler who 
denies he has a problem 
we just need to do a lot more education because theres still 
this wild west mentality out there that gamblings just fun she 
said 
ms edwards said the monthold hotline gets three to five calls 
daily 
most calls come from friends and family of addicted gamblers 
she said the ones from bettors dont last long 
theres a real problem of denial involved in this just like 
for alcohol and drug addicts said ms edwards a mental health 
therapist 
only one certified hospital exists in nevada to help compulsive 
gamblers she said and insurance companies dont recognize the 
problem as a disease like alcoholism or drug addiction 
were just in the beginning stages of addressing this 
problem she said 
ms edwards said publicity about pete rose the cincinnati reds 
manager suspended for life from baseball for betting on the game 
has helped gained legitimacy for people treating compulsive 
gambling 
according to various studies the typical gambler is male betwen 
the ages of 20 and 40 lives with his spouse and has at least a 
high school education 
i can walk through a casino and tell you who the compulsive 
gamblers are she added theyre mesmerized by the machines 
theyre in love with them they cant take their eyes off them 
its frightening

karel urbanek an obscure unknown 
bureaucrat picked friday as the new communist party chief 
represents the partys best hope of restoring the authority it has 
lost in two decades of hardline policy 
news that his predecessor milos jakes had resigned brought a 
throng of people into the streets of prague in a spontaneous 
explosion of joy 
reaction to the choice of urbanek however was reserved 
urbanek 48 joined the old 13man politburo 13 months ago 
since then according to a senior western diplomat urbanek has 
spent much of his time traveling in the provinces and apparently 
has gained support from regional party chiefs 
his most recent responsibilities as head of a new council for 
the party in the czech republic should have given him clear insight 
into the state of the economy and the partys standing in bohemia 
and his native moravia 
urbaneks greatest asset is his relative obscurity under 
communist party custom the general secretary must come from 
politburo ranks 
of the 13 men available urbanek was one of the few not directly 
associated with the unpopular hardline policies in place since 
1968 and thus has a chance to restore the partys flagging 
standing 
the official ctk news agency said urbanek was elected general 
secretary in a secret ballot of the central committee with 136 
votes for and seven against it was not known if there were any 
abstentions 
what little is known of urbanek suggests that in the past he has 
been an orthodox communist 
in an article in the party weekly tribuna in march urbanek took 
the standard line of acknowledging shortcomings in the present 
system but excluding independent groups from dialogue 
he wrote that prominent dissidents are not concerned with 
democracy freedom and the environment with dialogue in the realm 
of socialism but with a return to capitalism with all the 
consequences this would have for our country 
it is therefore impossible to give in to them he wrote 
born march 22 1941 at bojkovice in south moravia to a peasant 
family urbanek joined the communist party in 1963 studied at an 
industrial school and joined czechoslovak railways as a station 
master in his hometown in 1970 
in 1973 he became part of the regional communist party 
committee in south moravia while studying parttime at the partys 
institute in prague 
by 1982 he had risen to head the communist party in brno the 
capital of moravia and czechoslovakias thirdlargest city 
in march 1988 he made it onto the influential central committee 
apparatus 
seven months later he vaulted on to the ruling party politburo 
in a reshuffle that saw four other men named to the ruling body 
at the same time he was made head of the newly created 
committee for party work in the czech republic which until then 
had not had its own communist party organization something that 
existed in slovakia since 1969 he also was named head of a central 
committee commission for the political system in czechoslovakia 
other details of his personal life were not known

the skipper of the exxon valdez will 
try to get his case dismissed by claiming immunity from prosecution 
and seeking to have the results of a sobriety test thrown out of 
court 
joseph hazelwood is expected to return to alaska for a hearing 
on the motions in the anchorage superior court that begins monday 
and could last up to two weeks his trial is set for jan 22 
the 43yearold mariner from huntington ny was fired by 
exxon soon after the tanker exxon valdez struck a prince william 
sound reef march 24 and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
the worst oil spill in us history blackened pristine shores 
killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted 
lucrative fishing seasons exxon said it spent more than 1 billion 
on oil spill claims and cleanup work and state officials say the 
cleanup still is not finished 
hazelwood faces misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil and three felony counts of criminal mischief if convicted of 
the three felonies he faces a possible maximum penalty of 10 years 
in prison and 100000 in fines 
the case was moved from valdez to anchorage because of concerns 
publicity about the spill would make it too hard to find an 
impartial jury in valdez the southcentral alaska port town relies 
heavily on the oil industry for jobs and also has commercial 
fishing interests 
defense motions include claims that hazelwood received immunity 
from prosecution when he reported his ships grounding and oil 
spill the morning it happened a law designed to encourage 
selfreporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills 
provides protection against selfincrimination laywers contend 
they say virtually every piece of evidence in the case against 
hazelwood grew from his report to the coast guard that the exxon 
valdez was aground and leaking oil 
state lawyers have pointed out that it would have been hard for 
the massive oil spill to go undiscovered 
another defense motion asserts that the sobriety test hazelwood 
failed about 10 hours after the ship struck bligh reef was 
administered improperly and that the results cannot be used as 
evidence 
defense lawyers say the sample was obtained so long after the 
grounding that it did not provide a sound measure of hazelwoods 
condition at the time of the wreck

two commandos from the elite 
bracamonte battalion materialize out of the shadows near a jesuit 
parish house 
they stop a departing visitor 
who are you looking for one demands coldly what do you 
want show me your identification 
the church is suspect in el salvador denounced by the right and 
persecuted as subversive because it has become a force for social 
change a voice that denounces rights abuses 
it threatens the status quo in a country where a handful are 
wealthy and the majority live in ignorance poverty and disease and 
those who try to change things risk torture and death 
it is also a country torn by a civil war pitting a leftist 
guerrilla force against a succession of usbacked governments a 
war that has taken more than 71000 lives 
after the massacre of six jesuit priests last week attorney 
general mauricio colorado accused archbishop arturo rivera damas 
and auxiliary bishop gregorio rosa chavez of fomenting leftist 
violence 
he wrote to pope john paul ii that the prelates should be pulled 
out of el salvador for their own good 
the clerics he said have persisted in keeping alive the 
questionable ideology of the church of the poor and are blamed 
for much of the violence that has devastated el salvador for many 
years and culminated in the rebel actions of this week 
more than 1000 people were killed in the 11day offensive 
a dozen years ago a jesuit activist the rev rutilio grande 
asked what would happen if jesus came to el salvador 
theyd accuse him of being a rebel a foreign jew of getting 
mixed up in exotic and strange ideas theyd crucify him 
grande said in a homily in the rural parish where he worked among 
the poor 
he was dead less than a month later gunned down by a death 
squad on his way to say mass 
grande was one of the first priests to fall in the bloody 
attempt to suppress church activism in el salvador dozens of 
priests nuns and lay workers have been murdered since including 
the six jesuit academics teachers nurses doctors social 
workers academics all are suspect 
grandes life and death symbolized the new role for the roman 
catholic church in el salvador 
for hundreds of years the church had worked with the spanish 
conquerors and colonial rulers and with the oligarchs that 
followed ignore the misery of life on earth it taught and await 
your celestial reward there were few dissenting voices 
in 1968 a latin american bishops conference in medellin 
colombia decided the church should tend the material needs of the 
poor as well as their spiritual needs calling it a preferential 
option for the poor 
instead of counseling forbearance from the sidelines many 
clerics now felt their duties included standing at the side of 
parishioners trying to do things such as organize peasant 
cooperatives that might ease their crushing poverty 
as war devastated el salvador the importance of churches and 
church workers both catholic and protestant grew 
churches are virtually the only humanitarian institutions that 
have continued to function throughout a decade of bitter civil war 
between leftist guerrillas and a series of usbacked governments 
in a nation where political violence has fragmented families and 
displaced hundreds of thousands the only place to turn is often a 
church in some rural areas churches and church workers are the 
only source of social services health care and education as well 
as spiritual nourishment 
the church is also at the heart of the intellectual life of this 
massachusettssized nation of 5 million the university where the 
priests were massacred is one of the most respected institutions of 
higher learning in central america 
el salvadors right wealthy landowners and businessmen and 
their military allies have raged at the sight of the churchs 
inherent power and influence standing shouldertoshoulder with 
ideas they consider subversive 
while the many in the churches blame the war on social and 
economic factors the right blames the conflict on those who try to 
change them 
the general feeling of the government is that all humanitarian 
service groups in the country have sympathy for the rebels the 
rev richard potter head of the episcopal churchs partnership 
officer for latin america and the caribbean said in new york this 
week after 19 layworkers at the episcopal refugee center in san 
salvador were arrested 
the countrys only episcopal pastor the rev luis berrano 
laurente was arrested the next day monday the human rights 
monitoring group americas watch said friday he was still in 
custody 
as the salvadoran roman catholic church has supported its poor 
parishioners foreign priests nuns ministers missionaries 
doctors nurses social worker and teachers have joined them 
episcopal lutheran baptist and mennonite churches were on the 
rosters of the dozens of churches church schools refuges and 
social offices raided by authorities during the rebel offensive 
americans west germans canadians spaniards and guatemalans were 
among those detained or deported 
many both salvadorans and foreigners have fled many have 
gone into hiding in the past two weeks but even so they say the 
work of the churches is not over 
they feel needed here and the more they are persecuted the 
more needed they feel said an american academic with extensive 
experience in el salvador

americas taste for the hard stuff has plummeted 
to its lowest level in three decades 
the national centers for disease control reported friday that 
percapita consumption of distilled spirits in 1986 was 085 
gallons the lowest since 1959 when it was 084 gallons 
the decline in spirits consumption may represent changes in 
the drinking patterns and preferences in the drinkingaged 
population the cdc said in its weekly report 
these changes were reflected by greater interest in beverages 
with reduced alcohol content light beers and wine coolers as 
well as increased public awareness regarding physical fitness 
nutrition and alcohol abuse 
complete statistics were available through 1986 preliminary 
statistics indicate the decline continued in 1987 to 083 gallons 
said researcher darryl bertolucci of the alcohol drug abuse and 
mental health administration 
the cdc said the drop in consumption of distilled spirits 
between 1985 and 1986 was the sharpest since 1956 as measured in 
both actual cases sold and the percentage of the decrease but the 
exact statistics behind those conclusions were unavailable friday 
in the united states the cdc said percapita consumption of 
ethanol the actual alcohol in alcoholic beverages was 258 
gallons from all beverages in 1986 the lowest since 264 gallons 
in 1977 
two of three american adults drink but a relatively small 
number of them account for most of the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages 
the cdc said 10 percent of drinkers or just 65 percent of the 
us adult population account for half of all the alcohol consumed 
in the nation 
public health officials defined heavy drinking as an average of 
one ounce or more of ethanol each day about two beers cocktails 
or glasses of wine such drinkers the cdc said run a seventimes 
greater risk of liver cirrhosis than occasional alcohol drinkers 
the cdc said at least 46 percent of the cirrhosis deaths among 
us men and at least 15 percent of cirrhosis deaths among women 
are attributable to heavy drinking 
the agency reported friday that 26151 americans died of chronic 
liver disease and cirrhosis in 1986 42 percent of those deaths 
were associated with alcohol 
high rates of death from chronic liver disease were scattered 
across the country topped by 31 such deaths per 100000 residents 
in washington dc lowest was arkansas with six deaths per 
100000 people 
in another 13475 deaths the cdc said chronic liver disease 
was a contributing cause

a policeman on trial for two deaths that sparked a 
race riot shot a motorcyclist in selfdefense as he twisted to 
avoid being hit by the vehicle the officers partner testified 
officer dawn campell said she was only a few feet behind william 
lozano the night of the jan 16 shooting lozano 31 is hispanic 
and the two victims on the motorcycle were black 
prosecution witnesses had testified ms campbell was on the 
sidewalk and ducked down behind their patrol car at the moment of 
the shooting 
but on friday she insisted she was in the middle of the street 
when she heard sirens then spotted the motorcycle speeding toward 
lozano at about 70 mph with another police car in pursuit 
i saw the motorcycle come into the southbound lane heading 
straight for officer lozano she testified as the motorcycle 
got right up on him i heard a pop and saw officer lozano give a 
twisting movement 
she said the motorcycle passed within about a foot of lozano 
who twisted to escape being hit 
prosecutors claim the motorcyclist did not threaten lozano 
the driver clement lloyd 23 died instantly with a bullet in 
his head his passenger allan blanchard 24 was critically 
injured when the outofcontrol motorcycle crashed blanchard died 
the next day 
assistant state attorney don horn asked if despite departmental 
rules ms campbell had talked to lozano immediately after the 
incident she denied discussing the case and said she didnt recall 
a conversation at the scene among her lozano and a friend 
officer manny gonzalez 
horn then showed photographs of the three officers apparently 
talking and making gestures just after the shooting in one lozano 
appeared to be standing in the position the defense says he 
occupied at the time of the shooting but ms campbell denied they 
were reenacting the scene she and lozano were together she said 
because they had been ordered to find the spent shell casing 
prior to ms campbells testimony defense attorney roy black 
called the trial a political ploy 
there is more effort made to prosecute a police officer than 
any 10 murder cases ive ever seen in this court he said 
but lead prosecutor john hogan responded he would make no 
apology for the resources spent on the case 
there is a large proportion of the people who live in dade 
county who feel that they could be killed perhaps for absolutely 
no reason because of the color of their skin said hogan 
and because of the occupation of their killer that no justice 
will be done that the justice system works only for the chosen 
few

10000 worth of mink fox and rabbit furs splashed with red 
paint to symbolize blood an organizer the rev marc wessels of 
philadelphia said the furs once belonged to people who have since 
joined the animalrights movement 
id rather be naked than wear fur read a message on a float 
that protesters wearing skincolored leotards brought to a downtown 
miami shopping mall 
four fur shops were vandalized in miami and fort lauderdale 
fla a spokeswoman for the animals rights foundation of florida 
nanci alexander blamed the vandalism on furriers trying to make 
the protest groups look bad 
about 50 people dressed in mourning black marched in san 
franciscos union square in the heart of the downtown shopping 
district fur is torture dont buy fur they chanted as they 
weaved through crowds of shoppers 
among other cities where antifur demonstrations took place were 
scottsdale ariz st paul minn fayetteville ark corpus 
christi texas new orleans durham nc columbus ohio and 
syracuse ny trans species unlimited an animal rights group 
said protests were scheduled in dozens of other cities 
in new york barker led a fourblocklong line of protesters 
barker who resigned as host of the miss usa pageant over its 
award of a fur to the winner called the nations fur farms 
animal concentration camps the charge infuriated a spokesman 
for the fur industry 
that kind of spurious allegation is entirely without any basis 
in fact said bob buckler executive director of the fur farm 
animal welfare coalition the fact is animals raised on american 
fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals 
in the world 
harold dehart president of the coalition said furfree 
friday is simply a media ploy designed to draw attention away 
from the determination of animal rights groups to eliminate all 
animal use 
it was hard to gauge the effect of the protests on business but 
most shop owners dismissed the protests as merely annoying 
we have had very good sales at this time of year as usual so 
i dont believe it has changed at all said christina delgado 
manager of rosina malta fashions in miami where the front door was 
painted red by vandals 
in denver where about 250 protesters targeted five fur stores 
in the posh cherry creek district robin duxbury of the rocky 
mountain humane society asserted that such protests have cost the 
fur industry 30 percent of its market duxbury also said five 
denverarea furriers have gone out of business in the past year 
but the fur information council of america said fur sales have 
tripled in the united states in the past decade to more than 1 
billion last year the fur council monitored the demonstrations 
from its office in washington dc said richard parsons the 
executive director 
in some cities protesters met counterdemonstrations 
while 35 protesters gathered at a seattle shopping center half 
a dozen fur store workers and mink farm owners were nearby holding 
signs proclaiming the right to wear fur 
in milwaukee about 80 people who picketed fur shops were 
challenged by the rev harold turner and about eight members of his 
baptist church 
human rights over animal rights turner shouted to the 
antifur demonstrators take off your leather shoes if you dont

eastern airlines management and its machinists 
union agree on one thing the abrupt end of sympathy strikes by 
the pilots and flight attendants wont immediately change the 
airlines status 
in anything troubles were likely to be compounded for eastern 
which said friday it had no jobs to offer the returning pilots and 
attendants the machinists vowed to continue and intensify their 
8month strike despite the end of the sympathy walkouts 
it really doesnt affect our operation at all company 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak said now we have to deal with the 
issue of bringing people back to work if there are openings 
the airline asked us district judge james l king to determine 
the status of all employees those hired during the strike union 
members who crossed picket lines and returning strikers 
we want to take care of that up front so everyone knows 
clearly where they stand ms ceremsak said 
a statement from the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers local said the other unions action does not 
have a material effect on the strike and on chairman frank 
lorenzos failed reorganization plan it does not change the 
reality of easterns performance and the problems it faces in a 
poor industry environment 
were going to escalate the strike said frank ortis 
president of machinists local 702 theyre losing 2 million to 
3 million a day we know they cant survive without maintenance 
the company is in disagreement with the pilots and flight 
attendants unions on recalling former strikers and ortis noted 
recent reports that cashstrapped eastern has resumed negotiations 
to sell its south american routes to american airlines eastern 
filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began march 4 
what are they going to do with those people if they sell south 
america ortis said he said hundreds of pilots and flight 
attendants jobs are tied to those routes and eastern would face 
more legal fights about employees laid off after a sale 
although ms ceremsak said eastern was in solid shape on 
maintenance machinists officials said easterns records declined 
last month in ontime performance and customer complaints 
according to transportation department figures released earlier 
this month easterns ontime performance fell to 806 percent in 
september from 869 percent in august customer complaints fell to 
793 per 100000 passengers from 3624 in august but the figures 
for both months were above the average of 577 per 100000 
passengers for the period from january to september 
ms ceremsak said eastern has openings for 500 mechanics with 
2500 on the current workforce including 300 machinists who crossed 
picket lines 
she said eastern has 1700 union flight attendants who crossed 
picket lines and has hired 1700 new flight attendants with 
another 250 recruits in training that gives the rebuilding carrier 
all it needs she said 
ms ceremsak said eastern has 1850 pilots including 850 union 
pilots who crossed picket lines and 1000 new hirees enough for 
its schedule of 775 daily flights which is scheduled to expand 
gradually to more than 900 in early 1990 
the returning strikers go on a recall list and will be called 
back as openings come up ms ceremsak said eastern officials have 
said seniority is less important than the pilots qualifications 
for specific planes and routes

a human rights group has blamed 
both the rightwing government and leftist insurgents for killing 
civilians during an 11day rebel offensive 
americas watch in a report released friday said the armed 
forces engaged in targeted killings arbitrary detentions of 
noncombatants and torture 
the group also criticized rebels for using civilians as 
shields 
the report called carnage again said the air force as 
far as it is possible to determine caused great loss of civilian 
life by indiscriminate aerial attacks in slum neighborhoods 
during the fighting the air force attacked some neighborhoods 
around the capital san salvador in an effort to dislodge rebels 
who took up positions there 
americas watch criticized both sides for impeding medical 
care for the wounded who could not be evacuated because of the 
heavy combat 
the new yorkbased group also said the offensive led to 
noncombat human rights violations by the military as government 
forces apparently took advantage of the fighting to settle old 
scores 
it cited the massacre of six jesuits a series of raids on 
churches and churchrun shelters death threats against church 
officials and the arrests and expulsions of foreign church workers 
the report also raised questions about the governments 
investigation of the killings last week of the jesuits at a 
churchrun univerisity the report said president alfredo cristiani 
should have been able to determine what all government forces in 
the area did that night 
though cristiani has condemned the killings witnesses have 
reportedly said the jesuits were killed by forces in military 
uniforms 
a us embassy spokesman said friday that a witness to the 
massacre has left the country the witness left with the help of 
the governments of el salvador france spain britain and the 
united states said embassy spokesman jeff brown 
the head of the jesuit order in central america jose maria 
tojeira identified the witness as lucia barrera cerna officials 
said she had been staying in the spanish embassy since the killings 
attorney general mauricio colorado quoted the woman who had 
worked as a housekeeper at university as saying she saw men 
dressed in military uniforms killing the jesuits their 
housekeeper and her daughter 
jesuit officials said the woman left thursday for miami 
also friday legislators debated a proposed law that would 
impose long prison terms for protests and other activities by 
peasant humanrights and union groups 
the government and military consider most such organizations to 
be fronts for leftist rebels 
under the proposal participants in sitins or building 
takeovers could face up to 20 years in prison people blocking 
traffic with demonstrations could be jailed for five years

a woman who witnessed the massacre of six jesuit 
priests in el salvador last was spirited to the united states by 
spanish french and us diplomats and is under guard here at a 
secret location 
the witness was flown thursday night to miami from san salvador 
aboard a french military plane with the assistance of a key french 
official the miami herald reported in todays editions 
she has been identified as lucia barrera cerna 40 a cleaning 
woman who worked for two of the slain priests at jose simeon canas 
central american university 
according to unidentified officials cited by the herald the 
woman saw the priests and two university employees shot at 
pointblank range on nov 16 by a group of 30 to 40 men wearing 
salvadoran military uniforms 
her account appeared to bolster charges by church officials and 
others that the killings were carried out by members of the 
salvadoran military salvadoran officials have claimed the killings 
could have been the work of leftists trying to pass themselves off 
as salvadoran soldiers 
the witness also was interviewed by salvadoran officials and 
salvadoran attorney general mauricio eduardo colorado was quoted in 
the herald as saying the witness saw just five assasins three 
dressed in black and two in olivegreen uniforms 
bernard kouchner the french minister for humanitarian affairs 
said he escorted the woman her husband and their daughter to the 
united states kouchner said the family has been handed over to the 
us state department for protection 
but other unidentified officials involved in the case said the 
witness and her family were being guarded by the fbi a spokeswoman 
at the miami office of the fbi refused to confirm or deny the 
report 
kouchner said he was in san salvador last weekend to attend the 
funerals of the priests and learned wednesday the witness and her 
family were in the spanish embassy and wanted to go to miami 
inside salvador it was impossible to protect them kouchner 
said there were death squadrons all around 
kouchner said he offered frances assistance in bringing the 
family to miami and was joined on the trip by two unidentified 
us diplomats and bodyguards 
we transferred the lady to san salvadors airport under the 
protection of our bodyguards and security people from the french 
and spanish embassies kouchner said adding that the us 
ambassador to el salvador william walker was present 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani approved of the witness 
relocation to the united states kouchner said 
meanwhile an american priest who fled el salvador last week 
after receiving death threats said he planned to carry out a 
campaign to end us aid to cristianis rightist government 
the rev jim barnett visiting st paul minn this week said 
that during heavy fighting in the salvadoran capital last week he 
called friends in the united states to say that the government was 
hurting civilians by bombing and strafing of poor neighborhoods 
where leftist rebels were entrenched 
barnett said he then received a telephoned death threat at the 
residence for catholic and lutheran clerics where he lived and 
decided to leave the country 
many clergy in el salvador have been threatened by rightists 
since the guerrilla offensive began two weeks ago many priests are 
in hiding church members often are accused of sheltering or 
supplying the rebels

a jury has ordered the chicago cubs to pay 
67500 in damages to a boy who was struck in the eye by a foul 
ball during a game at wrigley field attorneys said 
the award to delbert yates jr 16 is only the second of its 
kind in the country cubs lawyer william cremer said in the other 
case a lawsuit against the houston astros the verdict was 
reversed on appeal and cremer said the cubs would appeal 
contacted friday night at the familys valparaiso ind home 
the boys father delbert sr said were pretty happy 
because maybe the cubs will do something to protect the fans now 
the younger yates was struck in the face by a foul ball off the 
bat of cubs slugger leon durham during an aug 20 1983 game 
against atlanta he was sitting in a box seat on the third base 
side of home plate just a few feet from the protective screen 
the boy was treated at a ballpark first aid station and taken by 
ambulance to a childrens hospital where he spent five days he 
suffered a fractured eye socket which caused double vision and 
required an eye operation a month later said his lawyer mario 
cirignani 
cirignani had contended that the protective screen behind home 
plate should have been extended further he said a cook county 
circuit court jury on wednesday awarded yates 67500 for his pain 
and suffering 
but cremer said i think there is an excellent chance of 
getting it reversed 
if the verdict is upheld what do the cubs do cremer asked 
do they then screen the entire park to protect themselves against 
liability catching foul balls is as much a part of baseball as 
crackerjacks and peanuts

a week ago the editor of a czechlanguage 
newspaper published in this tiny central texas town predicted in a 
column that change would soon come to his homeland 
but jan vaculik who left czechoslovakia a month after the 
soviet invasion in 1968 was stunned when the hardline members of 
the czechoslovak politburo resigned friday 
i didnt expect such change so rapidly vaculik said im 
excited at least that these guys are gone i always feared that 
they may turn violent against the people 
vaculik 44 publishes the monthly hospodar for 1000 
subscribers in the united states and 1000 in czechoslovakia he 
said most of the papers readers are older and remember the 
dream of the first republic the only independent 
czechoslovakian republic from 1918 to 1938 
they know there is a different way vaculik said 
about 85 percent of wests 2300 residents are of czechoslovak 
descent vaculik said but only a handful were born in 
czechoslovakia good farming conditions and cheap land brought most 
of them to west in the 1870s 
the towns 22member dance ensemble toured czechoslovakia last 
year 
it was really a culture shock things that we have at our 
fingertips theyre not able to have said maggie grmela who 
started the dance group with her husband 14 years ago were 
pleased to see whats happening now in granger a town about 80 
miles south of west that is also predominantly czech residents are

as the east german capital emptied today for 
a third weekend of visits to the west communist leader egon krenz 
took his appeal for public trust to the streets of leipzig a hub 
of recent protests 
on friday other leading communists said east germany should 
consider stronger ties with west germany to rescue this countrys 
troubled economy 
during his stroll through the center of the grimy industrial 
city of leipzig krenz was besieged by shoppers and workers who 
pounded him with questions about the nations future the official 
adn news agency reported 
can the desperate situation with the economy be improved 
will those responsible for the misery be punished residents 
asked krenz adn said 
they offered question after question but also 
encouragements adn said quoting strollers as yelling egon 
keep it up we wish you health 
protests in leipzig a weekly ritual have attracted hundreds of 
thousands of people the demonstrations there and elsewhere in east 
germany coupled with an exodus to the west through other east bloc 
countries prompted east germany to open its borders to the west 
earlier this month 
the generally positive report on krenzs visit appeared aimed at 
boosting the leaders image at a time of disillusionment with 
communist party stalwarts 
krenz reportedly faces strong opposition to his continued 
leadership within the party which is split on how to proceed with 
reforms he has admitted he could be replaced at a major party 
meeting next month 
in another move aimed at winning public confidence parliament 
speaker guenther maleuda said in an interview published by the 
youth newspaper junge welt that parliamentary elections could come 
as early as autumn 1990 if a new election law can be worked out 
early next year 
he did not indicate the vote would be truly democratic as other 
top officials have however he said he could envision 
participation by groups other than the current established parties 
aligned with the communists 
the rush for the borders began early with more than 300000 
crossing into west berlin and west germany before nightfall friday 
and hundreds of thousands more traveling through the night 
trabant and wartburg cars backed up as far as 25 miles at border 
crossings into west germanys bavaria state and east berlins 
potsdamer platz crossing in the wall for pedestrians was packed by 
thousands before noon 
east german public transportion was so overwhelmed with the 
westward travelers that the federal transport ministry issued an 
appeal to citizens late friday to avoid using the rail system 
most of the east germans were just headed for visits mostly to 
shop 
however a new surge of east german refugees also has become 
apparent over the past few days with more than 3000 applying for 
resettlement in west germany on thursday and friday 
also today adn said werner eberlein a member of the ruling 
politburo and head of the partys disciplinary committee called 
for a thorough probe of misuse of office corruption personal 
enrichment and other guilts 
he did not say exactly who he was referring to but the party 
has already launched an investigation into the actions of former 
party chief erich honecker and other top officials of the ousted 
leadership

the holiday shopping season is officially open and retailers 
hope the huge crowds that packed stores on the traditional kickoff 
day after thanksgiving are a prelude to a merry and profitable 
christmas 
nobodys anticipating a banner year said blair holden 
manager of the sears roebuck and co store in lansing mich but 
were hoping to do as well as last year and maybe a little better 
as the peak holiday selling season began friday many merchants 
tried to accommodate shoppers with longer hours bargains and 
special services on a day that usually is the busiest of the year 
for retailers 
but there were some indications buyers were bingeing less than 
retailers hoped 
thousands stopped by the 59store sierra vista mall in clovis 
calif but mall manager russ joyner said were finding that 
people are waiting longer to do their shopping 
the last saturday prior to christmas is the day that really 
seems to be the most lucrative joyner said 
almost half of retailers annual business is done in the weeks 
between thanksgiving and christmas usually shoppers swarm stores 
in the days immediately after thanksgiving and then lose interest 
until the final frantic days just before christmas 
this years retail outlook varies by region but nationwide 
retail sales are expected to rise only about an average of 55 
percent over last year compared with 1988s surprisingly strong 9 
percent gain 
retailers and industry analysts say holiday shoppers are likely 
to continue holding back generally on purchases of expensive 
longlasting goods such as home appliances as they have all year 
store workers said consumer electronics and video games appeared 
to be selling fast on friday clothing costume jewelry and 
accessories also did well 
nintendo is selling awful good and camcorders are blowing out 
anything in the electric department is selling very well said 
bob gilley manager of the sears roebuck and co store at merle 
hay mall in des moines iowa 
markdowns on merchandise at some troubled stores appealed to 
bargain hunters 
the six b altman amp co department stores in new york new 
jersey and pennsylvania drew hordes to the chains 
goingoutofbusiness sale only altmans cincinnati store will 
remain open after its financially ailing parent hooker corp 
couldnt find a buyer 
the morning crowd clamoring to get into b altmans main store 
in manhattan was so heavy that shoppers were admitted in shifts by 
midafternoon police turned people away saying the enormous store 
was dangerously overcrowded 
its like a war zone said audrey lavine of manhattan who 
battled the bedlam to buy a designer suit 
elsewhere shoppers who showed up early got special treatment 
the walmart store in terre haute ind offered extra low prices on 
selected items from 7 am to 10 am during a 7 am to 11 am 
sale at fred meyers a discount store about 20 miles south of 
downtown seattle shoppers drank free coffee sipped apple cider 
and munched on doughnuts 
some malls offered other amenities shoppers at grossmont center 
outside san diego could leave their youngsters at a free childcare 
center and take beepers in case of an emergency the somerset mall 
in troy mich and emporiumcapwells outside oakland calif

new president elias hrawi today chose a 
moslem leader as the new prime minister and formally disbanded the 
military government of christian gen michel aoun 
hrawi a 64yearold maronite catholic lawmaker was elected by 
parliament on friday as lebanons 10th president he succeeds rene 
mouawad who was assassinated wednesday by a car bomb in beirut and 
buried today 
the peace march has started and it will not stumble hwari 
told parliament friday as it met in this bekaa valley city guarded 
by hundreds of syrian troops we shall not allow anyone to stand 
in the way 
hrawis decree ousting aouns threeman military cabinet is a 
formality aoun still controls the 20000member army has 
denounced hrawis election and claims that his military cabinet is 
lebanons only legitimate government 
in hrawis hometown of zahleh in the eastern bekaa valley 
residents fired guns into the air to celebrate his selection 
hundreds danced in the streets 
in contrast church bells tolled and an army band played dirges 
in the northern mountain town of zgorta during the funeral of 
mouawad whom hrawi described in his acceptance speech as the 
martyr of national unity 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual leader of the maronite 
community led the funeral services and papal nuncio pablo pointe 
read a message from pope john paul ii in which the pontiff said he 
was praying for peace in lebanon 
women wailed as the coffins of mouawad and six slain bodyguards 
were carried out of the cathedral of st john the baptist for 
burial in a cemetery nearby mothers sisters and wives of the 
slain bodyguards flung themselves on the caskets as they were 
lowered into the graves 
christians and moslems nationwide joined in a strike in tribute 
of the fallen president 
like mouawad hrawi chose sunni moslem leader salim hoss to head 
a new government comprised of christians and moslems under an arab 
league peace accord aimed at ending lebanons 14yearold civil war 
aoun 54 a maronite like hrawi opposes the peace accord 
because it has no deadline for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian 
soldiers from lebanon 
aoun was named to head an interim cabinet by former president 
amin gemayel on sept 22 1988 just before gemayels sixyear term 
expired with parliament unable to elect a successor 
aouns appointment was rejected by moslems and resulted in the 
emergence of two rival cabinets vying for power hoss headed the 
moslem cabinet 
the ensuing political crisis renewed fighting between moslem 
militias and their syrian allies and hardline christian forces led 
by aoun 
hoss today announced a cabinet that he said he had chosen as 
prime ministerdesignate under mouawad 
hoss 60 retained druse warlord walid jumblatt as public works 
minister and shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri as 
minister of elecrical and hydraulic resources berri also got the 
housing and cooperatives portfolios 
berri and jumblatt are syrias main allies in lebanon they 
fielded the largest moslem militias in the civil war against the 
christians 
hoss also appointed george saadeh leader of the rightwing 
phalange party lebanons largest christian political force into 
the new government as minister of post and telecomunications 
but saadeh a maronite catholic living in the christian enclave 
controlled by aouns army appeared reluctant to take up the post 
i was surprised by my appointment i dont oppose the new 
government but the question of my participation must first be 
approved by the phalange politburo saadeh said in a statement 
broadcast by the partys voice of lebanon radio station 
in addition to the maronite sunni shiite and druse 
communities the greek orthodox greek catholics and armenians also 
were represented in hoss government 
aoun who vehemently opposed mouawads election said hrawis 
election was as unconstitutional as that of mouawad both have 
been elected under syrian occupation 
they should have waited to find out who killed mouawad before 
appointing a new president aoun said in a statement released by 
his press office in beiruts eastern suburb of baabda

the real crime capital of the world may be 
a small town nestled in a rural virginia forest where bank 
robberies kidnappings and deadly extortion plots are running 
rampant the towns mayor however shrugs it off with a serene 
smile 
after all as the interminable struggle between good and evil 
rages outside his office window jim pledger boasts a police force 
that would be the envy of any bigcity mayor dozens of smart 
squarejawed young fbi trainees 
pledger is mayor of hogans alley a fictitious but 
strikingly realistic town built on a wooded 20acre site at the 
fbi academy about 40 miles south of washington dc where 
students practice nabbing criminals interrogating witnesses and 
gathering evidence 
this is the most crimeridden town in the world says 
pledger the training unit chief in charge of hogans alley but 
the great thing is that our law enforcement people have a 100 
percent success rate solving crimes 
at first glance the town is picturebook america with its own 
post office drugstore bank barber shop combination pool hall 
and greyhound bus station coinoperated laundry movie theater 
motel and boarding houses 
all are phony except for the pastime bar where fbi employees 
can step inside for a cup of coffee or a sandwich while waiting for 
the next crime wave 
visitors with long memories might notice something familiar 
about the movie theater the biograph which features clark gable 
and myrna loy in manhattan melodrama it was under the same 
marquee of the biograph theater in chicago that gangster john 
dillinger was shot dead in 1934 
in this town there are no mothers pushing baby carriages or 
merchants hurrying to work the streets are strangely empty until 
the silence is broken by volleys from blankfiring shotguns and 
revolvers the squealing tires of police cruisers and shouts of 
freeze this is the fbi 
the makebelieve bad guys and witnesses who inhabit hogans 
alley are amateur role players hired by the hour through a 
commercial talent agency 
they include housewives from the neighboring marine corps base 
at quantico schoolteachers retirees and offduty firefighters and 
police officers none has any previous acting experience 
in this town crime pays at 8 an hour says pledger 
a huge sign on the outskirts of town gives visitors fair warning 
welcome to hogans alley city limits caution law 
enforcement training exercises in progress display of weapons 
firing of blank ammunition and arrests may occur if challenged 
please follow instructions have a nice day 
last wednesday the day started literally with a bang at 820 
am when the hogan bank was robbed three gunmen fled with about 
30000 in play money some of it in 50 bills bearing pledgers 
portrait 
four teams of fbi trainees 44 in all sprang into action 
following a minutebyminute script written by their supervisors 
while the first team was interviewing bank employees and dusting 
the tellers cage for fingerprints other trainees quickly arrested 
the first suspect a shaggyhaired man in plaid shirt and jeans at 
his hideout in the dogwood inn motel 
another gunman was grabbed handcuffed and frisked outside his 
threestory townhouse while his girlfriend loudly complained and a 
nosy neighbor gawked the third suspect who lives in the local 
trailer park was caught in an fbi ambush at will johnsons garage 
where he had left his aging green sedan for repairs 
case closed in just four hours 
these trainees know theyre playacting but their adrenaline 
really gets pumping said training supervisor donald j gray 
the nosy neighbor outside the townhouse was thomas burkhard a 
retired massachusetts dairy marketing executive who now lives in 
nearby woodbridge va his daughter lisa bennett a doctors 
receptionist and mother of two played the bank teller in the phony 
robbery 
its fun frankly said burkhard i dont do it for the 
money i do it because i enjoy it its ideal for me gives me 
something to do three or four days a month 
has he discovered any hidden talents for acting 
burkhard laughed and replied my role is to be a nuisance and 
ive almost been kicked off the porch a couple of times i get a 
thumbsup occasionally from the instructors

hundreds of monkeys descended from 
their buddhist temple home saturday for a 12course meal complete 
with menus and linen napkins but forgot their manners and hurled 
soda cans at the curious humans 
the furry guests leaped aboard the neat rows of tables to devour 
vast spreads of sweet and sour noodles salad tomato cocktail 
fried rice chinesestyle noodles potato soup banana cake and 
coconut candy 
a local hotel owner yongyut kiwattanananusan gave the monkeys 
the meal to thank them for the success of his lopburi inn the 
monkeys are symbols of good fortune and a favorite tourist 
attraction in this small provincial capital 70 miles north of 
bangkok 
the monkeys dined on the grounds of the wat san prakhan in the 
morning and a second feast was given in the afternoon at the 
10thcentury three pagodas temple 
at wat san prakhan they feasted with abandon despite attempts 
by an army of waiters to keep order at one stage some swung up 
into the trees and hurled soft drink cans at hundreds of human 
spectators 
the second feast was held before much larger crowds of people 
it fizzled out as a monkey named wang led his fellows in a tactical 
retreat leaving untouched more than 40 tables of food 
townspeople said the monkeys sleep at the wat san prakhan and 
cross the road at exactly 8 am each morning for breakfast at the 
three pagodas temple 
they believe the monkeys are the disciples of the fourhanded 
hindubuddhist idol around which the wat san prakhan was built

one of ferdinand marcos closest 
allies has slipped back into the philippines three years after 
president corazon aquino who is also his cousin banished him to 
the united states 
eduardo cojuangco was welcomed as the leading light of the 
opposition by those opposed to mrs aquino but he said after his 
return late friday that he came back mainly to defend himself 
against charges he helped marcos steal from the government 
cojuangco 54 left the philippines in february 1986 aboard the 
same american military plane that carried marcos into exile in 
hawaii after his ouster in an uprising that brought mrs aquino to 
power marcos died sept 28 
assistant presidential spokeswoman lourdes sytangco said 
manifests of flights from abroad did not include an eduardo 
cojuangco and he may have traveled under an assumed name from the 
united states 
a presidential security official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said mrs aquino learned of cojuangcos arrival from 
airport officials saturday 
cojuangco who is a first cousin to mrs aquino said he wanted 
to return to clear his name of allegations he helped marcos loot 
the philippine treasury of billions of dollars 
the aquino administration seized cojuangcos assets and has 
named him as a defendant in 29 civil suits presidential spokesman 
adolfo azcuna said criminal charges were also being prepared 
i am thankful that we have been able to come home because for 
a long time i have wanted to come back here cojuangco said in an 
interview with dzrh radio and i thank the almighty that i have 
been given the opportunity to return to my beloved motherland 
cojuangco told a group of reporters saturday that his defense 
counsel advised him to return home to make it easier to prepare his 
defense 
cojuangco said he was issued a passport by the philippine 
consulate in los angeles azcuna said the palace was unaware any 
passport was issued 
cojuangcos passport was canceled in 1986 along with those of 
marcos and his immediate family 
mrs aquino banned the marcos family from returning and refused 
to allow her predecessor body to be buried in the philippines 
citing national security 
rep rodolfo albano former minority leader in the house of 
representatives said cojuangcos return would boost the opposition 
forces still grasping for a leader since marcos death 
if he will accept it we will wholeheartedly give the 
opposition leadership to him albano said of cojuangco we 
welcome him as the leading light of the opposition 
but nicanor yniguez leader of marcos new society movement 
party said cojuangco apparently wanted to devote his time to 
clearing his name and if he wanted to stay out of politics we 
respect his decision 
others seeking support from marcos followers include vice 
president salvador laurel and sen juan ponce enrile both are seen 
as possible contendors for the presidency in 1992 mrs aquino says 
she will not seek reelection 
during the marcos administration cojuangco was described as the 
secondmost powerful figure in the national economy after the 
president himself 
cojuangco was variously chairman of the san miguel corp the 
countrys largest food and beverage company the united coconut 
planters bank and head of the state monopoly for exporting 
coconuts 
he was also governor of tarlac province stronghold of the late 
sen benigno aquino mrs aquinos husband

investigators hunting the bombers struggle with an international 
web of evidence theory and tales of political intrigue 
theories abound some conflict others interlock proving any of 
them is another matter 
terrorism experts and media investigations have pointed to the 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
theories are that iran hired the organization to avenge a us 
warships july 1988 downing of an iran air jet with 290 people 
aboard iran has denied any involvement 
flight 103 of dec 21 was an ordinary flight full of ordinary 
people students going home for christmas gis taking infants to 
meet their grandparents a newly engaged couple a pilots wife a 
peace corps volunteer 
the boeing 747 blew up over the scottish town of lockerbie 
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground 
the dumfries and galloway constabulary lockerbies regional 
police force still heads the investigation eighty officers are 
assigned to the investigation which has stretched to west germany 
malta and scandinavia 
inspector thomas mccullough said 85 percent of the boeing 747 
has been recovered along with 16000 pieces of belongings that 
were on board 
we are making satisfactory progress with the investigation 
mccullough told the associated press our progress to date 
certainly makes us optimistic that there will be a satisfactory 
conclusion 
police wont say more there are reports of friction between the 
british and west german police the two forces dont even agree 
publicly about whether the bomb was planted in frankfurt london or 
elsewhere 
it is a key question and the answer will help fix the blame for 
the security lapse that allowed the bomb aboard 
lord fraser the lord advocate scotlands senior law officer 
recently appealed to the news media to exercise restraint in their 
reporting lest they seriously jeopardize the international 
criminal investigation and any future court proceedings 
what is officially on record is that the bomb was made of a 
plastic explosive packed in a toshiba radiocassette player and 
hidden in a suitcase that was loaded into a forward cargo hold 
paul channon britains transport secretary at the time said it 
was probably semtex the colorless odorless puttylike explosive 
made in czechoslovakia 
deputy chief constable john orr said the balance of 
probabilities pointed to the bomb being loaded on a boeing 727 in 
frankfurt where flight 103 originated 
passengers and baggage continuing on to new york were 
transferred to the larger plane at londons heathrow airport and 
the hold where the bomb exploded contained mostly baggage loaded in 
frankfurt and a small amount of interline baggage orr said 
west german police maintain theres not enough evidence to prove 
the bomb was put on board in frankfurt 
paul wilkinson an aberdeen university professor who studies 
terrorism said the popular front a radical palestinian group 
based in syria fits the bombmakers profile 
they have the expertise they have a tradition of this type of 
attack they have been caught redhanded in west germany with this 
type of bomb he said in an interview 
pflpgc leader ahmed jibril a former syrian army captain has 
denied involvement but admits his faction has used devices such as 
the one that destroyed flight 103 
the british broadcasting corp and others have named the 
bombmaker as marwan khreesat a jordanian member of the popular 
front 
khreesat was among 16 palestinians suspected of planning a 
terrorist attack who were arrested in west germany two months 
before the pan am bombing in raids in frankfurt and nuess police 
also seized semtex bombs with air pressuresensitive detonators 
like the one that would rip apart flight 103 
all but two of the palestinians were released the bbctv 
investigative program panorama said khreesat was freed because 
he was a double agent working inside the popular front for 
jordanian intelligence and is now living in jordan 
while the sunday times of london made a connection to iran cbs 
said in february it was in revenge for the 1986 us bombing of 
libya and the us decision to talk with the plo they said jibril 
cleared the operation with syrian intelligence and had the full 
backing of the libyan secret service 
the sunday times said jibril ordered his top aide hafez 
dalkamoni to set up the bombing team and that dalkamoni recruited 
khreesat dalkamoni and another palestinians are in jail in west 
germany as the result of the october raids 
the sunday times said khreesat assembled the bomb in frankfurt 
and that it was smuggled to malta a mediterranean island republic 
with close ties to libya 
dalkamoni and mohammed abo talb an admitted member the 
palestine popular struggle front another extremist faction went 
to malta and told the cell to put the bomb on the dec 21 air malta 
flight to frankfurt the newspaper said 
abo talb is one of three palestinians on trial in sweden for 
bomb attacks in northern europe on israeli and american targets 
court records examined there by the associated press confirm talb 
visited malta oct 1926 1988 after spending one day in cyprus 
the sunday times said a baggage list shows one suitcase was 
transferred onto the pan am flight in frankfurt from air malta 
flight km180 in violation of international regulations it was not 
accompanied by a passenger air malta says all the flights 
passengers and baggage are accounted for 
the newspaper said west german authorities knew about the 
possible malta connection in february but didnt tell the british 
until august when the british said the bomb suitcase contained 
clothes made and sold in malta 
the sunday correspondent maintains the bomb began its journey in 
larnaca cyprus it said at least four us intelligence officers 
boarded a frankfurtbound cyprus air flight on dec 21 and 
transferred to flight 103 and that one of their suitcases was 
switched 
a report obtained by british relatives of pan am victims said up 
to eight cia agents were on flight 103 returning home after 
pinpointing the location of us hostages in lebanon 
the report said to have been prepared by a private investigator 
hired by pan ams insurance underwriters says the agents also 
discovered a ciaprotected drug smuggling ring at frankfurt airport 
sections of the report released by ohio congressman james 
traficant jr said the terrorists used the drug pipeline to 
smuggle the bomb aboard flight 103 in frankfurt 
the cia has denied the allegations

half a million cheering 
demonstrators today hailed alexander dubcek and told their 
communist rulers that a remarkable leadership reshuffle failed to 
meet their demands for more democracy 
unpopular prague party boss miroslav stepan a hardline member 
of the new politburo chosen only friday resigned together with the 
entire city party leadership today the official news agency ctk 
said 
todays rally at letna field the largest in the nations 
history was shown on staterun television 
dubcek the bold architect of the 1968 prague spring reforms 
that were crushed by a sovietled invasion made his strongest 
comments to date in favor of reform the rally capped a historic 
week of protests that forced the entire ruling politburo to resign 
the political leadership has lost touch with the people and 
the crisis has deepened said dubcek 67 rejecting fridays 
leadership changes as a cosmetic maneuver 
long live dubcek the people cried dubcek to the 
palace they chanted referring to the official residence of 
czechoslovakias president 
dubcek who was ousted from the party he led and spent nearly 20 
years in virtual seclusion urged party leaders to hear the voice 
of the people 
i appeal to the central committee of the party to take the 
initiative and the ideas of the reform group very seriously he 
said speaking publicly in prague for only the second time since 
1968 
prominent dissident vaclav havel also addressed the cheering 
demonstrators telling them that the opposition group civic forum 
would demand to negotiate democratic reforms with the ruling party 
politburo 
staterun media also reported criticism from communist party 
members who said the measures implemented at fridays central 
committee meeting did not go far enough 
the central committee replaced the 13member politburo with one 
containing nine members six of whom had sat on the former body 
the committee also named karel urbanek to replace party leader 
milos jakes urbanek 48 had been an obscure politburo member in 
charge of the czech republic 
jakes 67 was the third east bloc leader to fall from power in 
five weeks all were hardliners who resisted the reforms 
instituted by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the central committees 16hour session ended early today with a 
retooled government in place but left questions whether the regime 
would embrace the changes demanded by demonstrators 
official media said the central committee adopted a reform 
program that envisioned new laws on assembly association the 
press education and defense but a draft law on the press 
published recently for instance foresaw stiff fines for simply 
passing on unauthorized publications 
opposition leaders called for a general strike monday to demand 
real reforms 
referring to fridays reshuffle dubcek said today the 
changes did not meet the demands of the people 
they the government are telling us that the street is not 
the place for things to be solved but i say the street was and is 
the place the voice of the street must be heard he said to 
deafening roars from a flagwaving crowd that braved freezing 
temperatures to attend the rally 
we appeal to the central committee that those who have caused 
the stagnation leave their posts and do not obstruct further 
development of this country dubcek said 
the dramatic developments were chronicled in part on 
czechoslovak staterun television which on friday night showed 
film clips that revealed stepan was booed by factory workers who 
demanded his resignation thursday 
television showed a stormy city party meeting with lower ranking 
officials fiercely attacking stepan 
it also repeatedly showed pictures of the police brutality nov 
17 that helped cause the current protest movement police had 
clubbed hundreds of peaceful demonstrators urging greater democracy 
the stunning changes also have been covered in the soviet media 
the official news agency tass today described the atmosphere as 
uncertain tinged with emotion and not without a tint of 
political romanticism 
earlier zdenek horeni editor in chief of the official 
czechoslovak daily rude pravo told reporters the party envisioned 
changing the article in the constitution that guarantees the 
leading role of the communists in government 
but he refused to say what kind of reform this entails previous 
comments by party officials have suggested that the communists will 
remain automatically supreme in czechoslovak politics 
jan urban chief spokesman of the opposition group civic forum 
told the british broadcasting corp in a radio interview from 
prague the new politburo members were all very experienced 
apparatus people with no idea of reformist thinking 
he said the opposition was giving the new politburo until monday 
to show their reform minds by immediately releasing political 
prisoners starting talks with the people and including 
noncommunist parties in parliament 
theres nothing to be satisfied with he said not all the 
very compromised persons have gone 
seven politburo members lost their seats in addition to jakes 
those ousted included gustav husak alois indra karel hoffmann and 
ideology chief jan fojtik all of whom were directly responsible 
for the sovietled crackdown on the prague spring reforms of 
1968 
although husak lost his seat he retains his title as president 
for now 
premier ladislav adamec also lost his politburo seat meaning a 
new premier will likely be named soon the seventh politburo member 
removed was frantisek pitra 
stepan had kept his seat as did the head of the official trade 
unions miroslav zavadil urbanek and five holdovers were joined by 
three unknown new men josef cizek miroslav huscava and miroslav 
zajic 
what little is known of urbanek suggests that he is an orthodox 
communist he criticized leading dissidents in the party weekly 
tribuna in march

like members of a sports team that has just 
finished a rebuilding season members of congress are telling the 
public to wait till next year 
but when they return from their twomonthlong holiday break 
election year pressures will make tough legislative issues like 
deficit reduction and campaign finance reform even tougher to solve 
in the second session of the 101st congress than they were in the 
first 
this is an incomplete congress said house republican whip 
newt gingrich of georgia and i think we wont know until the end 
of next year whether its a good congress 
the senate started the year with a new chief majority leader 
george mitchell of maine 
then nearly halfway through the year the house had to get new 
leadership when speaker jim wright dtexas and majority whip tony 
coelho dcalif resigned wright was accused of ethics violations 
in his personal finances and coelho quit rather than face a 
similar inquiry from the house ethics committee 
gingrich who was wrights chief accuser climbed into the no 2 
spot among house republicans when dick cheney resigned to become 
secretary of defense 
i cant recall any year having seen such turmoil said rep 
dale kildee dmich a 13year house veteran the new leadership 
is just beginning to feel its way its been a salvage and 
repair operation 
house and senate leaders at years end pushed through a raise in 
the minimum wage new spending to fight drugs aid to poland and 
hungary and a controversial pay raise and ethics package a plan 
was approved to bail out and reregulate the savings and loan 
industry at a cost to taxpayers of perhaps hundreds of billions of 
dollars in the next few years 
but completion of many other issues was left for the next 
session among the major ones clean air child care and campaign 
finance reform 
president bush proposed campaign reforms and a bipartisan house 
task force worked on the issue but agreements were elusive as 
each party pushed for advantage 
foley and mitchell list campaign reform as a top priority for 
the new year but mitchell said he was not optimistic 
we have to change the method the system by which we elect 
public officials in our society and by which we finance and conduct 
campaigns he said renewing his call for public financing 
mitchell said he also plans to introduce legislation to provide 
long term health care for the elderly but hes not optimistic 
about that one either given how congress just repealed the 
medicare catastrophic illness coverage 
there is understandable reluctance on the part of members of 
congress to get into this issue having just been burned he said 
congress every year gets into the issue of deficit reduction 
and this year was typical in that the legislation approved wont 
solve the longterm problem 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on the house 
budget committee said the inexperience of the democratic leaders 
hurt this years efforts at deficit reduction 
we had two new leaders this year who were not dry behind the 
ears before plunging into budget summitry frenzel said 
they will be far more effective next year theyre going to be 
able to exercise a lot more discipline the leaders have to be able 
to enforce the agreements 
but there also will be factors out there not working today 
he said the election year will make our work immeasurably more 
difficult 
rep robert matsui dcalif said one of the best things the 
democratic leaders did was get congress out before thanksgiving to 
give themselves time to regroup 
we need this time to reflect to see if we can come up with a 
legislative agenda he said 
it has been a long year i think the membership is 
exhausted said rep mike synar dokla 
but synar was more optimistic about next year foreseeing 
success likely on longdelayed legislation on child care clean air 
and the campaign finance issue 
we get a c for the first session he said but we can 
improve the grade with a makeup in the first three months of 
next year he said

a man already sentenced to 3576 
years in prison for defrauding the government received an addition 
370year sentence from an antigraft court 
despite the long sentences rolando mangubat will probably spend 
no more than 30 years behind bars because that is the maximum time 
in prison the law allows 
the latest sentence against mangubat a former regional 
accountant of the ministry of public works and highways was 
announced friday after the court found him guilty of 55 graft cases 
and four cases of falsifying public documents 
mangubat was also ordered to pay the government 86000 which 
he allegedly pocketed by faking delivery receipts of construction 
materials from august 1977 to july 1978 he was also barred from 
holding any other public office 
last month another antigraft court found him guilty of 392 
cases of fraud and graft and sentenced him to 3576 years in prison

the navy under pressure from state officials 
worried about safety has stepped up plans to retrieve live and 
deactivated explosives accidently dropped onto public lands outside 
bombing ranges 
the navy will start looking for the loose ordnance on bureau of 
land management property outside two of its bombing ranges during 
the next three weeks said capt rex rackowitz commanding officer 
of the fallon naval air station 
the search is a continuation of an exercise nicknamed 
operation ugly baby to retrieve stray bombs that have dotted 
the desert at least 60 miles outside reno for up to 30 years 
no accidents have been reported involving the bombs but state 
officials have been outraged since revelations surfaced that the 
navy in october began a secret operation outside its bravo 17 range 
to retrieve errant explosives 
the navy said it was secretive to prevent the curious from 
collecting souvenirs or interfering in the cleanup 
navy officials had planned to start the cleanup around two other 
bombing rantes bravo 16 and bravo 19 in the spring in a letter 
to gov bob miller on friday rackowitz said the work would resume 
now in order to better protect the public and quickly resolve the 
situation that has drawn the unwanted attention of state 
environmental officials 
please know that the navy is attempting to resolve this 
situation quickly and with utmost concern for the safety of the 
citizens and property of nevada rackowitz wrote 
nevada environmental protection chief lew dodgion this week 
cited the navy for violating state law by leaving bombs on public 
lands he said he might seek fines as high as 10000 a day against 
the navy for failing to notify the state about the hazardous 
materials cleanup and failing to file a plan for the recovery 
operation 
rackowitz said some of the bombs and rockets may have landed 
outside the fenced ranges because of inexperienced pilots or 
equipment failure 
the bureau has closed off lands around the ranges during the 
cleanup 
the navy plans to sweep for bombs outside its bravo 16 bombing 
range beginning monday through dec 2 and on bravo 19 from dec 
415 about 150 naval personnel are traveling to fallon to help 
more than 80000 pounds of scrap metal and bombs were recovered 
from more than 2000 pieces of ordnance during the the bravo 17 
cleanup the navy said

government that vietnam installed in cambodia after a late 1978 
invasion its fighters captured the area north of svay chek in late 
september only days after vietnam made what it claimed was the 
withdrawal of its last troops from the country 
the capture of svay chek the capital of the district of the 
same name would be their biggest victory of the war

they have so many mortars and heavy guns we arent even 
counting any more said frontline guerrilla commander gen khun 
boeng

increased the number of defenders at svay chek to 2000 by trucking

winston churchill made his historic speech 
about an iron curtain across europe in this college town 43 
years ago now theres a move to pay tribute to the disintegration 
of that curtain by putting part of the broken berlin wall on 
permanent display 
supporters of the idea say it would be a tangible tribute to 
churchills descriptive phrase delivered in a lecture at 
westminster college here 43 years ago 
diplomatic logistic and financial barriers would have to be 
crossed still supporters say westminster is the right place for a 
symbol of chilled eastwest relations 
this was where winston churchill first used those words about 
an iron curtain descending across eastern europe the first 
glimpse in 1989 of that curtain ascending across eastern europe 
brings us a sense of closure to his prediction says the rev 
michael vaughn pastor of first presbyterian church in fulton 
i would like to see the memorial here which notes churchills 
moment in history bracketed with the other end of history the fall 
of the berlin wall 
out of government but with a wartime leaders perspective on 
postwar europe churchill spoke at westminster on march 5 1946 
introduced by president harry s truman the former prime minister 
called for unity between great britain and the united states 
then he uttered these famous words 
from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron 
curtain has descended across the continent 
behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of 
central and eastern europe warsaw berlin prague vienna 
budapest belgrade bucharest and sofia 
all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in 
what i must call the soviet sphere and all are subject in one form 
or another not only to soviet influence but a very high and in 
many cases increasing measure of control from moscow 
churchill who died in 1965 is memorialized at the school with 
a towering statue an extensive archive and museum and in an 
ancient stone church that was moved from london after being blasted 
by german bombs 
visitors say the rebuilt church is proof of a future after 
conflict and vaughn says the relocated wall could also be 
inspiring 
i think part of the symbolism should be a massive gap in the 
wall if its brought here like the cross which was a sign of 
execution that we now lift up as a sign of hope in christianity 
he says 
now a wall that separated us has cracked and come down and 
shown us that physical barriers cannot divide free people 
east germanys opening of its border to the west prompted 
celebrations at westminster where students and townspeople packed 
the old church on a recent evening for a service of thanksgiving 
we are here to celebrate the death of an inanimate object a 
wall jack rogers head of ecumenical ministries of callaway 
county told the worshipers yet that wall has come to symbolize 
all that has kept us apart 
for vaughn moving a section of the berlin wall to fulton would 
be a way of bringing people together 
often the people of israel would erect stones to momentous 
events often as altars but sometimes just groups of stones later 
their children would ask them what mean these stones 
when later generations come we can point to these stones if 
you will from the berlin wall and say this is a period in our 
life when we learned how to make peace

voters in this povertystricken 
nation choose a new president sunday whose biggest problem may be 
beyond any honduran leaders control the civil wars raging in two 
neighboring countries 
after years of military rule it will be honduras third 
straight free presidential vote 
one thing you can say for the current government is the fact 
that we are going to have free elections national party 
candidate rafael leonardo callejas said in an interview with the 
associated press 
callejas is the narrow favoriteif he beats liberal party 
candidate carlos flores and takes office for a fouryear term jan 
27 it will mark the first transition of power to an opposition 
party since 1932 
both candidates are young vigorous ustrained engineers with 
relatively conservative economic views and prous foreign 
policies the lively campaign and the feeling that honduras cant 
lose have brought a tone of pleased surprise to many comments on 
the election 
flores 39 is a newspaper publisher who comes from a family 
that owns textile mills callejas 46 comes from one of the 
counrys old landowning families 
both candidates support the presence of a us base in 
palmerola where 1600 americans rotate through on training 
missions and both oppose making the arrangement permanent 
the winner will face a critical situation however honduras a 
country of about 5 million has all the problems of a third world 
nation a stagnant economy with per capita income of about 500 a 
high foreign debt massive unemployment inflation little 
industry bad telephones and worse roads 
the country got about 186 million in us aid last year about 
41 million of it military 70 million in fiscal support has been 
withheld until honduras makes economic reforms that werent 
possible in an election year 
its biggest problems however are outside its borders and may 
be outside any honduran presidents control the bloody civil war 
in el salvador on the southeast and the continuing contra war on 
the southwest in nicaragua 
half a million war refugees have sharpened economic trouble and 
created resentment arms smuggling is rife and ordinary criminals 
wield assault rifles the ussupported contras have become an 
embarrassment that the country cant shake 
this year there was a spurt in political violence on both left 
and right us soldiers were attacked several times most 
seriously in july when seven soldiers visiting a discotheque were 
injured by a grenade 
both candidates see peace in central america as vital to 
progress and although both say the contras must leave honduran 
soil neither has offered new ideas on how to do it 
in the long run there cant be any recovery without peace and 
security in central america said callejas 
foreign investment outside of bananas and zinc mining has been 
nonexistent in recent years 
flores has tried to separate himself from incumbent president 
jose azcona hoyo who took office in 1986 in a split election 
against callejas azconas inability to solve the economic and 
contra problems has hurt he is barred by law from seeking another 
term 
what we need to do is make some strong decisions lack of 
decisiveness has been most important flores said in an interview 
with the ap 
flores also points to the liberals successful education and 
health programs although with money low the social security system 
has been unable to afford medicine 
more than 22 million voters are registered and 19 million are 
expected to turn out to elect a president three vice presidents 
128 members of a unicameral congress and more than 289 mayors 
voting is by party slate so there can be no ticket splitting 
polls show callejas with a 10 percent lead and few undecided but 
when voters are asked to select by party the liberals have a 
slight lead 
two minor party candidates are not expected to be a factor the 
military appears to be politically neutral 
callejas has campaigned vigorously in traditionally liberal 
regions and has had some success in part because he became the 
first candidate many peasants had ever seen but party loyalty runs 
strong 
most people have their party symbol branded on them at 
birth said saul cruz a carpenter in the southern city of 
nacaome 
callejas has promised to reduce the size of government and make 
free market reforms guarantee that investments will not be 
expropriated fight corruption and cut red tape 
flores makes similar promises and adds that he will try to reach 
a national consensus on economic policy before the inauguration to 
rescue the nations credibility 
with positions similar on substantive issues the campaign has 
at times been bitter and personal 
flores does not use his second last name facusse because it 
reminds voters that he is of lebanese christian descent a group 
resented because of their economic success 
flores was also attacked at first for having an american wife 
who does not speak very good spanish but mary de flores proved a 
sympathetic campaigner and the issue faded

the day after the village voice ran a story 
alleging hed made phone calls to a federal prosecutor on behalf of 
two mobsters sen alfonse damato was acting punchy 
the report was one more in a series of blows the press has 
landed on new yorks pugnacious republican senator and he returned 
a phone call to put his spin on what had happened but instead of 
his usual howahyah greeting the senator burst into an 
offkey ditty based loosely on allan shermans parody about an 
unhappy camper hello mudda hello fadda 
this is alfonse 
ive had better 
times and days 
to the suggestion that things couldnt be that bad damato was 
inspired to a second verse 
the singing waiter 
in the future 
how you like your 
wine and pasta 
he dissolved into asthmatic laughter had al damato finally 
lost it 
not at all songs and silliness pet names and baby talk this 
is damato behind the scenes schmoozing cajoling disarming 
playing the affable dope and right now damato needs all the 
friends he can get 
just as senator pothole had begun to shed his image as a 
worldclass porkbarreler and smalltown machine pol the media 
uncovered his remarkable ability to manipulate the federal 
department of housing and urban development to the benefit of his 
campaign contributors and friends 
and he has other troubles the village voice recounted two 
questionable phone calls that the senator made to thenus 
attorney rudolph giuliani in 1984 and 85 the voice said the calls 
were on behalf of mobsters damato denies it 
another recent charge involved damatos brother armand a 
former state assemblyman who is now a lawyer in private practice 
armand obtained information for unisys corp by drafting a letter 
to the navy in his brothers name regarding a 100 million 
antimissile contract unisys was a 35000ayear client of armand 
damatos law firm 
sen damato said he was unaware that his brother represented 
the long island contractor and said he also had not known about 
the letter 
since last spring each week has seemed to bring a new 
allegation against damato and the charges are taking a political 
toll two recent polls one statewide the other in new york city 
showed damatos popularity declining for the first time since he 
was elected in 1980 in july mark green the democrat who lost to 
damato in 1986 asked the senate select committee on ethics to 
investigate 
on nov 17 the ethics committee hired robert s bennett as a 
special counsel to determine whether an investigation of alleged 
influencepeddling is warranted 
in an interview last week damato said he is the victim of a 
pile on by the press adding that he was certain the ethics 
inquiry will exonerate him 
im proud of my record he said i have nothing to be 
ashamed of 
damato said his support for housing projects has had nothing to 
do with whether a particular developer or applicant had supported 
him politically 
show me where there is a situation where there has been a 
town where there has been a county where there has been a 
worthwhile program or project that has asked for our support where 
weve ever turned them aside he challenged 
and he predicted he will be just the first senator to undergo 
similar scrutiny 
if you were to ask for all the letters that various 
congressmen and senators sent on behalf of constituents to hud 
you will find that there are a number of grants that have been 
successful and that people contributed to them he said 
are we going to say therefore people should be precluded who 
contribute to your campaign from normal constituent services im 
not talking about things which are extraordinary or things that are 
wrong but a letter of support of a letter of inquiry to take a 
look at something i dont think thats the case 
damatos image began to erode in may when the wall street 
journal reported how the reaganera hud favored wellheeled 
developers who contributed generously to the gop and hired powerful 
washington consultants 
around hud the story said damato was known as the senator 
from puerto rico because of the keen interest he took in helping 
the commonwealth win subsidies some puerto rican developers who 
obtained these funds were big contributors to damatos reelection 
campaigns 
damato has since denied that he had ever tried to steer hud 
money to any particular developer in puerto rico 
the new york times dealt damato a second blow two weeks later 
when it reported on irregularities in how inexpensive hud houses 
were awarded in the early 1980s in damatos hometown of island 
park ny 
damato has said he played no role in his cousin getting a house 
and he has praised the island park hud program 
but the times story also chronicled the tale of island parks 
pork barrel pool which was to be built using a 425000 grant 
damato had wheedled out of a special fund controlled by thenhud 
secretary samuel pierce in july the village dropped the project 
after unfavorable news reports 
how does damato justify asking hud to build a swimming pool in 
a middleclass beach front community when so many americans are 
homeless 
it was a grievous error in political judgment he admitted 
last week if you want to say i was naive as it relates to 
island park i was dumb 
throughout the summer as hud released reams of old files and a 
house panel conducted investigative hearings damatos name came 
up again and again sometimes his name was being used without his 
permission says damato 
damato came from long island politics to win election to the 
senate after a challenge to sen jacob javits rny in which he 
capitalized on javits age 76 illness a progressive nerve 
disease and liberalism 
in his first term damato earned a reputation as the senator 
who got the little things done for new york he bucked his own 
party by fighting against president reagans demand for an end to 
federal subsidies that help pay for mass transit systems and he 
defended taxexempt industrial development bonds as a stimulus for 
creating and retaining thousands of jobs in new york 
during his second term damato perfected his knack for latching 
instantly onto issues of great public relations value and emitting 
much sound and fury 
as a senator damato has also been shrewd to the point of 
shamelessness in taking practically any position espousing any 
cause and lobbying for any project or program that could be 
popular with even the smallest segment of the new york 
electorate observed the almanac of american politics 1990 
still norman ornstein a scholar with the american enterprise 
institute in washington said in a recent interview that he 
believed damato had been on his way to winning some respect as a 
senator until hud

plane before it crashed and broke into two saturday on takeoff from 
seoul state radio reported at least 19 of the 52 people aboard

while taking off from kimpo international airport to remain 
airborne the staterun kbs network quoted government safety 
officials as saying 
the plane crashed on the runway broke in two pieces and its 
right wing was ripped off airport officials said firefighters with 
22 fire engines took 20 minutes to extinguish the fire the injured 
were rushed to four nearby hospitals the officials said 
korean air officials who declined to be named said they had no

one of new orleans biggest tourist rides is 
back on track 
the 154yearold st charles streetcar line the oldest 
continually operating streetcar line in the world made its first 
crosscity run in more than a year friday 
the streetcars made the 6mile trek from the edge of the french 
quarter up st charles avenue with swags of greenery draped above 
the windows during an evening run people living along st charles 
avenue turned on their christmas lights to greet the riders 
they are the best way to go said one of the firstday 
passengers kay young you can have a good time looking around 
and enjoy seeing things as well as its a wonderful mode of public 
transportation 
since october 1988 one stretch of track or another has been out 
of commission while crews replace the track and the bed of rocks 
beneath it 
the 47 million project is the first total renovation since the 
1835 opening of the line which is listed both on the national 
register of historic places and as a national mechanical 
engineering landmark 
the vintage1920 cars with a drivers seat at each end are 
considerably more modern than the muledrawn or steamdriven cars 
used for the lines first five decades after its opening in 1835 
part of the problem in maintaining the streetcars has been that 
the rock bed tends to solidify said michie stoutz spokeswoman for 
the project it would become like big blocks of cement 
crews laid down thick flannellike fabric and a plastic grid 
both designed to get water out of the rail bed and into the soil 
beneath it 
then new rocks imported because there arent any in south 
louisianas mushy soil were laid down and topped with new hardwood 
ties and heavier rails than the ones they replaced 
planners divided the work into 10 areas to close as few 
intersections as possible to other traffic as the parallel sets of 
tracks were ripped out and to minimize disruption to the 20000 
people who ride the streetcars every day 
buses have been ferrying riders between canal street on the 
edge of the french quarter and the edge of construction work 
tourists havent been totally trolleyless valerie robinson a 
spokeswoman for the regional transit authority said the 1mile 
riverfront line which opened for the republican national convention 
in 1988 has been carrying 4000 people a day during the week and 
6000 to 7000 a day on weekends about as many as can stuff 
themselves into the four crimson cars 
by the time the aquarium of the americas opens next september 
officials expect to have added a second set of tracks and three 
more cars to the route 
streetcars once ran all through this city but only two lines now 
exist the lines covered by asphalt include the desire street 
route made famous by tennessee williams one streetcar named 
desire remains on display in the french quarter

an opposition party that has won only 
two national elections this century is favored to defeat the 
governing colorado party in balloting sunday 
the vote follows a lackluster campaign that brought out few 
differences between the colorados and the opposition national party 
or their main candidates one the son and greatnephew of 
presidents the other the grandson of a longtime party leader 
neither centerright party severely criticized the other 
alleged campaign violations or indicated they would dispute the 
outcome 
the winning candidate will replace president jorge sanguinetti 
who took over from a 12year military dictatorship in 1985 the 
change of political leadership was not expected to bring major 
shifts in policy 
polls gave luis lacalle of the national party a big edge over 
the main colorado candidate jorge batlle whose name is pronounced 
bahtlee equipos consultores the countrys most respected polling 
agency projected the nationals would receive 38 percent of the 
total vote and the colorados 30 percent 
lacalle and batlle cite the same problems inflation low 
growth high foreign debt payments deteriorating public services 
both want to cut government bureaucracy allow private companies to 
compete with state firms in some areas sell gold reserves to 
reduce the debt and reform public education 
the colorados and the nationals have dominated political power 
for a century and a half except during the 197385 military 
dictatorship 
political observers said lacalle whose campaign was considered 
a long shot when he started 18 months ago overtook batlle by 
convincing voters he was less ideological and would undertake 
reforms through consensus 
lacalle has not said exactly what hell do but it looks like 
hell do it by coalition not by force said luis rosadilla a 
former tupamaro guerrilla whose political wing the movement for 
popular participation supports the leftist broad front candidate 
for president liber seregni 
a favorite lacalle remark is i want to be a president 
respected by everyone and feared by no one 
lacalle 48 is an attorney and was first elected a national 
deputy in 1971 during the dictatorship which followed an attempt 
by leftwing terrorists to overthrow the government he worked on 
the family ranch in central uruguay and practiced law 
the grandson of luis alberto de herrera the national partys 
leader for five decades until his death in 1959 lacalle was 
elected to the senate in 1984 
batlle 62 also an attorney and senator is the greatnephew of 
former president jose batlle y ordonez who set up uruguays 
welfare state at the turn of the century his father president 
luis batlle extended those reforms following world war ii 
twelve candidates are running for president although only 
lacalle and batlle and perhaps former president jorge pacheco 
areco another colorado candidate have a real chance at victory 
a party may field several candidates the colorados and 
nationals have three each thus lacalle will win if the votes cast 
for the three national presidential candidates exceed the total 
number of votes cast for any other party 
sanguinetti is barred by law from seeking immediate reelection 
also at stake is the makeup of the 30member senate and 
99member house of deputies as well as governments in 19 provinces 
polls open at 8 am and close at 730 pm preliminary tallies 
are expected late sunday 
voting is mandatory for uruguayans 18 years and older failure 
to vote is punishable by a small fine 
the national party ruled this nation of 29 million between 
brazil and argentina from 195967 winning elections in 1958 and 
1962 the term of office later was expanded to five years 
sanguinetti is due to step down in march 1990

the stunning events in eastern europe are 
expected to dominate the upcoming superpower summit in malta 
although president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev also 
will be discussing arms control trade and regional conflicts from 
nicaragua to afghanistan 
bush is holding his first meeting as president with gorbachev a 
more experienced summit participant and his advisers say he is 
being briefed on every imaginable topic including nuclear weapons 
controls and the environment 
at the same time the president has tried since he first 
announced the session on oct 31 to reduce expectations of a 
dramatic breakthrough to the point of insisting the dec 23 
meeting isnt really a summit just a feet up gettogether 
this is a first meeting a time for exploration it is not a 
time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next 
years summit he said wednesday night in a nationally televised 
speech 
in an interview with foreign journalists bush said he was 
prepared to think anew about reducing us troop levels abroad 
because of changes in eastern europe however he added we do 
what we do in conjunction with our allies not in private talks 
with the soviet leader 
the events that serve as backdrop for the summit are momentous 
the holes in the berlin wall the changing regimes in poland 
hungary east germany and bulgaria and fastmoving developments in 
czechoslovakia in prague the entire czech ruling politburo was 
pressured to resign in a remarkable weekend 
leadership shuffle that was continuing saturday with the largest 
rally in the nations history demanding still more change 
in his speech bush described his summit message to the soviet 
leader this way 
we will seek president gorbachevs assurance that this process 
of reform in eastern europe will continue and we will give him our 
assurance that america welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking 
advantage but as a people offering support 
the setting for the talks is striking us and soviet warships 
off the coast of the tiny island nation of malta far from the 
crossroads of major international events 
bush and gorbachev will meet for more than seven hours over the 
two days talking saturday aboard the soviet missile cruiser slava 
and sunday on the uss belknap the ships are to anchor in 
marsaxlokk bay within sight of fishing villages on the eastern end 
of malta and about 220 miles north of tripoli libya 
the customary horde of journalists will be there to cover the 
talks from a distance but raisa gorbachev and barbara bush will 
not accompany their husbands 
gorbachevs reputation after four years on the world stage is as 
a man who loves to spring surprises and white house officials say 
the president will be prepared for anything thrown his way bush 
has been meeting regularly with advisers and outside experts 
including one session several days ago with four previous 
ambassadors to moscow 
the president will know about the highs and lows of the soviet 
leaders perestroika program an immense undertaking to revamp the 
soviet economy and with it military and political policy 
administration officials say they are determined to avoid a 
repeat of the last superpower summit that the united states played 
down president reagans meeting with gorbachev in reykjavik 
iceland in october 1986 
reagan found himself in a spirited bidding match with gorbachev 
on who was more determined to banish nuclear weapons their 
dazzling duet crashed in disagreement over the us star wars 
search for a spacebased shield against soviet ballistic missiles 
so no subject can be ruled out with or without an agenda 
but as described by a number of us officials and the president 
himself malta primarily will be a listening event for bush an 
opportunity to get a firsthand assessment of how gorbachev is going 
about perestroika and what it bodes for us foreign policy and 
security interests 
secretary of defense dick cheney impelled both by budget 
constraints and an easing of eastwest tensions already has vowed 
to cut us military spending bushs assessment of soviet 
intentions is bound to become part of the pentagon calculations 
the president proposed in may a reduction of some 30000 us 
soldiers in western europe as part of a treaty under negotiation in 
vienna austria between nato and the warsaw pact 
administration officials have under study the possibility of 
even deeper cuts either to be made in a revised proposal by the 
allies or to be pursued in a second set of negotiations with the 
sovietled alliance after a treaty is nailed down 
the soviet leader is in the midst of carrying out a unilateral 
withdrawal of six tank divisions from eastern europe over two 
years and he has pledged to cut soviet forces by a halfmillion 
overall 
bush reiterated his support for perestroika during his presummit 
speech and hailed gorbachev as the dynamic architect of soviet 
reform 
but that does not mean bush is going to the mediterranean with 
crates of goodies for gorbachev 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher has held out the prospect 
of a yeartoyear waiver of high us tariff barriers if new soviet 
legislation to make emigration and travel easier passes us 
inspection 
but he also cautioned at a recent news conference that 
restrictions on trade credits would not be eased 
gorbachev has encouraged the political and economic reform that 
spread from hungary and poland this fall to east germany and 
bulgaria but he also has said he wants the warsaw pact kept intact 
nor would he be receptive to the reunification of a powerful 
germany a touchy subject that bush avoided in his speech 
amid the presidential reassurances though could be some 
pointed discussion about afghanistan and central america 
bushs speech included the declaration that nicaragua and cuba 
are holding off a regional trend toward democracy only because of 
the massive support of weapons and supplies from their communist 
allies 
so when i see president gorbachev ill ask him to join with 
us to help bring freedom and democracy to all the peoples of latin 
america he said 
soviet weapons also are helping the marxist government in 
afghanistan against usaided rebels

east germans worried that the drive to revive 
their economy could churn out more pollutants and darken the 
browncoal haze over the nation have formed their own 
environmentalist greens party 
east germany is one of europes most contaminated countries 
with rivers awash in industrial effluent and air so heavy with 
smoke that visibility is cut to a few blocks in cities such as 
leipzig and dresden 
conditions in leipzig gave birth to a broad opposition movement 
that embraces prodemocracy activists as well as champions of 
environmental protection 
the east german greens want direct influence on national 
affairs and will field candidates in elections for parliament and 
executive posts founding member gerhard baecher was quoted as 
saying in saturdays national zeitung a staterun newspaper 
political parties outside the communistcontrolled parliament 
are not recognized by east german authorities although officials 
have recently tolerated public activities by the growing number of 
unsanctioned proreform movements 
opposition groups as well as many senior communists have called 
for free elections as early as next year but a new election law 
must be worked out first to set conditions on candidacy and 
balloting and the various political factions have not yet 
clarified who will draft the legislation 
without a functioning environment there can be no functioning 
society baecher was quoted by national zeitung as saying 
he said the party like its western counterparts would also 
champion the causes of women nonviolence and total 
disarmament 
militarism threatens not only peace and security but it is 
the greater environmental danger as well baecher said 
west germanys greens have been a political force for more than 
a decade and have had parliamentary representation since 1982 the 
casually clad legislators have shouted down conservatives or 
knitted during lengthy parliamentary debates 
in a break with traditional greens policy baecher conceded that 
east germany cannot for the time being renounce the use of nuclear 
power 
the east german greens have instead proposed boosting 
alternative energy sources like solar and wind power over the 
next few years to cover 10 percent of national needs 
baecher also spoke out for better ties between the two german 
states to help east germany convert from using brown coal as its 
primary source of industrial energy production 
such improved ties could assist in the shortterm conversion 
to hard coal he told the newspaper west germany sits on 
gigantic mounds of hard coal that they cant even begin to use we 
could use it to reduce emissions by as much as 50 percent 
east germanys new environment minister hans reichelt told 
reporters in east berlin on friday that a turn away from brown coal 
was not possible soon 
the nations major industrial facilities are powered by the soft 
coal which emits significantly higher levels of sulfur than hard 
coal soft brown coal of the type used extensively in eastern 
europe is banned or severely restricted in most western countries 
reichelt said he expected double the funding for environmental 
cleanup projects beginning next year and said more stringent 
controls on emission and effluent were being developed 
baecher said the new party will seek radio television and 
newspaper exposure to raise environmental consciousness among the 
165 million east germans

when mary de flores steps to the front 
of the podium a thrill runs through the small crowd at a liberal 
party rally 
its mary its mary squealed an 8yearold girl 
stretching to see the woman in jeans and a red blouse accepting 
presents from a group of small children 
her spanish is really awful remarked another resident of 
this southern honduran city but she seems very nice 
mary de flores born in new orleans has made another convert 
for her husband carlos flores who wants to be elected president of 
honduras on sunday 
i was always the shyest in the whole school mrs flores 
said in an interview with the associated press i could never get 
up before a big group of people in english and now i have to do it 
in spanish 
its not the life she visualized when she met the energetic 
young engineering student who became her husband at louisiana state 
university 
my father was an engineer she said i kind of expected 
that kind of life 
she did not expect the poverty that afflicts honduras a poverty 
so deep that she reveals her age 37 but not her birthday 
if they know my birthday really poor people give me presents 
you feel she trailed off its hard to take from people 
who have nothing someone is making 40 a month and they spend 4 
to buy you some flowers 
she has two children and works with poor children at a local 
hospital 
you see children with kwashiorkor theyve gone for so long 
their bodies cant function dozens of kids die of measles that 
would never happen in the states you see kids who drink turpentine 
to get rid of worms parents who sell eggs to buy cola 
she was attacked especially in the liberal party primary for 
refusing to take honduran citizenship 
its like trying to choose between two children said mrs 
flores i didnt come here to escape the united states my 
father my brother they fought for the united states 
mrs flores would like to do what many hondurans do and hold 
dual citizenship but she said us officials told her she was too 
prominent a personality to take honduran citizenship without 
renouncing us citizenship 
the issue faded when it became clear mary de flores could 
connect with the voters 
shes an asset she is not faking it and people know that 
said flores who narrowly trails his chief opponent rafael 
leonardo callejas of the national party 
sometimes i feel uncomfortable with the upper classes the 
poor people they remind me of my grandparents they were cotton 
farmers in tennessee when i smell a wood fire its nostalgic 
said mrs flores 
the poor have so much faith in what carlos is saying when 
those people are so poor and so concentrated you feel an enormous 
responsibility she said 
carlos is optimistic about the future though im optimistic 
because hes optimistic she said

the head of the iranian navy said 
saturday his naval forces and the islamic revolutionary guards 
corps will conduct joint maneuvers in the persian gulf and the sea 
of oman next month tehran television reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted rear adm ali 
shamkhani as saying the week of war games will concentrate on 
training and coordinating the activities of the navy and the 
revolutionary guards corps 
the joint maneuvers follow the merger of the revolutionary 
guards ministry and the defense ministry which oversees irans 
regular forces earlier this year the two ministries were merged 
to streamline the military chain of command 
lack of coordination between the revolutionary guards and the 
armed forces led to a string of battlefield defeats for iran in the 
eightyear iraniraq war 
the maneuvers which begin sometime in middecember will be the 
first since shamkhani was appointed head of the navy by the 
countrys spiritual leader ali khamenei last month 
the former head rear adm mohammad husseinmalekzadegan was 
abruptly replaced as the head of the 14500man navy 
the iranians held their last naval maneuvers in the persian gulf 
in midoctober 
during those war games iraq accused two iranian gunboats of 
attacking an iraqi tugboat and of killing one crewman 
irans un ambassador kamal kharrazi denied that accusation 
he said two iranian boats had been attacked by an iraqi vessel in 
late october and a crewman taken prisoner 
there has been some disagreement among top iranian leaders on 
what to do about having two separate fighting forces within the 
country 
after his election in july president hashemi rafsanjani said 
the revolutionary guards would be merged with the regular armed 
forces 
but earlier this month khamenei said such a merger would not 
take place 
the merger seems to be limited to the level of administration

discoverys astronauts shut down 
experiments and checked flight control systems saturday as they 
prepared to end their secret military mission with a rare sunday 
night landing in the california desert 
nasa gave no details of the flight but standard procedure for 
the day before a landing would call for commander frederick gregory 
and pilot john blaha to run through a series of tests to make 
certain the shuttles computers and control jets were ready for the 
return to earth 
mission specialists manley carter story musgrave and kathryn 
thornton were expected to pack up the experiments some of which 
were believed to be connected with the star wars spaceborne 
missile defense project while others reportedly tested the 
astronauts capabilities as military observers in space 
mission control in houston broke the official silence on the 
mission thursday to report that discovery would return home on 
sunday landing at 702 pm pst at edwards air force base calif 
just as discovery became the third shuttle in 32 missions to be 
launched after dark it will be the third to land at night the 
spacecraft blazed into orbit wednesday night from cape canaveral 
the national aeronautics and space administration reported 
saturday that conditions at edwards were expected to be acceptable 
for landing with winds gusting from 12 to 20 mph an earlier 
forecast had predicted winds might gust as high as 32 mph 
mission rules dictate that the shuttle not land in crosswinds of 
more than 20 mph but there are several runways to choose from at 
edwards enabling the shuttle to select one that could avoid the 
strongest breezes hitting it broadside 
otherwise conditions were expected to be favorable with 
scattered clouds at 8000 feet and visibility of seven miles 
if the winds interfere the shuttle generally carries enough 
food fuel and other supplies to stay up at least two days beyond 
the target landing date 
the edwards air force base which has been host to as many as 
half a million people for shuttle landings will be closed to the 
public sunday because of the military nature of the flight 
the news blackout was imposed by the defense department which 
wants to keep the flights goals a secret however sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity reported earlier the astronauts had 
achieved their main task on thursday when they deployed a 2ton 
spy satellite to gather military intelligence over much of the 
soviet union europe africa and the middle east 
the next shuttle flight is set for dec 18 when columbia is due 
to lift off here for a 10day christmastime flight during which 
the fivemember crew will release a communications satellite and 
retrieve a scientific satellite

president elias hrawi declared the 
cabinet of the rebellious army chief gen michel aoun dissolved 
saturday and named a new government to end 14 years of civil war 
his predeccesor slain after 17 days in office was buried 
in a rare display of national unity businesses in both moslem 
and christian areas closed for a nationwide day of mourning for 
rene mouawad killed by a bomb wednesday 
church bells rang and bands struck slow drum beats as his 
flagdraped coffin inched through crowds in mouawads hometown of 
zgorta his widow nayla and daughter rima and son michel walked 
sobbing behind the cortege 
weeping women tossed roses and waved from balconies 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual head of the maronite 
community presided over the service and papal nuncio paolo ponte 
read a message from pope john paul ii saying the pontiff was 
praying for lebanons salvation 
a 21gun salute was fired as the coffin was put into a crypt at 
st marys church where it will remain until completion of a tomb 
at the cemetery 
aoun said hrawis election friday was as unconstitutional as 
that of mouawad both have been elected under syrian occupation 
they should have waited to find out who killed mouawad before 
appointing a new president he said in a statement 
no one has claimed responsibility for mouawads assassination 
hrawi put himself on a collision course with aoun by dismissing 
the generals military cabinet before dawn and forming a national 
unity government with members from lebanons seven major sects 
the new government under sunni moslem prime minister salim 
hoss is to oversee implementation of an arab leaguebrokered plan 
to introduce political reforms aimed at ending the civil war which 
has killed more than 150000 people 
aoun rejects the accord which was approved by parliamentarians 
in october and which cleared the way for mouawads election nov 5 
the military general said the plan is unacceptable because it does 
not provide a timetable for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops 
from lebanon 
mouawad 64 and 23 other people were killed wednesday by a 
remotecontrolled bomb in moslem west beirut 
it was not clear how hrawi and hoss would go about removing aoun 
to head off final partition of the country aoun commands the 
loyalty of a cohesive army of about 20000 that stands as the 
nations mightiest fighting machine 
but his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the syrians 
whose soldiers control 70 percent of lebanese territory under a 
1976 arab league mandate to quell civil war fighting 
staterun television in beirut said hrawi hoss and defense 
minister albert mansour were meeting possibly to discuss dismissing 
aoun and appointing a new army commander 
aoun is holding out with his troops in the countrys christian 
enclave comprising east beirut and land to the north he said his 
cabinet is lebanons only legitimate government 
the 54yearold soldier a maronite christian like hrawi was 
named to head an interim cabinet by outgoing president amin gemayel 
on sept 22 1988 because parliament was unable to agree on a new 
president 
lebanon had been without a president since then until 
parliamentarians approved the peace plan and then elected mouawad 
hoss whom mouawad selected to be prime minister also was named 
prime minister by hrawi in addition to foreign minister 
he retained druse warlord walid jumblatt as public works 
minister and shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri as 
minister of electrical and water resources berri also was given 
the housing and cooperatives portfolio 
jumblatt and berri are syrias main allies in lebanon they 
fielded the largest moslem militias in the war against the 
christians 
michel sassine a greek orthdox offered the position of deputy 
premier and labor minister turned down the post and flew to paris 
without explaining why staterun television in beirut reported 
hoss introduced george saadeh leader of the rightwing phalange 
party lebanons largest christian political force into the new 
government as minister of post and telecommunications 
saadeh a maronite based in the christian enclave controlled by 
aouns army said his participation must first be approved by his 
partys politburo 
also saturday israeli jets blasted palestinian targets in 
eastern lebanon for the second time in three days wounding two 
guerrillas in the 16th such air raid on the country this year 
the target was a bekaa base of ahmed jibrils popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
police said at least two pflpgc fighters were wounded as two 
fighterbombers fired six rockets into the base in two runs at 
1050 am

communist party chief egon krenz made a 
campaignstyle visit saturday to the opposition stronghold of 
leipzig in his latest effort to portray himself as a popular 
reformer and survive a crucial party congress 
a communist party newspaper said some of the leadership under 
erich honecker who was ousted oct 18 may be prosecuted for 
corruption 
hundreds of thousands of east germans headed to west berlin and 
west germany for more shopping the third weekend of their new 
freedom to travel one of several reforms since krenz took over 
parliament speaker guenther maleuda said in an interview 
published by the youth newspaper junge welt that parliamentary 
elections could come as early as autumn 1990 if a new election law 
is passed 
krenzs leipzig visit broadcast on state tv was another 
attempt to disassociate himself from his mentors hardline 
policies and present himself as a populist tv footage showed him 
surrounded by workers and shoppers in what seemed like a campaign 
stop 
i dont think socialism is kaput krenz said i think the 
disfigurements of socialism are kaput 
citizens grilled him about the countrys moribund economy and 
the governments sincerity in dealing with corruption 
come down on mondays and talk to us said one young man in 
the city where hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets 
each monday then things will get better in leipzig 
krenz praised leipzig for giving many impulses to the 
current promises of reforms 
opposition leaders say krenzs past in honeckers inner circle 
will continue to block his efforts to gain popular support the tv 
report on krenzs tour appeared aimed at boosting the leaders 
image at a time of little trust or sympathy with communist party 
stalwarts 
krenz reportedly faces strong opposition to his continued 
leadership within the party now split on how to proceed with 
reforms he has admitted that he could be replaced at next months 
party congress 
on saturday the communists daily newspaper neues deutschland 
said members of honeckers government could be prosecuted for cases 
of misuse of power corruption and personal enrichment 
honecker himself is the target of a party disciplinary 
proceeding and one of his top lieutenants was stripped of his 
membership 
the newspaper said party disciplinary proceedings were under way 
or planned against other former officials it did not mention names 
those who have made themselves guilty will be brought to 
accountability by the party and where necessary by judicial 
officials and other agencies both in criminal and disciplinary 
proceedings the newspaper quoted chief party investigator werner 
eberlein as saying 
in hamburg the bild am sonntag quoted opposition leader 
wolfgang schnur as proposing west german president richard von 
weizsaecker as the head of state for both german nations in a step 
toward possible reunification 
schnur is a member of the democratic awakening which is smaller 
and generally considered more conservative than the better known 
new forum opposition group 
the official adn news agency said an east berlin policeman 
sentenced to jail on charges of injuring a prodemocracy protester 
was placed back on the force on suspended duty 
the move by police chief friedhelm rausch followed a court 
ruling friday that found the policeman guilty of pushing a 
demonstrator down stairs after an oct 7 rally the court sentenced 
him to 14 months in prison but an appeal is expected 
rausch was quoted as saying the policeman was reinstated because 
the court used his dismissal after the incident as proof of guilt

more than 1000 whites 
received a thunderous welcome saturday when they staged an 
unprecedented march into a black township and joined residents in 
calling for an end to apartheid 
the march of hope began saturday morning outside a hospital 
in the southern coastal city of port elizabeth and proceeded three 
miles to the new brighton township growing in numbers along the 
way 
when the whites including children and senior citizens reached 
the township they were loudly cheered by an estimated 50000 black 
residents who filled the streets some youths climbed on rooftops 
to get a view of the visitors 
the spontaneous welcome was amazing said flip potgieter a 
city councilman in port elizabeth this was an amazing 
experience 
you must take this message to your homes and help forge this 
unity which will take us to a new nonracial democratic south 
africa said michael xhego a black antiapartheid leader we 
hope the whole country will learn from this march and follow suit 
new brightons assembly hall was packed and tens of thousands 
stood outside to hear whites express solidarity with blacks in 
seeking an end to apartheid south africas system of legalized 
race segregation 
this shows that good will exists in port elizabeth and that 
not all whites support apartheid said ronnie van wyk a lecturer 
at the university of port elizabeth 
few south african whites visit the countrys black residential 
areas and saturdays demonstration marked the first organized 
march by white citizens into a township police kept a low profile 
and no incidents were reported 
elsewhere four recently released african national congress 
leaders and several hundred supporters were teargassed in the 
black homeland of transkei 
the four had arrived hours earlier in the homeland capital of 
umtata and were warmly welcomed by several thousand supporters at 
the airport 
however police fired tear gas into a packed anglican church 
when the four men were preparing to give speeches 
the reason for the police action was not immediately clear 
i believe these policemen acted on their own crazy 
initiative said the rev s qanjule 
the police are under the control of the nominally independent 
government in the homeland not the whiteled south african 
government 
the homelands military leader gen bantu holomisa has said 
the anc leaders were welcome in transkei and he was scheduled to 
appear with them at a rally sunday 
the anc members walter sisulu elias motsoaledi wilton mkwayi 
and andrew malengeni were not hurt in the incident the four were 
among seven anc leaders freed from prison oct 15 in what was seen 
as a trial run for the release of nelson mandela the countrys 
best known black leader 
south african president fw de klerk said in september that the 
government would no longer break up lawful demonstrations and 
since then there have been dozens of peaceful antigovernment 
marches throughout the country 
the decision to allow protests is part of de klerks larger 
effort to reduce racial conflict in south africa in his latest 
move he announced friday that four neighborhoods around the 
country would be open to all races easing a 39yearold policy of 
strict residential segregation 
earlier this month de klerk declared beaches open to all races 
and called for repeal of the separate amenities act which allows 
segregation of many public facilities 
he says he seeks an end to all discriminatory laws but also 
promises to maintain segregated schools and neighborhoods for 
whites who want them

southern california bug experts again are 
marshaling their toughest weapons pesticides traps and swarms 
of sterile flies to put down a menacing mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation 
at stake in the medfly war is a big chunk of californias 16 
billion annual agricultural production farmrelated jobs and the 
availability and affordability of a variety of produce to consumers 
nationwide 
the battlefield for now is a 156squaremile crescent of los 
angeles suburbs from the northern san fernando valley to the orange 
county community of brea 25 miles southeast of downtown los 
angeles 
they are fighting the flies with pesticidespraying helicopters 
quarantines millions of sterile medflies thousands of fly traps 
and an army of workers to check traps remove infested fruit 
release the swarms of steriles and deliver spraying notices 
officials hope the millions of sterile male medflies will mate 
with fertile females preventing them from laying fertile eggs 
the cost of the battle has reached 10 million but the cost of 
losing the war and allowing the fly to become established is 
incalculable in a state where road signs proudly claim agriculture 
as its no 1 industry 
it would make california kind of an international pariah a 
lot of other countries and states would slap quarantines on us 
said veda federighi a spokeswoman for the state department of food 
and agriculture 
it would not be out of line to say it would destroy the soft 
fruit industry in california she said vegetable growers and 
nursery operators would also be affected 
the state has faced off with the medfly before in 1981 
california spent about 100 million to eradicate a statewide 
infestation that destroyed 100 million in crops 
the enemy is smaller than a housefly and has dark blue eyes a 
glistening black thorax with yellowish bands a yellowish abdomen 
crossed by silvery bands and droopy wings banded and blotched with 
yellow brown and black 
native to africa but now thriving in subtropical regions around 
the globe the medfly lives only about three weeks to a month a 
female however can lay up to 300 eggs during a lifetime 
the eggs which can be laid in 250 kinds of fruits and 
vegetables develop into maggots that feed on the pulp around them 
a stricken fruit spoils and falls to the ground allowing the 
larvae to enter the soil about eight days later they emerge from 
the ground as adult flies sexual maturity occurs after four or 
five more days 
the first medfly of the current siege was discovered in los 
angeles county on july 20 that find and later ones triggered 
quarantines aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion releases 
of millions of sterile flies clearing of fruit from backyard trees 
and application of pesticide on soil where infested fruit was found 
disturbingly trapping has continued to turn up fertile medflies 
as supply lines to the battlefield have grown long and thin 
to prevent breeding sterile flies must be released by the 
millions each week for two generations after a zone is sprayed with 
malathion now the demand for sterile flies exceeds the output of a 
laboratory in hawaii that produces them the result has been orders 
to send up helicopters to give a second dose of malathion to areas 
that dont get sterile flies 
authorities contend that the finds are not one big infestation 
but a series of isolated outbreaks caused by quarantine violations 
commercial smuggling of fruit from mexico and mailing of produce 
from other countries 
however roy cunningham the leading entomologist on the states 
medfly advisory panel called the situation grave this month and 
said the attitude is that we are going to have to treat this as 
one huge area 
los angeles county agriculture commissioner leon spaugy 
continues to believe the outbreaks were localized but the debate 
and possibility of more generalized pesticide spraying has fanned 
opposition efforts 
the malathion is mixed with a corn syrup bait that can mar the 
finish of cars left uncovered during the latenight sprayings 
whats worse opponents say is that spraying poison into the air 
over cities could be a health risk 
health authorities have long held that malathion delivered in 
small amounts 24 ounces per acre is the standard amount 
according to the state agriculture department is not a risk 
others are not convinced 
los angeles city councilman richard alatorre whose district has 
an infestation recently said in a letter to food and agriculture 
director henry voss that it was clear malathion is itself of 
questionable safety to the health of humans exposed to it 
and mayor pat reichenberger of suburban monterey park plans to 
ask the city council there to endorse a resolution demanding gov 
george deukmejian prohibit malathion spraying because of unknown 
longterm health risks

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
looking back on his work for lincoln savings and loan association 
says he doesnt believe he could have foreseen the thrifts 
spectacular failure expected to be the costliest in the nations 
history 
nearly five years ago greenspan testified before congress as a 
private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of lincoln and 
its owner phoenix ariz millionaire charles h keating jr 
keating objected to federal regulations restricting thrift 
institutions direct investments in real estate development 
greenspan a conservative economist generally opposed to government 
meddling in business supported him 
in an interview last week greenspan said he was surprised and 
distressed by lincolns eventual failure because of sour real 
estate deals but he said he still supports shortterm direct 
investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks 
supporters of direct investments have long argued that they can 
benefit sampls struggling with a portfolio of longterm mortgages 
i look back and i say to myself was there something i should 
have seen and didnt see and the answer is there was nothing 
visible at least to me greenspan said 
in early 1985 irvine califbased lincoln was a fastgrowing 
institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional 
homemortgage lending greenspan was a private economist with 
impressive political credentials as president fords chief economic 
adviser a decade earlier 
now lincoln is insolvent and under government control 
regulators say it will cost taxpayers 2 billion to protect its 
depositors making it the nations largest sampl failure 
greenspan is no longer a private consultant and suddenly his 
fiveyearold statements loom large as chairman of the federal 
reserve board he is considered by many to be after the president 
the most powerful official in the nation the fed influences daily 
life perhaps more than any other government agency through its 
manipulation of the economy and credit 
in a feb 13 1985 letter to the federal home loan bank of san 
francisco greenspan argued that lincoln deserved an exemption from 
regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts direct investment in 
real estate and other commercial ventures 
lincolns management he said was seasoned and expert in 
selecting and making direct investments with a long and 
continuous track record of outstanding success the institution 
itself was financially strong in a vibrant and healthy 
state and presented no foreseeable risk to the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp he said 
two weeks later on feb 27 1985 greenspan told the house 
government operations subcommittee on consumer commerce and 
monetary affairs that direct investments while undoubtedly risky 
were essential for thrifts to diversify their holdings 
traditional sampls which took in shortterm deposits and made 
longterm mortgage loans were vulnerable to a sharp rise in 
interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative 
he said 
he also endorsed a study by economist george bentsen now with 
emory university which cited the success of 17 sampls in direct 
investments fifteen of the 17 have since failed 
it was my view then as it is now that interest rate risk was 
the crucial problem confronting sampls the problem of longterm 
assets financed by shortterm deposits in that particular context 
at that particular time direct investment would reduce risk he 
said 
greenspan still believes bentsen took a rather sensible 
statistical approach but he points out that most of the 17 sampls 
cited in his study were located in texas later the center of the 
oil and real estate bust 
the central bank chairmans views have been cited as one of the 
reasons why a petition calling on sampl regulators to postpone 
direct investment limits attracted 225 signatures in the house in 
early 1985 
it is also being cited as a reason why two years later five 
senators decided to intervene with sampl regulators after keating 
complained about their efforts to examine lincolns finances 
the five alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz 
donald w riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and john mccain 
rariz met with the regulators in april 1987 
two of them cranston and mccain said greenspans views on 
lincolns health heavily influenced their thinking 
the problem as conveyed to me at the time not only by mr 
keating but also by mr greenspan and arthur young amp co an 
accounting firm was that federal examiners bore substantial 
responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state 
of limbo for this institution cranston told the senate ethics 
committee in a nov 16 letter 
greenspan said he does not understand why the senators cite his 
opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after it was given 
you do not rely on a 2yearold letter unless you call the 
guy who wrote it no one ever called me he said 
greenspan as president of townsend greenspan amp co was hired 
to review lincolns condition by the new york law firm of paul 
weiss rifkind wharton amp garrison he said he could not remember 
how much he was paid for his work but said he charged his usual 
hourly rate 
the partners of the law firm he said were longtime trusted 
associates they certainly never gave me the slightest impression 
that these were other than good people at lincoln 
greenspan said he recalls meeting keating himself two or three 
times but never for a detailed analytical discussion the people 
working under keating frankly i found fairly impressive he 
said

an state prison inmate whose sentence was 
to have expired saturday was the first to be charged because of two 
nights of riots last month in which 123 guards and inmates were 
injured police said 
state police at harrisburg said more arrests were pending in 
connection with the violence at camp hill state prison but they 
would not give specifics on when or how many 
william diggs 25 was arraigned friday at the prison on charges 
of riot kidnapping assault by prisoner criminal attempt to arson 
and making terroristic threats bond was set at 500000 
inmates seized control of the mediumsecurity prison oct 25 and 
26 terrorizing guards taking several hostages and setting fire to 
many of the buildings in the 52acre compound 
the riots caused 15 million in damages gov robert p casey 
suspended one prison official and has ordered a complete 
investigation into claims that locks broken on the first night were 
not fixed allowing inmates to pop cell doors open for the second 
night of rioting 
no details of the charges against diggs were released and 
authorities stopped short of calling him a ringleader in the 
rioting 
cumberland county district attorney j michael eakin issued a 
statement saying diggs sentence on a previous offense was to 
expire saturday and police wanted to file the charges before he was 
released from prison 
the timing of these charges relates to the defendants 
impending release from custody and should not be construed as 
indicative of greater complicity than that alleged in the 
charges the statement said 
diggs was serving 3 to 6 years on a conviction for robbery and 
conspiracy in philadelphia 
eakin said the criminal investigation is continuing we will 
begin filing charges for the majority of incidents in several 
weeks he said 
kenneth robinson press secretary for the department of 
corrections was out of town and could not be reached for comment

americans of czechoslovakian heritage were mostly cheered by the 
political changes taking place in the eastern european nation but 
many of them tempered their feelings with skepticism 
boy this is great if its for real said glenn w 
zajicek former mayor of wilber the selfprofessed czech capital 
of nebraska 
i have to see it to believe it said dolores pavlik who 
lives at the notre dame convent in omaha neb 
the hardline communist party leadership in czechoslovakia 
resigned friday forced from power by a week of huge prodemocracy 
protests but the new government is dominated by officials who also 
served the previous regime 
we have to watch the members of that new politburo to see 
what direction they will take said jan vaculik editor of a 
czechlanguage newspaper in the small central texas town of west 
vaculik who left czechoslovakia a month after the soviet 
invasion in 1968 said the change isnt yet as sweeping as what has 
happened in east germany but he said im excited at least that 
these guys are gone i always feared that they may turn violent 
against the people 
one of the speakers at rallies in czechoslovakia was alexander 
dubcek the reformist former party leader ousted in 1968 when 
soviet troops invaded in the teens dubceks father had immigrated 
to the united states but he returned home after spending 14 months 
in an internment camp in texas for refusing to serve in the 
military dubcek was born in 1921 after his father returned home 
in chicago dagmar herrmann a czechoslovakianborn translator 
who left her homeland in 1965 said saturday she visited there 
several times this year on business and felt this months upheaval 
truly was unexpected 
they must have been as astonished as we were here herrmann 
said nothing was truly planned the same way it had been in 
poland czechoslovakia doesnt have anything like solidarity it 
doesnt have opposition parties the same as hungary had 
the czechs are not truly people with their blood boiling they 
are quite stoic she said 
a woman who fled czechoslovakia with her husband in 1949 and 
settled in nebraska told the omaha worldherald on friday that she 
didnt believe reformers in the czechoslovak communist party can be 
trusted 
i dont trust communists she said they lie like its 
nothing 
the woman said she didnt want to be identified for fear of 
retaliation against her mother and two sisters who still live in 
czechoslovakia she hasnt seen them in 40 years 
were scared were scared for our people over there she 
said 
irma ourecky director of the czech musuem in wilber neb was 
more optimistic no one really knows she said but it seems 
like with the berlin wall down now things will be different 
in granger texas a town about 80 miles south of west that is 
also predominantly czech residents also are watching events 
overseas 
it looks like they might finally get some freedom but its 
hard to judge said jannine lalla who visited czechoslovakia 11 
years ago theyre a complicated outfit over there the people 
are so nice but they are afraid 
joe vrabel of granger publishes nasinec a 75year old 
czechlanguage weekly newspaper but has never sold the paper to 
residents in czechslovakia he hopes the changes prodemocracy 
demonstrators seek will make it easier for him to do so 
i never thought it would be free there again he said 
friday ive been thinking just today about selling the paper 
in czechoslovakia

a home for aids victims that was allowed 
to open only after a federal court battle with the city has closed 
after less than 2 months because of financial problems and public 
ill will its chairman says 
keith thomas chairman of the our place board of directors and a 
volunteer at the house said the board voted unanimously nov 18 to 
close the home 
our place was intended to house up to seven men at least two 
aids victims lived there until their deaths 
the house was shut down officially last weekend thomas 
said we voted to shut it down because of the ill feelings from 
the public toward the home the missappropriation of funds and 
inhouse fighting between anna berry and charles baxter 
but ms berry former administrator of the home said friday 
that our place was closed because of a lack of funds adding that 
she got along well with baxter who founded our place 
the reason the board decided to dissolve our place was there 
was not enough money to keep it going she said charles and i 
were not fighting 
thomas said he began working as a volunteer when the home opened 
to balance the books and help residents 
the money was not spent the way it was intended to be spent 
when it was donated thomas said i was a volunteer trying to 
set up the books i know there was mismanagement 
baxter a nurses aide with no previous experience running a 
boarding house battled with city officials for several months for 
permission to open the house he filed suit and us district judge 
william stiehl ordered the city to grant him a permit ruling that 
the denial of a permit violated the fair housing act 
irrational hysteria and public panic cannot support activity 
that is clearly discriminatory the judge wrote 
baxter got the permit sept 5 and the home opened sept 10 
baxter said the downtown building that he chose for our place 
was ideal because it had a hospice next door a hospital down the 
street and a doctors office in the back 
city officials had argued that the home was too close to a 
junior high school and was in a tooheavily traveled part of town 
other concerns included that it would cause property values to 
decline and people to avoid the area 
thomas said the board made up of professionals including a 
psychologist hopes to open another home for people with aids 
there was no comment from baxter there was no reply saturday to 
a message left on an answering machine at a listing for him in 
belleville someone who answered the phone at ms berrys home said 
she was not there

sunday because of weatherrelated damage to the craft that will 
take months to repair 
im terribly sorry but were not going to be able to take 
off a dejected richard branson said as the balloon was being 
deflated behind him changing from a towering shimmering mass into 
a limp rag the size of a baseball field

parts of the balloon to the ground when it was laid out friday 
night and when it was inflated saturday night the fabric ripped 
the two planned to make a 6200mile flight across the pacific 
and land on the west coast of the united states early this week 
they had hoped to take off early sunday after winds forced them 
to call off a launch friday night 
local officials in this town on the southern japanese island of 
kyushu had to scrap a special fireworks show they had planned for 
fridays launch and the cancellation sent hundreds of disappointed 
townspeople walking back down a 15milelong hill they had climbed 
to the launchpad 
branson founder of virgin atlantic airways and the virgin music 
group already holds the distance record for hotair ballooning for 
a trip he and lindstrand made across the atlantic ocean in 1987 
that trip almost ended in disaster when the huge craft flew out of 
control and crashed into the sea off scotland 
branson said the repair work on the new balloon will take 
months but we will be back in january or february and i hope 
that time we have better luck he said

allegheny county officials have decided not to 
set up a nativity scene surrounded by reindeer and santa claus 
even though the us supreme court says a secular display is 
permissible 
the supreme court ruled in july that the countys traditional 
nativity scene crossed the constitutional boundary between church 
and state but the court upheld the city of pittsburghs right to 
display a jewish menorah which stood alongside a christmas tree in 
the citycounty building 
the supreme court said placing secular items around the nativity 
scene would make the display acceptable 
given that choice the county chose to not display the creche at 
all 
you have to ask yourself how much do you want to junk it up 
then who do you offend said maura minteer manager of the 
countys bureau of cultural programs do you put in a reindeer 
and a blue smurf id just as soon not do it 
as in past years the county will erect a 12foot christmas tree 
in the courthouse wednesday along with wreaths and poinsettias 
ms minteer said 
meanwhile a jewish group in the pittsburgh area is asking the 
city to reconsider its decision not to place a menorah on the steps 
of the citycounty building this year the menorah marks the 
celebration of hanukkah which begins at sundown dec 22 and lasts 
eight days 
pittsburgh solicitor dan pellegrini said the city agreed not to 
display the menorah if the county could not place the creche in the 
courthouse 
the group chabad which began erecting the menorah in 1980 
since has held talks with mayor sophie masloffs office charles 
saul attorney for chabad said he last met with city officials 
nov 13 and is awaiting a decision 
we consider this a freespeech issue and the menorah is a 
symbol of free speech saul said that area is a public forum 
and if they permit other forms of free speech they ought to permit 
this as well 
the supreme court decision stemmed from a 1986 lawsuit filed by 
the american civil liberties union and several city residents who 
objected to the nativity display and the menorah 
the holy name society a catholic organization that owns the 
creche also doesnt want to see the display surrounded by secular 
items 
the society is working with county commissioner lawrence dunn to 
find an alternate downtown location for the creche

the communist leadership on saturday 
dismantled a police squad that cracked down on human rights 
activists and political opponents the state bta news agency 
reported 
it was the latest in a series of reforms since the communists 
replaced hardline chief todor zhivkov on nov 10 and joined the 
change that has washed over every warsaw pact nation except romania 
the decision came one week after 50000 bulgarians in the 
largest protest since bulgaria became a communist nation rallied 
for more democracy free elections respect of human rights and an 
end to 45 years of police repression 
interior minister georgi tanev after a meeting with new party 
leader petar mladenov took away a number of functions from the 
police ideological department and made assignments to other state 
and public institutions in the spirit of the deep democratic 
changes in bulgaria bta said 
the activity of the ideological department will be transformed 
toward protection of the constitutional order and the rights and 
freedoms of the citizens bta quoted tanev as saying 
while tanev did not elaborate he said the structure of the 
ministry would be simplified and its staff reduced 
in the past mistakes have been made there has been an 
inclination toward actions based on force at the expense of 
dialogue bta said 
bta described the police unit as responsible for cracking down 
on ideological diversion and human rights activists until nov 
17 when parliament scrapped it bulgaria had a law forbidding 
dissent 
last week bulgarias new reformminded leadership set up a 
commission to investigate alleged corruption under zhivkov 
zhivkov who had been in power for 35 years has been accused of 
living in luxury at the expense of the people and at recent 
rallies protesters demanded he be prosecuted

with 16000 members the 
czechoslovak socialist party is dwarfed by the 17 million 
communist cardholders 
for most of the past four decades since the communist takeover 
the socialists have been docile junior partners who carefully toed 
the line of the ruling party and even accepted its leading role in 
their statutes 
but with the ruling party in disarray following a week of huge 
prodemocracy demonstrations they are beginning to flex their 
muscles 
last week they issued what a senior party official called a 
declaration of independence printed in the party newspaper 
svobodne slova or free word 
it was a formal and forceful defense of freedom of opinion and a 
plea for an open dialogue about the future of this country it 
was published three days after police clubbed students peacefully 
demonstrating on nov 17 
the crackdown triggered a wave of huge protest demonstrations 
that eventually brought a shakeup in the communist leadership at 
the same time the socialists prestige soared 
since the declaration was published monday speakers at the 
protest rallies have addressed the hundreds of thousands of 
demonstrators in wenceslas square from the party newspaper building 
along the square 
you may call that statement a declaration of independence 
dr jiri vyvadil head of the socialist faction in the czechoslovak 
federal parliament told the associated press now we have become 
a real party 
vyvadil 35 portrays his party as left of center and said it 
has close contacts with the east german liberal democratic party 
that also has increasingly distanced itself from the communists 
we dont want to be heroes he said but the situation 
demands it 
he said his party wants to be a party of national 
reconciliation and wants a consensus with the communists but 
at this moment that is difficult 
our partners accused us of heating up the situation with our 
statement he said but if they had joined us in our approach 
things would be quiet again by now 
the czech people do not like barricades and heroic deeds he 
said we are all a bit conservative against change 
the change in the socialist partys stance did not come 
overnight 
party chief jan skoda who joined opposition speakers at a 
protest rally last week came out in may with a startling call for 
genuine political pluralism and for guarantees of civil rights 
without substantial progress in the democratization of 
political social and economic life we shall not manage to gain 
the citizens support for changes he said in a speech that 
anticipated the popular proreform tide 
a new party platform reflecting the new approach is nearing 
completion it is to cover a wide list of points ranging from a 
call for a stronger parliament to a project for a constitutional 
court 
will the party also call for free secret elections 
of course vyvadil said we would like to resume this 
tradition the country knew under tomas masaryk the first 
president of independent czechoslovakia 
but i am not sure that we will have as many candidates as we 
will need he added in a reference to his partys growing 
popularity

parents in one family are collecting 
pictures to send to a daughter they have yet to meet a father in 
another home 65 miles away copes with the devastating news he had a 
daughter he will never meet 
the players in the drama that intertwined two families and one 
little girl are ernest and regina twigg of sebring and robert mays 
of sarasota and the girl he raised kimberly 
the twiggs and mays discovered last sunday that they raised each 
others child kimberly and another girl arlena were born in 1978 
in a florida hospital swapped and each given to the wrong family 
arlena twigg mays biological daughter died last year of heart 
disease long before he learned of the swap they never met 
i feel a sense of loss mays said last week just what i 
lost is hard to say obviously ive lost a daughter but i didnt 
know the little girl i dont have a personality to remember or a 
face to remember or anything like that 
i really feel like i had two daughters one lived and one 
died 
mays a 44yearold roofing contractor raised kimberly who 
will celebrate her 11th birthday wednesday 
genetic testing showed that kimberly was really born to the 
twiggs parents of seven other children 
the child the twiggs named arlena and reared as their own was 
the daughter of mays and his late wife barbara who died of cancer 
in 1981 
both families say a switch occurred at hardee memorial hospital 
in wauchula but they have no idea how the mays baby was born on 
nov 29 and the twigg baby on dec 2 1978 
the twiggs are suing the hospital and mays is considering it 
officials at the hospital have refused to comment on the issue 
just before arlena died in pennsylvania in august 1988 the 
twiggs discovered through genetic testing she was not related to 
either of them 
after her death they began a 14month search for their missing 
daughter 
it brought them to kimberly michelle mays the only other white 
girl in the nursery at the rural florida hospital at the same time 
the twiggs waged a custody battle in court as mays resisted 
genetic testing he sought the expertise of child pschologists who 
advised against it 
this fall the twiggs moved their family back to central florida 
to be closer to kimberly twigg whose children range in age from 6 
to 21 got back his old job as an amtrak ticket agent in sebring 
finally in late october they broke the impasse by signing an 
agreement renouncing any claim on kimberly no matter whose child 
she was but they wanted visitation privileges and promised to let 
psychologists for both sides interview the girl and suggest a 
schedule 
on nov 17 results of sophisticated series of bloodprotein 
tests were returned from johns hopkins medical center in baltimore 
the tests which analyze genes determined with a 999 percent 
certainty that kimberly was a twigg and with a 989 percent 
certainty that arlena was a mays 
both families shared their feelings publicly last week through 
tears tears of joy for the twiggs that they had found their lost 
daughter and tears of pain for mays who had to explain to his only 
child she wasnt his biological daughter 
mays spoke wednesday about the trauma of telling kimberly 
she cried and cried and cried for a long time he said then 
she asked what it meant about their relationship 
he said he assured her honey youll always be my daughter 
and told her nothing would change 
i hope desperately we can continue to have the relationship 
and the happiness weve shared he said in an interview later 
i was perfectly happy with our life prior to this and i think 
she was too i told her that it had no significance in our life 
whatsoever 
the twiggs want their first meeting with kimberly to be special 
they plan to send family pictures first then perhaps meet with her 
alone without their other children 
well take it slow mrs twigg said 
mays wont talk about his own hurt ill have the rest of my 
life to sort out my feelings as to what happened said mays 
he wants to know where arlena is buried his attorney has asked 
the twiggs lawyer for the location of the grave he said hell 
visit the site as soon as he can

while the city is trying to rebuild 
following the devastating october earthquake a courtordered 
change in how the city council is elected will shake up municipal 
leadership 
the dec 5 election will mark a switch from atlarge to district 
elections mandated by a federal court to give hispanics fair 
representation on the city council 
when we look back 10 or 15 years from now and we see 
significant hispanic participation in voting watsonville will be 
seen as a catalyst for that change said joaquin avila the 
attorney who represented the mexicanamerican legal defense and 
education fund in the lawsuit 
the lawsuit filed by the fund in 1985 on behalf of three 
plaintiffs alleged the atlarge system discriminated against 
hispanics although about half the city of 30000 was hispanic 
until then no hispanic had ever been elected to the council the 
lawsuit was one of many filed by members of minority groups seeking 
to overturn atlarge voting in cities across the country 
earlier this year the us supreme court rejected the citys 
attempt to overturn an appeals courts order to create district 
voting 
the election originally scheduled for may 9 was postponed 
until nov 7 to allow time to develop the district plan after the 
oct 17 earthquake the election was postponed again the disaster 
destroyed more than 300 homes and damaged 1900 and displaced 
dozens of businesses in the town 95 miles south of san francisco 
sixteen candidates five of them hispanic are vying for seven 
seats on the new council which will choose a mayor from among the 
council members and work with the more powerful city manager three 
incumbents are seeking reelection 
housing and development big issues last spring have become 
even bigger since the earthquake with 135 families still living in 
tents or shelters and many more staying with friends or relatives 
councilman tony campos a wealthy real estate agent who 
inspected many of the cracked buildings last week estimated damage 
at 179 million to businesses and 165 million to homeowners 
earlier official estimates put the total damage in the city at 112 
million 
the most important business downtown fords built in 1852 and 
the oldest department store in california succumbed to a wrecking 
ball last week 
fords a 40 million company that also lost two other stores in 
the quake hasnt decided yet whether to rebuild a big store in 
watsonville 
that decision and many others that businesses must make 
depends largely on the availability of financing and the speed with 
which the city can put together a recovery plan and obtain federal 
and state help 
were going to have to have people who can make decisions 
said campos who became the first hispanic council member in 1987 
were in trouble right now the earthquake was bad enough if we 
lose these businesses the economic aftershocks will cripple 
watsonville completely 
mayor betty murphy who is running against campos in district 6 
dismisses the notion that the city which sits in the center of a 
rich agricultural area could be headed for oblivion 
this is a very strong personal and old community she said 
it wont be any ghost town but it is going to be difficult 
campos and murphy are stressing the need for experience and 
continuity on the new council arguing that an inexperienced 
council can slow recovery 
campos opposed the voting rights suit 
if the elections would have been left the way they were you 
would probably have four or five hispanics on the city council if 
not this year then within the next twoyear term he said one 
of the worst things they did was file this lawsuit its pitting 
two incumbents campos and murphy against each other and causing 
some friction in the community 
cruz gomez a candidate in district 1 is among those calling 
for change especially in regard to the attention paid to poorer 
hispanic residents 
gomez opposes reelecting campos and the candidacy of another 
hispanic saying they dont represent poor hispanics 
we have to go by issues and action and not by skin color or 
origin she said

defense secretary dick cheney said the united 
states must maintain naval superiority and modernize strategic 
nuclear weapons implying budget cuts might hit the army hardest 
the los angeles times said saturday 
in an interview in washington on friday cheney suggested that 
the job of maintaining ground forces in europe could be left to 
north atlantic treaty organization allies the times said 
cheney who emphasized that the nato balance would not be 
changed unilaterally by the united states said one scenario would 
have the allies take the main role of ground defense while the us 
upgrades naval and air forces in the alliance 
should the us as some have suggested take on a role that 
emphasizes more heavily the us obligation in the naval area and 
in air supremacy and places a greater emphasis with our allies in 
terms of the ground combat role in europe cheney asked all of 
those issues it seems to me are up for grabs 
he also said the us is now and will want to continue to be 
the preeminent naval power in the world even as the nations 
overall defense budget is subjected to cuts 
cheney also said were going to want to preserve our strategic 
nuclear capability adding that preservation of adequate 
conventional forces would be another demand 
the secretary said he remained skeptical about reforms in the 
soviet union 
i still think vigilance is the order of the day he said 
i still think we have to be very cautious about assuming that mr 
mikhail gorbachev will be successful or assuming that his 
successors will be more like him than like conventional soviet 
leaders brezhnev khrushchev stalin etc

states are pushing for more 
lowlevel radioactive waste dumps than the nation needs or probably 
can afford according to a federal report to congress 
the office of technology assistance which reviews scientific 
matters for congress concluded that too many lowlevel radioactive 
waste sites have been proposed at a time when less and less of that 
waste is being produced 
the report is expected to bolster the arguments of opponents to 
radioactive waste sites proposed in such states as michigan north 
carolina and new york 
the problem is there is an incredible reduction in the volume 
of waste weve had and it looks like its going to continue 
said gretchen mccabe of the agency who coordinated the study 
from a costperunit standpoint were estimating huge cost 
increases 
utilities and industries in 1988 created 55 percent less 
lowlevel radioactive waste than in 1980 and the amount will 
decrease by half again before 1993 the ota report predicted 
more than a dozen disposal sites including one in michigan are 
proposed to take the waste now handled at three sites 
the report given to congress last week during its hectic push 
to wrap up business before the holidays doesnt specify exactly 
how many radioactive waste disposal sites the nation needs 
frankly its a huge political game so there really isnt an 
optimal number mccabe said in a telephone interview friday from 
her home in washington dc 
at least some of the proposed sites will cost more than 10 times 
the current amount to run because there is not enough radioactive 
waste to support them mccabe said disposal costs now average 35 
to 45 per cubic foot to handle 10000 cubic feet of waste a year 
she said 
south carolina washington and nevada now have the only 
operating disposal sites for lowlevel radioactive waste sites in 
illinois kentucky and new york were closed because of health and 
environmental dangers 
when the three states balked at becoming the nations 
radioactive dumping grounds federal lawmakers gave all states 
until 1993 to prove to the nuclear regulatory commission they can 
handle their own waste 
many states already have entered compacts for other states to 
house their waste angering those whose backyards are selected for 
the dumps for instance seven midwestern states have agreed to 
send their radioactive waste to michigan prompting outrage in the 
three michigan counties considered candidates for the dump 
the office of technology assessment report gives three options 
a federal limit on the number of dumps oversight hearings to 
encourage states to limit the dumps themselves or no federal action 
at all the agency does not endorse any option

jurors deliberated for the 17th day 
saturday in the sedition trial of three people reviewing testimony 
by an fbi currency analyst and giving little hint of what was 
happening in the jury room 
the two men and a woman are accused of racketeering 
racketeering conspiracy and the arcane charge of seditious 
conspiracy which has been rarely used since it was invoked during 
the civil war to prosecute confederate loyalists 
prosecutors allege that raymond levasseur his wife patricia 
gros levasseur and richard williams were members of a terrorist 
band that robbed banks and bombed buildings along the east coast 
from the mid1970s to 1984 
the jury recessed saturday without reaching a verdict in the 
trial which has gone on for almost a year 
the testimony requested was that of fbi agent donald haldiman 
who testified about how money seized at the time of the defendants 
arrest was matched against federal reserve shipments 
haldiman said records showed the money had been sent to branches 
of the sovran bank the indictment alleges that levasseur and 
williams were part of a group of four men who robbed the norfolk 
va branch of the bank in june 1984 
earlier in the week jurors asked to look at charts of 
footprints taken at a bombing site 
the prosecution based much of its case on notebooks allegedly 
written by the defendants in an elaborate code that detailed 
strategies and recorded minutes of meetings defense attorneys said 
the books werent a reliable record terming them errorridden 
jottings 
some legal observers have said the lengthy deliberations are to 
be expected considering that the trial has taken 11 months and 
included testimony from about 200 witnesses evidence in the case 
filled filing cabinets and boxes stacked in the courtroom 
a trial in new york city involving some of the bombings 
prosecutors allege the group took part in resulted in 19 days of 
deliberations 
the springfield jury has diligently worked through weekends 
taking only one day off for thanksgiving and one saturday off while 
a juror renewed her wedding vows jurors planned a halfday session

a havana court sentenced three cuban human rights 
activists to prison after convicting them of giving false 
information to foreign journalists during a drug trial last summer 
the cuban government news service reported 
elizardo sanchez cubas most outspoken internal critic was 
convicted and given a twoyear sentence friday prensa latina 
reported hiram abi cobas and hubert jerez were sentenced to 18 
months each 
the prosecution had asked for prison terms of three or four 
years for the three activists 
the three were arrested aug 6 on charges of spreading false 
information against international peace in an attempt to 
discredit cuban courts when they spoke with us television 
networks and radio marti a us government station beamed to cuba 
the defendants were accused of telling us media that maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa sanchez had been psychologically tortured and had 
confessed to drug trafficking while under the influence of drugs 
administered by his interrogators 
granma the official cuban newspaper said the three carried out 
a campaign of slander aimed at discrediting the action of 
cuban courts during ochoas trial 
ochoa a cuban war hero and three other men were executed in 
july following trials that revealed a criminal ring in the cuban 
defense and interior departments that helped smuggle drugs from 
colombia to the united states 
the trial and the corruption it revealed were extremely 
embarrassing to cubas communist leader fidel castro who had 
insisted for years that accusations of drug trafficking were part 
of a us plot to discredit his government 
sanchez imprisoned for more than six years since 1972 
cofounded the cuban human rights committee in 1976 and the 
commission for human rights and national conciliation in 1987 he 
served eight months for a similar offense in 1986 
cobas is acting head of the human rights party of cuba and

news media in the east bloc on saturday generally 
lauded the political upheavals in czechoslovakia that removed 
hardline communist party leaders but the dramatic events were 
virtually unreported in romania 
romanian party chief nicolae ceausescu has firmly opposed the 
democratic reforms sweeping eastern europe and on friday the 
71yearold ceausescu was reelected to another fiveyear term as 
party leader 
soviet televisions nightly news program vremya said that as 
changes transformed poland hungary and east germany the 
czechoslovak leaders now the countrys former leaders 
repeated like prayers the words order and quiet 
vremya commentator sergei andreyev said in the broadcast from 
prague quiet if you mean the synonym of stagnation such quiet 
is not needed by a country which has embarked on the road to 
democratization 
vremya praised the czechoslovak protesters for maintaining order 
during their massive protests 
the official soviet news agency tass reported the czechoslovak 
communist party is willing to form a coalition government with 
other parties 
although soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms are 
credited with providing much of the impetus for the changes in 
eastern europe the soviet communist party has given no indication 
of accepting such a coalition arrangement 
tass quoted former czechoslovak communist party leader alexander 
dubcek as blaming his countrys crisis on military interference 
in the affairs and life of the czechoslovak people 
dubcek obviously referred to the sovietled warsaw pack invasion 
of czechoslovakia in august 1968 which crushed dubceks reform 
administration that had introduced what became known as the 
prague spring dubcek was ousted and a hardline party 
leadership installed 
the soviet government has not renounced the invasion but some 
other east bloc countries have 
tass also said the czechoslovak opposition did not seem to have 
a harmonious and clearcut action program and many people were 
looking to the communist party to take the country out of the 
crisis 
in hungary which is moving toward a full multiparty system 
the newspaper magyar nemzet said the prague domino has fallen 
the czechoslovak party leadership resigned 
polish party leader mieczyslaw rakowski congratulated karel 
urbanek on his election as new general secretary of the 
czechoslovak communist party sending wishes for the successful 
development of socialpolitical reforms in czechoslovakia poland 
has a coalition government and its premier a former solidarity 
activist is the first noncommunist government leader in the 
eastern bloc 
in nonaligned yugoslavia newspapers headlined the resignation 
of czechoslovakias hardline party leader milos jakes 
people are embracing champagne bottles are being opened 
columns of cars are rhythmically sounding their horns said the 
belgrade daily politika 
a belgrade ekspres headline said no one stood by jakes 
in jerusalem former soviet prisoner natan sharansky told israel 
television that the changes in eastern europe made him feel 
exactly as i did when i was released 
on the one hand youre afraid to believe it he said 
maybe its just another dream youre having while in solitary 
confinement 
he spent nine years in soviet prisons and labor camps before 
being freed in an eastwest exchange feb 11 1986 he had been 
sentenced to 13 years in 1978 on charges of antisoviet espionage 
for his contacts with western media and criticism of the kremlin 
sharansky 41 is the chairman of a soviet jewry zionist forum 
group he founded two years ago to help soviet jewish immigrants

more than half a million 
demonstrators saturday scoffed at a communist party shakeup and 
cheered alexander dubcek as he urged leaders to resign and make way 
for democratic reforms 
the beleaguered government bowed to some of the protesters 
demands releasing a group of prominent political prisoners and 
declaring a willingness to give noncommunists greater power 
also saturday the entire communist party leadership of prague 
resigned under increasing pressure for reform there were 
indications the prague party chief miroslav stepan was leaving 
the nations ruling politburo as well 
on friday the 13man politburo resigned and the partys 
policymaking central committee replaced it with a nineman 
politburo containing several hardline holdovers including stepan 
another central committee meeting was planned for sunday with 
the governmentrun news agency ctk saying only that the gathering 
would deal with political and organizational questions 
dubcek the reformer ousted after warsaw pact tanks crushed his 
prague spring movement in 1968 was shown for the first time 
live on national television as he addressed a sea of flagwaving 
roaring demonstrators at letna field in northern prague it was the 
largest rally in the nations history 
long live dubcek the people cried dubcek to the 
palace they chanted referring to the official residence of 
czechoslovakias president 
dubcek who was heckled just days earlier for making what some 
considered overly cautious comments unleashed his strongest public 
assault on communist leaders in more than 20 years he said 
fridays party changes had failed to go far enough 
the changes did not meet the demands of the people he said 
the political leadership has lost touch with the people and the 
crisis has deepened 
we appeal to the central committee that those who have caused 
the stagnation leave their posts and not obstruct further 
development of this country said dubcek 67 speaking publicly 
for the third straight day 
leading dissident vaclav havel welcomed the politburo 
resignations but also told the crowd further changes were needed 
although some of the most discredited people were 
eliminated we are deeply concerned by the new personnel lineup of 
our top party bodies he said 
in a 16hour session that streched into early saturday the 
party central committee replaced party boss milos jakes with karel 
urbanek a littleknown 48yearold politburo member who had been 
in charge of the czech republic 
jakes 67 became the third east bloc leader to fall from power 
in five weeks all were hardliners who resisted the reforms 
inspired by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
five old guard politburo members who were closely linked to the 
hardline policies pursued since the 1968 invasion stepped down 
but urbanek and five colleagues retained their seats 
urbanek in his first televised speech to the nation saturday 
opened the way for a more genuine coalition government and admitted 
past party mistakes 
we have to distance ourselves from all who have misused their 
functions or positions he said only then will people believe 
that we want to end corruption 
we know that we must sit down and negotiate with all those who 
are concerned about the destiny of our country urbanek said 
he said he would talk with anyone including opposition leaders 
and those who left or had to leave the party after 1968 he 
appeared to refer to dubcek who was purged along with half a 
million other communists 
but urbanek said his offer was nothing new and it was 
unclear how much power the communists are willing to share and 
when 
there are four other parties besides the communists in 
czechoslovakia traditionally docile they have no powerful 
ministries but recently have become increasingly independent 
a leading socialist who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
last week his party would be very reluctant to join a 
communistdominated coalition 
premier ladislav adamec ousted from the politburo on friday 
said on national television that he was prepared to initiate 
dialogue with civic forum the main opposition movement whose 
leaders have called for a twohour general strike monday 
last week i undertook such dialogue but we cannot leave it 
unfinished we must meet again and solve problems with which both 
sides are concerned adamec said i think we can do it sometime 
next week 
statecontrolled television shed any semblance of censorship 
after the party shakeup it showed stepan under fierce attack at a 
party meeting on friday it showed workers yelling resign as 
he spoke at a factory 
on saturday stepan stepped down from his municipal post along 
with the rest of the city leadership 
there were indications he would lose his politburo job as well 
sources speaking anonymously at the ctk news agency said they were 
informed of stepans departure from the politburo but had not been 
authorized to carry the dispatch 
stepans politburo seat was due in large part to his job as 
influential prague party boss so his resignation on the local 
level strongly suggested he was also on his way out from the 
politburo 
the influential prague party urged further personnel changes 
including the resignation of trade union chief miroslav zavadil it 
also urged an unusual congress to consider further changes to renew 
trust in the communist party 
in a concession to demonstrators president gustav husak granted 
amnesty to leading jailed dissidents ivan jirous ivan polansky and 
frantisek starek and ordered charges dropped against five other 
prominent government critics ctk reported 
they are among the best known of about 30 prisoners of 
conscience held in czechoslovak jails 
television repeatedly showed scenes of police clubbing peaceful 
protesters on nov 17 an attack that sparked a historic week of 
demonstrations and it showed a gathering saturday in bratislava of 
at least 100000 demonstrators

what we are doing is fighting a war we have not gotten into a

in the meantime the combat goes on 
yakima a city of 50000 in washingtons apple country has 
become a cocaine distribution point for the northwest police say 
drugs are smuggled in from mexico by agents who blend in with 
migrant farm workers 
to make the drug trade conspicuous police train four 500watt 
lights on suspected drug dens their purpose is similar to air raid 
lights discouraging attacking warplanes and police said they have 
reduced traffic 95 percent to the buildings since september 
we want to create a strong sense of paranoia among dealers and 
users said police chief pleas green said were forcing people 
out of their comfort zone 
but an american civil liberties union official in seattle is 
unimpressed it sounds like a hollywood approach to the war on 
drugs jerry sheehan said 
the southern arkansas city of el dorado population 26000 
condemned three suspected crack houses and set them on fire this 
spring 
it was really interesting to see people in the neighborhood

in inglewood calif police have infiltrated suspected crack 
houses to run sting operations when users come to buy drugs 
theyre busted

apathy is officially dead in central ohio and were on the 
march mayor dana rinehart said 
community activists also joined the battle with a block watch 
program 
the only way were going to eliminate the drug problem is to 
pitch in and do some of the dirty work the police cant be 
everywhere all the time said mark goodman a member of the olde 
towne east neighborhood association 
baseball is an ally in kansas city mo ewing kauffman the 
billionaire owner of the kansas city royals pledged free college

people theyll turn out good kauffman said 
the passions of war can even overwhelm antitax sentiments this 
month voters in the kansas city area approved a quartercent 
increase in the sales tax to raise 98 million over the next seven 
years to fight the war 
the people are fighting back said joe serviss treasurer of

opec oil ministers formally opened a 
strategy meeting saturday and then turned to private bargaining to 
try to end production cheating by some of the 13 member nations 
several ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries said they wanted crude prices to go higher 
i would like to see them rise saudi arabian minister hisham 
nazer said at the start of the groups winter conference 
irans gholamreza aqazadeh said the cartel must get to its 
target price of 18 a barrel a basket price of crudes monitored by 
opec recently hit 1776 a barrel 
west texas intermediate the american benchmark crude has been 
trading around 20 per barrel middle eastern crudes run several 
dollars less 
the petroleum ministers who arrived in vienna several days ago 
for informal talks have as their goal a new production and pricing 
agreement for the first half of 1990 
opecs output ceiling now is 205 million barrels a day but 
actual production is estimated at more than 23 million barrels 
opec president rilwanu lukman of nigeria told his colleagues the 
market can easily absorb an average of at least 21 million 
barrels a day next year 
a stumbling block in arranging a production deal is demands by 
kuwait and the united arab emirates for bigger shares of the 
cartels output 
both have ignored the current accord and pump well over their 
quotas their actions have angered other members who believe prices 
would be higher with more restraint 
during private discussions saudi arabia has proposed that some 
countries like kuwait and the united arab emirates be allowed to 
produce more 
i think it is a positive concept said kuwaits ali khalifa 
alsabah kuwait according to analysts is pumping close to 2 
million barrels a day nearly double its quota 
the united arab emirates mana saeed otaiba declined to say what 
quota he wanted he said his country is producing more than 2 
million barrels a day or double its quota

the following are the highlights 
of alexander dubceks speech before a rally of 500000 people in 
saturday his comments were made in slovak and translated by the 
associated press 
the political leadership has lost touch with the people and the 
crisis has deepened the changes did not meet the demands of 
the people 
they government leaders are telling us that the street is not 
the place for things to be solved but i say the street was and is 
the place the voice of the street must be heard 
i appeal to the central committee of the party to take the 
initiative and the ideas of the reform groups very seriously 
we appeal to the central committee that those who have caused the 
stagnation leave their posts and not obstruct further development 
of this country 
our efforts in 1968 were crushed but the ideals of democracy 
freedom and humanity live on in us and in the new generation 
democratic renewal can only succeed when the slogan all power to 
the people is fully realized

a plane carrying mostly soviet 
missiles and other weapons presumably for leftist rebels crashed 
near this southeastern village saturday three crew members were 
fatally injured and a fourth apparently committed suicide 
salvadoran and us military officals said the flight of the 
singleengine cessna originated in nicaragua and that the crash was 
proof nicaraguas sovietbacked sandinista government smuggles 
weapons to el salvadors guerrillas 
a second plane also apparently on an arms smuggling mission was 
burned at a landing strip southeast of the capital san salvador 
both planes apparently ran out of fuel 
later rebels fired on a military helicopter carrying reporters 
to the site of one of the two planes and two foreign cameramen were 
wounded 
colleagues said hugo burgos a camerman for cable news network 
and alfredo hernandez lopez a reporter for the mexican government 
radio network were wounded when the guerrillas opened fire near 
zacatecoluca 18 miles southeast of san salvador 
the pilot managed to land the helicopter at the comalapa 
international airport and doctors at the central military hospital 
in san salvador said burgos was in serious but stable condition and 
hernandez suffered minor injuries 
the cessna was carrying 25 shoulderfired surfacetoair 
missiles 24 sovietmade and one usmade a sovietdesigned 
antitank weapon and mortar shells it crashed in a soybean field 
just north of the town of el transito about 60 miles east of san 
salvador 
the salvadoran military press office reported saturday afternoon 
that the second light plane which had been used to smuggle weapons 
to the rebels was set afire on a dirt landing strip 7 miles 
southeast of zacatecoluca 
it said residents of the area told army officers the planes 
crew unloaded boxes presumably containing ammunition after it 
landed the press office said the plane apparently did not have 
enough fuel to take off and the crew burned the craft and then fled 
the cessna painted black and with no registration number did 
not burn col ricardo casanova commander of the 6th army brigade 
said it crashed when it ran out of fuel 
fredy garay a peasant who lives about a mile from the crash 
site told reporters he heard a sputtering motor and the sound of a 
crash at 530 am he said as he and a friend approached the 
wreckage they heard a single shot 
garay said two of the planes crewmen were dead one died 
shortly after he and his friend arrived and the fourth was dead 
from a bullet wound in his right temple 
three of the victims wore military fatigue uniforms none of the 
four had identification papers and officials said it was presumed 
they were nicaraguans 
an officer showed reporters a belgianmade browning pistol that 
he said presumably was used by the crewman who shot himself 
engraved on the pistol was guardia nacional de nicaragua 
nicaraguan national guard 
the rear cargo section of the plane was intact but the front 
section was destroyed salvadoran troops and a us military 
adviser were at the piedra pacha site within an hour after the 
crash 
when reporters arrived at midday the weapons had been placed in 
front of the wreckage 24 sovietmade sam7 missiles one 
usmade redeye antiaircraft missile a sovietmade 75mm 
recoiless rifle and 21 sovietmanufactured 82mm mortar shells 
a flight plan found in the wreckage indicated the plane was to 
have landed at a beach near amatecampo south of the capital 
lt col luis turcios told reporters the surfacetoair missiles 
represented a great threat he also said the plane was proof 
of sandinista intervention in the salvadoran conflict of their aid 
to the terrorists 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front have 
not used surfacetoair missiles in their 10yearold war against a 
succession of usbacked governments such missiles could provide 
a tactical boost to the rebels who last week waged their biggest 
offensive of the war 
el salvador is northwest of nicaragua and the two countries are 
separated by the gulf of fonseca in the pacific ocean they do not 
share a land frontier

election officials on sunday threw out 
results and ordered new balloting in prime minister rajiv gandhis 
district because of vote fraud affecting about 100000 voters and 
dealing a major blow to gandhis reelection efforts 
the election with voting staggered over three days on 
wednesday friday and sunday has been tainted by allegations of 
fraud it also has become one of the bloodiest campaigns in 
independent indias 42year history 
the death toll since polling began rose to 107 saturday when at 
least six people were killed including a state assembly candidate 
fatally wounded by a bomb as he rode his motorcycle in the northern 
town of allahabad at least 153 people have been killed since 
campaigning began in october 
sunday a respected magazine released results of a poll that 
indicated gandhis congress party would be hard pressed to win 
200 seats in the 543seat lok sabha parliaments lower house 
which will choose the next prime minister the poll was based on 
interviews with 11500 voters 
the election commission issued the stunning order on gandhis 
amethi district early sunday after 10 hours of deliberation 
it ruled as invalid the balloting wednesday and ordered new 
elections to be held in 98 precincts monday about 1000 voters 
were registered in each of the precincts 
the commission said there were serious lapses in the amethi 
voting and ordered the uttar pradesh state government to 
immediately replace the superintendent of police in charge of 
polling arrangements along with another officer for alleged ballot 
rigging it directed the state to initiate disciplinary action 
against the two men 
chief election commissioner rvs peri sastri said the decision 
on amethi was critical for indias future 
it is the country that is involved not merely the prime 
minister he said 
an opposition coalition had accused the congress party of 
election fraud in amethi 350 miles southeast of new delhi even 
before the balloting ended wednesday 
congress party spokesman anand sharma denied the allegations and 
said the opposition was engaged in a plot to embarrass the prime 
minister who has represented amethi since 1980 
so far the election commission has cast out the balloting in 
1236 of the countrys 590000 polling places and ordered new 
elections india has 498 million eligible voters 
initial election results are expected late sunday 
the top candidate to become prime minister if the opposition 
wins told the associated press he would not take the job 
vishwanath pratap singh who heads the fiveparty opposition 
coalition known as the national front said he would run the party 
instead 
it is political suicide to depend too much on an individual 
said singh so i have decided not to accept any proposal to 
become the prime minister 
there was no voting saturday but violence persisted 
in calcutta indias biggest city political activists battled 
and a polling agent was killed in the turmoil police fired in the 
air and used tear gas to disperse the angry mob 
two other people were killed in the southern states of andhra 
pradesh and tamil nadu at least 150 indians fled into bangladesh 
because of political clashes in the far eastern state of tripura 
the elections will determine whether gandhi remains in power or 
falls to the most cohesive opposition challenge since india won 
independence from britain in 1947 
the main campaign issue has been gandhis leadership neither 
party has called for major changes in indias domestic or foreign 
policy 
reports of highlevel corruption have damaged the 45yearold 
prime ministers image as a reformer 
massive security was prepared for sundays vote in tiny sikkim 
in the state of punjab where sikh separatists have killed more 
than 1650 people this year and in the state of bihar where 
clashes between hindus and moslems have killed at least 300 people 
in six weeks 
the election turmoil has brought doomsday editorials in 
newspapers 
poll perversion said the independent times of india 
it called the election in amethi a national disgrace and 
said if this is the example set in the prime ministers own 
constituency he is left without moral authority to control the 
hoodlums and mafia dons who make a mockery of the democratic 
process in other parts of the country

eastern airlines blamed striking machinists for 
bomb threats against a flight saturday claiming their union was 
trying to frighten travelers away from the airline during the 
holiday season 
a spokesman for the machinists union denied that union members 
had anything to do with the threats 
the associated press received a call warning that eastern flight 
90 from portland ore to atlanta due in at 438 pm saturday

heard about the threat while monitoring air traffic 
other news media also received tips on alleged bomb threats 
according to the airline and the federal aviation administration 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami said the carrier 
received several bomb threats involving flight 90 including one 
from a caller who identified himself as a striking eastern mechanic 
after the information was evaluated the carrier determined the 
threats were a hoax she said the flight was not disrupted 
whoever the caller or callers were they spent more time 
calling the media i think this is indicative of their the 
machinists shift in tactic to try and frighten travelers over the 
holiday period she said 
charles bryan president of machinists district 100 in miami 
denied strikers were involved 
i can assure you we are not inolved with any illegal activity

encourage them eastern to do so and stop the rhetoric bryan 
said we have rigorously and constantly told our membership not 
to do anything illegal

8month strike despite announcements wednesday and thursday that 
the pilots and flight attendants were ending their walkouts which 
began in march in solidarity with the machinists 8500 members 
another eastern spokesman jim ashlock said strikers were 
trying to create a big stir and this is a peak travel weekend i 
believe theres a direct relation between the bomb threat tips 
and the union workers announcement about changing tactics

a caterer whose plan to feed the 
hungry backfired on thanksgiving hasnt lost his spirit of giving 
and said saturday that he plans to make free meals at his banquet 
hall a regular event 
it looked like john kostik 40 was going to be stuck with 
hundreds of pounds of leftovers from a party planned for 900 needy 
people for which only 24 showed up 
but a food bank came to his rescue saying it would not let the 
food go to waste 
it was the strangest thanksgiving ive ever had kostik 
recalled on saturday 
more volunteers showed up to help serve the food than people to 
eat it 
kostik and his wife jane 40 found about 80 people to give 
food to friday but still had about 200 pounds of turkey 210 
pounds of potatoes 60 cases of bulk corn and more than 200 pumpkin 
pies left 
we gave them a couple of turkeys each and some pies we loaded 
them up kostik said we found the food bank as a result of all 
the media attention we got 
the greater pittsburgh community food bank will distribute the 
food to poor families said joyce rothermel the groups executive 
director 
kostik said he mailed dozens of announcements about the feast 
which cost him 1000 to pittsburgharea newspapers and television 
and radio stations but apparently none was used 
volunteers posted fliers throughout the neighborhood but that 
didnt help much either 
the only people who showed up were reporters who found out about 
the free party to which few came 
i hung up on the first television station that called that 
afternoon i didnt want them to make me any more depressed than i 
already was i didnt want to watch my empty banquet hall on tv 
that night or read about it in the paper the next day kostik 
said but the attention turned out to be a real good thing after 
all 
kostik thinks his use of the word needy on the fliers 
discouraged many people in his neighborhood from coming 
we have a lot of exsteelworkers here who have been unemployed 
a long time and a lot of senior citizens on fixed incomes theyre 
the kind of people who are too proud to ask for a handout he 
said 
kostik wants to try again he plans to begin serving free meals 
at least once a month at the banquet hall 
ill probably do that starting in december maybe every other 
tuesday for about 400 or 500 needy people he said 
but hell probably rely on word of mouth to attract guests 
on friday a lot of people told me if i do this again theyll 
bring a couple of their neigbors who are in the same situation

the burning mojave desert on saturday in a 135mile offroad 
motorcycle race that was marred by eleven injuries and has been 
opposed by environmentalists 
officials of the american motorcyclists association charged that 
someone had tried to litter the course between barstow and las 
vegas with spikes 
but the fourpronged spikes were dumped on a dummy course that 
had been set up to fool protesters the organizers said 
saboteurs also moved some of the course markers said ken boyd

theyre nothing more than terrorists boyd said when you 
change the course you can take riders over canyons have them drop 
off of cliffs the riders would have no knowledge of the course

particulate matter into the air 
wed like to see this be the last race she said 
ms schifferle said instructions for riders to stay on the 
course for safety and to avoid crushing endangered desert tortoises 
are just a few token bones tossed to the tortoise for a oneday 
joyride 
the course was ugly said rider westly peterson of los 
angeles its real dusty real rough and real short 
the race staging area took on the look of a heavymetal concert 
early saturday with riders and their families many clad in leather 
and chains arriving before dawn for the races 7 am start the 
whine of motorcycles reached earsplitting levels as the bikers 
revved up and sand filled the air as the race got under way

to 5000 spectators and crew members gathered for the event 
its a zoo but i love it said referee ed hales

fort irwin military base hospital blm spokeswoman barbara maxfield 
said eight lesser injuries including dislocated elbows and knees 
and broken collarbones were reported

incident although about 10 riders strayed off course near the 
beginning and rode into a wilderness study area

ms maxfield said blm officials went over the course both before 
and after the race and found no tortoises

elliott abrams former assistant secretary of state for central 
america alan fiers former chief of the cias central america task 
force and clair george the agencys former deputy director of

south african president frederik w de klerk 
has rejected the possibility of a transitional government that 
would include blacks while a new nonracial constitution is being 
drafted according to a published report 
de klerk in his first newspaper interview since he became 
president in september for the first time ruled out a central 
negotiating position presented by the african national congress 
the washington post reported in its sunday editions 
the anc the main black nationalist group fighting the 
government and a key bargaining partner in future negotiations 
proposed that a multiracial interim government would share power 
during the process of drafting the new constitution 
we are not prepared to move into a situation where a lawfully 
elected government will be suspended and interim governments will 
come about de klerk said in pretoria 
however he said that once a new constitution is negotiated with 
blacks under the supervision of the white government the existing 
authority will have to accept it and give way to a new government 
on other topics de klerk 
made clear that whatever new political order evolves power in 
south africa would be shared on the basis of racially defined 
groups not according to the principle of majority rules 
ruled out the possibility of his government repealing the 
aprtheid law that categorizes every south african in a racial group 
at birth saying the race law is fundamentally tied to the 
existing constitution and that its repeal would have to go 
handinhand with the writing of a new constitution 
said the release of imprisoned anc leader nelson mandela is 
under constant consideration but declined to say when he would 
be freed 
said he plans to lift the state of emergency as soon as 
possible if not all at once then in stages 
de klerk the post said conveyed a sense of urgency in removing 
south africas 23 million blacks from the 45 million white 
minority rule but said an expectation by some us officials that 
the political system can be overhauled as early as next june is 
unrealistic 
i think we are involved in a process he said i dont 
think you can put a time scale to it 
if there is a conception that we will have a final solution in 
six months i think thats an expectation we cannot deliver

new opinion polls published sunday showed prime 
minister margaret thatcher and her governing conservative party in 
deep trouble with the voters 
a harris poll in the observer indicated twothirds of voters 
felt mrs thatcher should quit before the next general election 
due by mid1992 
a survey by market opinion and research international mori in 
the sunday times reported the opposition labor party could win 51 
percent of the vote the highest figure since mrs thatcher came to 
power 10 years ago 
the conservatives would get 37 percent support and minor parties 
shared the remaining 12 percent 
the figures mean that if an election took place now the 
conservative majority of 100 seats in the 650seat house of commons 
would be completely reversed in a labor landslide 
mori also reported 23 percent of all conservatives would like 
their leader to stand down 
michael heseltine a former defense minister was identified by 
30 percent of all voters in the mori survey as the conservative 
leader they would prefer to take them into the next election while 
mrs thatcher had the support of 22 percent a reversal of their 
ratings two months ago 
both polls took place over two days last week among a national 
sample of nearly 1100 voters who were interviewed neither survey 
reported any margin of error 
the 64yearold prime minister returned home on saturday after 
talks on friday with president bush at camp david outside 
washington and a generally warm reception from americans in 
contrast to feelings about her back home 
labor moved ahead of the conservatives in the polls in the 
spring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation and 
intended changes in the national health service 
mrs thatcher has won three general elections and is the 
longestserving british prime minister in this century as 
criticism of her leadership mounted within her party she said last 
week she was prepared to lead it into a fourth and even a fifth 
election 
this week sees the first ballot for the conservative leadership 
since mrs thatcher became leader in 1975 
sir anthony meyer a constant critic of cabinet policies and the 
only tory lawmaker to oppose britain going to war with argentina 
over the falkland islands in 1982 said he will stand against her 
to test feeling about the leadership among his fellow legislators 
they are the only party members entitled to vote on the issue

ireland puts its male statues on 
pedestals the female images are displayed at street level then 
the wits go to work at shredding what dignity remains 
dublins bronze women are familiarly known as the tart with 
the cart the hags with the bags and the floozie in the 
jacuzzi 
the statues which have appeared in the past two years are 
accessible streetlevel images intended to make amends for the 
past male bias in the capitals public sculpture 
the hags resting on a bench beside their bronze shopping 
bags at the foot of the hapenny bridge are two anonymous shoppers 
the tart is a wellbuilt lass inspired by sweet molly 
malone who wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and 
narrow crying cockles and mussels alive alive o 
the floozie recumbent in flowing streams represents the 
river liffey recalling james joyces anna livia but 
floozie she is and much more

aliases bidet mulligan the skivvy in the sink 
anorexia anna livia plurability and scandalously the 
whore pronounced hoor in the sewer 
ms smyth a lecturer at university college and head of the 
womens studies forum detected a sign of difficulty and 
fragmentation but also of possibility and the singular 
diversities and diverse singularities of irish women 
dubliners have appropriated the monument in their midst 
through a multiple renaming game manifestly pleasurable which 
reverberates with a plurality of significations often 
contradictory but dreams go by contraries infinitely 
translating travesty she explained 
anna livia may be the most abused by the wits but recent 
letters to the irish times indicate molly malone who stands at the 
foot of the grafton street shopping strip and opposite trinity

its tough stance was the same in both bruising 
battles but for the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers the outcomes of strikes against boeing co and 
eastern airlines could not have been more different 
easterns machinists are walking picket lines alone after being 
abandoned by pilots and flight attendants who voted to return to 
work this past week after more than eight months on strike 
at boeing however their fellow machinists returned to work 
after ending a 48day strike and gaining what is considered a 
strong new contract 
it boeing was much more of a traditional collective 
bargaining experience a much cleaner bargaining environment 
mark kahn an independent labor arbitrator said friday eastern 
is at the other extreme it isnt just a matter of economics 
the eastern pilots and flight attendants decisions to end 
their strikes which were begun in sympathy with a machinists 
strike on march 4 was a stinging blow to the machinists and a key 
victory for frank lorenzo head of easterns parent texas air corp 
the hardtoreplace pilots had given the machinists crucial support 
in their battle against lorenzo and their walkout had virtually 
shut eastern down in the early days of the strike 
at boeing where the machinists struck alone a much shorter 
walkout ended last monday when 814 percent of the membership 
ratified the new 3year contract although the union failed to get 
the full wage increase it sought it scored other points 
including costofliving adjustments that will account for 
virtually all inflation 
the 57000 machinists at boeing the worlds biggest commercial 
aircraft maker had secure jobs to go back to their prosperous 
company with a swollen backlog of orders didnt attempt to 
continue full production during the strike 
many of the workers who struck financially troubled eastern on 
the other hand have been replaced over the months as the 
financially sagging airline has rebuilt itself on a smaller scale 
under bankruptcy court supervision 
miamibased eastern warned the pilots and flight attendants 
unions thursday that they wont necessarily get their old jobs back 
the eastern machinists also have been seeking higher wages but 
the bitterly contested issues at the airline have gone beyond 
economics easterns unions have demanded the removal of lorenzo 
charging him with trying to bust the union and draining assets from 
eastern to its sister carrier continental airlines 
the financial conditions and economics of eastern and boeing 
as well as their unions also are vastly different 
the 8500 eastern machinists are about equally divided between 
two distinct groups relatively skilled aircraft mechanics and less 
skilled ramp service workers who fuel planes handle baggage and 
drive motorized equipment on airport runways after the strike 
began eastern was able to contract out much of the ramp service 
work 
at boeing the union represents skilled production workers who 
perform tasks ranging from riveting wiring and plumbing in 
aircraft to quality inspections and machinetool maintenance their 
skills make them difficult to replace 
another factor on the returning strikers may have been the pull 
of the holiday season both the eastern and boeing workers decided 
to end their walkouts the week of thanksgiving the prospect of 
holidays punctuated by continued struggles to make ends meet could 
not have been cheering for the employees and their families 
in each case there also was a specific catalyst that appeared 
to trigger the end of the strikes 
at eastern the catalyst was president bushs veto last tuesday 
of unionbacked legislation that would set up a blueribbon 
commission to investigate the dispute that directly precipitated 
the action by the pilots and attendants 
in the case of boeing however the catalyst seemed to work in 
the machinists favor as some of boeings big airline customers 
started to express public anxiety about further delays in jet 
deliveries due to the strike the company appeared more pressed to 
make a deal with the union 
in other business and economic news this past week 
economic reports pointed to continued sluggishness in the 
nations manufacturing sector and a small inflationary spurt in 
october orders for durable goods dipped 06 percent while the 
consumer price index rose 05 percent 
a number of major airlines announced plans to raise fares on 
most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly by 
business travelers 
wall street woes continued merrill lynch amp co the nations 
largest retail brokerage announced a restructuring that it said 
would include layoffs and other cost cutting while shearson lehman 
hutton inc said it would cut stockbroker commissions for the first 
time in 15 years

wall street analysts say the federal reserve 
appears to have grown a bit more aggressive lately in its efforts 
to cushion the impact of a slowing economy 
the fed gave evidence just before the thanksgiving holiday that 
it was taking further steps to relax its credit policy 
for the second time this month it engaged in maneuvers that 
encouraged a decline in shortterm interest rates 
the earlier easing didnt cause much of a stir analysts say 
partly because it didnt touch off any dramatic moves in the bank 
prime lending rate but the latest actions by the central bank 
might make a bigger splash said douglas schindewolf at smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
if the fed is trying to reduce general recession fears the 
policy move in early november seems to have fallen short he 
observed in order to reach general psychology the easing would 
need to grab the headlines 
that may come soon he suggested in the form of a general 
reduction in the prime rate talk also has spread on the street 
that the fed might reinforce its message by lowering the discount 
rate the charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions 
the latest developments dont necessarily signal that alan 
greenspan the feds chairman has abandoned the gradualist style 
that has become his trademark observers say 
nor do wall streeters think the central bank has dropped its 
campaign against inflation as economic enemy no 1 
but inflation the feds top priority is contained said 
maury harris economist at painewebber inc recession risks have 
risen 
if all goes right analysts say the fed will be able to bring 
off the muchballyhooed soft landing for the economy as 1990 
begins letting interest rates fall and setting the stage for 
renewed expansion later on 
but some doubts persist that it can achieve that tricky feat 
signs of a downturn are in view contends erich heinemann at 
ladenburg thalmann amp co 
mr greenspan has responded to the softening in the economy 
he has also responded to heavyhanded pressure from the bush 
administration which is worried about the prospect of further 
democratic gains in the congressional elections in 1990 
whatever the motivations stock and bond traders found a lot to 
like in the feds latest actions 
after getting off to a weak start the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 2289 to 267555 in the past week 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 101 to 
19029 while the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market slipped 09 to 45663 and the american stock exchange market 
value index fell 21 to 37314 
volume on the big board averaged 12702 million shares a day 
during the holidayshortened week against 14769 million the week 
before 
the most recent economic reports confirm that business 
activity is slowing said analysts at wright investors service 
a bridgeport conn investment management firm in their latest 
appraisal of the outlook 
a further easing of inflation pressures and lower interest 
rates appear to be reasonable expectations for the months ahead 
that looks like a recipe for higher bond prices at least among 
topquality securities such as treasury bonds but opinions remain 
sharply divided on what it might mean for the stock market 
corporate earnings are forecast to decline wright said 
we expect that earnings disappointments will increasingly 
overpower the interest rate downtrend as a determinant of stock 
prices taking them lower in the process
