a national union of the homeless said monday 
it had seized at least seven vacant governmentowned houses as 
part of a national protest against housing policies 
the national union of the homeless which claims 18000 homeless 
and formerly homeless members in 16 cities said it took five 
houses in philadelphia and one each in alexandria va and detroit 
police prevented a move to take a house in new york city 
the philadelphiabased union said it also planned takeovers in 
minneapolis chicago and washington dc coordinators of those 
groups either didnt have information on the activities or 
couldnt be contacted monday night because of disconnected 
telephones 
anna kontradas a senior adviser to housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp didnt address the unions actions 
directly but said in a statement that huds immediate goal is to 
help provide both housing and supportive services to those who are 
homeless today 
we feel like its insane to have boardedup houses when so 
many people are homeless said ronald darnaby of the philadelphia 
union which took over five homes 
in new york about 30 members of the tent city chapter of the 
union were thwarted by police in their attempt to take a house 
said union member renaldo casanova he said two groups members were 
arrested 
casanova 43 defended the groups actions 
i think it is against the law to let people live in the 
streets he said 
in northern virginia and in detroit groups reportedly occupied 
a vacant house no further details were available 
a member of the tucson union of homeless in arizona said his 
group plans to set up a homeless camp next week in front of a 
federal building located downtown 
the union wants a number of changes in national policies 
including hud allocation of 50000 homes it owns to the homeless 
we are sick and tired of empty promises union president 
leona smith said 
the government is more committed to bailing out mismanaged 
savings and loans banks than to saving and restoring the lives of 
people who are homeless chronically unemployed and who are being 
pressed into a permanent underclass status she said 
the organization also wants half of all community development 
block grant money earmarked for remodeling or new construction of 
lowincome housing and for more rent subsidies 
the coordinator for the homeless for huds regional office in 
philadelphia pat mulligan said his agency considered the seizures 
illegal trespassing but said officials had not decided how to 
respond 
city officials sent in building inspectors but no police 
officers 
police lt ed kachigian said the city had referred the seizures 
to hud and would not act against the homeless unless hud requested 
police assistance 
darnaby said the coalition checked with huds inventory to 
identify houses for sale then discussed the proposed seizures with 
community leaders and neighborhood clergy 
the twostory houses would house two families each none of the 
houses had utilities darnaby said 
inside one of the houses on monday morning protesters and 
homeless people wearing coats huddled around kerosene heaters and 
sipped hot drinks while about 20 other members picketed the 
sidewalks outside 
well stay as long as it takes said charles thompson 
across the street at chew transmission center an employee who 
would only identify himself as ed said he had considered buying the 
house from hud and said the coalition should not be allowed to 
seize the house 
i think they should have to pay for it he said 
city housing commissioner ed schwartz said his department would 
not try to force the squatters out 
schwartz said he was willing to act as a mediator between 
dignity shelter which is part of the union and hud a role he 
played two years ago when the group seized several houses hud 
later sold those houses to dignity shelter 
mulligan said the federal agency gives priority to shelter 
groups when selling houses and offers the groups leases for 1 a 
year

more than a thousand miles from the mexican 
border is perhaps the nations unlikeliest drug battlefield a 
small city in a farming valley that is being compared to miami and 
new york 
drug dealers riding a sort of underground railroad to wealth 
have turned yakima county into the heroin and cocaine trafficking 
capital of the pacific northwest 
traveling on longestablished migrant farmworker routes from 
deep inside mexico they have brought death and disrepute 
the sound of an ak47 assault rifle shatters the evening calm 
one night on another a mans arm is chopped off with a machete 
apparently the fallout from a soured drug deal us drug 
enforcement administration agents arrest entire families and 
police use spotlights to illuminate known drug houses 
once notable mostly for growing many of the nations apples 
yakima county has become a front line in the nations war on drugs 
there is a war between the people of this city and the drug 
cartels says county commissioner graham tollefson this is not 
a war we are capable of winning ourselves 
william bennett the federal drug czar visited the city of 
50000 people last october and was astonished said his spokesman 
david robb 
secretary bennett came away with the feeling that for a 
community its size there was clearly something wrong there robb 
said in a telephone interview from washington it definitely 
jumps off the map 
sen brock adams dwash hoping to use bennetts reaction to 
gain more dea agents and federal resources asked that yakima 
county be designated a highintensity drug trafficking area 
bennett instead selected new york city miami los angeles 
houston and the southwest border region but in a letter to adams 
his office acknowledged the yakima areas problem and promised more 
help 
yakima county has become a warehouse and wholesale distribution 
point for drugs eventually consumed in other communities said 
robert dreisbach head of the deas office here 
when the dea opened its fulltime office in 1986 agents were 
amazed by what they found dresibach said 
i never saw anything like it he said 
but perhaps they should not have been surprised 
while yakima county is one of the worlds premier food 
producers supplying the nation with asparagus apples mint 
pears fruit juice and hops for beer the metropolitan area ranked 
fifth from the bottom in per capita income in 1988 in a us bureau 
of labor statistics study 
the countys 186000 residents easily have the states highest 
metropolitan unemployment rate 14 percent in january 
education levels are low and goodpaying jobs are scarce making 
drugdealing an attractive option for those seeking to avoid the 
fields or the fruit row warehouses 
the minority population also is high compared to the rest of the 
state law officers say the countys 17 percent hispanic population 
provides a perfect cover for drugdealers from mexico to move 
freely in and out of the area 
the problem has spread to other counties in central washington 
as well 
franklin county with just 35000 residents has the highest per 
capita felony caseload in the state and a 350000 court budget 
deficit the county seat of pasco was the site of a mass murder in 
1988 in which five men were shot to death in an auto body shop the 
presumed motive was drugs the presumed killers escaped to mexico 
the city of wenatchee 100 miles north has shown signs of 
sprouting as a drug trafficking center 
along with the drugs come violence and an overloaded criminal 
justice system described as near collapse 
drug arrests in yakima jumped from under 300 in 1984 to more 
than 700 in 1988 the new county jail is already 30 percent over 
capacity holding more than 400 prisoners a day 
law officers time their arrests to days when there is available 
jail space dreisbach said prosecutors are bogged down with 
caseloads triple those in nearby cities 
we cant even put people in jail said police officer maria 
schade who for two years has been pursuing streetlevel dealers in 
the citys central business district its got to be a felony or 
a warrant 
more troubling violent crime has become almost commonplace 
there were 23 murders in the county last year following a record 
28 the year before as recently as 1984 only nine murders were 
recorded 
not coincidentally requests from county residents for gun 
permits jumped from 411 in 1986 to 2256 in 1989 sheriff doug 
blair said 
police chief pleas green says nearly all the murders are 
drugrelated and believes its only a matter of time before one of 
his officers is killed 
we have stepped up training in officer survival techniques 
he said 
an example of the scope of the areas drug trade was last 
augusts dea raid that broke up two longtime drugdealing families 
in the yakima valley and produced 18 arrests in yakima tacoma 
seattle and portland ore 
for 15 years the multigeneration drug families had provided up 
to 200 kilograms of cocaine a month to the seattle and portland 
areas dreisbach said 
the operation was not that sophisticated but provided another 
example of the drug pipeline police have come to know and fear 
they get into a car and drive it south dreisbach said 
they put drugs in the car and drive it north

like many residents auto parts dealer 
jose chavez has developed a fear of teenagers in his crimeplagued 
colonia near the south texas border 
his advice for visitors if you stop there at nighttime and 
you see a bunch of kids you better not stop 
they might be tricity bombers a youth gang claiming lopezville 
as its territory other gangs roam many of hidalgo countys rural 
colonias the scores of impoverished subdivisions where migrant 
farm workers live along unpaved streets without adequate water 
sewers or drainage 
in this farming region separated from the rest of the country by 
huge ranches people wonder how they ended up with a social problem 
considered symptomatic of bigcity angst and alienation 
how did they get an asphalt jungle in a place where the 
streets arent even paved 
officials say the lower rio grande valleys gangs remain 
relatively unsophisticated yet just as in los angeles chicago 
and other cities they steal fight and attack enemies windows 
with rocks and bullets 
sometimes they kill in january a gunfight between what police 
said were rival gang members left two young men dead in the town of 
san juan 
it is the despair of poverty some say that leads to gang 
membership along with a high school dropout rate that hovers 
around 50 percent 
kids are real bored man said gabriel benavides a 
17yearold still in school who has been named by the hildago 
county sheriffs department as a tricity bombers leader 
the gang which claims about 200 members is named for the 
cities of pharr san juan and alamo which share a school district 
the spraypainted tcb initials show up everywhere in lopezville 
its like having an outside family were all brothers 
benavides said putting his fist on his heart with the index and 
pinky fingers extended the tcb salute 
they dont like to fight he said but cautioned i have a 
tendency to cause pain if you give me trouble i have a tendency 
to cause pain if you dont mess with me i wont give you pain 
tcb member jorge alberto cantu 20 remains in jail without 
bond accused in the shooting deaths of two males who authorities 
said belonged to a gang called the spoilers tcb members confrnted 
a group of spoilers outside a san juan video arcade the night of 
jan 5 said police chief rene lizcano 
parents of the victims 14yearold guadalupe gonzalez jr and 
his 21yearold cousin miguel ojeda said neither belonged to a 
gang 
he was going to get married a week later oralia ojeda said 
of her son 
chavez gave up on keeping glass in the windows at his small 
store joes auto parts gang members would throw rocks through 
them in revenge every time he painted over the graffiti they 
sprayed on his storefront he said now the windows are covered 
with heavy sheets of plywood 
one night a brick sailed through the front window of chavezs 
house and hit his wife in the head he said another day someone 
fired shots into the cab of his truck 
a lot of these people they dont say nothing because theyre 
afraid these kids will come and do something at their house at 
night while theyre asleep chavez said 
two years ago five area gang members were convicted of beating 
a 27yearold man to death with a baseball bat outside a 
convenience store they left his 33yearold brother with permanent 
brain damage said chief deputy bob davis of the sheriffs 
department 
apparently it wasnt over anything davis said these 
guys were on their turf 
davis estimates about 25 gangs operate in the countys rural 
areas covered by only seven patrol cars gang members smashed the 
windows out of four patrol cars in a melee last halloween 
some residents say the gangs have been around for nearly a 
decade but drew authorities attention only after the cars were 
attacked 
the developments worry j michael olivero a criminal justice 
professor at the university of texaspan american in edinburg 
olivero who studied gangs in the chicago area believes the 
south texas groups could become sophisticated crime rings involved 
in extortion drug trafficking and other crimes typical of urban 
gangs 
they found a kid with an uzi olivero said the things 
arent cheap 
graffiti representing california and illinois gangs has started 
appearing on area walls which olivero said could result from 
children of migrant farm families traveling to other states 
community leaders have been meeting recently to address the gang 
problem and say parks and jobs would help kids stay out of trouble 
school officials meanwhile have promised a late afternoon bus 
route to give students in outlying areas a chance to participate in 
extracurricular activities 
chris willingham head counselor at the local high school said 
the transient lives of migrant farm workers keep many children 
offbalance at school many arrive late in the year and leave 
early she said 
were going to have to address the educational needs of these 
kids olivero said and were going to have to get them water 
and get them roads and things like that to facilitate a sense of 
pride kids who are integrated with family church and school dont 
join gangs 
but while lizcano the san juan police chief acknowledges the 
county has a problem he rejects the theory that gangs are fostered 
by poverty and hopelessness 
i grew up in a colonia myself he said and im a chief of 
police

windows of bungalows lining the streets of the 
citys industrial southeast side are starting to sport new signs 
an airplane stamped with a red circle and a slash 
the message no airport 
mayor richard m daleys plan to build a third metropolitan 
airport near the indiana line has sparked heated debate among 
politicians in two states and across the neighborhoods that would 
be bulldozed and replaced with runways 
daley announced the 49 billion project two weeks ago saying 
it represents jobs and an investment that would help revitalize the 
area site of shuttered steel mills and toxic dumps 
but indiana officials are fighting for a share of any new 
airport that might be built to alleviate congestion at chicagos 
ohare international the worlds busiest a bistate committee 
already had been considering four possible sites none in chicago 
and even in hegewisch a mixed industrial and residential 
neighborhood daleys lake calumet airport would displace there is 
no consensus 
why should we have to leave why should somebody tell us where 
to live homeowner janet chibicki said last week 
but contractor james amendola a resident for 26 years says 
there are any number of reasons to bulldoze hegewisch for an 
airport 
i think itd be really good for the area considering we got 
dumps on one side killing us the waters contaminated what have 
we got left alls we got left is people got pride he said 
on one street a block of white frame houses deadends with a 
view of a flaming smokestack at the ltv steel yard at the william 
w powers state fish and wildlife area picnic tables overlook oil 
tanks on the opposite shore of wolf lake 
under the mayors proposal 5510 to 9360 homes would be 
replaced by runways in chicagos hegewisch and south deering 
neighborhoods and in suburban burnham and calumet city 
it took everything we have to get this house now theyre 
going to take it away from us said mrs chibicki she and her 
husband gary saved 10 years before buying it for 64000 in 1988 
and she does not think theyll get a fair price for it 
i dont think anybody even the powerful mayor of the city of 
chicago has the right to literally destroy neighborhoods when you 
have options 20 miles south or east of us said calumet city 
mayor robert stefaniak 
no option has won federal support and even if lake calumet 
airport is built it would not open for about 20 years 
the airport would cover 9400 acres compared with ohares 
7700 acres the city intends to pay for it with bonds federal 
grants and either a 225 tax on travelers at ohare and midway 
airport on the southwest side or state and local taxes 
the city estimates the airport would create more than 200000 
permanent jobs and each year would inject 137 billion into the 
regional economy 
the city has pledged to reimburse homeowners at fairmarket 
value and to pay moving expenses and a relocation allowance said 
marj halperin daleys deputy press secretary 
daleys announcement also spawned a political fight because it 
preempts the illinoisindiana committee that already had chosen 
four finalist airport sites two in indiana and two south of 
chicago 
sen dan coats rind has enlisted the aid of fellow 
republicans including senate minority leader bob dole to fight 
daleys plan 
the mayors plan is clearly unfair to indiana which has 
played by the rules from the beginning in the selection process for 
that new airport coats said 
he is trying to block 52 million the city requested from the 
federal aviation administration to produce a master plan for the 
airport 
rep pete visclosky dind has accused us transportation 
secretary samuel skinner former chairman of the regional 
transportation authority of northern illinois of favoring the city 
all ive agreed to do is not eliminate any choices skinner 
said last week after meeting with coats and dole

while jittery southern californians sweated 
out earthquake aftershocks last week officials took another step 
in a pioneering effort to issue warnings when they believe stronger 
jolts might be on the way 
were trying to save lives and property with whatever 
knowledge the scientists can derive from their instruments said 
michael guerin spokesman for californias office of emergency 
services 
researchers are still a long way from being able to predict the 
exact time and place of earthquakes but they are learning to use 
statistics on historical quakes to estimate the odds that one jolt 
might be followed soon by a larger one 
there is about a 5 percent chance a moderate quake in california 
will be followed within three days by an equal or bigger jolt 
according to research by us geological survey seismologists paul 
reasenberg and lucile jones 
so four hours after a moderate quake measuring 55 on the 
richter scale shook southern california on wednesday the office of 
emergency services issued a formal earthquake advisory to four 
counties and the news media it said scientists believed an equally 
powerful or stronger quake could happen within three days 
the advisory officials avoided calling it a warning or 
prediction expired saturday without a bigger quake although 
dozens of smaller aftershocks rattled the region including one 
that measured 34 on the richter scale sunday 
it was only the fifth time since 1985 the state issued such an 
advisory 
the other advisories which also expired without a strong quake 
were issued in june 1984 after three magnitude4 quakes in san 
diego in july 1986 after a 61 quake in the eastern sierra nevada 
and in june 1988 and august 1989 following 50 and 52 temblors on 
the san andreas fault south of san francisco bay 
the section of the san andreas involved in the 1988 and 1989 
advisories finally ruptured on oct 17 1989 in the 71magnitude 
earthquake that killed 67 people in the san francisco bay region 
officials have said the advisories raised the level of public 
preparedness for that disaster 
because of differing scientific opinions and a desire to avoid 
public panic the latest advisory was even more vaguely worded than 
previous ones guerin said it neither cited a percentage 
likelihood for a larger quake nor said how large that quake might 
be 
right now in this branch of science vague is 
stateoftheart guerin said 
al langworthy a san bernardino county emergency planner said 
the advisory didnt alter local precautions undertaken after the 
main quake 
but lt gary schoeller of the los angeles county sheriffs 
emergency operations bureau said quake advisories can spur 
authorities and citizens to take precautions 
examples include taking fire trucks outside fire stations 
which might collapse and crush them and alerting our people 
there may be a need to call them to duty schoeller said 
guerin said the state hopes citizens heed advisories by avoiding 
hazardous old buildings during highrisk periods moving home 
furnishings that might topple making sure a wrench is available to 
shut off gas lines knowing the whereabouts of relatives and 
stockpiling food water flashlights radios and batteries 
but the higher the potential for disaster the greater the 
caution by officials 
a magnitude62 quake near the californiamexico border on nov 
23 1987 spurred an allnight vigil by scientists and officials as 
aftershocks migrated toward the san andreas fault they debated 
whether to issue an advisory saying the quake might be a foreshock 
to the longfeared 83magnitude big one the government has 
said might kill 14000 people 
no advisory was issued and the big one didnt happen but 
the 62 quake was followed 12 hours later by a magnitude66 jolt 
on another nearby fault ninetyfour people were injured

soviet gunners disguised as egyptian soldiers shot 
down 21 israeli fighter jets in the summer of 1970 during 
egyptianisraeli combat near the suez canal a soviet newspaper 
reports 
the soviets openly assisted the egyptian army until a 1971 break 
in sovietegyptian relations but neither country had formally 
revealed that the soviets engaged in direct combat with israeli 
warplanes 
the sovietskaya rossiya newspaper quoted a retired soviet 
colonel konstantin popov as saying divisions of soviet 
antiaircraft gunners were involved in the combat bringing down 
israeli mirage and phantom fighters 
it said popov commanded one of the divisions near suez and 
recalled the fights with israeli planes in detail in a fullpage 
article 
the officially soviet press which has been reporting on 
previously censored chapters of the soviet militarys past carried 
a similar revelation last year about the combat role of soviet 
advisers in the vietnam war 
popov described how soviet soldiers in civilian dress were 
smuggled on a merchant ship from the black sea into the 
mediterranean past corrupt turkish guards and then transported to 
egypt 
on june 30 1970 a soviet division brought down its first 
phantom popov was quoted as saying on july 18 eight soviet 
troops were killed when they were hit by israeli planes 
in all during the military activity of the soviet pilots and 
gunners 21 israeli planes were brought down sovietskaya rossiya 
said 
popov credited the soviet gunners with stopping israeli air 
attacks on egypt they forced the israelis to understand that 
soviet gunners would not allow them to act freely in the skies over 
egypt and heighten aggression the article said 
popov was unimpressed however by the reward he said the 
government of egypt gave the soviet troops on their departure some 
hastily stamped aluminum medals

gen augusto pinochet is taking his final 
bows declaring democracy restored after a coup and more than 16 
years in power but the civilians who will follow him say the job 
has just begun 
pinochet says he is leaving a thriving orderly nation to 
presidentelect patricio aylwin who takes office march 11 
we promised to restore democracy and we have done it 
pinochet said recently on a farewell tour of this narrow 
3000milelong nation on south americas west coast we gave it 
the indispensable stability required for living in peace freedom 
and solidarity 
his critics dont see it that way 
the transition to democracy will be very very hard but the 
alternative to tackling the difficulties is remaining under a 
dictatorship said jorge arrate head of the socialist party 
his party is prominent in aylwins centerleft coalition arrate 
and others in the alliance say they are inheriting a powder keg of 
social problems long ignored or suppressed by pinochets military 
government 
they say the new administration will be hardpressed by the need 
for more social services wage demands from labor and the desire 
for justice in cases of human rights abuses 
pinochet 74 insists on retaining command of the 60000man 
army for up to eight more years as permitted by the 1980 
constitution his government wrote 
he also hints at an eventual return to power and has not ruled 
out running in the 1994 election at public gatherings in the 
waning days of his presidency supporters can be heard shouting 
youll be back soon or until 1994 
the general held a referendum in 1988 trying to get approval 
for an eightyear extension of his presidency but the voters said 
no that forced him to call an election and aylwin a 71yearold 
centrist christian democrat got 55 percent of the vote 
small but enthusiastic crowds have turned out for pinochets 
farewell tour which uses the slogan mission accomplished 
pinochet proudly tells them that chile enjoys one of latin 
americas healthiest economies one of its lowest inflation rates 
about 20 percent a year and a gross national product that has 
grown steadily for six years 
he says the political and social disorder that was rampant when 
he overthrew the elected government of president salvador allende 
an avowed marxist in september 1973 has been replaced by an 
orderly society 
the 1980 constitution provides an institutional bulwark against 
chaos or a communist threat according to pinochet 
critics however consider the claims unfounded and the tour a 
disgrace 
this idea that we have to express our gratitude its 
absurd arrate said hes the only chilean president ever to 
stage a farewell carnival 
arrate said pinochets claim to have laid the institutional 
groundwork for democracy was contradicted by lastminute laws that 
cut aylwins authority and gave armed forces unprecedented 
autonomy among other changes 
the new government plans to modify many of the laws but the 
problem is you lose time in undoing those things said ricardo 
ffrenchdavis an economist with aylwins christian democratic 
party 
he said pinochets pride in the economic growth of the last six 
years is arbitrary like so many arbitrary things that have 
occurred under this government 
pinochet also must take responsibility for the worst recession 
in latin america in the early 1980s when production in chile 
fell by more than 13 percent and unemployment soared to 20 percent 
or more ffrenchdavis said 
improvement since then has represented recovery with very 
little growth the economist said and poor people have not had a 
proper share in it 
if you take the top 20 percent of the population and the 
bottom 20 percent the gap has been growing all these years he 
said 
ffrenchdavis said there is a desperate need for better public 
education and health services but he and other economists in 
aylwins camp praise the existing freemarket exportoriented 
economic program and do not plan major changes 
to distribute chiles wealth the economy must grow and for 
the economy to grow you must have stability he said 
most unions were suppressed under pinochet and aylwin also 
expects a chorus of demands for higher wages but arrate said 
workers and the poor must not expect too much 
we cant correct from one day to the next all the inequities 
that have accumulated during 16 years he said all we can do 
is give signs that the government has changed its tendency 
democracy is expected to bring a cry for justice in hundreds of 
pending cases of alleged human rights violations by security 
forces at least 700 people disappeared after the coup and 
thousands were jailed and tortured 
demands by rights groups for swift and severe punishment 
probably will not be met aylwin has stressed the need for national 
reconciliation and said justice must be tempered by a spirit of 
pardon

a former president of brandeis univesity and 
his wife are suspected to be among the americans killed in last 
weeks fire at a luxury hotel a us embassy spokeswoman said 
sunday 
the spokeswoman said the bodies of marver bernstein and his wife 
were believed to be in the cairo morgue but she could not confirm 
the deaths until a medical report was received so far she said 
they are listed as unaccounted for 
dr kamal elsaadani of cairos central morgue said friday that 
a man with a similar name was among the dead and that the body of 
an unidentified woman was thought to be that of his wife 
if confirmed the deaths would bring to four the number of 
americans killed in the hotel fire thursday at the heliopolis 
sheraton in which 17 people died 
according to the washington post bernstein 71 was dean of the 
woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs at 
princeton university before serving as president of brandeis in 
waltham mass from 1972 to 1983 he then joined the faculty of 
the georgetown school of foreign service where he taught both 
politics and philosophy and coordinated the schools american 
courses program 
after his retirement from georgetown last year he remained as a 
lecturer bernstein born in mankato minn and sheva rosenthal a 
native of st paul minn married in 1943 the paper said 
also sunday police said all cairo hotels will be checked for 
adequate firefighting equipment 
maj gen fahr eldin khaled head of the tourist police said a 
police committee would check all hotels whether or not they have 
canvas tents similar to the one at the sheraton where the fire 
started 
this committee will prepare a comprehensive report which will 
be presented to the tourism minister to take suitable procedures so 
that such accidents do not happen in egypt again khaled said 
according to the official middle east news agency 
sheraton officials have insisted that a fire alarm was sounded 
when the fire spread from its garden tent restaurant to the hotel 
building itself early thursday 
they said hotel workers tried to put out the blaze with 
extinguishers but strong winds caused it to spread so quickly it 
became uncontrollable 
survivors said there was no fire alarm or sprinkler system 
egyptian officials have said the canvas tents popular at most 
luxury hotels in egypt are illegal because they are fire hazards 
but spokesmen for four major hotels in cairo contacted by the 
associated press said their tents had adequate safety precautions 
and there was no plan to dismantle them 
it was not immediately clear if officials would ban the tents 
which usually house restaurants or nightclubs 
tourism is one of egypts main sources of foreign currency in 
1989 24 million tourists visited egypt bringing 23 billion 
into the country according to official figures

the huge blueandwhite banner behind the 
president of the national education association declared no more 
reports no more speeches we want action 
that backdrop signaled the groups intention to press for 
innovations it says are needed in the nations schools 
over the past five years we at nea have launched program 
after program at the cutting edge of the movement to restructure 
americas schools said keith geiger nea president we have 
helped launch educational improvement projects at the school 
district and state level in almost every one of our states more 
than 600 projects and programs 
geigers speech delivered at the national press club was 
hardly unusual for a labor leader trying to boost the standing of 
his membership but it also illustrated the eagerness with which 
the nea along with hundreds of other education leaders and 
politicians has endorsed the notion of restructuring the 
nations schools 
the idea has gained attention and momentum as president bush and 
the nations governors set and promote education goals 
geigers speech was timed to coincide with the winter meeting of 
the national governors association this past week the session 
focused on completing six national goals and agreeing on the 
restructuring needed to achieve them 
these goals are ambitious yet they can and must be 
achieved said the nga document however they cannot be 
achieved by our education system as it is presently constituted 
substantial even radical changes will have to be made 
the nga defined restructuring as changing what is taught and how 
it is taught to get away from an emphasis on lowlevel basics and 
instead make sure that students are involved in challenging 
learning activities 
the american association of school administrators said 
restructuring might include changes in the curriculum variations 
in federalstatelocal relationships reform in the way teachers 
are prepared and paid dealing more effectively with atrisk 
students or simply fostering changes in the way people think 
gov booth gardner of washington told reporters at the nga 
meeting all governors made a commitment to lead restructuring 
efforts in their states 
for example maine gov john mckernan jr pointed to a rural 
middle school which has been divided into teams of teachers and 
students who spend two years together the teams have their own 
budgets and the flexibility to set their own schedules and goals 
within broad school guidelines 
officials said discipline problems are down and student 
involvement in learning is up 
it takes educators a while to learn that they can go beyond 
existing boundaries said mckernan the cumulative effect of 
many regulations built up over the years has been to create an 
ingrained way of thinking and operating 
gov steve cowper of alaska told how students from eskimo 
villages are invited to study at an openenrollment high school in 
sitka the curriculum focuses on pacific basin trade opportunities 
and includes instruction in chinese japanese and russian 
south carolina gov carroll campbell said 328 companies in his 
state have been encouraged to open classrooms at plant sites he 
said workers can take remedial education courses or upgrade their 
skills the program uses federalstate job training funds he said 
other examples given were of vermont gov madeleine kunins 
focus on services to atrisk 3 and 4yearolds to ensure they 
enter school prepared for learning and connecticut gov william 
oneills investment of state aid to cities and towns and a boost 
of teachers salaries to the second highest in the nation 
students at the lassiter middle school in louisville ky who 
turn in unsatisfactory work do not get a failing grade instead 
the teachers work with them until the students work is up to 
standard 
the goals of these projects are almost identical to the 
national goals said geiger 
to share information on the projects the nea created a network 
called the national center for innovation in education geiger said 
the center has the capacity to involve all of neas 2 million 
members working in schools in every community in america 
two years ago the american federation of teachers began a 
center for restructuring to serve as a clearinghouse and to develop 
a network among school districts and local unions 
one of the aft projects is a joint venture with apple computer 
to create a multimedia resource that teachers can use to learn 
about projects in other areas 
restructured schools need not start from scratch and they 
need not operate by trial and error said an aft brochure

from a small ground floor office in a 
republican stronghold one of the leaders of the postwatergate 
democratic surge is plotting his congressional comeback after eight 
years in political exile 
toby moffett came to washington in 1974 as one of the 
watergate babies reformminded democrats bent on cleaning up 
the tarnished image of american politics 
twice a loser in bids for statewide office in connecticut 
moffett has decided the house is what he enjoys after all 
i think its an important time to go back to washington he 
said 
moffett gave up his house seat in 1982 to wage an unsuccessful 
challenge to thengop sen lowell weicker after another 
disappointing showing in 1986 when he failed to get on the 
democratic primary ballot for governor moffett spent three 
unsatisfying years as a television anchor 
i was really looking to do something more challenging 
moffett said its really a process of trying to understand what 
you do best and what you enjoy doing best 
the 45yearold father of five recently moved to newton in 
connecticuts fifth district to run for a seat being vacated by 
us rep john rowland a republican candidate for governor 
lets be honest moffett said congressional seats dont 
open up very often and this seat opened up in an area that i feel 
very comfortable with 
and as he plots his comeback moffett is tailoring his 
statements and positions to an audience of rockribbed republicans 
and bluecollar democrats 
in january he proposed allowing the president to order the 
assassination of foreign leaders who commit criminal acts and 
threaten us interests he says he could accept a fair version 
of a capital gains tax cut and even says there may be enough room 
in the federal budget to pass a tax break for the middle class 
his comments on federal programs do nothing to support the label 
of bigspending liberal that one gop opponent has tried to attach 
to moffett 
were not going to have for the foreseeable future a lot of 
money to play with to do great new things moffett said we 
have to focus 
moffett brings to the race the 90 percent name recognition of 
his four terms in congress and three years as a television anchor 
in hartford in washington he has the backing of some of his 
former colleagues including house majority leader richard gephardt 
and other leaders who have promised him first crack at prestigious 
committee assignments 
but moffett would be the first to admit that his political 
comeback is anything but a foregone conclusion 
he faces a democratic opponent shelton mayor michael pacowta 
who commands strong support in the party apparatus five 
republicans are vying for the nomination including one candidate 
james mclaughlin who recently referred to moffett as a 
freewheeling nutty cocky bigspending liberal of the 1970s 
and moffett will be running with the carpetbagger label in 
the states most conservative district at a time when rowland 
highly popular locally may be the top republican on the statewide 
ballot and although moffett was successful as a congressional 
candidate he is 0 for 2 in his most recent political battles 
clearly three strikes and youre out in this business its a 
lot like baseball and hes got two strikes said dick foley 
head of the connecticut republican party hes out of step with 
connecticut and out of step with america and that means youre way 
out of step with the fifth district 
moffett came to congress at age 29 with a background of 
grassroots citizen advocacy and motto of making old laws work 
in 1979 he became the youngest subcommittee chairman in house 
history by taking over an energy and environment panel moffett 
investigated top reagan administration officials james watt the 
interior secretary and anne gorsuch burford head of the 
environmental protection agency worked on acid rain legislation 
and new formulas for medicaid reimbursements and improved 
evacuation plans for nuclear plants 
political scientist william schneider who has written 
extensively on the class of 74 disagrees with those who say 
moffett wont survive in his new more conservative district 
the class of 74 democrats were unique in that they learned 
how to survive in republican districts schneider said the group 
included onetime presidential candidates gary hart michael dukakis 
and jerry brown all politicians who in various offices were able 
to set themselves apart from traditional bigspending democrats 
schneider said

the house of representatives legislative 
agenda is so light you could hear a bill drop but you dont hear 
second thoughts about the record pay raise the lawmakers gave 
themselves last fall 
the plan to boost house salaries by onethird by 1991 was so 
sensitive that only extraordinary cooperation by house republicans 
and democrats and president bush made passage possible the two 
parties even agreed to punish their own candidates if they raise 
the issue in this years house elections 
now eight months before election day the deal is holding 
house salaries have quietly risen from 89500 to 96600 the 
foremost question in the capitol is whether the senate which took 
a similar cost of living raise this year will join the houses 
decision to take a hefty 25 percent pay installment next january 
if senators look toward the house to judge the political winds 
theyll find comforting balmy breezes 
both democratic and republican leadership offices say 
constituent mail on the issue has slowed to a trickle 
so far no one has introduced legislation to repeal the house 
raise 
last fall 174 members of the 435member house voted against it 
but even in that group the pay plan may be settling in comfortably 
roll call capitol hills local newspaper found 65 of those who 
voted against the pay raise now say theyll keep the dough only 15 
said they would give it all back to the treasury the bulk of the 
others either were undecided or didnt respond 
rep dick armey rtexas voted against the pay raise but 
having lost that battle he has no doubt he should keep the money 
hes obviously doing a better job than 99 percent of the guys 
up here says his spokesman ed gillespie he votes against a 
lot of federal programs as well but once they are funded he wants 
to make sure his constituents get a fair share it doesnt make 
sense to do a better job than your colleagues and get paid less 
and his constituents would agree 
some who voted against the raise decline to return the money to 
the treasury but instead promise to turn the money over to charity 
they can score political points both for turning down the raise and 
as philanthropists 
for example rep jim jontz dind is turning down this years 
pay raise as he did the previous boost hes putting the money into 
a scholarship fund he set up in his congressional district to 
provide stipends to deserving students 
the pay raise was such a big issue with the public in early 1989 
that it helped topple former house speaker jim wright dtexas is 
it possible that voters have slipped into apathy 
marshall taylor of the national taxpayers union says the public 
memory isnt as short as the politicians might like and his group 
doesnt consider nex januarys pay hike a fait accompli 
its kind of seething below the surface with voters he 
said this ticks a lot of people off he said and should be a 
campaign issue even if the two parties try to avoid it 
people who vote against the pay and then keep the money are 
another issue its kind of hypocritical taylor said what 
are you telling the voters i went on record but hey ill 
take more 
while slumbering now the pay issue is almost certain to heat up 
as the year goes on 
the senate unless it takes action faces the uncomfortable 
prospect of being paid less than the house and several senators 
including christopher dodd dconn and timothy wirth dcolo 
are pushing to ban senators from paid speechmaking as the house 
will do next year such a ban on outside earnings would further 
increase pressure for a salary hike 
the senate is so politically fearful but so loath to fall behind 
the house that theres already talk of a pay raise bill in a 
lameduck session after the november election 
the permutations which arise with the pay raise issue can be 
baffling 
in roll calls house survey several respondents said they would 
keep the 25 percent pay raise in 1991 only if they were reelected 
so if they lose theyll give it back

president bush whose speeches are not 
renowned for their memorable prose is trying out warmup material 
in the johnny carson style of newsoriented opening monologues 
on his justfinished trip to california the president unveiled 
some topical oneliners that registered stronger on the laugh meter 
than the ripple of twittering one expects at such political 
functions 
bush got things off to a rolling start at a new york fundraiser 
for congressional candidate susan molinari when he mentioned the 
headlinegrabber of the day 
here i am in the middle of the battle right here in new york 
where one of the great contests of 1990 will take place a lot at 
stake theres been a lot of money spent on both sides a lot of 
press attention bush paused but im not here to talk about 
the trumps 
the next day prolonged chuckling swept a ballroom breakfast of 
the academy of television arts and sciences in los angeles when 
bush said 
being president does have its advantages i have a tv set 
there in the white house with five screens one big one in the 
middle four small ones around it all of them on at once now i 
dont have to miss the nightly news while i watch wheel of 
fortune 
he told the tv industry audience he had six education goals for 
the country to achieve by the year 2000 
and this morning i want to add a seventh goal by the year 
2000 all americans must be able to set the clocks on their vcrs 
bush couldnt resist a couple of jabs at his old nemesis daniel 
ortega the leftist president of nicaragua who was voted out of 
office feb 25 in an upset by the usbacked candidate violeta 
chamorro 
he said molinaris father rep guy molinari was one of his 
oldest allies even when no one gave bush much of a chance to win 
the presidency back then the pollsters had it figured out about 
the way they figured out nicaragua he said 
at a san francisco fundraiser for sen pete wilson bush 
predicted wilson would be californias next governor but he 
warned just dont use the same pollster ortega did 
other snippets from the presidential joke file during his 
california trip 
something that really impresses me about california is the 
west coasts will to survive even triumph in adversity new ways to 
cope spring up no matter what kind of disaster strikes somebody 
told me theres even a new support group in malibu called parents 
without perrier 
georgia frontiere owner of the los angeles rams football team 
has built one of the toughest teams in pro football who says 
theres no role for women in combat

librarians are asking congress to guarantee 
public access to information generated by the nations largest 
compiler of facts the government itself 
the american library association says the bush administration so 
far hasnt lived up to a promise to reverse reagan administration 
policies which curtailed how much information the government 
gathers and restricted its distribution 
specifically the 50000member association is concerned that 
making information available through electronic means and not on 
paper could wind up limiting access or costing the user for what 
he now gets free 
and the librarians worry about the practice of letting private 
enterprise assume the responsibility of disseminating government 
information in hopes of turning a profit 
a system of information haves and havenots could be 
created big business customers who can afford to buy while 
students individuals libraries and others cannot ala president 
patricia wilson berger testified last month before the senate 
government affairs committee 
the committee is considering legislation reexamining the 
governments information distribution policies 
the association fears that the proposed bill could require 
libraries to pay for information they now get free from the 
government it would permit agencies to require libraries to share 
distribution costs of electronically relayed information 
the taxpayer already has paid to gather and generate and 
maintain this information and shouldnt be asked to pay again to 
get access to it said eileen cooke the alas washington 
representative 
ms berger said she welcomes new technologies which could 
enhance access to information but added they are equally 
capable of erecting artificial barriers to citizens rights to 
know 
she said the problem arises when libraries lack equipment 
software indexes finding aids trained staff and expertise in the 
use of data bases 
since the earliest days of the republic ms berger 
testified the federal government has provided ways to inform the 
public of its activities and to collect information essential to 
its operations today it is the largest collector and publisher of 
information in the united states 
but reagan administration guidelines adopted in 1985 encouraged 
the distribution of government information through private 
enterprise the guidelines also pared the governments publication 
lists 
thousands of publications were scrapped data collection 
programs were scaled back libraries of many federal agencies were 
turned over to private management companies and access to the 
documents of regulatory agencies was made far more difficult the 
ala said 
under the bush administration the omb has promised to revise 
these information policies the association said so far 
however no concrete action has resulted 
a law passed in 1858 requires the government to make its 
publications available to 1346 depository libraries around the 
country in addition 51 regional depositories are required to get 
and keep every publication issued by the government printing 
office last year the gpo distributed 27 million copies of 68000 
different publications to the depository libraries 
as an example of the problem the ala cites an electronic data 
base operated by the agriculture department to furnish commodity 
statistical economic and other agricultural reports 
until 1985 the department released the information through a 
university of nebraska computer system then under new omb 
guidelines the government signed an exclusive contract giving the 
information to martin marietta data systems which sells access to 
it 
according to the ala information once distributed free or at 
nominal costs through the university of nebraska to depository 
libraries now costs 45 an hour from martin marietta or as much as 
96 an hour from clients which get the information from martin 
marietta and redistribute it

a passing generation still talks 
about the golden times in prague when headwaiters shaved twice a 
day coffee houses resounded with freewheeling debate and the 
pastries were more delectable than those in vienna 
if you want glimpses of what once was along with the proletarian 
overlay of recent decades and an absence of the wests trendiness 
come some evening to the cafe europa 
a trio of elderly men plays hapsburg empire melodies while a 
pair of prostitutes eye new arrivals homosexuals in leather 
jackets embrace and a scruffy man hops through the room on one leg 
clutching his crutches 
paintings of seminude goddesses florid mirrors and cut crystal 
chandeliers hallmarks of the art nouveau style adorn the 
premises 
this popular haunt located in the grand hotel europa dates 
back to the turnofthecentury when the czechs were part of the 
austrohungarian empire and the coffee houses of vienna prague and 
budapest centers of social and political life 
their heyday continued for 30 years of independence known 
nostalgically as the golden republic which many czechs today 
hope will serve as a model for the future 
pragues coffee houses their pale remnants can no longer 
evoke the cafe life between the two world wars wrote czech poet 
jaroslav seifert of this era in the coffee houses we discussed 
planned and engaged in passionate polemics and i never had the 
feeling of time being wasted 
there were cafes wrote the 1984 nobel prize winner frequented 
by artists others by high society where the headwaiters had 
themselves shaved twice a day and places which attracted 
students because they carried current newspapers from all over 
europe 
these vanished with the advent of communism rule in 1948 but 
students and dissidents like the countrys new president vaclav 
havel and author ludvik vaculik continued to gather although talk 
was more circumspect and hushed 
in a cup of coffee with my interrogator vaculik wrote that 
it was suspected some tables in every cafe were bugged by the 
authorities 
do you really think that without coffee houses there would 
have been no culture vaculik asks a friend in the book 
no of course culture wasnt created there but it was an 
environment that encouraged it the friend replies 
these days cafe talk is once again openly freewheeling and while 
the snooping devices may have been dismantled the places 
themselves have yet to slough off the outer shabbiness and a 
roughness of manner to which communist societies everywhere seem 
prone 
the cafe slavia one of the last of the great old coffee houses 
still attracts artists from the nearby opera and theater but 
filthy rags and cigarette butts lie unswept by slouching waiters 
the future of pragues coffee houses like many institutions in 
the dramatically changing society seems to hang in the balance 
will the countrys leaders and leading actresses once again be 
mercilessly dissected over coffee and cake will the onetime sense 
of stylishness return with an improving economy will the coffee 
houses succumb to upmarket chic catering more to tourists than 
local characters 
meanwhile at the cafe europa matrons sip coffee topped with 
whipped cream for 10 crowns 25 cents and earnest young men down 
good czech white wine for 18 crowns a glass the three grayhaired 
bespectacled men could stand a neater fit to their suits and better 
tuning of their instruments 
during a break a west german businessman buys the trio beers 
and in a booming voice offers a lecture about all the changes they 
are to expect when capitalistic ways take hold 
they nod politely go back to violin viola and piano and after 
their strauss and lehar staples venture into broadway tunes and 
as time goes by

nicaraguan rebels said sunday they 
have taken steps toward demobilization and that presidentelect 
violeta barrios de chamorro should replace the sandinista army with 
a civilian police force 
the ussupported contra rebels said in a statement that they 
are in contact with leaders of the united national opposition 
coalition which upset the leftist sandinistas in nicaraguas feb 
25 elections 
the resistance is conscious that there will be an authentic 
democratization process in nicaragua the statement said for 
that reason it is willing to change its role of insurgent army to 
one of civic and political positions 
we have begun to take the necessary steps to demobilize our 
combatants in search for mechanisms and guarantees appropriate to 
the current situation in nicaragua it said 
in managua sandinista president daniel ortega said he would 
need more information about which elements in the contras made the 
statement but believed it would be good news for all the people 
of nicaragua 
we need to wait for more information because the communique 
from honduras has no signature ortega told the associated press 
as he was leaving church sunday night 
a commission sent by the incoming government of nicaragua was to 
meet with rebel leaders in tegucigalpa this week to discuss their 
return home 
the archbishop of managua cardinal miguel obando y bravo said 
sunday he would send two representatives to honduras to sound out 
the plans of the contra rebels 
im sending them to make a sounding before i say a word i 
want to know what the situation is the cardinal told reporters 
after saying mass in his las sierritas parish he said his 
representatives would go tuesday or wednesday 
i believe that once there is democratization the armed 
resistance has no reason for being he said 
the rebels said they also had begun to renew contact with the 
international support and verification commission on guarantees for 
the safety of those returning to nicaragua the commission was 
created under an aug 7 1989 agreement among five central 
american presidents to disband the contras 
the statement which offered strong support for mrs chamorro 
also said her government should replace the sandinista army with a 
civilian police force 
it did not say when that should happen 
the statement from the nicaraguan resistance titled position 
of the resistance on the triumph of democracy in nicaragua said 
the speed of demobilization of the contras and their families would 
depend on the guarantees and logistics 
about 10000 rebels and their families have been in camps on the 
honduran side of the border since the united states halted military 
aid in february 1988 the honduran government has said another 
30000 nicaraguans sought shelter the past 10 years in border 
provinces 
the rebels said they have ordered an absolute halt in 
hostilities and asked the coalition and the verification 
commission to apply a special policy of persuasion to the 4000 
rebels estimated to have gone into nicaragua since september 
the rebel statement followed three days of talks between rebel 
military leaders and harry shlaudeman president bushs special 
envoy

folk singer tracy chapman shuns the fame she 
quickly found after her 1988 debut album soared to the top of the 
charts and won her three grammy awards including best new artist 
i guess if there were some way to choose what i wanted or 
didnt want from what my success has brought me i would choose not 
to have the celebrity chapman said in an interview in the march 
12 issue of time 
i dont think im very good at it 
chapmans first album tracy chapman hit no 1 on the 
billboard pop charts and sold 10 million copies her second album 
crossroads has sold 4 million copies since its release five 
months ago the albums mix songs protesting poverty and racism with 
love songs 
chapman who begins an american tour in may said she is hurt by 
criticism of her music by other blacks 
there are people who have gone so far as to say that im not 
black or not part of the black musical tradition she said i 
think the reason i dont get played on black radio stations is 
because i dont fit into their present format and theyre not 
willing to make a space for me 
im upset by what has been said because it doesnt speak well 
of black people chapman said you know it basically says 
black people dont respond in a cerebral manner to music and 
thats just not true

china and the leadership in china refuses to recognize 
reality and thats freedom and democracy eventually 
president bush came under heavy fire from congress after 
revelations that brent scowcroft his national security adviser 
and lawrence eagleburger the deputy secretary of state traveled 
to beijing for meetings shortly after the chinese cracked down on 
prodemocracy student activists at tiananmen square in early june 
some members of congress have complained that bush moved too 
quickly to establish smooth relations with china which has done 
little to loosen restrictions on dissent since the summer 
bush vetoed legislation that would have barred the united states 
from sending chinese students back to their country when their 
visas expire and the senate upheld the veto after assurances that 
an executive order would accomplish the same result 
quayle defended the us policy saying the administration was 
not going to stick our head in the sand and say that china 
isnt important 
at the same time he said some us sanctions on china remain in 
place 
on other issues quayle refused to make a firm commitment on 
what kind of financial package the united states might be willing 
to offer nicaraguas newly elected government 
we will meet the demands of whatever is necessary he said 
a group of nicaraguans representing presidentelect violeta barrios 
de chamorro is expected to be in washington and new york this week 
asking for 300 million in aid 
quayle also praised daniel ortega nicaraguas ousted sandinista 
leader as being very conciliatory after ortega promised 
earlier on the same program to turn over nicaraguas government on 
april 25 and to respect its constitution 
i thought it was on target and perhaps it appears that we do 
have a new daniel ortega that is truly committed to democracy 
said quayle 
chamorro defeated ortega on feb 25 
both chamorro and ortega have called for the demobilization of 
the contra rebels many of whom remain at camps in honduras the 
contras have said they would remain intact until after chamorros 
inauguration in april 
quayle said the key to demobilizing the 12000 contras is a 
peaceful transition while some contras already have laid down 
their weapons and returned to nicaragua they have done so on a 
voluntary basis he said 
when democracy is there and it appears that its going to be 
and when the contras feel secure they will demobilize he said 
thats part of the peace plan

town meetings usually come and go 
without much of a stir in this quiet coastal community but a plan 
to abolish local taxes promises to breathe new life into yankee 
democracy this year 
a lot of people are going who wouldnt normally be there 
said mark gross one of 1200 residents in the blueberrycanning 
community 
the proposal to scrap property taxes in 1991 and replace them 
with voluntary contributions and user fees has got a lot of 
people around town a little nervous said gross who calls the 
plan a lot of crazy ideas 
but to royce perkins who is leading the taxfreedom charge from 
his handbuilt log home deep in the woods scuttling taxes seems as 
natural as lighting a fire in a woodburning stove or skinning a 
weasel 
perkins 53 a father of five whose 150 acres roll over scenic 
woodlands along a jagged coastal peninsula envisions a system in 
which noncompulsory payments and payasyougo fees finance only 
those services that people really want and really need 
one of the great joys of life is to own your own home outright 
and clear but when you have taxes against your home its like a 
constant mortgage he said property taxation is like holding a 
sword over the land 
a wildlife biologist and salmon fisherman in alaska for about 20 
years perkins returned with his family to his native environs 
several years ago also a former teacher he educates his children 
at home he runs the local landfill and also operates an 
earthmoving business 
his proposal is on the agenda for tuesdays town meeting because 
35 people five more than the minimum needed signed a petition 
the man who oversees penobscots 12 million budget 
selectmens board chairman jim henry said hes never heard of such 
an extreme plan he said hell definitely be among those taking a 
stand against it tuesday 
its too idealistic said henry 
still even henry allows that i love the notion of having no 
taxes and he believes the debate among taxpayers is unquestionably 
healthy 
now people know what services the town provides what they 
would lose and what they would have to pay for whereas before 
they paid their taxes and didnt ask questions said henry 
of the total budget 1 million goes to the schools and the 
rest is divided among services that include road maintenance a 
volunteer fire department landfill general government expenses 
and street lights 
perkins sees the string of street lights in the center of 
penobscot a new england tableau of handsome clapboard homes 
church school and town hall overlooking the bay and river by the 
same name as an example of a municipal service that only the 
handful of its users should pay for 
as for the bigticket question of education perkins says the 
state should ultimately pick up the entire tab and issue vouchers 
so that families can send their children to the schools of their 
choice 
his neighbors remain skeptical 
a lot of people if they dont have to pay theyre not going 
to pay said gross 
are you going to put tolls on our town roads and a toll booth 
at the town dump asked kenneth reynolds a fish dealer 
one of the biggest fears is the prospect of being hit with huge 
school bills if parents of students are forced to support the 
schools alone 
in my occupation i couldnt pay to educate my children and 
many others couldnt said rev james robertson of the south 
penobscot baptist church 
perkins said he has received letters of support from people in 
other states but he acknowledged that support among townspeople 
appears light at best but win or lose he said he is gratified his 
oneman tax revolt has at least spurred civic activism 
ive had several say i havent been to a town meeting in 20 
years but im going this time he said

a yearold law requiring 60 days notice for 
plant closings and major layoffs is not causing the trauma for 
business that opponents predicted according to economists and the 
laws supporters 
but others say its impact on workers is marginal and that 
struggling companies find compliance difficult and confusing 
the measure was passed by congress in 1988 amid complaints that 
it was an anticompetitive threat to industry thenpresident 
reagan who allowed it to become law without his signature called 
it a ticking time bomb for companies 
i dont see any devastating effects on businesses said gov 
michael dukakis the massachusetts democrat who pressed the issue 
during his failed presidential campaign dukakis said the advance 
notice lets state economic development officials try to find new 
buyers to keep troubled companies in business 
robert dederick chief economist at northern trust co of 
chicago said the legislation was not as onerous as had been 
feared and has not harmed the nations economy 
greg leroy of the midwest center for labor research a 
chicagobased consulting group that studies plant closings noted 
there is no move to repeal or change the law 
theyve got no horror stories they can trot out to congress 
that would compel anyone to change it now maybe we can lay all the 
malarkey to rest and move on to the more substantive issues like 
severance pay health care and retraining workers leroy said 
but renee reymond the national association of manufacturers 
chief lobbyist against the measure said the law has been as 
complicated and confusing and difficult as we expected 
the law requires 60 days advance notice of plant closings by 
employers with at least 100 fulltime workers if the shutdown will 
cost 50 or more employees their jobs advance notice of a layoff is 
required if the number of affected workers totals either 500 people 
or 33 percent of the companys employees whichever is lower 
you cant always give notice its very hard to predict when 
things are going to come up companies who are struggling to 
survive dont know what their situation is going to be down the 
road ms reymond said 
this law has not been the saving grace for american workers 
she said 
even supporters acknowledge that although the law provides two 
months paid notice it cant provide longterm help to workers in 
areas where there are no other jobs available 
when a florsheim shoe factory in hermann mo closed last year 
there was no other major employer in the town of 2700 able to give 
the 250 displaced workers a job 
the closing was announced before the feb 4 effective date of 
the law but the company chose to provide advance notice anyway 
said joan saurez who heads the southwest region for the 
amalgamated clothing and textile workers union 
patricia gentry who worked at the hermann plant for 16 years 
said the advance notice gives you a chance to prepare yourself 
so you can think straight figure out what to do 
she found out through employment counseling that she could get 
government help to return to school and she now is working toward 
an accounting degree 
federal figures showed that before the law took effect 64 
percent of the nearly 2 million workers idled annually received no 
notice and of those who did whitecollar workers received 14 
days warning and bluecollar workers got seven days warning 
the government has not yet studied the laws effect because 
states not the federal government keep track of the notices 
in the past year in one of the largest industrial states ohio 
officials received 160 notices affecting about 23000 workers of 
those notices about twothirds were plant shutdowns and the rest 
were layoffs 
officials speculate that many of those notices came from small 
firms that did not have to comply 
companies feel an obligation to provide the notice even if 
they dont have to said reuven carlyle a spokesman for ohio 
gov richard f celeste a democrat 
arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat said the law has created 
a subtle pressure on businesses to help in the transition 
once you announce it you dont have time to just cut and run its 
been a net plus 
still others said neither workers or businesses have been 
affected a great deal 
we had one side saying theyre going to save the world with 
this and on the other that it would destroy us i think its 
turned out no one was right said illinois gov james thompson a 
republican

out of the remote reaches of siberia a young 
singer has leapt onto the international music scene a baritone of 
such promise that at age 27 he seems on the verge of becoming a 
superstar 
his name is dmitri hvorostovksy and at his us debut recital 
sunday night he showed that much of the excitement is justified 
hre is a voice of splendor supple and powerful at the same 
time tinged with a dark mellow beauty over virtually the entire 
baritone range his only discernible weakness is in the very 
highest register around g where he sounds less secure he also 
has phenomonenal breath control giving him the ability to sing 
long phrases without gulping for air 
for his program hvorostovksy chose all russian songs half 
tchaikovsky and half rachmaninov no doubt he felt most at home in 
this repertoire still more variety would have been welcome too 
many of the songs were slow mournful lamentations over hopeless 
love or worldly misfortune 
but there were striking moments and some firstrate 
interpretations tchaikovskys familiar none but the lonely 
heart was nicely restrained the same composers don juans 
serenade had a streak of cruelty as well as bravado and 
rachmaninovs christ is risen seemed deeply felt in its cry of 
anguish 
the real revelation came at the end when hvorostovksy performed 
three operatic arias as encores one from rachmaninovs aleppo 
and one each from verdis un ballo in maschera and don 
carlo 
here the young siberians voice rang out with a thrilling 
hallfilling grandeur that prompted wild cheering from the capacity 
audience at alice tully hall 
hvorostovsky who grew up and studied in the city of 
krasnoyarsk first came to international attention last june when 
he won the young singer of the world competition in cardiff wales 
tapes of the bbc telecast of his performance there have circulated 
widely winning him admiration for both his voice and his matinee 
idol looks 
before returning to europe hvorostovsky will repeat sundays 
program in washington on march 10 he has signed a recording 
contract with philips and is rapidly getting booked up by 
orchestras and opera companies 
one hopes he wont take things too fast 27 is still very 
young and his voice surely cannot have reached its full 
development 
but if he gets the right coaching and management one can easily 
imagine that a few years from now he will virtually own the great 
baritone roles on record and on stage

president bush back from summit talks where 
he pledged a global partnership with japan now faces the 
challenge of proving he can act on his vow to turn around the us 
trade deficit with japan 
even as the president headed back sunday from the meeting with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu in rancho mirage calif 
house majority leader richard gephardt complained that the summit 
appeared to be another case of good intentions but no specific 
actions to improve the 49 billion annual trade deficit with that 
country 
nothing has changed gephardt said 
but the missouri democrat said the increasingly protectionist 
congress will wait until summer for concrete action from the two 
leaders promises before it considers trade sanctions against 
japan 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher acknowledged sunday that 
at the end of the year if there arent some major changes in 
that well know it was more rhetoric 
but in an interview on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program mosbacher voiced optimism there would be 
results 
officials described the weekend talks as political in nature 
rather than formal negotiating sessions 
kaifu pledged cooperation to answer us concerns that the 
political push needed to advance trade reforms had been sidetracked 
by the recent election campaign in japan 
trade negotiators face a june 18 deadline to produce agreement 
on removing japanese barriers to supercomputers satellites and 
forest products failure of those talks would open the door to us 
retaliatory sanctions 
the two leaders announced no specific measures to further those 
talks or the stalled structural impediments initiative talks that 
are aimed at reforming economic practices that obstruct sale of 
us exports to japan 
but they promised to move those talks forward 
kaifu said he was determined to firmly tackle the structural 
reforms including product standards building codes and other 
barriers that effectively block sales of us products in japans 
market 
bush said japan is very aware of the mood and concern in this 
country about the continuing impediments to further growth of our 
trade relationship 
make no mistake about it i want to see that deficit come 
down not by restricting our markets or managing trade but by 
further increasing our exports to japan he said 
gephardt a tough proponent of retaliation measures voiced 
skepticism 
how many of these press conferences have we seen over the past 
10 years he said on nbctvs meet the press show what you 
never hear is a specific goal an action that both sides are going 
to take to deal with the problem 
gephardt said bush should have insisted on setting goals with 
kaifu how much are we going to get the trade deficit down a 
year and how specifically are we going to do it 
until the united states takes a firmer line on such targets the 
trade relationship will not improve he said 
for the newly elected kaifu the meeting offered a chance to 
bolster his weak political support at home 
bush carefully chose his words for a twopronged message 
first lauding the cooperation of the united states and japan in 
such areas as aid to the emerging democracies in east europe and 
latin america 
we talked about how we can expand even further our global 
partnership he said 
secondly bush nudged kaifu on the trade question letting him 
know what was expected if that partnership was to continue 
the president said he took the opportunity to be just as clear 
as any congressman would have liked me to be on what needs to 
happen 
mosbacher said the summits major result was that both our 
governments for the first time realize we both have things to 
do to close the gap weve admitted we have problems and are 
starting to work to bring them together 
bush is sending mosbacher later this month for trade talks in 
tokyo he also directed secretary of state james a baker iii to 
meet with the japanese foreign minister to develop a trialogue 
with europe on global foreign policy and economic decisions

the soviet union is running out of tobacco to 
meet the rising demands of cigarette smokers according to an 
agriculture department report 
although the soviet union is the worlds thirdlargest tobacco 
producer this years harvest is expected to be only 215000 metric 
tons unchanged from 1989 the peak was 350000 tons in 1985 only 
china and the united states produce more 
major acreage reductions are taking place in moldavia the 
major tobacco producing republic in order to increase food 
production the report said although the soviet government 
calls for a mandatory sixmonth supply of tobacco limited supplies 
have reduced stock levels to barely a threemonth supply 
since 1970 tobacco smoking in all forms has increased 70 
percent according to official soviet figures in 1988 it was 
estimated that there were 70 million smokers spending an 
equivalent of 11 billion annually 
a government antismoking campaign has been waged since soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev came to power including a smoking ban on 
all domestic air flights and in some work places 
however public interest in reducing the level of smoking 
seems low the report said smoking is quite acceptable in the 
soviet society even with the awareness of its potential hazards 
domestic demand for tobacco increase slightly in 1988 with retail 
sales growing 2 percent 
the report was written by laura r davis a tobacco analyst in 
the departments foreign agricultural service and was included 
last week in a review of the world tobacco situation 
currently the soviets rely on other centrally planned countries 
for imports of cigarettes and other manufactured tobacco products 
the report said 
in 1988 almost 55 billion cigarettes were imported with more 
than 95 percent coming from bulgaria residual suppliers included 
cuba india switzerland the netherlands and the united states 
but imports of unmanufactured tobacco leaf has declined to less 
than half of the peak years in the early 1980s 
comparatively us tobacco production last year was 641460 
metric tons about three times larger than soviet output and us 
cigarette production at 685 billion pieces last year was 80 
percent larger than the 380 billion produced by the soviet union in 
1988 
what happens next is uncertain the report said lacking hard 
currency the soviet union will probably continue importing tobacco 
and tobacco products through reciprocal agreements 
although the government has thus far been unsuccessful in 
curtailing cigarette consumption future attempts may succeed in 
lowering the demand for tobacco products the report said 
meanwhile the soviet unions reduction in tobacco production and 
imports while consumer demand remains high will continue to draw 
down inventories

making changes in the amount of cropland 
farmers must idle in order to qualify for federal price support 
benefits can have little effect on total production according to 
an agriculture department report 
the annual landidling is provided by the acreage reduction 
program or arp in the various annual commodity programs 
to qualify for benefits farmers might have to idle 5 percent or 
10 percent or even 40 percent of their acreage for a specific 
crop under the usual arrangements farmers are not paid for land 
idled in the arp but have to comply if they want price supports and 
deficiency payments on the remainder 
the departments economic research service said in the march 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine that switching arp levels in 
the feed grain program would produced mixed results 
theoretically it said if the arp was increased to 40 percent 
from 5 percent the previous year federal spending would be reduced 
by 47 billion and net farm income by 28 billion 
but feed grain production mainly corn would be reduced by 
only about 5 percent 
falling program participation rates combined with more 
intensive use of permitted acres are behind these results the 
report said 
the participation rate in the programs was said to be the most 
important variable in switching to different arps 
participation in the corn program for example would drop 
from 80 percent to 43 percent if the feed grain arp were raised 
from 5 percent to 50 percent the report said 
in all with a 50 percent arp for feed grain the program 
acreage would decline to 24 million acres from nearly 78 million

wine drinking in japan hasnt reached the 
levels of other industrialized nations but an agriculture 
department observer says changes may be underway 
both the mass and upscale wine markets seem ripe for growth

for upscale markets us exporters have found success by 
upgrading their lines to include premium labels 
brabant said in the march issue of agexporter magazine that 
japanese consumers are new to wine shopping and that marketers 
should concentrate on educating the public about the superior 
qualities of these more expensive products 
japanese wine industry sources believe larger imports of bottle 
wines will be needed brabant said growth is forecast at annual 
rates of 15 percent to 30 percent for the next several years

students at bennington high school are 
100 percent drug free and proud of it but the peer pressure that 
has kept the school clean has taken away youngsters privacy a 
civil liberties expert says 
the entire student body volunteered for a countywide drug 
testing program and all 75 students learned last month they 
passed now they wear special tshirts walk with their heads high 
and cash in on discounts at local stores 
i just hope that they start doing this drug test all over 
said 15yearold sophomore christie wilson 
rebecca foster executive director of the american civil 
liberties union of oklahoma said the organization opposes testing 
without reason to suspect a student is using drugs 
people right now seem to be willing to compromise their civil 
rights if they think they can clean up the drugs in america 
foster said the aclus not for drugs but we dont support drug 
testing 
students at bennington have their reasons however for 
participating in the program in this town of 300 people about 150 
miles from oklahoma city 
a lot of people around here always said bennington school has 
a drug problem miss wilson said we wanted to prove that 
everybody heres not taking drugs it feels good to say youre from 
bennington now 
other students said they too are proud bennington is the only 
one of 10 bryant county schools that tested drug free 
we think it should be a big deal said 17yearold junior 
jeff henson 
katy morris education coordinator for bryant county youth 
services said about 1400 students in the county have taken the 
tests and only about a dozen failed bennington she said is the 
only school at which all the students agreed to give a urine sample 
theres a lot of peer pressure for the kids to remain clean 
said olan ispell superintendent of the bennington school district 
ispell said students who pass receive a drugfree id card good 
for discounts at restaurants bowling alleys video stores and 
other establishments 
students who fail on subsequent random tests lose their cards 
and their discounts the schools counselor is informed and not 
parents police or teachers but when a student has to pay full 
price at one of the discount establishments word will spread the 
student failed the test ispell said 
this ms foster said is a violation of privacy the students 
are submitting to peer pressure to submit to drug testing she 
said its giving up their total right to any kind of privacy 
whatsoever 
but people in bennington apparently dont see this as a problem 
mrs morris said her organization has not had a complaint neither 
has the aclu 
drug use in bennington appears small in comparison to big 
cities but ispell said students and faculty members would be 
concerned even with a few instances of drug use 
mrs morris said every month 10 percent of the students must 
submit to random testing students who fail are given counseling 
and lose their cards but receive no other disciplinary action 
ispell said the program builds a positive image he said 
bennington students wear their black and green drug free youth 
tshirts with pride 
there is a drug problem he said school officials who 
tell you they dont have a drug problem are kidding themselves

a huge poaching raid that startled this 
poor town of 800 a year ago may actually have helped prompt an 
artistic and economic renaissance some community leaders say 
a local artist is making a religious shrine two 
bedandbreakfasts have opened empty buildings are being 
renovated plans are being made for cottage industries using the 
skills of local artisans 
allen c manzanares director of the statefunded costilla 
county economic development council inc thinks the raid has had a 
positive effect on a town where one of every four or five people is 
unemployed 
it caught the attention of the rest of the state and of gov 
roy romer who got funding for development council said 
manzanares whose family has lived here for many generations as 
have most san luis families 
we want to put it behind us and i think generally we have 
he said the community has started to recover from it how do 
we turn something negative into a positive 
last march 6 more than 100 state and federal wildlife officials 
converged on san luis and nearby chama and fort garland they 
arrested 57 alleged poachers in the culmination of a 2year sting 
an undercover officer had posed as a taxidermist and wild game 
processor set up shop and bought elk deer bear and other game 
hides and carcasses many taken out of season as well as 
endangered birds of prey 
of the 57 people arrested the cases of three are still pending 
charges against four were dismissed and seven were fined and 
sentenced to prison terms of up to eight months the others pleaded 
guilty and were fined 
san luis in an arid valley at 7900 feet was founded in 1851 
by descendants of spanish colonists it is colorados oldest town 
and like neighboring san pablo san pedro and san francisco the 
areas heritage culture and geography have isolated it 
the closeknit community remains nearly 90 percent hispanic 
people here take care of each other said the rev patrick 
valdez the roman catholic priest who is one of the chief 
architects of the towns renaissance 
there is no hunger but there is poverty if there is an 
illness or a death they do take care of each other 
san luis awakening has come from within 
valdez has renovated a convent left in disarray since the 1950s 
turning it into a handicraft gallery and a bed and breakfast 
appropriately called el convento 
the gallery is the incubator of a whole series of cottage 
industries valdez said 
what i anticipate is that the artisans will start off here and 
when they get big enough they will be able to open their own 
businesses and open their extra rooms into shops or their garages 
into workshops he said 
also planned are the towns first motel and a furniture factory 
employing local artisans the town sponsored workshops for artists 
and artisans last summer and plans more this summer 
at the center of activity is a shrine being built on a hill 
overlooking the village the stations of the cross images that 
depict christs final suffering crucifixion and burial will be 
placed along a nearly milelong path that hairpins to the top of a 
volcanic rockstrewn mesa west of town 
the stations to be dedicated in may are being rendered in 
bronze by artist huberto maestas who also plans to open a san luis 
foundry that will employ several residents 
valdez saw the poaching case as a setback to an overdue economic 
recovery for the region but said im very optimistic about the 
future 
i think it the recovery was going to happen i think the 
raid was a stumbling block in our way that we have to jump over 
and it would have been better if it hadnt ever happened

when democratic aides are asked if they are 
seeking gov michael s dukakis endorsement for their candidates 
this year their first reaction is to laugh mumble something 
unintelligible or give a no comment 
their reaction suggests just how far the governor has fallen 
since he ran for president in 1988 
when dukakis appeared to have a good shot at the white house 
state democrats were all too happy to have their name associated 
with him 
now with the states worsening budget problems democrats 
running for statewide office are wary of appearing too closely 
associated with him 
even dukakis has joked that the best favor he could do for one 
democratic candidate for treasurer house speaker george keverian 
would be to endorse the republican opponent joe malone 
dukakis press secretary mindy lubber said the governor has no 
plans to endorse any democratic candidate in the primary 
obviously post primary he will be far more active in the 
race lubber said for the harmony of the democratic party his 
position has always been hes going to stay out of a primary 
fight 
theres no doubt that at one point during the height of his 
popularity democrats would have lined up to court dukakis 
support said paul watanabe head of the political science 
department at the university of massachusetts in boston 
the level of positive support at the height of the dukakis 
administration was remarkable and the fall has been about as 
dramatic as one can imagine watanabe said 
this year even democrats with a long history in state politics 
are calling themselves outsiders 
an endorsement by dukakis might not be the kiss of death but it 
would probably do a candidate more harm than good watanabe said 
my guess is he would not endorse anyone without first 
consulting them and my guess is that the advice being given at the 
campaigns at this point is to forgo an endorsement watanabe said 
state sen richard kraus a candidate for treasurer said an 
endorsement from the governor would probably hurt his election bid 
the negatives are so high right now he said 
former attorney general francis x bellotti one of the leading 
democratic contenders for governor does not really place any 
value on an endorsement at that level said ernie corrigan his 
campaign spokesman 
its just not something frank bellotti has even thought 
about corrigan said 
mark longabaugh campaign manager for lt gov evelyn murphy 
sounded more enthusiastic about an endorsement than officials from 
other campaigns we want everybodys endorsement he said 
john silbers campaign spokeswoman michael regunberg said 
uh uh i dont think well comment one way or another 
rep john flood a democrat who was an outspoken critic of the 
governor during the presidential campaign said he would use a 
dukakis endorsement of any of his party rivals against them 
obviously it would be used by the campaign as a negative 
he said

a 500 million spy satellite in orbit 
as one of the rookies on board i just say wow what a 
fantastic experience the pilot air force col john casper 
said after the shuttle touched down sunday on a dry lake bed runway 
in the mojave desert 
nasa crews today were to prepare atlantis for a piggyback jet 
ride home to floridas kennedy space center on saturday 
preliminary inspection showed 62 of the shuttles heatshield 
tiles sustained dings nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said 
the shuttle made a fiery descent through the atmosphere 
touching down at 1008 am pst in a landing closed to the public 
but open to invited guests and journalists 
the five astronauts made it to california just ahead of winds 
and bad weather that could have delayed the landing their launch 
from cape canaveral fla on wednesday was delayed five times by 
weather a computer glitch and a sore throat suffered by the 
shuttle commander navy capt john o creighton 
i probably had the worlds most famous cold he said 
groundtoshuttle communications were blacked out during the 
flight the 34th by a shuttle and the sixth dedicated to the 
pentagon 
about 4 hours after landing casper creighton navy lt cmdr 
pierre thuot air force col richard mullane and marine lt col 
david hilmers said goodbye to 100 nasa employees and friends at 
edwards air force base 
then the astronauts rode two jets home to houston where they 
were greeted by 200 cheering spectators 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the astronauts 
thursday deployed a satellite to snoop on much of the world 
including the soviet union by taking highly detailed photographs 
and eavesdropping electronically 
a network of amateur astronomers reported seeing both the 
shuttle and the satellite speeding overhead 
the shuttle triggered characteristic twin sonic booms close to 
its landing strip but police over a wide area of southern 
california reported a lack of the usual calls from citizens who 
mistake the noise for earthquakes 
that suggests the shuttle flew an unusual route as it crossed 
the coast at a point nasa would only say was somewhere north of los 
angeles 
we did something that was important for the country 
creighton said everything went very well we enjoyed doing it 
he also joked about the secrecy telling the houston crowd 
here id thought wed sneak in in the middle of the night and 
nobody would know we were back 
unable to discuss mission details the astronauts gushed about 
traveling in space 
all the preparations all the discussions with the guys and 
girls that have gone before me just couldnt quite prepare me for 
what ascent is like thuot said i was in awe 
mullane who previously announced he would retire after this 
flight said wistfully i will be sitting there and watch space 
shuttles fly into space and ill envy that 
the next shuttle flight is set for april 12 when discovery is 
to begin a fiveday mission to deploy the 155 billion hubble 
space telescope

the city that welcomes the elite of the nations 
college students is having a woeful time trying to educate its own 
young people 
boston schools have been called among the worst in the nation 
even by the people who run them the city must now find someone 
willing to tackle the job since the bitter ouster of the districts 
first black superintendent 
whoever slips into the superintendents seat will be asked to 
halt a high dropout rate reform discredited school policies 
settle simmering labor disputes and ensure schools are safe for 
both students and teachers 
he or she must bring together a racially divided school 
committee recruit dedicated teachers and balance a budget in tight 
economic times 
meanwhile the kids need to be educated 
four years ago laval wilson was going to do all that but the 
school committee is now buying out the last 18 months of his 
contract and members charge wilson made little headway in school 
improvement wilson contends he met the committees goals 
recriminations including charges of racism have been traded 
among committee members like taunts from opposing sides at a 
football game 
high dropout rates poor basic skills and disruptive home 
environments are not unique to boston but many education experts 
say the relatively small boston system 55000 students in a city 
of nearly 600000 does not face the overwhelming problems of 
megasystems in new york chicago and los angeles 
in fact said anne wheelock of the massachusetts advocacy 
center which has made numerous studies of boston schools boston 
has the conditions for success 
we have an extremely active business and university community 
that provide resources we have a relatively small number of 
schools she said we have an excellent stafftostudent ratio 
in the middle schools 
even state education commissioner harold raynolds jr who has 
called the boston schools among the worst managed in the country 
contends the system is inherently manageable 
why is success so elusive for boston city schools state and 
city education officials and national experts point to a 
combination of factors including bostons political history 
recent immigration and an insular yankee mentality 
bostons dropout rate is often cited in assessing the school 
system which is about onequarter white with the rest mostly 
black and hispanic 
figures from 198788 indicate that 43 percent of all ninth 
graders drop out in the next four years more than half of all 
hispanics entering ninth grade drop out 
dropout rates in pittsburgh and san diego two cities of similar 
population and school size have lower rates pittsburgh has a 
fouryear rate of 22 percent san diego a threeyear rate of 212 
percent 
only 37 percent of boston seniors go on to college compared 
with 54 percent in pittsburgh more than 10 percent of bostons 
students are held back every year students are suspended at a rate 
one and a half times the national rate 
bostons problems may not be for lack of dollars expenditures 
per pupil in 198687 total 4982 in san diego the amount is 
3950 
harvard education professor vito perrone said the systems 
problems date to the 19th century and the citys political 
structure traditionally a high proportion of boston students have 
gone to private not public schools thus decreasing the political 
stakes in improving public education he said 
about 25 percent of bostons schoolage children do not go to 
public schools in pittsburgh with its long tradition of catholic 
schools the figure is about 26 percent in san diego only about 9 
percent 
in 1974 federal orders to desegregate boston schools through 
busing contributed to white flight to the suburbs busing created a 
climate of distrust and racial tension that has lingered said 
perrone 
theres a history of mistrust thats another way of saying 
racial issues said charles glenn state director of education 
equity 
glenn also said education suffers because of tension between 
state government which is influenced by massachusetts old 
families and city government which is dominated by immigrant 
ethnic groups 
theres never been a sense of hey this is our system lets 
get on with it and really make it really superb he said 
wheelock said an insular mentality contributes to a reluctance 
to try new programs or seek outside solutions in boston we have 
not adopted practices that researchers and pioneers in education 
have demonstrated are effective with kids she said 
in particular she cites bostons high rate of flunking 
students holding students back is an archaic practice that leads 
to more dropouts raynolds said 
raynolds goals for the school include giving individual schools 
more leeway in setting policies and curriculum and a greater 
emphasis on preschool and vocational education 
but he and other experts stressed the need for parents 
businesses and other parts of the community to participate 
public education is at a crossroad said john kellogg a 
staff member of the bostonbased national coalition of advocates 
for students it is viewed by the country generally as having 
failed students and parents and education advocates have an agenda 
for change 
its clear that agenda is being advanced boston is among 
those areas where change is coming last

with atlantis safely back on earth 
nasa turns its attention to the april launch of shuttle discovery 
with the hubble space telescope the biggest observatory ever to be 
put in orbit 
the 15 billion telescope the most expensive unmanned 
spacecraft ever built will offer a view of the universe with a 
clarity 10 times greater than what now can be achieved from the 
ground 
thats comparable to the impact of galileos telescope nearly 
four centuries ago according to lennard fisk nasas chief 
scientist 
whenever you make that kind of leap in sensitivity and 
resolution you suddenly are able to see parts of the universe that 
are only fuzzy to you at the moment fisk said that increase 
in clarity will give real insight into how the universe works which 
we dont now have 
the hubble space telescope will be suspended in orbit 370 miles 
above earth for 15 years studying stars and galaxies as they 
existed 14 billion years ago the universe is believed to have been 
formed 15 billion years ago with an explosion known as the big bang 
the 25000pound 43feet space telescope named after the late 
american astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered the expanding 
universe will peer into the heavens from above earths atmosphere 
this will enable the instrument to detect light of all wavelengths 
from distant stars before it is absorbed or distorted by the 
atmosphere 
the first large optical telescope in space will look seven times 
more deeply into space and detect objects 50 times fainter than the 
best groundbased observatory its 8foot primary optical mirror is 
the most precise ever made 
astronomers hope to ascertain the size of the universe and 
uncover some of the mystery surrounding quasars pulsars and black 
holes among other things 
one of the more pressing questions are there other solar 
systems and if so are they inhabited may have to wait for an 
even more sophisticated telescope capable of detecting planets 
around other stars already nasa is looking ahead to this 
socalled son of space telescope 
scientific information should be forthcoming one to two months 
after discoverys liftoff on a fiveday mission april 12 said bill 
taylor the telescopes chief engineer 
crews at kennedy space center planned to move discovery to the 
mammoth assembly building today to be joined to the solid rocket 
boosters and external tank 
the space agency can concentrate on that mission now that 
atlantis is back on earth having put a spy satellite in orbit the 
shuttle landed sunday in californias mojave desert 
fisk said he expects interesting observations to be made 
fairly early just to show everybody it works but he said 
the real insight the real indepth study of astronomy will come 
back over a period of years 
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 five 
years after receiving initial funding but technical problems 
postponed liftoff until 1985 and then 1986 the challenger 
explosion in 1986 delayed the mission until 1989 and concern over 
the shuttles solid rocket boosters pushed it back yet again 
nasa has taken advantage of the delays to improve the telescope 
we ought to have an orbiting telescope that is much easier to 
take care of over the long period taylor said all of that 
comes at some price the biggest penalty is some of the components 
have aged that in and of itself is not and should not be a real 
concern 
the launch schedule for the rest of 1990 
may 9 columbia which will deploy an ultraviolet astronomy 
laboratory called astro 1 to examine hot stars quasars and galaxy 
centers 
july 9 atlantis with a secret pentagon payload 
aug 29 columbia with a life science laboratory that will 
conduct biological research 
oct 5 discovery which will unleash the space probe ulysses 
to explore the suns polar regions 
nov 1 atlantis to deploy the gamma ray observatory which 
will explore gamma ray sources throughout the universe 
dec 12 columbia on the first international microgravity 
laboratory mission 
eight shuttle flights are scheduled in 1991 and a record 12 in 
1992

the free haircuts bike repairs and other 
services offered by thousands of people at roadside stands were 
part of an official communist campaign to revive the spirit of a 
selfless soldierhero dead nearly 30 years 
as declared by the chinese communist youth league last month 
sunday was national learn from lei feng day 
chinese were supposed to do good deeds in honor of the soldier 
killed in 1962 when he backed his army truck into a utility pole 
leis deeds are legendary in china where everyone knows the 
stories of how the young soldier washed and mended his comrades 
clothes gave his rations away and read the works of revolutionary 
leader mao tsetung wherever he went 
but skeptics question the official story because of the 
suspicious existence of photographs of lei doing good deeds that he 
supposedly performed in secret 
shortly after leis death mao made him famous with an 
inscription to learn from comrade lei feng for years every 
child was taught to follow the lei feng spirit of being a 
rustless screw in the socialist machine 
in the recent years of reform and opening to the outside world 
the lei feng spirit was considered oldfashioned 
since last years massive prodemocracy movement however the 
chinese leadership has sought to summon back the old spirit of 
selfless sacrifice for the nation and has dusted lei off and put 
him back on a pedestal 
but few of those fixing bicycles and watches mending clothes 
handing out fliers on prevention of infectious diseases taking 
blood pressure and offering advice on fixing household appliances 
said sunday they were motivated by leis example 
in beijing where lei feng activities also were to mark 200 days 
before the asian games most people said they were motivated by a 
desire to bring glory to the nation by helping prepare for the 
september sports event 
few seemed to wonder how cutting hair or fixing bikes 
contributed to asian games preparations 
gui dalu a 50yearold repairman acknowledged the futility of 
what he and his 100 colleagues were doing 
when asked why they were picking up trash at the asian games 
village six months before the event gui said in fact we were 
just discussing that ourselves 
of beijings 10 million residents hundreds of thousands 
participated in organized voluntary service activities 
according to sundays beijing evening news 
much of the activity seemed pointless gangs of college students 
with pickaxes hacked at earth near an overpass but planted 
nothing schoolchildren marched up and down bicycle lanes near 
their schools waving banners 
the day was more festive than productive bright colorful flags 
and banners with exhortations of every kind learn from lei feng 
warmly welcome asian games be a civilized driver protect the 
environment filled street corners and dotted the roadsides 
at the asian games village officers of the peoples armed 
police banged on drums and crashed cymbals while a police trio at 
the beijing railway station serenaded the crowds with a mix of pop 
and patriotic songs 
the hype for lei feng day had been building for weeks his name 
began reappearing in newspapers after last years prodemocracy 
movement was brutally suppressed and an intense campaign to drum 
up enthusiasm for lei feng day began in january 
among the stories that have filled chinese newspaper and 
television reports daily is one claiming that even cadets at the 
us military academy at west point are studying lei feng and that 
his portrait hangs in a prominent position among military heroes at 
the academy 
west point spokesperson andrea hamburger told the associated 
press there is no specific part of the curriculum at west point 
that discusses lei feng this seems to be a rumor thats gotten 
out of control

machinists union members held out little hope of 
getting their eastern airlines jobs back as their strike began its 
second year today but they aim to hold out one day longer than 
company boss frank lorenzo 
at the beginning of the strike there was a lot of waiting to 
get it over with said jim bertram a former flight simulator 
technician who was among hundreds of protesters rallying outside 
eastern headquarters here sunday 
now all i want to do is see lorenzo burn 
lorenzos texas air corp bought eastern four years ago and he 
has been the focus of the nationwide strike over wage and workrule 
concessions 
police estimated at least 500 people rallied in miami on the 
strikes anniversary sunday 
hundreds more strikers and supporters rallied at logan 
international airport in boston laguardia airport in new york and 
in other cities with large eastern union memberships strikers 
rallied saturday at atlanta 
in miami protesters most wearing bright red union tshirts 
rallied next to the union hall across the street from easterns 
corporate headquarters police guarded the company buildings some 
of which were splattered red and yellow by paint bombs and had 
windows broken out 
the strikers chanted one day longer meaning they hope to 
endure one day more than lorenzo 
they then went by bus to miami international airport to march 
through the eastern terminal 
the enthusiasm and determination and spirit of the real 
eastern employees has not wavered one bit charles e bryan 
president of machinists district 100 told the crowd its become 
a cause for justice 
but in boston chief steward leo romano admitted being downcast 
i cant lie and say that spirits are high at this point but 
the flying public was out there today and i think they see what we 
really are romano said 
were not a group of radicals were a group of people 
dedicated to a cause 
most machinists who at eastern represented mechanics and other 
maintenance worker have gone on to other jobs in most cases for 
less pay 
though there seems to be no serious hope for settlement of the 
strike the machinists said they are showing they wont give in to 
what they call lorenzos unionbusting and dismantling of eastern 
i think basically the accomplishment of the strike is a 
philosophical idealistic one said elaine segura a 20year 
eastern veteran clerk who struck with her husband paul a 23year 
mechanic these people who have suffered for a year still have 
the enthusiasm and perseverance the answer to lorenzo is still 
no 
the strike virtually shut down eastern at first when pilots and 
flight attendants joined the nearly 9000 machinists 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days 
later and began hiring new workers while trying to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier today eastern has 18000 employees compared to 
more than 30000 before the strike and 800 daily flights compared 
to nearly 1100 when the strike began 
the carrier is losing 2 million a day as it struggles to emerge 
from bankruptcy protection the pilots and flight attendants ended 
their sympathy strikes three months ago but eastern has taken only 
a few back saying it has no openings 
management did not mark the strike anniversary spokesman robin 
matell said the bottom line is a year later there are no 
winners only losers matell said there were an awful lot of 
people who got hurt

in 1946 zbigniew szadkowskis parents 
were rousted out of the sovietannexed polish ukraine and moved 
west to settle the emptied formerly german lands of polands new 
frontier 
now these aging refugees and the children they bore on the 
forfeited german territories east of the oder and neisse rivers are 
haunted by fears they might be swept away once again this time by 
a resurgent united germany 
they are afraid about the border said szadkowski these 
are people who lost all their property everything in the east 
now they are afraid their children will lose everything again 
it is polish history he added with a shrug 
szadkowski a middleaged polish army lieutenant serving in the 
border guard is standing on the bridge of friendship behind him 
is the east german city of goerlitz in front of him the polish 
town of zgorzelec 
below him is a dirty brown swath of the neisse river the 
natural boundary used to create a manmade border that divided the 
german city in 1945 
in a 1950 pact east germany confirmed polands western border 
two decades later west germany also formally recognized the 
oderneisse border 
but the quest to regain lost lands has lingered in some german 
hearts and now that communist rule has collapsed and the two 
germanys are striding toward reunification the muddy neisse seems 
a thin and vulnerable line 
many poles are reminded of another polish border across which 
german troops crashed in 1939 to unleash six years of nazi horror 
polands government is demanding that the oderneisse border be 
guaranteed before german reunification but chancellor helmut kohl 
of west germany has refused to give an unequivocal promise on the 
border 
kohl must face voters in december and with polls showing him 
running just a few percentage points ahead of the opposition social 
democrats apparently does not want to alienate conservative 
supporters 
many west german politicians even leading figures of kohls 
governing coalition such as foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher favor guaranteeing polands western border before 
reunification 
but kohls murky stance has fed feelings of anxiety in this town 
at the western edge of the land ceded to poland by a defeated 
germany land that comprises onethird of modern poland 
the older people especially are afraid of this reunification 
life teaches that history often repeats itself said zbigniew 
daniluk an economist and zgorzelec solidarity leader 
as world war ii ended more than 12 million ethnic germans were 
expelled from newly polish territories and transported west 
the victorious allies had allowed stalin to give the land to 
poland in exchange for the greater territory he took from poland in 
the east and annexed to the soviet union poles were never 
consulted 
there is bitterness in some german quarters about the severing 
of longnurtured german ties to lands now labeled polands 
recovered territories a reference to polish prior ownership 
of the land in the middle ages 
trepidation about german unification is widespread in poland 
but is particularly acute for those who resettled in formerly 
german territories after leaving the eastern lands seized by the 
soviets 
forced to repopulate the new western region stretching from 
baltic coast to zgorzelec and south these poles have long lived 
with a sense of impermanence 
this fear is well evident in the small formerly german 
villages which are not restored and are not neat and tidy said 
walery wysoki 
people for all this time have been wondering whether they 
will stay here forever or not 
his father who had lived in eastern poland and was forced by 
the soviets to labor as a miner in the soviet caucasus settled in 
zgorzelec in 1956 
in zgorzelec there is a sense of artificial division a feeling 
that the town could so easily become united and german again 
the trolley rails that linked the two sections of the prewar 
german city are still embedded in the bridge over the river border 
on both sides of the river the archetecture is turnofthecentury 
german 
the soaring cathedral is in gorlitz as is the old heart of the 
city zgorzelec says szadkowski doesnt have a real center like 
every polish town 
poles returning from jobs or vacations on the west side of the 
border describe antipolish sentiment surfacing a restaurant 
refusing service or a store posting a sign toys for german 
children only 
in western poland grafitti demanding germans go home has 
appeared on bus stop walls 
it has long been easier for east germans to enter poland on 
shopping forays than it is for the poles to go west and germans 
have developed a reputation in poland as rapacious consumers of 
scarce goods 
and yet a polishgerman familarity has also been spawned by the 
border traffic we have shared a few vodkas says szadkowski 
and a common sense of new freedom after casting off communist rule 
local poles remember that when east germans swam the neisse last 
year seeking to reach the west through the fracturing east bloc 
the people of zgorzelec welcomed them with dry clothes and lifts to 
the west german embassy in warsaw 300 miles away 
now thoughts are focused on whether the warsaw government can 
wield enough international influence to ensure the neisse remains 
the permanent border 
it is an emotionstirring question solidarity parliament leader 
bronislaw geremek recently told a paris audience that it would take 
a war to change the border 
said wysoki simply we will not allow them to do it

a group of oneida indians faced trial in 
federal court today on charges of seizing a reservation bingo hall 
and burning it down in a dispute over alleged profit skimming 
nine residents of the 32acre oneida indian reservation were to 
stand trial four other oneida indians from canada were indicted in 
the takeover of the 1 millionamonth operation and the arson but 
were never arrested 
seven are charged with pilfering 60000 in bingo hall profits 
during the takeover while seven are charged with conspiring to 
burn down the hall in 1988 a new bingo hall is expected to open 
this spring 
the 800seat bingo hall that opened in 1985 was hailed by 
supporters as way to generate revenues for reservation schools 
services and other improvements it provided jobs for nearly 100 
people 
however another faction contended the hall did not have the 
blessing of the entire tribe and was not approved by the iroquois 
confederacy grand council to which the oneidas belong 
in late 1987 william beglen and other dissidents began 
questioning what had become of the bingo profits estimated at 
between 28 million and 43 million they accused the halls 
operators of embezzlement and seized the hall 
stephen lance cimino who is representing beglen said the 
defendants did not set the fire he addded there was a lot of 
money involved and there was no accounting of it

andy rooney returned after a threeweek 
suspension to his endoftheshow slot on 60 minutes to take up 
the demeaning job of defending himself against charges he is a 
racist bigot 
at the same time the 71yearold humorist let it be known 
sunday night he would not be silenced do i have any opinions 
that might irritate some people youre damn right i do thats 
what im here for he said 
rooney was given a threemonth suspension without pay from cbs 
news president david burke on feb 8 after a gay magazine the 
advocate quoted him as saying blacks had watered down their 
genes because the least intelligent had the most children burke 
later cut short the suspension 
rooney who has repeatedly denied making the remarks in the 
magazine interview which was not taperecorded said on 60 
minutes he spent a lot of his suspension worrying hed be 
remembered as the bigot he isnt 
id be known for the rest of my life as a racist bigot and as 
someone who had made life a little more difficult for homosexuals 
i felt terrible and ive learned a lot he said 
at the time of his suspension rooney was under fire for a 
letter in which he said he found gay sex repugnant and for a 
cbs special dec 26 in which he put homosexual unions on a list 
of things that cause selfinduced death 
what do i say to defend myself do i say im not a racist 
that sounds like saying im not a crook he said in his return 
broadcast how do i apologize to homosexuals for hurting them 
with a remark i made that i didnt realize would hurt them 
he said it found it demeaning to have to sit here and defend 
myself against allegations of racism he cited among other things 
the night he threw out a guest for using the word nigger and 
his arrest while in the army during world war ii for insisting on 
sitting in the back of a bus with black soldiers 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
last week said it was satisfied that the racial remarks attributed 
to rooney were distorted and didnt reflect his views the group 
declined to comment on sundays broadcast 
craig davidson executive director of the gay and lesbian 
alliance against defamation applauded rooneys comments 
mr rooneys anecdotal remarks contain an acknowledgement that 
his statements about gay people were unfair and harmful davidson

a decorated fbi agent who took part in a 
discrimination lawsuit against the agency has been suspended and 
stripped of his security clearance amid allegations of espionage 
it was reported today 
colleagues of fernando e mata 48 told the new york times that 
the allegations against the 15year veteran and counterintelligence 
specialist are unjustified and that he appears to be a victim of 
retaliation for the lawsuit 
the newspaper reported that mata who is based in miami lost 
his clearance as a result of a threeyear investigation 
fbi spokesman robert davenport in washington confirmed only that 
mata had been placed on administrative leave he would not say why 
an fbi official who spoke to the times on condition of anonymity 
said that no matter what you think of the fbi its ridiculous to 
think the agency would retaliate by making such a serious 
allegation 
mata aided in several major fbi investigations to counter spying 
by foreign countries coworkers said he risked his life in covert 
assignments 
an unidentified friend of matas told the times that the fbi 
claimed to have information that cuban agents had approached mata 
and sought to enlist him as a spy 
an affidavit filed in the discrimination lawsuit in which mata 
was a plaintiff showed mata had requested psychiatric care after a 
traumatic stint as an undercover foreign counterintelligence agent 
but that the fbi refused to grant security clearance to a 
psychiatrist outside the bureau 
what the bureau is doing to fernando mata is unspeakable 
said leo a gonzales an fbi agent who retired last year theres 
no doubt in my mind that fernando is a patriot and a loyal 
american 
gonzales told the times that the allegations appeared to be a 
maneuver to force mata out 
us district judge lucius d bunton of el paso texas ruled in 
1988 that the fbi had demonstrated a widespread pattern of 
discrimination against its hispanic employees in both promotions 
and working conditions 
the fbi was ordered to make sweeping changes in its policies 
matas attorney hugo a rodriguez said mata has been 
repeatedly questioned about the possibility of contacts with cuban 
intelligence agents several years ago 
they havent told us what hes being charged with said 
rodriguez he has not done anything wrong he has not compromised 
the interests of his employer or the government 
rodriguez said it was unlikely mata could be charged with 
espionage because he was granted limited immunity from prosecution 
in exchange for agreeing to undergo liedetector tests and other 
questioning last year 
mata in 1983 won the attorney generals award the highest award 
given by the justice department friends said the work that 
prompted the award is classified

gunfire crackled through a northern 
provincial capital today as troops searched for a governor charged 
in the bloody december coup attempt whose followers fought the army 
to prevent his capture 
a general and at least 13 other people were killed in sundays 
fighting which broke out after suspended gov rodolfo aguinaldo 
refused to surrender 
aguinaldo who fled during sundays fighting in cagayan 
province was indicted last week on charges of rebellion and murder 
in connection with the bid to topple president corazon aquino that 
claimed 113 lives 
today officials ordered the arrest of three mayors one village 
chief and a lawyer for supporting aguinaldo 
in tuguegarao capital of cagayan 250 miles north of manila 
government forces conducted housetohouse searches today but 
failed to locate aguinaldo sporadic firing continued until late 
morning and tension in the city was high 
mrs aquino told reporters today she ordered the armed forces to 
arrest aguinaldo using such force as is necessary but taking all 
feasible measures for the safety of civilians 
among the dead in sundays fighting was brig gen oscar 
florendo sent to tuguegarao to negotiate with aguinaldo he was 
among officials trapped in a hotel seized by aguinaldo supporters 
who mrs aquino said killed florendo before fleeing the hotel 
the act of cowardice and treachery of aguinaldos followers 
will not go unpunished mrs aquino said after those trapped in 
the hotel were freed 
casualty figures were incomplete but regional commander col 
miguel fontanilla said at least 14 people died including 10 killed 
during a clash at a checkpoint near a bridge three in fighting 
near a gasoline station and florendo at the hotel he said 
the decision to arrest aguinaldo has been widely seen here as 
part of the governments effort to display strength in cracking 
down on those suspected of involvement in the six armed attempts to 
topple mrs aquino since she took office four years ago 
but share prices closed 138 percent lower today on the manila 
stock exchange traders said investors feared a new wave of 
political unrest in the wake of the tuguegarao bloodshed 
in a statement to news organizations mutinous soldiers 
responsible for the december coup attempt deplored florendos death 
but declared support for aguinaldo 
we call upon the filipino people to express their indignation 
and rejection of the illegitimate aquino regime before our 
beloved nation is torn apart the statement said 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered troops to 
capture aguinaldo at all costs

sending tanks and artillery to the city to support mutineers trying 
to oust mrs aquino was indicted tuesday on rebellion and murder 
charges along with opposition sen juan ponce enrile and five 
others 
enrile appeared in court today in suburban quezon city but his 
arraigment was deferred until the supreme court rules on the 
validity of the charge 
the high court is expected to hear arguments tuesday on enriles 
contention that a 1956 supreme court decision invalidated the dual 
murderrebellion charge 
marines were flown from manila on sunday to reinforce security 
in tuguegarao a city of more than 80000 people philippine 
airlines canceled flights to the city and schools were ordered 
closed today 
acting provincial gov melvin vargas said aguinaldos forces 
released about 30 hostages taken late sunday de villa said 227 of 
aguinaldos followers had been arrested including 63 members of a 
militarybacked militia raised trained and equipped by the aquino 
administration 
florendo and local governments secretary luis santos had gone to 
tuguegarao to convince aguinaldo to surrender but he refused 
saying he should be charged only with rebellion because he killed 
no one 
rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years imprisonment and 
defendants are allowed bail murder with rebellion carries a life 
sentence and is nonbailable 
before dawn sunday aguinaldos supporters surrounded the 
sixstory delfino hotel in tuguegarao and took florendo 51 and 
three aides prisoner and trapped santos and others on the second 
floor 
thousands of aguinaldos supporters poured out into the streets 
around the hotel and set up makeshift barricades near the hotel 
aguinaldo dressed in combat fatigues and brandishing a weapon 
appeared before them at the hotel to rally support 
aguinaldo was also implicated but never charged in a august 1987 
coup attempt later he raised a private army ostensibly to fight 
communist guerrillas he ran for provincial governor in january 
1988 and was elected by a landslide

prime minister yitzhak shamir says israel does 
not consider jewish neighborhoods in predominantly arab east 
jerusalem to be settlements and will try to direct as many soviet 
jews to the area as possible 
shamir was responding to statements by us leaders among them 
president bush who linked american aid for immigrant resettlement 
to a halt in israeli settlement activity in the occupied 
territories and jerusalem 
there are no settlements in jerusalem shamir declared in a 
speech to jewish fundraisers it is part of israel and it will 
never be divided again 
shamir later explained to reporters that he made the statement 
because some people are talking about settlements in jerusalem 
the great the big suburbs of jerusalem like gilo and ramot 
and ramat eshkol for them they are settlements 
for us they are part of yerushalaim shamir said using the 
hebrew name for the holy city we want to have as many soviet 
jewish olim new immigrants in yerushalaim as possible 
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing it from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war and has declared the unified city home 
to 350000 jews and 130000 arabs its capital 
most western countries including the united states do not 
recognize that claim and say the status of jerusalem should be 
determined in negotiations recent us statements however seemed 
to go beyond that point by objecting to israeli housing projects in 
east jerusalem 
tens of thousands of israelis live in new neighborhoods built on 
the outskirts of east jerusalem since 1967 the population of gilo 
alone for instance now reaches 30000 
however the israelis living there do not get the same financial 
incentives tax deduction and cheap housing as those living in 
the occupied west bank and the gaza strip 
his statements came as the government was debating its response 
to us proposals for starting middle east peace talks 
us secretary of state james a baker iii trying to work out a 
compromise between israel and palestinians who demand an 
independent state with east jerusalem as its capital has suggested 
including an east jerusalem arab in preliminary peace talks with 
israel 
israeli hardliners oppose the idea saying it would amount to 
negotiating the status of jerusalem 
referring to bakers stand on soviet immigration shamir said he 
hopes baker would reconsider his position and change it 
on thursday baker said the united states could not extend a 
400 million guaranteed loan to israel for housing for soviet jews 
if they were settled in the west bank or in gaza or if israel 
continued its settlement projects there 
israel which receives 3 billion in annual american aid says 
it needs the extra money to accomodate the wave of soviet jews 
expected to reach 80000 to 100000 this year some israeli 
officials say as many as 230000 may come 
shamir created a furor in the west and the arab world by 
suggesting israel needs to retain the occupied territories to house 
soviet immigrants 
the government later said it had no policy of directing 
immigrants to jewish settlements in the occupied lands where some 
200 soviet jews have settled in 1989 
amid mounting arab protests over the influx of immigrants the 
government last week announced that soviet immigration figures must 
be submitted to israels military censor prior to publication

these are days of delicious irony 
for enrique bolanos days a decade in coming 
bolanos one of nicaraguas leading businessmen and sandinista 
critics was stripped of his business by the leftist sandinistas 
many people like bolanos left nicaragua long ago convinced 
there was no place for them in a sandinista state but bolanos 
stayed a tenacious critic to the very end 
i wanted to see them crying he says softly i wanted to 
see them crying and crawling 
his wait was rewarded last week when a probusiness prous 
opposition coalition led by now presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro defeated the sandinistas in the general elections 
one of the key planks in the united national oppositions 
platform is privatizing as many confiscated enterprises as possible 
a few miles away and a pole apart from the cool dark study 
where bolanos savors fates intricate twists and turns a 
sandinista party official sits in bolanos old business office 
an ak47 assault rifle leans against the wall 
were not giving up a shred of this esteban corea says 
corea 35 runs what used to be saimsa in the days when it 
belonged to bolanos now it is a stateowned and operated 
agricultural business with 1800 workers named after the brother of 
president daniel ortega camilo who died in the revolution 
the business has 60 rifles most of them ak47s but many of 
the workers have aks at home as well corea says 
it would be nice he says to have more weapons to fight off 
anyone who tries to privatize the confiscated company with its 
cotton gin its airport its farms and its cattle 
the sandinistas have said theyll hand over power but 
unpredictability is a sandinista hallmark and they have vowed to 
defend the gains of the revolution despite repudiation at the 
polls 
bolanos isnt sure the sandinistas will be able to let go after 
more than 10 years in power 
they are stashing arms everywhere in the city in the 
country everywhere bolanos says it is going to be very 
violent nicaragua very dangerous everyone has weapons 
he says it calmly quietly like a survivor 
bolanos 61 was president of the superior council of private 
enterprise the nations leading business group from 1982 to 1988 
a tenacious and outspoken critic of sandinista economic policy he 
was jailed put under house arrest threatened and finally in 
1985 stripped of his business 
they told me it was punishment that i has misbehaved he 
says with a dry little chuckle 
but it wasnt punishment a punishment is something that is 
deserved this was revenge pure revenge 
bolanos a likely candidate for a top cabinet post would like 
at least some of saimsas assets back and compensation for that 
which cannot and he says should not be returned such as land 
now occupied by peasants 
peasants are one thing bolanos archfoes are another 
he savors the dilemma of the top sandinista comandantes people 
like ortega or interior minister tomas borge ensconced for a 
decade in comfortable homes confiscated from affluent capitalists 
did you see that story in the paper how the comandantes are 
afraid theyll lose their homes bolanos says their homes it 
said 
these homes some even call them modest mansions are now 
state property and suddenly the sandinistas arent the state 
anymore 
they thought theyd be in power forever bolanos says 
the sandinistas he says will have to watch the tools they 
fashioned used to undo much of what they built in the name of 
revolutionary reform and military expediency 
the president has the powers of an emperor in the 
constitution its as though daniel ortega thought hed be 
president forever bolanos says 
just wait hell be the one now asking for a change in the 
constitution

lobbyists and lawmakers arent the only fat 
cats hanging around the capitol as the legislature meets in special 
session 
a selfdescribed basic bleedingheart cat lover has been 
providing veterinary care to an assortment of felines who make the 
statehouse grounds their home she hopes to find people to adopt 
them 
diane odegard a clerk for the senate journal said at least 
five cats some of which to be fair are actually rather slim 
have been prowling around the capitol for more than a year 
sometimes in the morning theyll be sitting out sunning 
themselves she said sometimes theyll be sitting on the steps 
of the capitol just like they belong there 
ms odegard and capitol parking attendants believe some of the 
cats were abandoned at the legislative hall as kittens last winter 
and have survived on squirrels and pigeons plus a little help 
from captol workers 
as it turns out a lot of us have apparently been feeding 
them im sure we all thought we were the only ones ms odegard 
said youll walk around the capitol and see a plate of cat food 
here and there 
nevertheless she said the irregular feeding exposure to the 
weather and danger from cars and people prompted her to try to 
improve the cats lot 
ms odegard and carolyn seelig another capitol employee have 
been taking donations to have the cats vaccinated and neutered so 
far ms odegard said she has trapped and altered three cats and 
has found one male tabbie a home 
strays still hanging about the halls of power include a female 
tabbie and a female calico both altered and three males a 
tabbie a large white cat and one with black and white fur 
there may be more than we think this may be fairly futile

up to 10000 mongolians rallied in their capital 
in the largest gathering yet of opposition groups seeking 
democratic reform in the worlds secondoldest communist country a 
foreign source said today 
at sundays rally in ulan bator representatives of the social 
democratic movement announced formation of mongolias second 
opposition party the social democratic party said the source who 
spoke on condition he not be identified 
unlike the mongolian democratic party which was formed last 
month and advocates bringing the country to a higher state of 
socialism the social democrats favor an entirely new political 
and economic structure based on an end to the communist monopoly on 
power and dependency on the soviet union 
the two groups are the most active of the halfdozen unofficial 
political organizations that have sprung up in the past 2 months 
in mongolia a vast pastoral land of 2 million people ruled by the 
communist party since 1921 and long a soviet client state 
sundays rally was the sixth since late december 
some 800010000 people gathered at about noon in front of the 
lenin museum then marched to the great peoples hural or 
parliament on central sukhbator square to present a petition to 
the government 
rallies and demonstrations have been banned at the square but 
there was no attempt to disperse the crowd that gathered there for 
about an hour before returning to the lenin museum it was the 
second time an opposition rally has been held there despite the ban 
the protesters delivered a joint petition to the government 
demanding a special congress of the communist party formation of a 
new party central committee promulgation of a new election law and 
election of new deputies to the hural 
the petition set a deadline of wednesday for the government to 
respond but did not say what would happen if there is no response 
the source said 
speakers reiterated calls for quicker reform and for the 
communist party to give up its 69year monopoly on power 
they criticized mongolias economic relations with the soviet 
union alleging that premier dumaagiyn sodnom who just concluded a 
sixday visit to japan is responsible for unfavorable economic 
agreements with the soviet union the groups also called for 
mongolia to withdraw from comecon the soviet bloc trading group 
there was no police or military presence at the rally and 
police even helped direct traffic when the demonstrators marched to 
and from the central square the source said 
the gathering drew many young people and families with children 
who played under sunny skies and temperatures near freezing which 
the source described as balmy for ulan bator

the united states may sharply curtail the granting 
of asylum to nicaraguan refugees because of their nations switch 
to democracy but there is little chance political exiles already 
here will be forced to return 
in theory people granted asylum are subject to review each 
year and could have that status revoked said duke austin 
spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service in 
washington 
but i know of no single case since political asylum has been 
an avenue in the united states when we have involuntarily returned 
someone because conditions in their homeland improved austin 
said its in the law but its never been done 
what is more likely is that new applicants will get tougher 
scrutiny of their applications 
an estimated 80000 to 90000 nicaraguans are now in the united 
states legally including both political and nonpolitical cases 
some exile advocates say twice that number actually live in this 
country if the count includes illegal immigrants many of whom 
were hoping to win political asylum 
in fiscal 1989 the ins granted just under 6000 nicaraguan 
requests for asylum and denied more than 10000 between october 
1989 and january of this year about 500 were granted and 650 
denied but ins reports that some have been dropping their requests 
for asylum 
most of those voluntarily dropping asylum requests like marlene 
falcon say they are eager to return 
were here not because we want to be but because of the 
repression she said i couldnt see any use to continue 
battling a political asylum claim that didnt have any validity 
the ins rules on political asylum in large part are based on 
state department advisory opinions for each case most denials 
occur because analysts rule applicants are economic rather than 
political refugees 
the state department cautioned it is too early to be assured 
that democracy will stick in nicaragua but a spokesman said policy 
toward asylum will clearly be reviewed 
nat kingsley of the state departments human rights bureau 
emphasized that under us law each application is treated 
individually whether it comes from england or albania 
obviously the conditions within a country play a role but it 
is the individuals relations in that country that are the deciding 
factor he said teams of state department analysts are 
constantly revising evaluations of many factors in each country 
including its human rights record 
for nicaragua its pretty early to tell how it will affect 
asylum kingsley said noting that the constitutional transition 
is not scheduled to occur until april 25 
last year poland and hungary were in effect dropped from the 
list of nations that violated human rights making political 
asylum almost impossible 
a few years ago solidarity people from poland were granted 
asylum almost automatically austin said now theyre running 
the government and we no longer accept applications 
in the week since usbacked violetta chamorro beat the 
sandinistas daniel ortega in nicaraguas presidential election 
miami immigration officials noted the decrease in the asylum 
requests 
dozens of nicaraguan exiles have either dropped their petitions 
to stay or have stopped fighting deportation

a week before elections colombias 
cocaine barons have declared a state of alert in a message that 
suggests they intend to end a 6weekold ceasefire in their war 
against the government 
the announcement sunday by the extraditables the name adopted 
by the medellin drug cartel came a day after president virgilio 
barco announced he will keep extraditing suspected drug traffickers 
instead of trying them in colombia as they have requested 
the traffickers declared a unilateral ceasefire jan 17 in an 
effort to persuade barco to end extraditions of drug suspects to 
the united states 
the government has not extradited any drug trafficking suspects 
since jan 21 and currently holds sixteen in the previous five 
months of the drug war it sent 14 suspects to be tried in the 
united states 
resumption of the drug lords assassinations and bombings which 
had killed more than 200 people since the war began in august 
could disrupt balloting on sunday for mayors city councilmen 
state assemblies and a new congress 
campaigning already has been plagued by almost daily attacks by 
leftist guerrillas 
the traffickers did not say what they meant by a state of alert 
but there was little doubt it was a message that more bloodshed may 
lie ahead 
the traffickers announcement was published sunday by the bogota 
daily el tiempo and broadcast by the radio network caracol 
barco has rejected all appeals by the traffickers that they be 
given guarantees they would be safe from extradition if they were 
to surrender he reiterated his position saturday night upon return 
from a state visit to argentina and uruguay 
in its fight against the drug cartels which began after the 
august assassination of a leading presidential candidate the 
government has wielded extraditions as its chief weapon 
it has also tracked down and killed a top medellin figure 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha raided drug labs and seized cocaine 
weapons and 38 million in cash gold and platinum hidden at 
traffickers ranches 
in their announcement sunday the traffickers denied any role in 
the recent murders of members of colombias leftist party the 
patriotic union 
diego montana president of the patriotic union has blamed the 
army and the secret police for killing many of the 72 party members 
slain this year 
in the caribbean coastal city of barranquilla the headquarters 
of many drug traffickers election officials said saturday night 
that they had discovered that 34000 voters were paid money for 
their votes 
some candidates have said traffickers are financing some 
campaigns but no names have been mentioned and no one has been 
arrested 
on sunday leftist rebels ambushed an army patrol killing 12 
soldiers the 7th brigade said in a statement 
the ambush by the rebel colombian revolutionary armed forces 
took place near the town of san jose de ocune about 250 miles east 
of bogota the army said

if gianni versace was daring last season 
when he hiked his hemlines 10 inches above the knee this time hes 
darn right fresh with skirts so tiny they no longer cover anything 
the peekaboo effect of the new fallwinter collection 
presented in rome on sunday was no accident the flamboyant 
designer favorite son of the showbiz crowd presented them in a 
variety of styles from derriere hugging jersey dresses and skirts 
to elaborately embroidered silk cocktail gowns 
also super short was the 1990s versace version of the loose 
trapeze dress first launched in the 1960s 
gianni was a bad boy when it came to his evening wear too 
slitting the side of a floor length gown straight up the leg the 
same gown has a plunging backline which joins the slit at the waist 
in a single snap what happens if the snap were to pop is anybodys 
guess 
apart from a few raised eyebrows mainly from the staid milanese 
crowd on the first day of the four day readytowear collections 
the general consensus was that whatever gianni does he does so well 
he can get away with it 
one of the things versace does best is jeweled embroidery which 
this season he uses heavily to divert attention from the many bare

to the micro skirt below while simple silk stretch pants turn into

in its latest drastic attempt to 
end hyperinflation the government says it will fire and retire 
civil servants radically trim bureaucracy and raise taxes and 
duties on farm products 
economy minister antonio ernan gonzalez announced the new 
package in a nationally televised speech sunday night 
he called for public support tolerance and comprehension to 
prevent bankruptcy from dragging us into anarchy and social chaos 
banks and exchange houses were to remain closed today to allow 
implementation of measures aimed at stabilizing the countrys 
financial system 
the government of president carlos menem who took office in 
july has been beset by recession inflation that soared more than 
8100 percent over the last 12 months the plunging value of the 
national currency rising interest rates labor strife and record 
unemployment 
the package gonzalez announced was approved during marathon 
weekend cabinet sessions he said the government plans to trim 2 
billion from expenses through the retirement and dismissal of 
government workers and elimination of state bureaucracy 
effective immediately gonzalez said all state workers who have 
reached retirement age but continue to work will be retired while 
those who are within two years of retirement will be laid off and 
paid their salaries until they reach retirement vacancies will not 
be filled 
the minister did not say how many state workers would be 
affected state employees now total 25 million in a total national 
labor force of 125 million 
in addition the minister said all 56 government secretariats 
will be eliminated and subsecretariats will be cut from the 
current total of 112 to 32 with their duties being taken over by 
the ministries from which they now depend 
speaking to reporters after the speech gonzalez described the 
elimination of secretariats and subsecretariats as the most 
drastic of the new measures and denied that the retirements 
constituted massive dissmissals 
the minister also announced intervention in the management of 
the national development bank and the closure effective today of 
the national mortgage bank used principally to finance building of 
lowincome housing 
the banks lose tens of millions of dollars a year through bad 
loans poor collections and the political decision to finance 
provincial budgets at the expense of the national government 
steps also will be taken to solve the problems of a few private 
banks that encounter chronic difficulties gonzalez said without 
specifying what would be entailed 
other steps included suspension for 60 days of payments to 
holders of state contracts and continuation of an earlier measure 
suspending state subsidies for industrial promotion 
gonzalez said the state will raise an additional 600 million in 
income through a 15 percent increase in the tax on capital goods 
and an average 5 percent boost in duties on agricultural exports 
guillermo alchouron president of the argentine rural society 
which represents the countrys leading producers of beef for 
export said the ministers description of the crisis was 
realistic and impressive and recommended postponement of sectoral 
complaints no matter how just and reasonable they may be 
the printing of money to finance the state deficit has been 
prohibited gonzalez said 
the minister also announced that all state employees will be 
paid a minumum monthly salary of 90 beginning april l 
many state employees now earn far less than that amount the 
largest teachers union announced last week it would strike today 
the first day of the 1990 school year if the government did not 
grant a basic wage of 66 a month 
gonzalez made no mention of expected increases in public utility 
rates fuel prices however rose by 1245 percent on sunday 
following a saturday night announcement by energy secretary julio 
cesar araoz 
menem has raised public service rates drastically during his 
eight months in office and pledged to open up argentinas state 
dominated economy by selling public companies deregulating 
monopolies lowering tariff barriers raising taxes and cutting 
subsidies

an iranian newspaper said today that a 
weekend editorial interpreted as a hopeful sign for the release of 
western hostages in lebanon was the personal opinion of the writer 
and not a government statement 
the statement came amid reports from damascus syria that a 
senior iranian envoy met with syrias foreign minister and 
discussed efforts to free the hostages syria is the power broker 
in neighboring lebanon by virtue of its 40000 troops there 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted the english 
daily kayhan international as saying western media distorted its 
editorial by reading it as an official hint of contacts between and 
iran and washington over the hostages who are believed held by 
proiranian factions 
in the saturday editorial also excerpted by irna the paper 
suggested usiranian ties might be improved in the posthostage 
era if washington agrees to release three american moslems 
imprisoned in the united states in exchange for two americans in 
iranian jails 
but today the governmentrun paper distanced itself from the 
statement said irna monitored in nicosia 
neither the writer of that column nor the author of this 
present one is a government spokesman or employee irna quoted 
kayhan as saying no officials of any sort were consulted before 
putting pen to paper 
what was and is now being expressed are privately held 
views kayhan said 
western media reports took the editorial as another in a series 
of signs from tehran in recent weeks that a new effort was under 
way to free the 18 westerners held in lebanon 
they include eight americans four britons two west germans 
two swiss an irishman and an italian most are believed held by 
shiite moslem factions loyal to iran the longestheld is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the editorial followed a spate of statements from iranian 
newspapers saying the hostages should be released because they are 
fueling propaganda against iran 
a syrian source who refused to be identified further said a 
meeting sunday between mahmoud hashemi of iran and farouk alsharaa 
of syria appears to be to coordinate efforts between the 
governments of syria and iran to gain the release of all the 
hostages 
the source said hashemi the brother of iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani had arrived from beirut where he met with 
senior shiite moslem figures on the hostage issue 
another source said this appears to be a serious effort the 
first in some time to end the hostage ordeal but i dont 
think well see anyone out tomorrow 
the iranian paper on saturday had suggested that two americans 
david erwin rabham and jon pattis could be released if washington 
freed dhorubaalmujahid elmer geronimo pratt and khalifa 
hammas abdul khalis who it identified as political prisoners 
in the united states 
pattis a 53yearold engineer was arrested in june 1986 for 
allegedly passing iranian military secrets to the cia for use by 
iraqi bombers in the eightyear iraniraq war 
businessman rabham has been in jail for almost 10 years he was 
arrested after a phone conversation with former president jimmy 
carter when iranian militants stormed the american embassy in 
tehran in november 1979 and held 52 americans hostage 
of the three americans mentioned khalis was the leader of a 
hanafi moslem group that took over three washington buildings in 
1977 holding several hundred people hostage for several days 
before surrendering one person was killed by gunfire from the 
group 
pratt the onetime defense minister of the black panthers 
is serving a life sentence for a 1972 murder conviction

rioting prompted security forces to seal off a 
city in uzbekistan where about 30 demonstrators were killed when 
soldiers fired on them an activist said officials reported only 
the death of one soldier 
yadigar abidov spokesman for the uzbekistan grassroots 
organization berlik said sunday that soldiers would let no one 
leave or enter parkent about 30 miles from tashkent the capital 
of the republic considered the cultural and geographic heart of 
traditionally moslem central asia 
there were conflicting reports over what sparked the violence 
abidov said the city was blocked off after a regional communist 
party leader was stoned to death saturday by the protesters who 
demanded their own candidate in a local election sunday officials 
denied it 
a newspaper said the clashes broke out after residents demanded 
the government move out several hundred meskhetian turks who had 
fled ethnic violence in the nearby uzbek region of bukinsky 
grigory kuplin a spokesman for the interior ministry in moscow 
said at least one soldier died in a clash between demonstrators and 
interior ministry troops saturday he said he had no information on 
other dead or wounded and knew nothing of a curfew in parkent a 
city of 200000 
the uzbekistan interior ministry and other official sources 
contacted in tashkent refused all comment on the violence one 
national newspaper printed a small report sunday on unrest but 
other official media including the official tass news agency 
provided no information 
the republic of uzbekistan has been the most recent area of the 
soviet union to erupt in violence as president mikhail s gorbachev 
loosens decades of tight kremlin control 
twentytwo people were killed in rioting in dushanbe the 
capital of the neighboring tadzhikistan republic last month 
tensions persist in the caucasus republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan where hundreds have been killed in the past two years 
in addition to ethnic tensions residents of uzbekistan are 
frustrated by low wages in the cottongrowing republic ecological 
devastation and poor housing exacerbated by large families 
the komsomolskaya pravda newspaper reported sunday that the 
parkent violence occurred during a meeting of residents demanding 
the evacuation of meskhetian turks 
the turks were forcibly resettled in uzbekistan from the 
caucasus republic of georgia by josef stalin in june they were 
targeted in ethnic violence in the fergava valley of eastern 
uzbekistan that left about 100 people dead 
abidov said the violence broke out when a crowd of parkent 
residents gathered in front of local communist party headquarters 
saturday to demand registration of their candidate in runoff 
elections to the uzbekistan parliament 
uzbekistan held elections of its parliament feb 18 and runoffs 
were held sunday 
abidov said parkent residents were angry that ismail salimov a 
regional communist party first secretary had refused to allow any 
other candidates on the ballot 
at one point soldiers gave demonstrators three minutes to 
disperse and when the crowd refused the troops opened fire abidov 
said 
in the ensuing pandemonium some protesters grabbed stones and 
began to pelt salimov and another party official who died as a 
result of their wounds the activist claimed 
his account could not be confirmed kuplin said he had no such 
information and an official with the local election commission in 
parkent who refused to give his name said salimov was alive and 
voted sunday

communist reformer boris n yeltsin easily won his 
contest but dozens of other local and regional races were headed 
for runoffs after old guard communists in the slavic heartland 
faced their first challenges at the polls early returns indicated 
today 
sundays balloting the first contested local elections for the 
russian ukranian and byelorussian republics was seen as a key 
test of president mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to transform 
soviet politics 
while the vote was only partially democratic prodemocracy 
candidates were expected to unseat many longentrenched communists 
in the baltic republic of lithuania proindependence activists 
said results in runoff elections sunday assured them of the quorum 
they need to covene the republics parliament where activists are 
expected to push for creating a mechanism to secede from the soviet 
union 
nearly 150 million voters were registered to choose among more 
than 11000 candidates for 1800 seats in the legislatures of 
russia the ukraine and byelorussia thousands of seats in local 
governing councils were contested 
official results were not expected to be announced until 
tuesday election officials said but preliminary results showed 
that runoff elections will have to be held in dozens of districts 
where none of the candidates won a majority of the votes the 
balloting is expected in two weeks 
yeltsin easily won a russian parliamentary seat with 72 percent 
of the vote in his home district in the ural mountain city of 
sverdlovsk anatoly moisyev a member of the republics election 
commission said today 
yeltsin hopes to be elected president of the russian republic by 
legislators that post is currently held by politburo member vitaly 
vorotnikov who also won a seat sunday with a majority of 713 
percent 
the russian presidency traditionally merits a seat on the 
nations ruling politburo and yeltsin could possibly return to the 
ruling body from which he was ousted by gorbachev in february 1988 
for criticizing the pace of reform 
in the ukrainian capital of kiev preliminary results showed 
that communist party first secretary vladimir a ivashko a member 
of the politburo seen as a gorbachev protege failed to win a 
majority over 11 opponents and will have to stand again in a runoff 
election 
although communist leaders have at gorbachevs urging endorsed a 
multiparty system noncommunist parties are not yet permitted 
opposition candidates ran sunday as members of grassroots 
citizens groups or as reformist communists 
our elections involve a new type of people people who have 
been given new impetus from perestroika a relaxed confident 
gorbachev said after voting the essence of it is that it is a 
peoples referendum on perestroika 
perestroika is gorbachevs name for his program of 
restructuring soviet politics and the economy so the system is more 
democratic and the bureaucracy that has strangled the economy is 
dismantled 
in the slavic republics reforms where they have managed to 
get started have proceeded more slowly and quietly than in other 
areas there have been neither the concerted drives of the baltic 
republics nor the violence of the caucasus and central asia 
in the ukraines donetsk coal basin however miners went on 
strike friday demanding resignation of the local communist party 
leadership and complaining that promises made after coal strikes in 
the region last summer were not implemented quickly enough 
gorbachev has pressed the communist party to relinquish its 
monopoly on power and pushed for a new more powerful presidency 
hundreds of thousands of people have turned out for prodemocracy 
rallies 
responding to reporters questions after he voted in lenin 
hills the soviet leader said it was not particularly important 
whether the victors in sundays elections were communists 
the 20million member party is trying to get much closer to the 
people and so the question of proportions is not crucial he 
said it is important that people are there who support 
perestroika and are prepared to move this process ahead communist 
or nonparty members all will be good enough 
voters in the ukraine selected a 450member supreme soviet 
legislature byelorussia chose a 310member legislature and russia 
elected a 1068member congress that will choose a legislature and 
leadership from among its members 
the balloting in the slavic republics follows local elections in 
lithuania swept by candidates endorsed by the proindependence 
sajudis movement and several other republics 
voters in 28 lithuanian districts cast ballots in runoff 
elections sunday runoffs in the remaining 17 districts not settled 
in the feb 24 election will be held later in the week the 
official tass news agency said 
on sunday at least nine deputies to the lithuanian supreme 
soviet were elected eight of them supported by the 
proindependence movement sajudis said longinas vasiliauskas a 
sajudis spokesman twothirds of the 140member parliament must 
have been elected before a session can be called 
observers have speculated that sajudis wants a quick parliament 
session so lithuania can vote to secede from the soviet union 
before gorbachev gains his expected broad new powers which include 
the right to suspend republic parliaments and send in troops 
the soviet congress meets in one week to consider gorbachevs 
proposal 
vasiliauskas said the lithuanian parliament would not vote to 
leave the soviet union immediately but wants to create the 
mechanism for secession because we dont know what gorbachev will 
do after hes elected president

a minor earthquake measuring 39 on the richter 
scale shook eastern idaho but caused no damage a spokeswoman for 
the us geological survey said early today 
the temblor at 1151 pm mst sunday was felt by residents of 
the jackson wyo area near the idaho line according to pat 
jorgenson spokeswoman for the usgs in menlo park calif 
the epicenter of the quake was about 30 miles southwest of 
jackson jorgenson said the last recorded quake in eastern idaho 
was in the early 1980s she added 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale is considered capable 
of causing slight damage in the local area a quake of 4 can cause 
moderate damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

cardinal john oconnor said some kinds of rock 
music help trap teenagers into devil worship and he disclosed 
that two exorcisms have been performed in the new york area within 
the past year 
diabolically instigated violence is on the rise oconnor 
said in his sermon sunday at st patricks cathedral 
divorce and abortion are two examples he told parishioners 
oconnor said heavymetal rock music in particular can help 
trap people especially teenagers into devil worship he 
singled out the song suicide solution by ozzy osbourne as an 
example 
the parents of a teenager who killed himself while listening to 
the song sued osbourne in 1986 the lawsuit later was dismissed 
i think the industry had better police itself oconnor told 
reporters after the sermon he avoided calling for music censorship 
oconnor described how young devilworshippers gather in 
cemeteries for disgraceful satanic ceremonies such a ceremony 
could end in suicide he said 
he said the roman catholic archdioceses vicar general 
monsignor patrick sheridan approved the use of exorcism a ritual 
to cast out an evil spirit in two recent cases of demonic 
possession 
as far as we know they have been successful the cardinal 
said 
possession seems to be very rare psychological medical 
and other causes of what appears to be possession must be ruled 
out oconnor said 
he said the novel the exorcist is a gruesomely authentic 
portrayal of demonic possession

nelson mandela laid a wreath today at a 
memorial to those who sacrificed their lives in the independence 
war that transformed whiteruled rhodesia into blackgoverned 
zimbabwe 
mandela 71 said zimbabwes victory was an inspiration to the 
people of south africa where some 5 million whites wield political 
and economic power over a voteless black majority of 28 million 
mandela began his fourth week of freedom from south african 
jails at the north koreanbuilt heros acre shrine a monument to 
the blacks wartime victory 
today i have seen something altogether new he later told 
south african trade unionists and exiles at the university of 
zimbabwe in harare referring to the countrys multiracial society 
and this has convinced me that we are on the threshhold of 
something altogether new in our country 
nothing can ever stop an idea whose time has come he added 
and the time of the idea of liberation freedom and peace has 
come in our country 
mandela now vice president of the african national congress 
was freed feb 11 after more than 27 years in prison for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the pretoria government 
president robert mugabe who led the zimbabwean guerrillas in 
the sevenyear conflict declared today mandela day a public 
holiday but many zimbabweans flocked to work anyway unaware 
theyd been given a day off 
at a state banquet sunday night mugabe spoke of discordant 
voices being heard in the face of efforts towards peace talks 
between the antiapartheid groups and the whiteled government 
this was a clear reference to the panafricanist congress the 
ancs main rival which opposes contacts with pretoria and pledges 
to escalate an armed struggle 
the anc the pac and the south african communist party were all 
legitimized by president f w de klerk last month as a prelude to

south africa sent troops into 
the ciskei homeland today to suppress riots by mobs that burned 
factories and looted shops after the territorys authoritarian 
president was ousted in a military coup 
foreign minister pik botha said his government intervened at the 
request of brig gen oupa gqozo of the ciskei army who seized 
power in a military coup sunday in the nominally independent 
homeland

stabbed to death and dozens of others injured in the rioting

attack government buildings in the ciskei capital of bisho he gave 
no details and did not say whether south african forces were 
involved in fighting with rioters 
there was no immediate word from gqozos junta on the 
developments 
botha had said earlier that south africa would not entertain 
any request to intervene he did not say if south africa would 
recognize the new government in ciskei 
more than 50 factories many of them owned by israeli and 
taiwanese firms were set ablaze today as major rioting and looting 
flared for a second day in mdantsane a sprawling township and 
industrial area in eastern ciskei near the south african city of 
east london officials said 
mobs attacked and burned businesses and shops in fort jackson

new government of ciskei was to reincorporate it into south africa

hotel 
some onlookers attempted to stop the looting but the local 
police made little effort to intervene eyewitnesses said adding 
that some shots were fired apparently by security forces but 
there were no reports of injuries 
residents said the factories were a symbol of the oppressive 
rule of the old government and people were burning them because of 
poor wages and bad working conditions the previous government 
attracted major foreign investment with subsidies and by providing 
workers for wages of 50 or less a month 
but many of the people who looted shops were simply taking 
advantage of the lawlessness others said 
botha said south african forces would protect all threatened 
property

burned and looters used wheelbarrows to haul away stoves 
refrigerators and other goods taken from shops officials said

prime minister toshiki kaifu told critics in 
parliament today that his summit with president bush had very 
good results in reducing economic friction and was not a case of 
onesided yielding to us pressure on trade issues 
the united states is willing to have a dialogue with us do 
you really believe dialogue is bad kaifu asked japan socialist 
party chairwoman takako doi who delivered a lengthy criticism of 
his partys policies 
to avoid going backward we must continue cooperating kaifu 
said i would like to ask for the help and understanding of the 
whole nation in doing so 
while ruling liberal democratic party officials saw the summit 
in palm springs calif as contributing to relations with the 
united states leaders of the socialist party the largest 
opposition group accused kaifu of weakness 
what promises did you make to president bush in the united 
states doi asked after charging that kaifus trip on a weeks 
notice lacked adequate preparation or consultations 
on sunday socialist party secretary general tsuruo yamaguchi 
charged that kaifu had unilaterally yielded to bushs demands for 
economic reform in japan aimed at slimming this nations 49 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
kaifu denied he had merely yielded to us pressure 
he said a decline in the trade imbalance from a peak of 598 
billion in 1987 to 49 billion last year was the result of both 
countries efforts he also defended bushs pledges to cut the 155 
billion us federal budget deficit 
the united states is committed to resolve its problems and we 
must also follow through with our reforms and continue our 
cooperative dialogue with them said kaifu who returned late 
sunday from the weekend summit 
he faced skepticism however over his ability to follow through 
on promises to bush that he will reform japans distribution system 
and land use policies improve living standards and tighten 
enforcement of antimonopoly laws 
in talks called the structural impediments initiative us 
officials have said these reforms are needed to eliminate what they 
call informal trade barriers 
the nations largest newspaper the yomiuri shimbun said bushs 
requests to kaifu would severely test kaifus leadership 
ability another major paper the asahi said the challenge would 
test the entire japanese leadership 
the japanus structural impediments initiative will end in 
empty talk unless japanese companies overly strong competitiveness 
and the nature of japans closed economy are subjected to close 
scrutiny the asahi said in an editorial 
in palm springs bush also said he wanted to help cut the trade 
imbalance by reducing the us federal budget deficit improving 
education and worker training increasing savings and investment 
and encouraging longterm management strategies aimed at boosting 
industrial productivity 
japan is under pressure to show it will implement promised 
reforms before early april when trade negotiators are to issue an 
interim report on the structural trade talks 
japanese officials expressed concern kaifu will have problems 
gathering support for reforms soon enough to satisfy the united 
states kaifu lacks political clout within his own party and faces 
an upper house of parliament dominated by the socialistled 
opposition

moslem militants ambushed a government 
patrol in the heart of srinagar while curfew was lifted briefly 
today and one civilian was killed when the troops returned fire a 
senior officer said 
the militants claimed they killed 12 members of the border 
security force but a senior officer of the paramilitary force said 
only two of his men were wounded and none were killed 
the officer said the ambush in srinagar was one of the boldest 
and best organized ever carried out in the kashmir city center of 
the proindependence movement by moslems who want to secede from 
predominantly hindu india 
the officer speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
attackers fired sovietdesigned ak47 rifles from three directions 
using at least 100 rounds of ammunition 
the attack occurred on the main shopping street in the heart of 
srinagar the curfew which had been in effect since friday 
morning was lifted for the first time for a few hours early today 
to enable thousands of stranded villagers to return home 
the jammukashmir liberation front claimed responsibility for 
the attack saying it was to avenge the killing of 49 moslem 
demonstrators by army and paramilitary troops last thursday 
we have killed 12 indian soldiers we carried out the 
operation this morning to take revenge for the deaths of our moslem 
brothers who were killed by the army a telephone caller told a 
local journalist 
the border security force officer said one civilian was killed 
and a suspected militant was seriously wounded when the ambushed 
troops returned fire 
about 150000 people many of whom had participated in a 
massive antiindia demonstration on thursday were stranded by the 
curfew the intelligence officers said on condition of anonymity 
an estimated one million people streamed through srinagar 
thursday to demand kashmirs independence from predominantly hindu 
india it was the largest proindependence demonstration ever 
staged in the kashmir valley 
the government said its troops opened fire in selfdefense 
witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the 
marchers had tried to grab the weapons of soldiers and paramilitary 
police 
the killings by government troops prompted rebukes from 
neighboring pakistan an islamic nation and appeals for restraint 
from the us state department 
gov jagmohan a federally appointed hindu who is the top 
administrator of jammukashmir state met army and security 
officials during the weekend and was to receive a delegation of 
federal officials from new delhi today sources said 
jagmohan who uses only one name said in an interview sunday 
the government was prepared to call new state elections within six 
months but this seemed unlikely to appease the jammukashmir 
liberation front and other militant groups who say they will be 
satisfied by nothing less than independence 
jammukashmir is the only indian state with a moslem majority 
the southern jammu region of the state is mostly hindu while the 
kashmir region that includes srinagar is predominantly moslem 
spurred in part by the hindu ruler of the old princely state of 
kashmir the valley acceded to india rather than join pakistan the 
two countries went to war in 1949 and 1965 over kashmir but the 
region still remains divided by a ceasefire line separating indian 
and pakistani troops 
kashmiri secessionists initially sought to join pakistan but in 
the past year the militants have been pressing for full 
independence 
jammukashmirs population of 6 million is 64 percent moslem and 
32 percent hindu with small minorities of buddhists sikhs and 
christians nationwide hindus account for 82 percent of indias 
880 million people while moslems comprise 12 percent

to the cheers of hundreds of 
onlookers workers succeeded in lifting bucharests imposing statue 
of lenin from its foundation today after a weekend of intensive 
demolition work 
he was built to last a thousand years but luckily he couldnt 
withstand us said duri gomfedele a member of the crew that 
finally brought down the 25foot seventon bronze statue 
workers labored all day saturday and sunday with jackhammers and 
blowtorches to bring down the statue located in front of the 
staliniststyle state publishing house in the recently renamed free 
press square 
this morning the statue was lifted from its marble base placed 
on a flatbed truck and driven away to a storeroom in fondul 
plastic the citys plastic art foundation workers said 
i cant believe its finally happened said mihai radulescu 
ive been here every day since saturday waiting to see lenin go 
this morning i didnt go to work 
demolition crews had been slowed by the thick bronze rods 
implanting the statue deep in its foundation a small wrecking ball 
that slammed against lenins arm saturday failed to do more than 
shake the statue slightly 
to our surprise there was a bronze plate protecting the 
concrete foundation that also went up through his legs said 
gomfedele it was much more difficult than we expected 
the ruling provisional council of national unity acting as a 
miniparliament until national elections scheduled for may 20 
decided on friday to remove the 30yearold image of lenin 
the statue had become a symbol of the 45 years of communist rule 
that ended in december with the ouster of dictator nicolae 
ceausescu by a popular revolt ceausescu and his wife elena were 
executed on christmas day after a summary trial 
the demolition provided weekend entertainment for hundreds of 
bucharest residents who monitored the job and joked about the 
statues resilience 
authorities said saturday they had not decided what to do with 
the statue which depicts lenin holding his cap and the lapel of 
his overcoat from where he stood he stared down a broad avenue 
towards bucharests arch of triumph 
the now empty pink marble base is covered with anticommunist 
graffitti and blue writing that reads down with the statue

the supreme court in a case stemming from the 
1981 settlement of the iran hostage crisis today rejected an 
appeal by a cleveland ohio company seeking to avoid paying 36 
million to iran 
the court without comment let stand what was described as a 
firstofitskind ruling that american courts have authority to 
enforce such payments 
the agreement between the united states and iran that freed 52 
american hostages in 1981 included release by the us government 
of billions of dollars in frozen iranian assets 
the settlement also set up a process permitting those with 
claims against iran to take them to an international tribunal 
the supreme court previously upheld the power of former 
president carter to approve the settlement 
at issue in the appeal acted on today was whether us courts 
can force american companies to pay claims the international 
tribunal has awarded to iran 
gould inc a high technology firm was ordered by the 
international tribunal to pay 36 million and return military 
radio equipment to iran 
iranian officials asked us district judge richard a gadbois 
jr in california to enforce the tribunals decision 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that us 
courts have such power although the appeals court said the 
authority does not derive directly from the 1981 settlement 
the appeals court said the settlement was designed to secure 
payment of claims against iran and provided no specific vehicle 
for the enforcement of awards in favor of iran 
instead the appeals court relied on a 1958 united nations pact 
called the new york convention it provides for enforcement of 
international arbitration awards 
partystates to the convention agree to recognize arbitral 
awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with their own 
rules of procedure the appeals court said noting that the 
united states signed the pact in 1970 
the 36 million payment order against gould qualifies as such 
an arbitral award the appeals court said as it sent the case back 
to gadbois for further review 
gould acquired hoffman export corp in 1978 the hoffman company 
sold electronic military equipment to iran when it was a us ally 
ruled by shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
the case is gould inc vs iran 891103

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by 661 pilots who say their seniority rights were violated 
after delta air lines acquired western air lines 
the court without comment let die the pilots lawsuit against 
delta and the air line pilots association 
the pilots most of whom had worked for western and now are 
employed by delta said delta reneged on a promise to arbitrate 
labor disputes arising from the 1986 merger of the two airlines 
the former western pilots also accused the air line pilots 
association of failing to represent them adequately 
they said delta used illegal coercion to enforce new seniority 
rankings threatening to lay off more than 300 pilots if the 
rankings were rejected 
as a result the pilots said they occupy just 95 of the top 600 
positions instead of the 189 they are entitled to by seniority 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld a 
california judges dismissal of their lawsuit 
the integration of a seniority list involves much more than 
listing pilots according to the date that each began work the 
appeals court said it encompasses such variables as the pilots 
rank and the kind of aircraft with which a pilot has had 
experience 
the appeals court said the postmerger agreement between delta 
and the pilots union was acceptable to most of the union members 
although it was opposed by most of the former western pilots 
only the collective bargaining representatives or the 
carrier may submit a dispute over the integration of seniority 
lists to arbitration the appeals court said 
that rule is designed to allow a union to focus on the needs 
of its whole membership without undue fear of lawsuits from 
individual members the 9th circuit court added 
the case is herring vs delta air lines 891119

in december because of an irregular heartbeat and had been taking 
medication for the condition doctors said 
an autopsy was planned but not before tuesday said an official 
in the los angeles county coroners office who refused to identify 
himself 
the 6foot7 210pound senior center from philadelphia was 
expected to be a firstround choice in this years national 
basketball association draft he was known for his intensity and 
his will to win 
if there can be any good in this at least he died doing the 
thing he loved best said his high school coach rich yankowitz

talked with gathers three weeks ago and the player said he felt 
good and looked forward to the rest of the season

real happy again focused properly on what was important to him 
everything was fine yankowitz said 
gathers averaged 288 points and 112 rebounds a game this year 
during his junior year he averaged 327 points and 137 rebounds 
and his 1015 points last season ranked him 11th on the alltime 
singleseason scoring list

coast conference tournament game against portland and headed 
upcourt with a big smile 
seconds later without warning he crumpled to the court he 
tried to rise but got only to his knees before collapsing again he 
appeared to suffer convulsions for a few seconds while his mother 
and aunt raced to his side 
their cries could be heard throughout gersten pavillion as the 
crowd of about 3000 sat in stunned silence 
efforts to resuscitate gathers on the court in an ambulance and 
at daniel freeman marina hospital failed he was pronounced dead

rep robert dornan is challenging the 
accuracy of born on the fourth of july saying the hit movie 
could mislead viewers about the record of author ron kovic who may 
be his election opponent 
the republican congressman said he was attacking the movie 
because it could leave people in his district with the impression 
that all of the events actually happened to kovic whose wounds in 
vietnam left him paralyzed from the waist down 
the movie recounts kovics transformation from patriotic marine 
to war opponent 
the movie is in effect his political resume and kovic has 
engaged in resume padding dornan said recently 
sid galanty kovics media representative dismissed dornans 
remarks 
its an entertainment vehicle not a documentary said 
gallanty who did not dispute the discrepancies brought out by 
dornan people who want a strictly factual account should read 
the book 
kovic 43 whose autobiography was made into the tom cruise film 
directed by oliver stone has been wooed by the democratic 
congressional campaign committee 
kovic has not said if he will run against dornan but said his 
time of dedicated service to my country has come again 
in february dornan sent out 20000 fundraising letters that 
called kovic the favorite of the ultraliberal hollywood 
left 
among the inaccuracies cited by dornan and backed by others were 
kovic is shown accidentally killing a fellow marine during 
combat then later going to the dead marines parents to tell them 
of the incident 
marine lt col fred peck responding to media inquiries said 
kovics commanding officer concluded that kovic did not shoot the 
marine kovic told knbctv that the scene of the visit to the mans 
family did not actually happen but was a recurring nightmare that 
he had 
kovic is shown being attacked with other students by 
nightstickwielding riot police in 1970 at syracuse university 
after a speech by the late activist abbie hoffman 
new york state sen nancy hoffman and washington attorney david 
ifshin who both participated in the protest say abbie hoffman was 
never on the campus 
the movie is totally inconsistent with the facts said ms 
hoffman adding that police displayed remarkable restraint 
kovic also is shown being spat on and roughed up by security 
guards at the 1972 gop national convention in miami but former cbs 
correspondent roger mudd who was near the scene of the alleged 
action doesnt remember it that way mudd also denies kovics 
account in his autobiography that mudd interviewed the activist 
during the incident

palestinian leaders from the occupied 
territories demanded today that the plo be involved in proposed 
israelipalestinian peace talks a move israel has consistently 
opposed 
the statement signed by more than 30 prominent palestinians 
from the occupied lands was released as israeli leaders were 
deadlocked over accepting usbacked compromises aimed at getting 
preliminary peace talks under way 
the hardened stance by the palestinian leaders lessens the 
chances of israel accepting the compromises which were aimed 
partly at avoiding even the appearance of plo involvement 
israels rightwing likud bloc headed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir has resisted proposals by secretary of state james a baker 
iii to include residents of arab east jerusalem and two 
palestinians deported by israel among the negotiators 
party hardliners fear such a move would allow indirect 
participation by the plo which israel considers a terrorist 
organization 
the statement by 34 palestinian leaders from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip was circulated in jerusalem and the west bank 
it called for the immediate opening without preconditions 
of a palestinianisraeli dialogue and chided the israeli 
government for placing obstacles in the way of any effort to move 
the peace process forward 
but it also repeated the palestinian demand that the plo 
represent them in the talks 
the plo alone has the right both to form and to announce any 
palestinian delegation to the peace dialogue the statement said 
no palestinian from the israelioccupied territories will

the supreme court ruled today that even when 
police question criminal defendants in violation of their right to 
legal help the responses may be used to contradict trial testimony 
by the defendants 
by a 54 vote in a michigan case the court said the 
constitution does not bar use of such statements when they are used 
by prosecutors to rebut a defendants testimony and impeach the 
accused persons credibility 
the prosecution must not be allowed to build its case against 
a criminal defendant with evidence acquired in contravention of 
constitutional guarantees chief justice william h rehnquist 
wrote for the court 
but use of statements so obtained for impeachment purposes is 
a different matter he said if a defendant exercises his right 
to testify on his own behalf he assumes a reciprocal obligation to 
speak truthfully and accurately 
the court previously has ruled that statements obtained by 
police in violation of a defendants fifth amendment privilege 
against selfincrimination may be used to challenge the defendants 
trial testimony today the court extended those rulings to allow 
use of statements obtained in violation of a defendants sixth 
amendment right to legal representation 
the court ordered further lower court hearings that could lead 
to reinstatment of tyris lemont harveys criminal sexual conduct 
conviction and 6to10year prison sentence 
harvey was accused of sexually assaulting a woman on june 11 
1986 
two months after his arrest and after he was assigned a 
courtappointed lawyer harvey was questioned unlawfully by police 
the police told harvey he did not need to speak to his lawyer first 
because the attorney was going to get a copy of the statement 
anyway 
the statement was used at the trial when prosecutors 
crossexamined harvey to challenge his testimony on the witness 
stand 
harvey testified the woman agreed to remove her clothes 
voluntarily and said the two did not engage in sexual intercourse 
the woman said she was forced to engage in sexual acts 
harveys conviction was overturned by a michigan appeals court 
which ordered a new trial the state court said any statements to 
police as the result of an unlawful interrogation may not be used 
for any purpose at the trial 
rehnquist said the sixth amendment to the constitution 
guaranteeing legal representation to defendants does not prohibit 
use of harveys statement to police as long as it was made 
voluntarily 
we have never prevented all use by the prosecution of 
relevant voluntary statements by a defendant rehnquist said 
the search for truth in a criminal case outweighs the speculative 
possibility that exclusion of evidence might deter future 
violations of rules by the police 
rehnquist was joined by justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justice john paul stevens in a dissenting opinion said the 
tragedy of todays decision is not merely its denigration of the 
constitutional right at stake it also undermines the principle 
that those who are entrusted with the power of government have the 
same duty to respect and obey the law as the ordinary citizen 
he was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and harry a blackmun 
the case is michigan vs harvey 88512

at least 500 lawyers walked off their 
jobs and sat on the lawns in front of the supreme court building 
monday to protest what they called human rights violations by the 
government 
the hourlong demonstration organized by the nepal bar 
association brought work in the court to a standstill court 
officials said 
bystanders and visitors to the court were held back from the 
site of the demonstration by riot police 
lawyers say 59 of their colleagues were arrested in the 
governments crackdown on a movement for greater democracy several 
have been released and one alleged police tortured those detained 
for five days i had to sleep on damp floors with only rotten 
food to eat even drinking water was not available said asik ram 
karki 
he said some of those arrested were beaten on the soles of their 
feet 
a nationwide movement was launched feb 18 by the nepali 
congress party and the communist party of nepal demanding the 
restoration of multiparty democracy and an end to a 1961 royal 
decree banning all political parties 
according to the government 12 people have been killed in 
demonstrations and police firing since then but activists say the 
toll is double that figure 
nepals 2yearold experiment with westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra father of the present monarch king 
birendra dissovled the government of the nepali congrees party 
accusing it of corruption and poor administration 
the government accuses the multiparty advocates of trying to 
impose their version of democracy on a nation that they say already 
has a working deomcracy 
power in nepal is shared between the king and the nonpartisan 
rashtriya panchayat or national assembly onefifth of the 
panchayats 140 members are nominated by the king the rest are 
elected 
the government of king birendra says the campaign to lift the 
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum which 
narrowly voted for retaining the panchayats system of nonpartisan 
membership

the supreme court today used the case of a 
south carolina death row inmate to limit the ability of criminal 
defendants to challenge their convictions in federal court 
the court in a 54 decision upheld the conviction of horace 
butler sentenced to die for the 1980 murder of pamela lane 
the court refused to apply retroactively a 1988 ruling that bars 
police from questioning a suspect about any crime once the suspect 
has invoked his right to have a lawyer present 
the body of ms lane an 18yearold clerk at a convenience 
store near charleston was discovered near a bridge july 17 1980 
butler was arrested six weeks later on assault and battery 
charges unrelated to the womans death 
he obtained a lawyers representation after refusing to talk to 
police without an attorney present sometime later police 
questioned him about ms lanes death and butler confessed he shot 
her 
butler asked a federal judge to throw out his conviction on 
grounds that under the supreme courts 1988 ruling his rights 
were violated by unlawful police questionning 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
it was too late for the 1988 ruling to be of any help to butler 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said the 
decision by refusing to apply new court rulings to previous 
criminal cases strips state prisoners of virtually any 
meaningful federal review of the constitutionality of their 
incarceration 
he was joined in dissent by justices thurgood marshall harry a

top us trade negotiators told congress today 
that they have been disappointed with the lack of progress so far 
in efforts to reduce japanese barriers to american imports 
but the negotiators held out hope that the weekend summit 
between president bush and japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
may reenergize the stalled talks 
two senators warned of growing congressional unhappiness with 
the seemingly intractable 49 billion trade deficit america is 
running with the japanese they raised the possibility of 
legislation that would force the administration to retaliate 
against japanese products sold in this country 
deputy us trade representative s linn williams told a senate 
trade subcommittee that in the three rounds of talks held so far 
little progress has been made he said the japanese negotiators 
have raised a number of reasons for being unable to make the 
reforms sought by the american side 
we are not satisfied with the progress of the talks 
williams said the basic question is whether the japanese side 
sees the negotiations as damagecontrol and a public relations 
exercise or as a substantive effort on that the jury is still 
out 
williams appeared with officials from state treasury commerce 
and the council of economic advisers to give a progress report on 
the socalled structural impediments initiative which aims at 
eliminating economic shortcomings in both countries viewed as 
culprits in the massive trade imbalance 
on the japanese side negotiators are focusing on various 
exclusionary business practices that keep out foreign competition 
the american issues include a low savings rate and high federal 
budget deficit which increases the need for foreign capital to 
finance the us savings shortfall 
the negotiators who face a deadline of april for an interim 
report and july for a final report have achieved no breakthroughs 
so far 
trade held center stage at a twoday summit between bush and 
kaifu in palm springs calif over the weekend the administration 
officials today said they were encouraged by the pledges both 
leaders made after the discussions concerning the need to make 
progress 
however sen max baucus dmont chairman of the trade 
subcommittee of the senate finance committee said that kaifus 
promises of reforms made to bush were not enough 
every us president since nixon has gotten promises of a more 
open market from japan most of those promises have been empty 
he said 
baucus and sen john danforth rmo both said that congress 
patience was growing short and if the talks failed it was likely 
that japan would face legislation requiring mandatory legislation 
the next few months are going to be telling months for japan 
and for the bush administration danforth said

seven women were sent into a pool of potential 
jurors today for the irancontra trial of john poindexter 
including a lawyer who worked in george bushs presidential 
campaign 
us district court judge harold greene disqualified one of 
eight prospective jurors as the jury selection process got under 
way for the trial of the former national security adviser 
one of those questioned by greene and lawyers for both sides was 
a real estate lawyer who worked in bushs campaign on a team that 
did background reviews of potential vice presidential candidates 
the woman said one of poindexters defense lawyers joseph small 
had babysat for her when she was a child 
just because counsel babysat for her doesnt cast any doubt on 
her said greene who sent her into the pool 
richard beckler one of poindexters lawyers started off the 
questioning by asking the first prospective juror what she thought 
of reagan 
the young woman an unemployed delivery driver for an auto parts 
firm wasnt given a chance to answer irancontra prosecutor dan 
webb objected to becklers question without giving a reason and 
us district court judge harold greene sustained the objection 
a pool of 206 potential jurors was set up for the poindexter 
trial and 50 of them were in the us courthouse for the first day 
of questioning seventysix of the 206 prospective jurors said in 
questionnaires filled out last week that they had seen read or 
listened to portions of poindexters immunized testimony to 
congress in 1987 according to greene 
poindexter is accused of conspiracy obstructing congress and 
making false statements for allegedly covering up oliver norths 
secret contra resupply network and lying about a 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran 
theformer president gave videotaped testimony last month in the 
case and poindexters lawyers are expected to replay it in court 
reagan said he instructed his staff that all efforts to assist the 
nicaraguan contras should be done within the law 
reagan said he didnt think poindexter had made any false 
statements to congress and that im in complete support of 
letters by poindexter which form the basis of one of the 
obstruction charges against him concerning the contras 
poindexter is the highestranking reagan administration official 
to go on trial in the scandal us district judge harold greene is 
presiding in the poindexter case and a jury of 12 people will be 
selected from a pool of residents from the district of columbia 
directing the prosecution is chicago trial lawyer and former 
us attorney dan webb while poindexter is being defended by 
longtime washington dc attorney richard beckler 
the irancontra affair began unfolding in october 1986 when an 
ammunitionladen c123 that was part of norths operation was shot 
down inside nicaragua north later testified under a grant of 
immunity that he began shredding documents after the cargo plane 
was shot down 
the next month there were news reports from beirut of us arms 
sales to iran north later testified that thencia director william 
casey advised him to destroy evidence relating to the initiative 
the contra and iran parts were linked on nov 25 1986 when 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii announced that iran arms sale 
money had been diverted to the contras 
the indictment against poindexter deals with his alleged 
assertions to congress on nov 21 1986 that he didnt find out 
that hawk missiles had been shipped to iran in november 1985 until 
two months after the delivery 
poindexter ha said his recollection of the hawk shipment was 
very very fuzzy in november 1986 and that while he may have 
made incorrect statements he did not lie to congress 
national security council computer messages support norths 
testimony last year that he kept poindexter advised of the november 
1985 shipment both before and immediately after it occurred but 
poindexter said he forgot 
my best recollection is that i did not remember anything 
about or know anything about the hawks until january 86 
poindexter told congressional investigators in immunized testimony 
in 1987

the head of the union representing mail 
carriers came to the defense of higher postage rates monday a day 
before the postal service was expected to announce plans to raise 
the price of a stamp 
a stamp today in terms of real dollars is cheaper than it 
was in 1971 said vincent r sombrotto president of the national 
association of letter carriers 
the us postal service has scheduled a tuesday news conference 
at which it is expected to announce plans for a rate increase 
affecting all classes of mail 
the new rates would take effect sometime in 1991 probably 
including a 30cent price for firstclass stamps currently the 
firstclass rate is a quarter 
it cost 8 cents to mail a firstclass letter when the current 
postal service was set up in 1971 adjusting for inflation since 
then the cost should of a stamp now should be just what it is 25 
cents sombrotto said 
but he added in 1971 the postal service received several 
million dollars in tax subsidies that have been eliminated if that 
value were included stamps should be selling for 33 cents today 
sombrotto said 
sombrotto said he anticipated that a planned rate increase will 
renew discussions of turning the postal service over to private 
business or allowing private companies to compete in mail delivery 
it would be an absolute disaster if that were to happen he 
said 
the postal system is designed to provide service to everyone in 
the country at the same price he said contending that private 
companies could choose to serve only profitable urban areas 
leaving the costly rural deliveries to the postal service that 
would mean either higher costs for rural residents or taxpayer 
subsidies sombrotto said

on a hill overlooking the center of 
vilnius three tall white crosses stand in simple defiance to 
history 
hidden by locals to prevent destruction by the soviets in the 
late 1940s the stone crosses were brought out again last year and 
given their former place of prominence 
the crosses are emblematic of the city of about 400000 people 
that is surrounded by low wooded bluffs and bisected by the 
greengray ribbon of the nera river vilnius has learned to survive 
foreign conquest and reemerge with its essential character intact 
today as electric trolleys whoosh along its stonepaved streets 
past colorful kiosks and centuriesold churches vilnius presents 
an attractive face in contrast to the gray monotony of other soviet 
cities 
as the capital of lithuania the baltic republic incorporated 
into the soviet union in 1940 and now struggling to restore its 
sovereignty vilnius finds itself at the center of a peaceful 
rebellion against soviet control 
the lithuanian communist party officially broke ranks with 
moscow in december and multiparty elections on feb 24 brought to 
office what will be the soviet unions first 
noncommunistdominated parliament its first duty will be to lead 
lithuania back to full independence 
despite the momentous changes the city seems curiously calm and 
rancorless as though it would not be wise to get too excited just 
yet 
on the springlike day last month when the voting took place 
townspeople lounged in lenin square reading books or chatting with 
their grandchildren 
at the center of the park stands the 30foottall statue of 
lenin but his oratorical posture seemed out of place with the 
relaxed mood around him 
if lithuania follows the rest of eastern europe the lenin 
statue may not be standing much longer and the communist party will 
find itself on the sidelines 
the situation is not yet ripe for the communists to leave but 
in the long run yes they will go said kastas kumstys a 
student sharing a park bench with his girlfriend 
they had voted earlier in the day for a professor from the 
sajudis independence movement but kumstys said he had no illusions 
the situation would quickly improve 
my parents had stalinism and now we have a time of everything 
overturning he said i dont think it will be better soon 
what most people talk about is not the elections but the 
terrible state of the shops 
on otherwise elegant gedimino street where a huge placard 
proclaims a lithuania without sovereignty is a lithuania without 
a future scores of saturday shoppers lined up for small green 
oranges being unloaded from moldy boxes marked cuba 
elsewhere in the market barriers kept people back while workers 
filled a stand with grapefruit when the barriers were removed 
shoppers raced to the stand elbowing aside each other as they 
greedily grabbed for the citrus 
at a music store up the street the only records being offered 
for sale were comecon music lps from czechoslovakia cuba 
bulgaria and the soviet union 
the kind of music i like they dont have here said a 
20yearold disgruntled shopper walking out the door 
the young man spoke in russianaccented polish one of the three 
languages of vilnius 
lithuanian is spoken most followed by russian but many 
residents are ethnically polish and retain the language that 
dominated the city then known as wilno when it was part of 
poland from 1920 to 1939 
poland and lithuania were united from 1386 to 1795 and its upper 
classes remained polish into modern times 
marshal jozef pilsudski so loved his home town that he conquered 
it for newly restored poland in one of the small wars that followed 
the collapse of the russian empire in world war i 
the nascent state of lithuania was forced to set up its capital 
in kaunas 60 miles away a fact lithuanians have neither forgotten 
nor forgiven 
after poland fell in the early days of world war ii and the 
soviets annexed lithuania vilnius was made capital of the 
lithuanian soviet socialist republic one of the 15 republics 
making up the ussr

a judge today reluctantly agreed to a months 
delay in the trial of four young white men accused of killing a 
black teenager the prosecution had sought the delay to find a 
missing witness 
judge thaddeus owens had first ruled that jury selection should 
begin today as scheduled if you cant move the case thats your 
problem he told the prosecution 
but he changed his mind less than an hour later after 
prosecutors insisted they were not ready to proceed 
i have no choice owens conceded the law is clear on 
that 
he set a new trial date of april 2 a date which he said was 
written in stone 
prosecutors announced last week that an important witness was 
missing and said that if he were not found by today they would seek 
an adjournment 
the four defendants are among seven young white men who are 
charged in the slaying of 16yearold yusuf hawkins who was 
surrounded and killed aug 23 after he ventured into the 
predominantly white bensonhurst section of brooklyn to look at a 
used car 
zistrict attorney charles j hynes had said the disappearance of 
john s vento would not ruin the rosecutions case obviously 
you want as many building blocks as possible but without him well 
be able to proceed to trial he said earlier 
privately though prosecutors said the setback was a severe 
blow and defense lawyers who had pressed for an immediate start 
of the trial maintained the disappearance would seriously affect 
the prosecutions case 
a second blow to the case came when it was revealed several days 
ago that another key prosecution witness gina feliciano a woman 
who has been under police protection since the attack has entered 
a drug rehabilitation center 
the judge was expected to empanel two juries to simpwaneously 
hear testimony against two sets of defendants 
lawyers on both sides said vento 21 has admitted participating 
in the attack and maintains he saw a gun passedxto the man accused 
of fatally shooting hawkins in the chest 
vento was given a deal to testify if he fails to surrender in 
the next few weeks hynes said he will void the plea bargain and 
charge vento with murder 
authorities have described the killing as a racial attack 
sparked by a dispute between one of the defendants and accused 
ringleader keith mondello 20 and miss feliciano a former 
girlfriend 
as word spread through the mainly white neighborhood on the 
evening of the slaying that miss feliciano had invited black and 
hispanic friends to her 18th bcrshday party mondello allegedly 
recruited several friends to take on what they saw as intruders 
police said the whites mistook hawkins and his three pals all 
black for miss felicianos guests and set upon them as the gang 
of up to 30 whites surrounded the young blacks joseph fama 19 
allegedly opened fire with a pistol 
hawkins collapsed on the sidewalk and died as members of the mob 
fled 
fama and five others have been charged with murder a seventh 
defendant steven curreri 19 was charged with assault 
the remaining three defenants will be tried later 
miss feliciano is considered a key witness by prosecutors who 
planned to call her to the stand to establish a motive for the 
attack and to identify gang members

a judge monday dismissed a misdemeanor 
prostitution charge against a man accused of killing 11 women 
arthur j shawcross was to be tried on a charge of patronizing a 
prostitute but the prosecution did not want to proceed with the 
case because of the possibility that barbara mae dodson a key 
witness would invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to testify 
about her alleged prostitution activities 
the monroe county district attorneys office also was concerned 
about generating publicity before shawcross murder trial abate 
said 
jeffrey abate an assistant district attorney had asked that 
the prostitution trial be postponed until after the murder trial 
but city court judge john manning regan had denied the request 
shawcross attorney david murante opposed the dismissal of the 
charge saying the trial would have been an opportunity to test 
dodsons testimony 
dodson gave police a statement on jan 3 detailing two alleged 
encounters she had with shawcross 
shawcross was arrested the next day on the prostitution charge 
and subsequent questioning led to his being charged in the 
slayings which occurred during the past two years

mongolians are showing resentment of 
the generations of domination by moscow that began when their 
country followed the soviet union to communism in the early 1920s 
growing antisoviet feeling is expressed in many ways from 
heated exchanges between mongolian journalists and soviet diplomats 
to a hissed russkie when a mongolian driver mistook an 
american for a russian 
soviet influence has been strong since the founding of the 
mongolian peoples republic when its two neighbors china and the 
soviet union parted over ideology in the 1950s mongolia sided 
with moscow 
a foreign reporter who had spent five years in the soviet union 
described ulan bator mongolias capital as a typical russian 
town 
the mongolian language is written in cyrillic the same script 
as russian nearly all educated mongolians speak russian and almost 
all intellectuals studied in the soviet union which has put a 
great deal of money into the vast pastoral nation of only 2 million 
people 
ulan bators debt to moscow has been estimated by western 
economists at the equivlalent of nearly 6 billion 
in recent years mongolians have begun emerging from the soviet 
shadow nationalism which sometimes takes the form of 
antisovietism is growingre usually

abcs life goes on averaged a 15 percent audience share and

national ratings are due tuesday 
athough still toprated 60 minutes had begun falling in the 
ratings since rooneys threemonth suspension on feb 8 
on feb 25 the show slipped to 18th place in the weekly 
nielsens but research analysts at all three networks said that 
primarily was due to abcs competition that night a rerun of the

rooney was suspended without pay after a homosexualoriented 
magazine quoted him as making disparaging racial remarks rooney 
denied the remarks attributed to him 
he had drawn fire earlier from gayrights groups for a december 
special on cbs in which he cited homosexual unions as among the 
causes of premature deaths 
on thursday cbs news president david burke who never 
specifically said why he suspended rooney ordered an early lifting 
of the suspension allowing the 71yearold commentator to return 
to work 
obviously the return of andy rooney had a lot of people 
tuning in said cbs research vice president michael eisenberg 
people were curious about the whole matter and we probably

when the white government 
established black homelands in the 1960s it saw them as the 
perfection of segregation and the ultimate answer to south africas 
racial conflict 
now those homelands long ignored and usually docile are 
turning on their creators some are becoming a force in the 
struggle against apartheid south africas official policy of 
segregation by race 
military leaders who seized power sunday in the ciskei homeland 
left no doubt of their loyalties they were flanked at their first 
news conference by officials of the african national congress the 
main black group fighting white domination 
the coup ousted president lennox sebe 63 one of several 
authoritarian leaders of homelands who have worked closely with 
south african security forces and suppressed antiapartheid 
activists 
homeland leaders of sebes generation face increasing pressure 
from restless young activists who see the homelands as an attempt 
to restrict blacks to the most isolated and underdeveloped parts of 
the country 
south africa spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to 
support the homelands which have little industry or arable land 
brig gen oupa gqozo 37 who led the ciskei coup said he 
wants the homeland to relinquish its nominal independence and 
return to south africa 
the homelands are falling apart unable to contain the 
accelerating rate of political change the antiapartheid 
newspaper weekly mail said in an editorial 
rising expectations for reincorporation in south africa and 
longrunning resentment against poverty have led to strikes 
demonstrations and political violence 
south africa has 10 black homelands and has declared four of 
them independent since 1976 including siskei their independence 
is not recognized abroad 
about half of south africas 28 million blacks live in the 
homelands which are scattered across the eastern half of the 
country and were established when hendrik verwoerd led south africa 
as prime minister in the 1960s 
verwoerd sought to make all blacks citizens of the homelands 
giving them local autonomy and leaving whites in control of the 
national economy and government 
the rule of older conservative tribal chiefs in the homelands 
began to falter in 1987 when gen bantu holomisa then 32 seized 
power in transkei 
holomisa made overtures to antiapartheid groups and favors a 
referendum on whether transkei should relinquish independence and 
return to south africa 
he recently helped organize a huge rally for walter sisulu and 
other leaders of the african national congress which rejects the 
homelands and praised holomisa as an antiapartheid ally 
leaders of the lebowa and kwangane homelands also have expressed 
support for the anc 
since holomisa began making changes in transkei rebellion has 
increased in other homelands 
among recent developments 
dissident army officers in bophuthatswana held president lucas 
mangope hostage in february 1988 until the south african military 
intervened and restored him to power 
in the past month unrest has has cost six lives and injured 
dozens of people mangope rejects calls to return the territory to 
south africa and declared we will be an independent state 100 
years from now 
hudson ntsanwisi chief minister of gazankulu was not seen in 
public for several days during recent violence in which at least 10 
people were killed students workers and bureaucrats have 
conducted strikes or demonstrations in recent weeks 
civil servants have been striking in venda and at least 18 
people were reported killed several in confrontations with 
authorities 
in kwazulu supporters of mangosuthu buthelezi the chief 
minister are involved in a 4yearold power struggle with 
antiapartheid groups aligned with the anc 
buthelezi sees the homelands as a step on the path to black 
majority rule he opposes apartheid but parts with the anc over 
its support for guerrilla warfare sanctions boycotts and other 
confrontational measures 
south africa sent security forces into ciskei to stop looting 
but did not indicate monday that it planned to restore sebe who 
was accused of widespread corruption the south africans have not 
tried to intervene on behalf of other homeland leaders threatened 
by unrest 
president fw de klerk has not renounced any aspect of the 
homeland system or taken a position on returning the areas to south 
africa he has said however that the homelands will be welcome to 
take part in negotiations on a new south african constitution

the us tax court has upheld an irs order 
denying a tax exemption to a south carolina private school on 
grounds it discriminates against blacks 
the absence of either a single black student in the school or 
a plausible explanation of inability to attract black students 
permits an inference of discrimination particularly in view of 
the schools history the court held 
the decision made public monday means that contributions to 
calhoun academy in st matthews sc are not deductible 
chief judge arthur l nims iii held that although calhoun had 
adopted a racially nondiscriminatory policy the school had failed 
to operate under that policy 
we cannot conclude that nondiscrimination in operations 
is more likely than discrimination nims wrote for the court 
calhoun organized as a notforprofit corporation dec 30 
1969 offers classes for grades kindergarten through 12 the school 
has never had a black pupil or teacher two black parents requested 
and were given application forms for enrollment in 198485 but a 
black teacher has never applied for employment 
since 1982 at least one pupil of oriental background has been 
enrolled in calhoun the only nonwhite teacher a 
japaneseamerican was hired in 1983 court records showed 
the school amended its charter in 1985 and began advertising 
that it did not discriminate it applied to the internal revenue 
service for a tax exemption in 1986 
the irs denied the exemption citing the fact that calhoun was 
formed at a time of enforced desegregation in area public schools 
its total lack of black pupils despite blacks being a majority in 
calhoun county and its failure to announce a policy of 
nondiscrimination until 1985 
at a later meeting the irs suggested that calhoun improve its 
contacts with the black community and offer reduced tuition for 
black pupils a director of the school rejected the reducedtuition 
suggestion saying it would result in unequal treatment on the 
basis of race 
in siding with the irs the tax court cited a 1983 case in which 
the supreme court had stripped a tax exemption from bob jones 
university after finding that it discriminated on the basis of race 
the supreme court held that racially discriminatory schools 
violate fundamental public policy and cannot be viewed as 
conferring a benefit on the public 
from the record before us nims wrote it appears that 
white students and their parents gravitate to petitioner calhoun 
at least in part because of a historical absence of black students 
petitioner admits that the local public schools are superior in 
material respects yet considerably less expensive 
petitioners survival would thus depend to some extent on 
perpetuating its history the court ruled adding that such 
discrimination would clearly preclude a federal tax exemption

health secretary louis w sullivan said monday 
that a 66 billion plan to expand federal health care benefits 
could backfire like last years failed medicare catastrophic 
coverage program 
good intentions can have unintended consequences particularly 
if they carry a high price tag sullivan told the house select 
committee on aging 
his comments were directed at recommendations last week by the 
us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health care known as 
the pepper commission in honor of its first chairman the late rep 
claude pepper dfla 
the commission made up of 12 members of congress and three 
white house appointees recommended a broad expansion of benefits 
to the uninsured and those who need longterm care at home or in 
nursing homes the plan would cost the federal government 66 
billion and private businesses 20 billion in increased 
contributions to employee health plans 
the commission did not specify how the government would pay for 
the new benefits 
sullivan called the commissions recommendations one 
contribution to the public debate over desirable health policy 
goals but said the administration was awaiting reports from 
several other panels that also are looking at health issues 
sullivan said he hoped the administration would have its own 
recommendations by this fall 
i want to be sure that as i go forward with recommendations to 
the president that they are recommendations that will stand the 
test of time sullivan said 
we do not want another catastrophic outcome on our hands and 
my concern is that the 66 billion price tag on the pepper 
commissions proposal could result in just that he said 
congress last year repealed the medicare catastrophic program 
which offered expanded health benefits to 33 million elderly and 
disabled individuals after some older americans complained that 
the benefits were too expensive and in many cases duplicated their 
private insurance coverage 
noting that the pepper commissions recommendations on longterm 
care were adopted on a divided vote sullivan said there clearly 
is not yet a strong concensus for those programs 
he also expressed concern about the added costs to business 
under pepper commission plan saying the new requirements could 
have very adverse effects on businesses as well as their employees 
as well as on national competitiveness

more than 360 lebanese fleeing their 
warbattered country have been detained at rome and brussels 
airports with forged visas to the netherlands aviation officials 
in beirut said monday 
more than 300 were being held at romes leonardo da vinci 
airport and 60 at brussels zaventem airport after a dutch 
immigration officer ruled their visas fake preventing them from 
continuing to amsterdam the officials said 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
detainees were mostly young men and their families who have lost 
hope that lebanons 15yearold civil war will end 
the latest round broke out jan 30 with more than 750 people 
killed and thousands wounded in the fight between renegade army 
gen michel aoun and the lebanese forces militia under samir geagea 
for control of the christian enclave 
those held in rome traveled during february from various middle 
eastern points including beirut the syrian capital of damascus 
and the cypriot town of larnaca the officials said 
the brussels detainees were stopped by police when they arrived 
on a middle east airlines jetliner on feb 28 with fake visas to 
the netherlands the lebanese aviation officials said 
italian and belgian authorities have reached no final verdict on 
what to do with the detainees a belgian magistrate ruled he 
airline should cover the expenses of the group in brussels 
according to the officials 
in italy the case prompted the authorities to impose a fine of 
about 1100 on any carrier for every passenger brought in with a 
forged visa the decision has not retroactive the officials said 
they said belgium warned the airline in january for carrying 32 
passengers bound for stockholm sweden via belgium because they 
asked for political asylum when they arrived in brussels their 
passports and visas were found to be fake and they remain under 
arrest in brussels the officials added 
lebanese police have said racketeers have been tricking 
thousands of desperate lebanese into buying false visas at up to 
1200 per visa 
they said these rackets operated in beiruts moslem and 
christian sectors as well as east lebanons bekaa valley and the 
main palestinian base at the ein elhilweh refugee camp in the 
southern port of sidon

penalty law in a decision that might invalidate the sentences of 
the states 85 death row inmates

easier for capital case jurors to consider all mitigating 
evidence

they tell juries choosing life or death for convicted murderers 
voting 54 in a separate case to uphold a california mans death 
sentence

the soviet legislature monday directed two feuding 
caucasus republics to start negotiations toward settling the ethnic 
conflict that has killed hundreds of people in two years of unrest 
the supreme soviet returned to the emotional theme that has 
added a constant undercurrent of tension to its deliberations on a 
day during which a lack of a quorum frustrated efforts to take up a 
law on property ownership one of the key aspects of mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic reforms 
if approved the law on property would break soviet socialist 
tenets by allowing private individuals to own means of production 
and hire workers a final draft presented monday also dropped a 
preamble that declared socialist property the foundation of the 
socialeconomic system of the soviet union 
instead of using the longhated term of private property 
the measure instead calls it the property of citizens 
legislators approved a directive written on the dispute between 
armenia and azerbaijan by its presidium or executive body on a 
vote of 29820 with 45 abstentions after a debate punctuated by 
pleas for reason and angry shouting by armenian deputies 
supporters and opponents of the directive agreed it would not 
solve the key problems of the region but they differed on whether 
it was a step forward 
every passionate speech is one more letter in a death sentence 
for a living person said deputy nikolai medvedev of lithuania 
speaking in support of the directive 
armenian deputy lyudmilla arytyunyan told reporters all 14 
armenians present voted against it 
armenians say azerbaijan has lost the moral right to rule the 
disputed nagornokarabakh territory and demand that it be taken 
from azerbaijan and placed under national jurisdiction she said 
control of predominantly armenian nagornokarabakh is at the 
center of the dispute between the two republics but the directive 
said nothing about nagornokarabakh 
asked about medvedevs plea she said i would like to ask 
is it better to live on your knees or die standing up 
it gave the interior ministry which controls the police the 
kgb and the two governments two months to report back on who was 
responsible for ethnic attacks on armenians in baku azerbaijan in 
midjanuary that killed scores of people and led the kremlin to 
send in soldiers 
an angry vice president anatoly i lukyanov who presided over 
the session told legislators it was a shame to show on the 
daily delayed tv broadcast that they could not muster a quorum to 
debate the property law 
some of the missing lawmakers were occupied by sundays election 
to local and republic governing councils in russia the ukraine and 
byelorussia he said 
twothirds of the 542 members of both houses of the supreme 
soviet or 361 members must be present to pass legislation on 
monday morning 346 were present and that swelled to 364 when 
lukyanov brought the 34article bill up for an itembyitem vote 
but then only 352 deputies voted on the first item and lukyanov 
gave up further consideration of the bill until tuesday 
it was brought to the supreme soviet two weeks ago just after 
the communist party declared that individuals should be allowed to 
own factories and other means of production legislators found it 
too vague and sent it back for more committee work 
the new draft strengthens provisions allowing individuals to 
hire others long prohibited by soviet socialism as exploitation 
as long as they are provided adequate wages and benefits 
yuri kalmykov chairman of the supreme soviet committee on 
legislation told legislators the committees rejected a specific 
mention of private property in the law because soviets cannot agree 
on what it means

the white house said monday that there are no 
grounds for expecting the imminent release of american hostages in 
lebanon though there is a lot happening in behindthescenes 
efforts 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said many people 
excluding us government officials are involved in discussions 
around the world on behalf of the hostages 
the intermediaries include businessmen diplomats of other 
countries representatives of the hostage families and their 
employers and people who have contacts in iran and lebanon he said 
often they represent themselves as representing the united 
states but that is not the case fitzwater said 
many of them have had contacts with the us government he 
said they have told us what they are doing they have asked us 
for advice 
when all this comes out later i dont want it said they were 
working for the us government theyve gotten advice and 
comments and so forth so there is a lot happening 
i dont want to be discouraging he said i want to be 
encouraging we want as many people to be helping on this as 
possible 
however fitzwater emphasized that the united states will make 
no concessions in return for the hostages release 
we cannot say that there is any movement he said we know 
of no imminent release 
fitzwater underscored that the united states is ready to talk 
directly with iran about the hostages whenever iran is ready to 
do so 
so far he said iran has not shown any interest 
iran is believed to exert considerable influence over hezbollah 
an umbrella group of shiites believed to hold some of the americans 
in lebanon 
fitzwater said that no us government officials were speaking 
with iran about the hostages 
asked what the administration said to intermediaries who want to 
work on the hostages behalf fitzwater said we give them our 
policy and we say no deals if you can be helpful fine but keep 
in mind this is our policy no deal 
fitzwater told reporters that if the united states becomes 
involved in talks about the hostages well try to keep you 
informed of talks i suspect they would be public but you never 
know 
eighteen westerners are being held in lebanon they include 
eight americans four britons two west germans two swiss an 
irishman and an italian most are believed held by shiite moslem 
factions loyal to iran 
the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
speculation about their release has been fueled by a spate of 
stories about contacts in the middle east about the hostages 
for example a syrian source said mahmoud hashemi a senior 
iranian envoy met sunday in damascus with farouk alsharaa 
syrias foreign minister to coordinate efforts between the 
governments of syria and iran to gain the release of all the 
hostages 
the source said hashemi the brother of iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani had arrived from beirut where he met with 
senior shiite moslem figures on the hostage issue 
another source said this appears to be a serious effort the 
first in some time to end the hostage ordeal but i dont 
think well see anyone out tomorrow

a prosecution witness against joseph 
hazelwood clashed angrily today with a defense attorney who 
suggested the witness had been coached to give opinions damaging to 
the skipper of the exxon valdez 
william milwee jr an expert in salvaging grounded vessels 
shouted they didnt tell me to say anything as attorney 
michael chalos attacked his testimony 
milwee has said that hazelwood was reckless in his maneuvering 
of the grounded tanker after it rammed a jagged reef he has said 
hazelwood risked capsizing the ship by trying to run it off the 
reef 
chalos produced a letter from prosecutors to milwee which 
suggested facts supporting those opinions the letter was dated 
before milwee wrote his report in the case but milwee said he 
formed his opinion independently 
the interrogation came as the prosecution prepared to close its 
case against hazelwood defense lawyers were marshalling expert 
witnesses to show the nations worst oil spill was an accident not 
a crime 
any captain that was ever involved in a grounding or a 
collision could be in the defendants chair if a maritime accident 
were a crime said defense attorney michael chalos 
chalos who said hazelwood was feeling better after a bout with 
the flu said the defense planned to call about 10 witnesses the 
prosecution was expected to rest today or tuesday 
defense witnesses will range from experts in matters of the sea 
to fact witnesses who saw hazelwood on the day his ship 
grounded they will seek to show that his actions do not support 
felony and misdemeanor charges 
these are not criminal acts the lawyer said in an interview 
sunday this is a maritime accident 
chalos said an expert in computer simulations will show jurors 
conclusively that the exxon valdez voyage would have ended safely 
if crew members followed the skippers orders for navigating 
through a narrow passage into prince william sound 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was absent from the ships 
bridge when the 987foot tanker went aground on jagged bligh reef 
last march 24 the prosecution claims he was reckless and has 
charged him with a felony criminal mischief and three 
misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
he could receive up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
the three issues which the prosecution has raised and which the 
defense must address are hazelwoods alleged intoxication his 
departure from the bridge 10 minutes before the accident and his 
alleged recklessness in trying to move the tanker off the reef 
after the grounding 
the exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into 
the clear waters of prince william sound killing thousands of 
birds fish and other wildlife and coating hundreds of miles of 
rocky shore with black goo 
chalos sees the alcohol issue as the keystone of the 
prosecutions case and suggests there is no conclusive proof 
hazelwood was intoxicated if they cant prove intoxication its 
a very flimsy case he said 
an expert in alcohol toxicology was expected to be the 
prosecutions climactic final witness and the defense will answer 
with its own expert interpreting hazelwoods blood alcohol reading 
of 061 in a test 10 hours after the grounding 
does this indicate alcohol consumed hours before the ship sailed 
or possible drinking after the ship grounded no one has said and 
not a single witness has described hazelwood as appearing drunk 
the charge of recklessness hinges on hazelwoods actions after 
the grounding 
prosecution witnesses have accused hazelwood of recklessly 
risking his ship and the lives of crew members by trying to run the 
tanker off the reef the defense insists he never tried to get off 
the reef and said exxons salvage master will support that point in 
testimony 
but even if hazelwood did try to move the tanker the defense 
says it would never have budged the prosecutions own experts 
have said conclusively that it couldnt move said defense 
attorney thomas russo 
to find hazelwood guilty of recklnessness russo said the jury 
must believe there was a substantial risk the skipper ignored 
there was no risk because it couldnt move russo said if 
you cant commit the crime there is no crime 
of course only one witness can say exactly what the captain had 
in mind on the fateful night and that is the captain will he 
testify 
we havent decided that yet said russo and we wont 
decide it until the very end

the government on monday approved a 
plan that would allow the stateowned korea electric power corp to 
import enriched uranium from the soviet union for nuclear power 
plants an official said 
the decision cleared the way for south korea and the soviet 
union which have no diplomatic relations to begin cooperation in 
nuclear power 
the power company will import 40 tons of uranium each year for 
10 years 
other details of the agreement have not been worked out yet but 
one power company official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified said the price of the soviet uranium would be set at 
between 600 and 700 per ton almost half of what the company is 
paying now 
in return south korea will make nearly 30 percent of its 
payments to the soviet union in electronic consumer goods such as 
televisions and computers 
south korea buys most of its uranium ore from australia and 
canada and has it enriched in the united states and france south 
korea pays 1060 per ton for the enriched uranium officials said 
south korea has nine nuclear power plants in operation and two 
under construction it plans to build three more by 1998 
south korea is the worlds 10th largest producer of nuclear 
energy and generates nearly 50 percent of its electricity in 
nuclear power plants 
despite a lack of diplomatic relations the soviet union and 
south korea have expanded economic and cultural ties recently 
trade between the nations totaled 700 million in 1989 and is 
expected to rise to 1 billion this year

chancellor helmut kohl on monday 
defended his demand that a guarantee of polands border be linked 
to warsaws renunciation of war reparations saying poland has been 
demanding compensation for forced laborers used in the third reich 
in east berlin meanwhile communists and opposition parties 
agreed to submit a broad social charter to lawmakers in both 
germanys designed to protect east germans against social hardships 
once the countries merge under a capitalist system 
the charter adopted at weekly negotiations between the 
communists and 15 opposition groups demands that the right to work 
and the right to accommodation be enshrined in the constitution of 
a united germany 
it also calls for guarantees of democratic and humane working 
conditions education and health services for all protection of 
pensions equality of the sexes and social integration for the 
disabled 
kohls refusal to give poland guarantees about its border has 
led to a widening split with foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher and the two met privately monday to discuss the issue 
results of the meeting were not made public 
genscher has been saying that west germany must make clear to 
its neighbors that a unified germany would not be a threat 
this not only concerns polands trust but that of all 
europeans he told the zdf television network 
kohl has said he has no designs on land ceded to poland after 
the third reichs defeat about a third of modernday poland 
but he has insisted that only the government of a united germany 
could have final say on the matter kohl faces west german 
elections in december and is apparently concerned about losing the 
conservative vote 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has called on both 
germanys to begin negotiations on a treaty that would recognize the 
oder and neisse rivers which currently form the border as the 
permanent boundary between poland and germany 
on friday kohl said such a treaty would have to be tied to 
polands 1953 renunciation of war reparations and of its pledge 
last year to protect the ethnic rights of its german minority 
kohls demands produced astonishment in warsaw and harsh 
criticism from politicians at home 
the chancellor trying to justify his demands said monday that 
since 1987 poland has been raising the topic of compensation for 
poles sent to nazi labor camps during world war ii 
kohl also said he would oppose signing a peace treaty as a means 
of settling the border issue no world war ii peace treaty was ever 
signed 
in east berlin opposition minister gerhard poppe said the new 
social charter once adopted by the east german parliament should 
serve as the basis for east germanys negotiations with its 
capitalist neighbor on economic monetary and social union 
he said the charter also would be presented to the west german 
bundestag for discussion 
according to the charter unification should be based on 
reforming of both german social security systems to perfect the 
positive points of both 
single parents large families pensioners and the disabled 
should receive special advantages the document said 
delegates also urged guarantees to protect east germans 
personal property and savings 
the proposed social charter comes less than two weeks before 
east germanys march 18 elections for a new parliament 
east germans traditionally have viewed their social security 
network as the paramount achievement of more than 40 years of 
communist rule and they are nervous about what might happen to 
them under a capitalist system 
once efficient western methods are introduced to east germanys 
statecontrolled industry for example the nownegligible 
unemployment rate in the countrys 9 millionmember work force 
could jump to as much as 15 percent rent prices also are likely to 
surge 
east germans in general know little about west germanys social 
security network viewed as one of western europes most generous 
the conservative alliance for germany backed by kohls 
christian democratic union appealed to voters not to fear the 
switch to capitalism 
east germanys christian democratic union chairman lothar de 
maiziere said difficulties in the transition were a direct result 
of years of communist mismanagement 
he pledged that the abolition of rent and food price subsidies 
would be compensated by an increase in personal income 
meanwhile hundreds of disabled demonstrated in leipzig monday 
for the conversion of a communist government hostel into a center 
for the handicapped the east german news agency adn reported 
the agency said the demonstrators many in wheelchairs 
protested inadequate accommodation by waving banners that read 
integration instead of isolation rights not charity 
the hostel is the only building in the city built with 
provisions for the disabled adn said

the mayor said monday he plans to apologize 
to the family of a young black man who was questioned in a 
manslaughter investigation that has prompted comparisons to 
bostons infamous stuart case 
a white man has since been arrested 
although mayor mark johnston said he would write a letter of 
apology he insisted that police in this southern maine town did 
nothing wrong and were not motivated by racism when they detained 
19yearold jonathan johnson as he returned home from school 
wednesday 
they did exactly what they were supposed to do look for a 
man fitting that description johnston said it would be no 
different he said if it had been a large fat man with a balding 
head 
an naacp leader agreed that authorities had acted properly 
when i first heard about this the first thing that came to 
mind was the stuart case said neville knowles president of the 
maine chapter of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
but after sitting down and talking with the chief and the 
deputy chief its my feeling that race didnt have anything to do 
with the actions of the saco police department 
in the boston slaying of carol stuart black men were randomly 
questioned by police on the basis of a false report by the womans 
husband who eventually was implicated in the killing and jumped to 
his death off a bridge 
johnson was questioned about the shooting death of 21yearold 
joseph low after two of the white victims roommates said a black 
youth had fired the fatal shot a third roommate who is white was 
later arrested and charged with manslaughter 
detective sgt michael harriman said johnson was detained for 
about an hour and 45 minutes before being questioned for about five 
minutes he was then released 
in the interim police were interviewing two of lows roommates 
lisa catroppo 17 and simon langdon 20 harriman said as we 
continued the interview we came to realize that the story about the 
black man was bogus the detective said 
the two roommates later admitted they had fabricated the story 
and that no black man was involved according to harriman 
lows other roommate 20yearold dana g harris was later 
arrested on a charge of manslaughter and was being held in lieu of 
25000 cash bail authorities said 
harriman said no charges have been filed against catroppo and 
langdon in connection with their initial report to police he said 
the state attorney generals office was considering filing charges 
but assistant attorney general pamela ames said no criminal 
prosecution was contemplated 
harriman said johnsons mother had spoken to police when they 
arrived at the apartment to question her son and was very 
understanding about the situation 
she could understand that her son happened to be in the wrong 
place at the wrong time harriman said

farmers often choose agriculture because 
it offers independence and wide open spaces but singles isolated 
on the high plains and windswept prairies have found life on the 
land is lonely without love 
what surprises me is the number of people in the 30s 40s and 
50s whove never been married said marcy gahm president of 
singles in agriculture a lot stay on the farm with their 
parents and when mom and dad die suddenly theyre really alone 
gahm said about 700 singles from around the country belong to 
the organization which she founded four years ago they meet 
regularly to share stories about their common bond 
many live and work on farms especially in the midwest others 
who now live in town trace their roots to agriculture 
they gathered here in the heart of the cornbelt from thursday 
through sunday for the organizations fourth national convention 
i started dating late in life and i live in an isolated area 
so there is no way to meet people said farmer and winemaker 
jerome hoelscher 53 of garden city texas 
i was really uncomfortable when i attended the first meeting 
but now i feel so at ease with all these people its hard to 
believe said hoelscher who raises cotton wheat and sorghum on 
his 1700acre farm in west texas 
members pay 20 to join and 15 to 30 for a listing in the 
groups directory either by name or by confidential code 
they meet at various places throughout the year camping in 
arkansas squaredancing in ohio boating on the mississippi river 
some make no bones about it they want to get married others 
just enjoy being with people who understand them 
im not interested in getting married but i do like that 
macho outdoortype man strong healthy and downtoearth said 
nell youngblood a 62yearold widow from tulsa okla 
hoelscher said women with agricultural backgrounds understand 
the oddities of farm life things that might put off a woman from 
the city 
the first thing they wouldnt understand is that you cant go 
a short distance to the shopping center or supermarket he said 
theyd miss being surrounded by a lot of other people 
farmers also have to work long hours including saturdays and 
sundays sometimes and he said farm wives often share the chores 
she might wind up doing work with her hands thats not so 
attractive getting dusty and cold said hoelscher its not a 
sheltered life like the city 
it is a life that appeals to debby loveless of mechanicsburg

the supreme court today overturned a key 
portion of north carolinas death penalty law in a decision that 
will invalidate the sentences of most of the states death row 
inmates 
by a 63 vote the justices set aside a north carolina 
murderers death sentence reaffirming a decision that makes it 
easier for capital case jurors to consider all mitigating 
evidence 
the decision does not mean that any death row inmates will go 
free but it does mean that as many as 70 convicted murderers must 
have new sentencing hearings said north carolina attorney 
general lacy thornburg it means in each case that another jury 
will be required to again decide the appropriate punishment 
it was not immediately clear why the decision would not affect 
all 85 of the states death row inmates 
essentially the system that was condemned is the system weve 
been using since 1977 for sentencing people to death said 
raleigh lawyer malcolm r hunter jr who represented the death row 
inmate involved in todays decision 
it could have a very broad impact hunter said 
the court also gave state prosecutors greater leeway in what 
they tell juries choosing life or death for convicted murderers 
voting 54 in a separate case to uphold a california mans death 
sentence 
and in a third deathpenalty ruling the justices split 54 in 
ruling that an oklahoma murderer is procedurally barred from 
contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore sympathy 
before it sentenced him to death 
the courts decision in the north carolina case probably will 
not affect any death row inmate outside the state and the two 
other rulings are not likely to affect many of the some 2200 death 
row inmates across the nation 
in other action the court 
ruled that even when police question criminal defendants in 
violation of their right to legal help the responses may be used 
to contradict trial testimony by the defendants 
by a 54 vote in a michigan case the court said the 
constitution does not bar the use of such statements when they are 
used by prosecutors to rebut a defendants testimony and impeach 
the accused persons credibility 
ruling in a case stemming from the 1981 settlement of the iran 
hostage crisis rejected an appeal by a cleveland ohio company 
seeking to avoid paying 36 million to iran 
the court without comment let stand what was described as a 
firstofitskind ruling that american courts have authority to 
enforce such payments 
agreed to decide whether louisiana officials wrongly are 
giving a convicted murderer mindaltering drugs just so he can be 
executed for his crime 
the justices said they will study the case of louisiana death 
row inmate michael owen perry convicted of killing his parents and 
three other relatives 
the courts decision in the california death penalty case is a 
defeat for richard boyde who was convicted and sentenced to die 
for the jan 15 1981 murder of dick gibson a riverside calif 
convenience store clerk 
police said boyde then 24 was accompanied by his 19yearold 
nephew carl ellison when abducting gibson during a robbery that 
netted 33 in cash gibson was taken to a nearby orange grove and 
shot 
ellison also was convicted and was sentenced to 25 years to 
life in prison 
boyde had been convicted of robbing the same convenience store 
five years earlier and had been implicated in at least four other 
convenience store robberies 
the jury that sentenced boyde was read a list of specific 
mitigating factors it could consider in choosing his punishment 
jurors also were told they could consider any other circumstance 
which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a 
legal excuse for the crime 
boydes lawyers argued that the instruction prevented jurors 
from considering factors regarding his background and character 
that might have been found to be mitigating even if they did not 
lessen the gravity of the crime itself 
the jury also was told it was required to impose a death 
sentence if it found that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating 
factors 
boydes lawyers said the mandatory language prevented sentencing 
jurors from considering his case a whole 
the california supreme court decided by a 43 vote in 1988 that 
boyde had not been harmed by the challenged instructions 
neither instruction is still used in california however 
in upholding the state court ruling today chief justice william 
h rehnquist wrote there is not a reasonable likelihood that the 
jurors in boydes case understood the challenged instructions to 
preclude considerations of relevant mitigating evidence 
rehnquist was joined by justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens dissented 
in the north carolina case the court set aside the death 
sentence of dock mckoy jr convicted of the dec 22 1984 
shooting death of anson county deputy sheriff william kress horne 
prosecutors said horne was one of several deputies who responded 
to reports that mckoy was drunkenly shooting off his shotgun at his 
home near wadesboro nc 
relying on its 1988 ruling in a maryland case the high court 
said the jury that sentenced mckoy wrongly was limited in its 
consideration of mitigating factors because jurors were told they 
had to agree unanimously on the existence of each mitigating factor 
north carolinas unanimity requirement violates the 
constitution marshall wrote for the court 
he was joined by brennan white blackmun and stevens kennedy 
wrote a separate opinion joining in the result rehnquist scalia 
and oconnor dissented 
in the oklahoma case the court never reached the merits of 
death row inmate robyn leroy parks challenge on an 
antisympathy instruction his sentencing jury received 
instead kennedy wrote for the court that parks was procedurally 
barred from raising that argument after having exhausted his direct 
appeals in state courts 
kennedy was joined by rehnquist white oconnor and scalia 
parks was convicted of the 1977 killin of abdullah ibrahim a 
gas station attendant in oklahoma city 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals by a 64 vote in 1988 
threw out parks death sentence after it upheld his murder 
conviction the appeals court said the instruction given to his 
sentencing jury undermined its consideration of mitigating 
evidence factors pointing to life in prison rather than death 
as the appropriate punishment 
the presiding judge had told jurors you must avoid any 
influence of sympathy sentiment passion prejudice or other 
arbitrary factor when imposing sentence 
the justices in 1987 upheld a california murderers death 
sentence even though jurors in that case were told they should not 
be swayed by mere sympathy 
the court said in the 1987 ruling that reasonable jurors would 
understand that instruction as a directive to ignore only the 
sort of sympathy that would be totally divorced from the 
mitigating evidence 
today the court never answered whether the instruction given to 
the jury in parks case is constitutional 
the relief parks seeks would necessitate the creation of a new 
rule kennedy said and such a decision generally cannot be made 
in a case that is not on direct appeal 
the cases are boyde vs california 886613 mckoy vs north 
carolina 885909 and saffle vs parks 881264

the fbis suspension of a cubanborn agent in 
connection with a reported spy probe is part of a pattern of 
harassment against hispanic agents the mans lawyer charged monday 
hispanic agents won a discrimination lawsuit against the bureau 
two years ago 
special agent fernando e mata a 15year veteran stationed in 
miami who in 1983 received the justice departments top award for 
his counterespionage has been placed on administrative leave and 
his security clearance has been revoked said antonio silva who 
represents mata in the bias case 
the case against mr mata is a house of cards silva said 
there is no substance whatsoever to the allegations it is 
nothing more than reprisals and retaliation against him 
the investigation involves matas alleged contacts with cuban 
intelligence agents the new york times reported monday but silva 
said that under a federal court order he could not confirm that he 
did say that the fbis case apparently relies on the disputed 
results of lie detector tests 
in washington the fbi issued a statement saying it would be 
inappropriate to comment on the case 
matas home telephone number is not listed 
silva an el paso texas attorney who handled the 1988 
discrimination case tried in that city said the fbi initially 
looked into accusations against mata in 1987 but dropped that 
investigation 
then in august 1988 mata testified in support of the lawsuit 
brought by 311 hispanic fbi agents who charged they were 
discriminated against in hiring promoting and disciplining silva 
said the old investigation suddenly resurfaced 
the timing on this is just outrageous silva said it had 
lain fallow for one year and was resurrected two weeks after his 
testimony 
the attorney said in the eyes of some superiors mata had 
violated what agents call the first commandment dont embarrass 
the fbi 
there has been a series of retaliatory charges against agents 
who testified in the lawsuit he said including three in san 
antonio one in philadelphia and one in los angeles silva also 
said there have been almost daily informal reports of other 
kinds of harassment some of the cases have involved accusations as 
serious as tipping off underworld figures or stealing confiscated 
money silva said 
the difference in mr matas case is that its coming from the 
upper levels of the fbi silva said 
in november 1988 three months after appearing in court mata 
filed an affidavit with the court complaining he had been put under 
administrative inquiry for supposed security lapses during his 
trial testimony 
silva and matas other attorney in the case hugo rodriguez 
also were investigated by the fbi a probe ordered halted by us 
district judge lucius bunton who presided over the bias case 
in his trial testimony mata 48 who has a law degree said he 
was told he could not be a legal adviser for the bureau in 
washington because of his dark skin and accent he also said he was 
ostracized by his colleagues in miami because he participated in a 
fundraiser for the lawsuit 
bunton found the fbi had discriminated and in may stripped fbi 
supervisors of the power to overrule decisions by the bureaus 
career promotion board 
his order also set up a panel of three outside attorneys to 
decide if up to 200 hispanic agents should be promoted to make up 
for past job discrimination 
fbi director william sessions decided not to appeal the decision

us trade representative carla hills said 
monday the japanese risk having our market closed or at least 
gravely limited if they fail to open trade barriers to american 
exports 
two key senators made similar comments suggesting a 
protectionist trade war as bush administration negotiators 
admitted making little progress so far in cracking japanese 
trade bars 
the negotiators said that it is too soon to predict whether 
president bushs weekend summit with prime minister toshiki kaifu 
will produce results but that the japanese now must move rapidly 
to provide solutions 
hills answering questions after a speech said theres no 
question that japan has gained its economic wellbeing from 
worldwide trade and worldwide investment 
and if it fails to open its markets to the same extent to our 
entrepreneurs as our markets are open to japanese entrepreneurs 
they risk having our market closed or at least be gravely limited 
and therein risk killing the goose that laid their golden egg as 
well as ours 
the senators meanwhile said there could be a trade war if 
tokyo does not bow to us demands in the structural impediments 
talks before the next economic summit in july in houston 
antijapanese sentiment in the united states is rising fast 
said sen max baucus dmont japan has a choice it can either 
follow the lead of the rest of the world and open its markets or it 
can keep its markets closed and have the rest of the world follows 
its lead 
sen john danforth rmo said the bush administration has 
done nothing yet to warrant congratulations on getting japan to 
open its markets adding congress will not accept a public 
relations job which attempts to buy us off 
if we didnt go far enough in 1988 believe we can go 
farther danforth said referring to the trade act two years ago 
calling for retaliatory steps if japan does not lower is barriers 
to imports from abroad 
under secretary of state richard mccormack said us negotiators 
avoided pressuring japan in the first three rounds of talks in 
order to prevent the issues from becoming political footballs 
in japans parliamentary election last month 
but at the next session april 2 and 3 in washington the 
japanese side must move rapidly to provide solutions to the 
problems we have been discussing for six months he said 
the negotiators however said there is no assurance that will 
happen despite the mutual pledges by bush and kaifu at their 
hastily arranged meeting last weekend in palm springs calif to 
redouble efforts on both sides 
the basic question is whether the japanese side sees this as a 
damage control exercise public relations or whether they see it 
as one requiring substantive effort said deputy us trade 
representative s linn williams 
on that point the jury is out williams told the senate 
finance subcommittee on trade chaired by baucus proof is in the 
results its too early for us to pass judgment 
j michael farren the commerce departments under secretary for 
trade said the us trade deficit with japan has improved by only 
73 billion less than 15 percent since 1987 despite a 45 percent 
devaluation of the dollar against the yen 
at the same time he said the us deficit with west germany 
has declined by half and with korea taiwan and other east asian 
countries it is down by 29 percent 
while kaifu last weekend promised bush more action during the 
election campaign last month he ruled out repealing a retail store 
law that keeps some us companies out of tokyo farren said 
he also complained that japans trade minister has rejected 
revising antimonopoly laws that allow collusion among japanese 
firms to effectively bar us steel companies access 
even more fundamentally farren said there is an 
allbutexplicit underlying assumption that the japanese surplus 
must be maintained as a hedge against anticipated oil prices 
increases 
which means he said that american workers will continue 
paying the insurance premium with the price being american jobs and 
a diminishing us standard of living 
john taylor a member of bushs council of economic advisers 
acknowledged the faster and further progress we seek has not 
materialized but he said it would be premature to pass 
judgement before the april round is concluded and a final report 
is completed in july

parliament on monday adopted a law 
restoring names the 15 million ethnic turks and other native 
bulgarian moslems had to forsake under a forced assimilation 
campaign launched by the old communist leadership 
under the new law all bulgarian citizens can choose their own 
names without restriction 
some ethnic turks are still unhappy with the law which includes 
a clause that requires name changes to be approved by a court 
about 3000 moslems held a protest vigil outside the 
cordonedoff parliament building monday saying they would not 
leave until they saw the law in writing they were informed of the 
laws passage by medyud doganov a turkish leader and two 
legislators 
also monday 30000 miners and other workers were on strike in 
several regions according to the opposition newspaper 
demokratsiya workers at 26 mines went on strike last week 
alleging the government has not kept its promise to increase their 
pay and improve working conditions 
ethnic turks and other moslems were forced to take bulgarian 
names in an oftenviolent assimilation campaign authored by 
communist leader todor zhivkov who was deposed in november 
most of bulgarias 9 million people belong to the bulgarian 
orthodox church 
the name law became the centerpiece of the parliamentary session 
after other reform items were shelved partly because they had not 
been discussed with the opposition talks between the communist 
government and opposition were suspended three weeks ago over 
disagreement over political and economic reform 
communists in bulgaria unlike those in other soviet bloc 
countries have retained much of their clout in national politics 
on sunday moslem and opposition leaders appealed for people to 
stay away from sofia fearing clashes between moslems and bulgarian 
nationalists some of whom oppose any concession to turkish or 
other minority groups 
the assimilation campaign was marked by protests and violence 
in the past two years authorities violently suppressed ethnic 
turkish unrest over the policy that denied them religious and other 
minority rights amnesty international said 100 people died 
last year about 320000 ethnic turks emigrated to turkey after 
zhivkov granted them passports turkey had to close its borders to 
stem the influx it said it could no longer handle 
since then more than 150000 turks facing poor housing and a 
lack of jobs in turkey have returned to bulgaria only to find 
their jobs forfeited and their homes occupied 
the new communist government led by moderate of andrei lukanov 
has so far failed to complete an emergency economic program badly 
needed to revamp the wobbly economy or to implement promised 
political reforms

a senior member of the house armed services 
committee predicted monday that congress will try to slash more 
than 8 billion from president bushs 292 billion defense budget 
for fiscal 1991 
rep marvin leath dtexas who also serves on the house budget 
committee questioned army officials on what impact a significant 
reduction in the presidents spending blueprint for the fiscal year 
that will begin oct 1 would have on their service 
i dont like to play a what if game leath said if we 
hold the cut to 8 billion some members of armed services would 
feel some kind of victory 
leath suggested that if such a cut were made the army might be 
faced with a reduction of 3 billion to 4 billion from the 
proposed total 
it would be devastating if we took that kind of cut said 
the army chief of staff gen carl e vuono who predicted that 
personnel and readiness expenditures would bear the brunt of the 
cuts 
reducing the size of the forces not spending on major weapons 
programs would result in the quick savings many members of 
congress expect from the defense budget with the soviet threat to 
the west diminishing but the deficit increasing 
you would be back to fracturing the force and i dont use that 
term lightly vuono told the house armed services committee 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
panel said the 8 billion is not far off of whats being kicked 
around the committee chairman suggested that vuono and army 
secretary michael pw stone start planning on restructuring the 
force to reflect the expected congressional cuts 
the fiscal 1990 defense budget calls for an increase from this 
years 2868 billion in outlays to 292 billion a 2 percent 
reduction after adjusting for anticipated inflation

campbell soup co has voluntarily recalled 
24000 packages of its microwave chunky beef soup because the soup 
was not heatprocessed and could contain harmful organisms the 
agriculture department said monday 
although no illnesses have been reported we strongly urge 
consumers to avoid opening or tasting the product said lester m 
crawford administrator of the departments food safety and 
inspection service 
the microwave soup was made in the companys maxton nc 
facility and distributed to retail stores in indiana michigan 
ohio pennsylvania west virginia and wisconsin 
some of the 24000 packages also were distributed to the 
military but the amount was not determined said jim greene a 
spokesman for crawford 
the soup was packaged in paper cartons each containing one 
9ounce microwavable plastic bowl with a metallized sealed 
lid the announcement said the suspected product is identified 
by a threeline code stamped on the side panel of the package 
only packages with the code dec90 est4r co9j are being 
recalled 
the problem was reported to usda after company officials 
discovered that one days production was not sterile and could 
allow the growth of organisms that cause illness if those

a nuclear power plant worker 
was charged monday with spiking a lunchroom cooler with radioactive 
water that eight men drank before the contamination was discovered 
the eight who drank the contaminated water last month at the 
point lepreau plant have a slightly higher chance of getting 
cancer officials said but are in no immediate health danger 
daniel george maston 33 assistant operator at the plant 
bordering saint john was arrested sunday in the incident which at 
least one power plant worker said appeared to be a practical joke 
gone awry 
royal canadian mounted police released few details of the 
investigation that led to mastons arrest 
during a court appearance monday maston was charged with 
causing a noxious substance to be administered with intent to 
endanger lives or cause bodily harm the charge carries a maximum 
penalty of 14 years in prison 
the contamination was discovered feb 22 during routine urine 
checks of plant employees 
police officials said the day before a glass of slightly 
radioactive heavy water was dumped into a 52gallon cooler that 
provides water to a dispenser that mixes it into fruit juice 
heavy water is used to cool the power plants reactor it is not 
radioactive itself but the water is exposed to radioactivity from 
the plants uranium fuel rods 
maston did not speak during his 10minute appearance provincial 
court judge bill mccarroll ordered him held until he finds a lawyer 
and enters a plea wednesday 
the courtroom was crowded with other workers from the nuclear 
power plant but only one trent lamb spoke with reporters 
he described maston as a quiet guy and said many lepreau 
employees believe the water contamination was not malicious but a 
bad practical joke lamb was not among the eight who drank the 
tainted drink 
maston does not work in the control room of the power plant 
officials said he has been an employee of lepreau for several 
years 
colin nichols president of the union that represents more than 
half the workers at point lepreau refused to discuss maston or the 
charge against him but nichols said the arrest has eased tensions 
people are feeling a little more comfortable said nichols 
head of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local 
2309 but there are still a whole lot of questions we all want 
answered about why someone would do this 
the workers who drank the spiked juice none of whom have been 
identified publicly met monday afternoon with a doctor who advises 
the atomic energy control board which regulates the canadian 
nuclear industry 
the doctor was brought in to answer the workers questions about 
their exposure officials said 
one worker was exposed to almost four times what is considered 
the annual safe limit of radiation officials said the others 
received lesser exposures 
the annual limit of radiation for workers in the nuclear 
industry is set at 50 millisieverts the average person is exposed 
to about three millisieverts a year from the suns rays and 
uranium on earth 
under federal regulations none of the eight will be allowed to 
work in areas of the generating station where they would be exposed 
to radiation for one year 
before most people were very proud to say the worked at 
lepreau but right now people are pointing fingers making jokes 
about glowing in the dark nichols said our production record 
is worldclass and all that goes out the window with this black 
mark

workers picketed 11 major hotels monday as both 
sides awaited word on whether gov john waihee would intervene in a 
2dayold strike 
the walkout by 7500 employees began early saturday after 
negotiators for local 5 of the hotel and restaurant employees union 
rejected managements final offer 
economists have said the strike could badly damage the hawaiian 
economy if it is lengthy and if news reports give potential 
visitors the impression that the states tourist industry is 
paralyzed 
the strike affects about onefourth of the 37000 hotel rooms in 
waikiki the states prime tourist destination and oneseventh of 
the 70000 hotel rooms in the state according to the hawaii 
visitors bureau 
the union has filed two unfair labor practice charges against 
the hotels including one accusing management of refusing to 
bargain in good faith 
their charges are totally groundless said william crawford 
executive director of the council of hawaii hotels we bargained 
in good faith all the way through 
management and union officials were waiting for a decision by 
waihee who was being briefed by his staff after returning from the 
mainland during the weekend 
waihee helped the two sides work out an agreement during 1987 
contract talks 
hotels have continued to operate during the strike using 
management to fill in at unionized jobs some hotel services have 
been curtailed 
crawford sharply criticized union leader tony rutledge who 
encouraged union workers to exercise civil disobedience by engaging 
in sitins at the affected hotels even if it meant getting 
arrested no one has been arrested so far 
i think thats very irresponsible of the union making them 
criminals crawford said that cannot have a productive effect 
on negotiations 
rutledge has been meeting with his staff to plan strategy to 
bring national attention to the dispute 
we dont plan to lose he said if they the employers 
knew what i know and what we plan to do they would settle 
rutldge plans to extend the strike to nonunion hotels owned by 
the same companies as the affected hotels if the strike continues 
to next week the international union will begin informational 
pickets on the mainland he said 
hotel workers who do not receive tips now earn an average of 
922 an hour while tipped workers earn an average of 487 an 
hour 
the union turned down a fouryear contract that includes what 
management calculates as a wageandbenefit package of 7 percent 
annually but which the union calculates at 4 percent a year

the supreme court slammed shut the federal 
courthouse door monday to fresh appeals by many convicted 
criminals including death row inmates 
in two 54 rulings the court generally barred defendants from 
using new constitutional rulings to attack state court convictions 
after exhausting initial rounds of appeals 
the justices upheld a south carolina death row prisoners 
conviction and reinstated the death sentence of a convicted 
oklahoma murderer 
the courts four dissenters and the american civil liberties 
union denounced the rulings 
the aclu in a statement signed by three officials said the 
court has sent a clear signal that it will turn away and allow 
people to be executed in plain violation of the bill of rights 
in the south carolina case the court upheld the conviction of 
horace butler sentenced to die for the 1980 murder of pamela lane 
a clerk at a charlestonarea convenience store 
the court refused to apply retroactively to butlers case a 1988 
ruling that limits police questioning the 1988 decision said 
police may not question a suspect about a crime the one for which 
he was arrested or any other once he asks for a lawyer 
the 1988 ruling was foreshadowed by a 1981 decision banning a 
second round of police questions about the crime for which a 
suspect was arrested 
butler was in jail on a relatively minor charge and had obtained 
a lawyers representation after refusing to talk to police police 
later questioned him about an unrelated murder and butler 
confessed 
butler asked a federal judge to throw out his murder conviction 
on grounds that under the supreme courts 1988 ruling his rights 
were violated by unlawful police interrogation 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
it was too late for the 1988 ruling to be of any help to butler 
prisoners cannot rely on new high court rulings to overturn 
their convictions as long as the state appeals courts that upheld 
the convictions reasonably interpreted thencurrent constitutional 
rulings rehnquist said 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said the 
decision strips state prisoners of virtually any meaningful 
federal review of the constitutionality of their incarceration 
after today despite constitutional defects in the state 
processes leading to their conviction or sentencing state 
prisoners will languish in jail and others like butler will die 
because state courts were reasonable even though wrong brennan 
said 
he said that with mondays ruling the court has finally 
succeeded in its thinly veiled crusade to eviscerate federal laws 
aimed at protecting criminal defendants rights 
brennan was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens 
in the oklahoma case the same five majority justices ruled that 
robyn leroy parks is barred from contending that a jury wrongly was 
told to ignore sympathy before it sentenced him to death 
but kennedy wrote that parks was barred from raising that 
argument after exhausting his direct appeals in state courts 
parks was convicted of the 1977 killing of abdullah ibrahim a 
gas station attendant in oklahoma city at parks sentencing trial 
the judge told jurors you must avoid any influence of sympathy 
sentiment passion prejudice or other arbitrary factor when 
imposing sentence 
the justices overturned a ruling by the 10th us circuit court 
of appeals that said the judges instruction undermined the jurys 
consideration of mitigating evidence the appeals court had 
said parks should be resentenced

employees occupied the national 
mortgage bank monday protesting the decision to close it in an 
austerity plan that includes mass layoffs to combat inflation 
averaging 80 percent a month 
teachers boycotted classes disrupting the start of a new school 
year after the summer recess and professors at the 27 national 
universities also were on strike all seek higher pay 
court clerks who have shut the federal court system twice in 
two weeks planned to begin another pay strike tuesday and doctors 
at municipal hospitals said they would walk out wednesday 
banks and foreign exchange houses were closed monday while the 
economy ministry put the finishing touches on measures to prop the 
austral currency which has lost 99 percent of its value the past 
year 
they are committing an error in shutting the bank that 
finances lowincome housing juan zanola director of the powerful 
bankworkers association said about the decision to close the 
mortgage bank 
when banks reopen the 150000member union may strike the other 
four national banks including the central bank as it did two 
weeks ago when the government announced a bank restructuring plan 
zanola said 
real wages have shrunk up to onehalf because of inflation 
which was 79 percent in january and probably equal that in 
february a recession has stalled business activity and forced one 
of every five adults out of a job or into parttime work 
the austral has lost so much of its value that prices and wages 
are quoted increasingly in dollars 
economy minister antonio gonzalez said on national television 
sunday night the government which has played a central role in 
argentinas economy for decades is on the verge of bankruptcy 
public employees beyond retirement age will be dropped from 
payrolls he said and those within two years of retirement will be 
suspended with pay overtime will be curbed and vacancies will not 
be filled 
gonzalez estimated those measures along with suspension of 
federal subsidies and deferral of payments to state contractors 
would save 2 billion a year 
he did not say how many public employees would be laid off or 
retired but newspapers speculated tens of thousands might have to 
go about onefourth of argentinas 125 million workers are 
employed by the government 
the general labor confederation with 3 million members 
argentinas largest labor organization said it was studying the 
government measures it has criticized earlier versions and has not 
ruled out a general strike 
restructuring of the national banks is aimed at reducing losses 
that contribute to a deficit this year of about 70 billion or 
1215 percent of gross national product 
because of poor lending and collection practices the mortgage 
bank has run up a deficit of 1 billion with the central bank 
until now the central bank simply printed money to cover such 
losses 
a report last month in the newspaper pagina 12 citing bank 
data said the national development bank was owed 19 billion by 
its 60 largest debtors including the state telephone electric 
coal railroad and gas companies 
closing the mortgage bank and laying off public employees are 
seen as a test of the governments resolve to address the deficit 
without printing money 
in past months the government has announced plans to retire or 
transfer hundreds of employees of the state railroad mortgage bank 
and congress it backed off in each case because of union 
opposition

president bush said monday that parents must 
spark the flame of curiosity in their children but that the 
national parent teacher association may have to supply the matches 
the presidents comments to about 250 pta leaders at the white 
house came hours after the organization released a poll that found 
that fewer than half of those surveyed had visited their childrens 
schools to participate in a backtoschool night or attend 
parentorganization meetings during the fall of 1989 
bush criticized parents for thinking of education as a service 
we can hand over to the school boards much the same way we expect 
our cities to provide electricity or water 
education is not a utility education is a national mission 
that must include parents he said noting that a school program 
wont kiss away the pain from an injured knee or calm the 
fears of a child about to get a first shot or instill a 
lifelong love of learning 
but parents can spark the flame of curiosity by reading to 
their children every night bush said adding that the 66 
millionmember pta can provide the needed leadership 
there is no organization in america that can reach as many 
schools and as many parents as you can not the state governments 
not even the federal government he said 
bush was accompanied by his wife barbara who has made literacy 
one of her priorities 
many parents are doing only half their job when it comes to 
getting a good education for their children national pta 
president ann lynch said in releasing the poll too many 
parents sit at home and complain about the schools without ever 
setting foot through the doors to find out how they can help 
the most common reasons for visiting schools included attending 
a scheduled parentteacher conference which 71 percent had 
attended or class or school program which 64 percent had attended 
the survey commissioned by newsweek magazine for the national 
pta and chryslers dodge division was based on a national sample 
of parents in 538 households with children enrolled in kindergarten 
through 12th grade ninety percent of the children are in public 
school with 10 percent in either private or parochial schools 
while school involvement was often low the survey found most 
parents said they were very active in their childrens education at 
home two of every three 69 percent said they discussed school 
topics with their children nearly every school day more than half 
58 percent helped with homework at least two to three times a 
week and 52 percent read to or with their children at least once a 
week 
more than half 57 percent said their own role was extremely 
influential in their childrens learning however slightly more 
than half 53 percent of the parents surveyed were not involved in 
any kind of parent group many of those parents cited lack of time 
or work commitments as a deterrent to participation 
were all busy with work and family commitments but its 
amazing how we can find the time for things that are really 
important to us said ms lynch a few hours or less a month is 
all it takes to keep in touch and help at the school 
among parents who are involved in parent groups a large 
majority are more likely to help with fund raising 80 percent and 
extracurricular events 72 percent than to volunteer in 
classrooms 52 percent or participate in curriculum or 
policymaking 33 percent 
parents tend to get involved in fund raising because its easy 
and makes them feel as though they are doing something for their 
childs school said ms lynch noting that parents also must 
work for better school funding and participate in school 
decisionmaking 
the survey was conducted by icr survey research group in media 
pa between dec 29 and jan 7 the margin of error is plus or 
minus 45 percentage points

with the gubernatorial primaries a week 
away former gov mark white is the sudden democratic frontrunner 
and state treasurer ann richards is struggling after refusing to 
say if she ever misused drugs 
on the republican side three contenders are trying to keep 
multimillionaire oilman clayton williams from winning the 
nomination outright without a runoff 
after pumping more than 4 million of his own into a slick 
television ad campaign the colorful williams stood at 45 percent 
in a dallas morning newshouston chronicle poll published feb 25 
if he wins 50 percent in the march 13 balloting he avoids a runoff 
election for the gop nomination to succeed retiring republican gov 
bill clements 
among the democrats ms richards had been frontrunner since 
entering the race in june until white pulled ahead in the feb 25 
poll which showed him with 34 percent to ms richards 31 percent 
state attorney general jim mattox was third at 17 percent 
ms richards who rose to national attention after her keynote 
speech at the 1988 democratic national convention where she said 
george bush was born with a silver foot in his mouth insists 
her refusal to disclose whether shes ever used an illegal drug 
isnt a problem 
i have been tested by fire and the fire has lost said ms 
richards a recovering alcoholic i feel truthfully that it has 
energized a great number of people who feel it is important to do 
and say what i am saying and that is if you need help get help 
but her opponents and others watching the race disagreed 
voters are more tolerant of that than lack of candor george 
christian an austin political consultant and former press 
secretary to president johnson said of drug use 
the question arose in two debates that were televised statewide 
white and mattox said they had never used illegal drugs ms 
richards didnt answer the question directly 
my addiction was alcohol she said adding i have 
revealed more about my personal life including my alcoholism and 
my recovery for 10 years than any person who has ever run for 
governor 
by continuing to raise these questions i think that we are 
sending a very sad message to a lot of people who see that if they 
seek treatment they will forever bear the stigma of their 
addiction 
the issue came up again at a news conference monday ms 
richards again refused to say whether she had used illegal drugs 
but did say shed never knowingly commited a felony offense 
unless ms richards answers the question republicans will make 
it an issue if she wins the nomination her opponents said it 
wont be pretty its a serious question said white 
ms richards attacked white and mattox on monday for making her 
refusal to answer the drug question a campaign issue 
no one has ever raised this question while i have been 
managing all of the money of the state of texas she said the 
only time this question was raised was when i got in the way of 
those boys who want to be governor 
white governor from 1983 to 1987 has risen steadily in the 
polls since entering the race in november as he and mattox have 
dueled over the death penalty and taxes 
mattox who as attorney general has attended most of the 33 
texas executions since they resumed in 1982 has emphasized his 
crimefighting record his television commercials show him walking 
in front of prison bars 
white responded with a chilling commercial that showed him 
walking beside giant photos of felons who were put to death during 
his term 
only a governor can make executions happen i did and i 
will white said 
mattox and ms richards have even become issues in the 
republican race 
struggling to cut into williams staggering lead rival kent 
hance has aired an ad focusing on the oilmans contribution of 
1000 to mattox do we know the real clayton williams yet 
hances ad asks williams also gave 200 to ms richards 
williams who is making his first bid for public office insists 
his donations were made while he was a businessman and before he 
considered entering politics 
hance a former democratic congressman who sponsored president 
reagans 1981 tax cut legislation is rnning a distant second to 
williams with about 22 percent support according to recent polls 
the two other major contenders have earned most of the 
endorsements from the states major newspapers but both tom luce 
of dallas lawyer for billionaire h ross perot and former 
secretary of state jack rains of houston remain in single digits 
in the polls

members of a secret 
intelligence unit planted bombs were suspects in political 
killings and plotted to harass archbishop desmond tutu by sending 
him a baboon fetus an intelligence official said monday 
gen rudolph badenhorst head of the military intelligence 
branch of the defense force was the first witness to testify 
before a judicial inquiry into allegations of military and police 
participation in death squads 
opposition leaders claim the squads may have been involved in 
about 60 unsolved murders of antigovernment activists in the past 
decade 
badenhorst said the civil cooperation bureau a unit so secret 
that president fw de klerk says he was not told of its existence 
until recently had blown up a pretoria store owned by an 
antiapartheid activist exploded a bomb at a community hall in a 
mixedrace township near cape town and planned to deliver a baboon 
fetus to tutu an antiapartheid leader and winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize 
badenhorst gave no reason for the plan to send the fetus he 
said the idea was called operation apie 
the intelligence chief said an internal military investigation 
begun in november revealed that prominent antiapartheid activists 
such as black mineworkers leader cyril ramaphosa the rev frank 
chikane of the south african council of churches and jay naidoo 
general secretary of the nations largest trade union federation 
were on a list to have their movements monitored 
he maintained that he did not know the bureau existed before 
november and he didnt know the purpose of the surveillance 
the secret unit reportedly consisted of cells of civilians 
mostly former policemen in undercover operations against 
government opponents 
an attorney for the civil cooperation bureau said its chief 
col joe verster had been detained friday for questioning by 
police who are investigating the 1989 assassinations of david 
webster a johannesburg anthropologist and anton lubowski the 
only white executive member of the southwest african peoples 
organization in namibia 
badenhorst confirmed that three former policemen wanted in 
lubowskis death were members of the civil cooperation bureau all 
three disappeared last month after police in namibia issued 
warrants for their arrests badenhorst said the civil cooperation 
bureau was not involved in websters slaying 
he said that during questioning by military investigators 
verster had seemed surprised at some of the activities of bureau 
members and was especially surprised by the hiring of an 
expoliceman ferdie barnard after he had been released from 
prison 
de klerk who became president in august said defense minister 
magnus malan did not tell him of the civil cooperation bureau until 
january badenhorst told the commission de klerk had not sanctioned 
any of the units activities 
malan said monday he did not know the bureau existed until 
november 
the defense minister has said he never authorized killings or 
other illegal acts but he has come under increasing pressure from 
opposition parties to resign 
in another judicial inquiry ordered by de klerk supreme court 
justice richard goldstone ruled that clayton sizwe sithole 
identified by friends as the former boyfriend of nelson mandelas 
youngest daughter zindziwe committed suicide in police custody on 
jan 27 
sithole had been arrested with others in a murder investigation 
and after police interrogation he was found hanging by his 
shoelaces and belt at the johannesburg police headquarters 
goldstone said there were no recent injuries on his body other 
than those associated with hanging

leaking of hydraulic fluid that developed before the shuttle landed 
at edwards on sunday nagel said 
atlantis and its fiveman crew landed on a dry desert lakebed 
after an officially classified mission reportedly to launch a 500 
million spy satellite 
the shuttle was to be hoisted into position monday inside a 
100foottall steel trusswork so workers could prepare it to be 
mounted atop a modified boeing 747 jetliner for a piggyback flight 
to florida but nagel said the work would have to wait until late 
monday because of the wind 
he said preliminary inspection revealed possible hydraulic fluid 
leaks in three parts of the shuttle but added that they hadnt 
posed any danger in sundays landing and probably werent a safety 
issue the shuttle has three redundant hydraulic systems that 
operate shuttle steering during reentry 
inspectors for the national aeronautics and space administration 
also found 62 heatshield tiles with dings including one that 
probably will be replaced but nagel called the damage 
insignificant and said atlantis was in excellent shape 
nagel said he had hoped atlantis would be ready for the flight 
to florida on friday but the windrelated delay meant the trip 
would be saturday 
had the winds come earlier they could have delayed sundays 
landing the shuttles launch last wednesday from the kennedy space 
center in florida had been delayed five times by weather a 
computer glitch and the sore throat of the commander navy capt 
john o creighton 
the next shuttle flight is scheduled for april 12 when discovery 
is to begin a fiveday mission to deploy the 155 billion hubble 
space telescope 
discovery was towed monday to the vehicle assembly building at 
kennedy space center in florida nasa spokeswoman pat phillips said 
in a telephone interview

the president of cyprus pressed congressional 
leaders monday to help break deadlocked negotiations over his 
countrys future 
president george vassiliou said that his discussions went very 
well it was very productive very useful 
vassiliou flew to washington on a private visit after 
unsponsored talks on the future of cyprus collapsed last week

negotiations that included both vassiliou and rauf denktash the 
leader of cyprus turkish community the island nation in the 
mediterranean has been divided since 1974 when the turks invaded 
the island

more clearcut policy on behalf of the administration and 
congress to help bring an end forever to this problem that has 
been with us so long 
broomfield said vassiliou had won a lot of support in 
congress for his efforts and the michigan republican criticized 
denktash for not acting in good faith at the un talks 
he said he favored cutting military aid to turkey until ankara 
pressured denktash to adopt a more conciliatory negotiating stance 
while broomfield doubted congress would take such a drastic 
action he said members would work with the bush administration to 
see if it could be more forceful in prodding the parties toward 
reconciliation 
pressler predicted that congress would take an initiative 
perhaps in the form of a resolution to try to get the talks with 
the turks off dead center 
the bush administration has followed the lead of the un 
secretary general in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to 
the conflict on the island a state department official said 
a spokesman for the turkishcypriot office in washington was

marijuana because he was busy doing other things like playing 
ball and studying 
it was never part of my environment said the 57yearold 
new york democrat during the taping of a weekly radio interview 
but cuomo considered a potential 1992 presidential contender 
said that doesnt mean anything that doesnt make you good or 
bad 
the governors comment came during an interview for albany radio 
station wamcs weekly capitol connection when he was asked 
about some massachusetts politicians who have recently admitted to 
having tried marijuana 
people are free to confess if they feel they should thats 
fine by me if they wish to said cuomo 
nonetheless cuomo said politicians should discourage a 
practice of everybody stepping forward and confessing everything 
they ever did because then you construct a new category when does 
it end did you ever shout at your wife et cetera et cetera

about 350 authors editors literary agents and 
sympathizers staged a noisy sidewalk protest monday to accuse 
random house of destroying one of its key subsidiaries for 
financial reasons 
the bottom line is not the last word read one sign 
displayed outside the publishing giants midtown headquarters 
where a lunchtime crowd had to thread its way past police 
barricades 
the protesters charged that random house owner samuel i 
newhouse had effectively killed the subsidiary pantheon books by 
forcing the resignation wednesday of its longtime editorial 
director andre schiffrin 
schiffrin reportedly had refused to cut his staff and the number 
of books he planned to publish 
five of pantheons six senior editors subsequently quit saying 
pantheons established role as a publishing house for 
unconventional and otherwise little known writers was being ruined 
in the name of profits 
random house chairman alberto vitale said he was absolutely 
puzzled by the reaction to schiffrins resignation he said 
pantheon would have ceased to operate a long long time ago 
without random houses support 
its not random house who is hurting anything vitale said 
in a telephone interview random house has kept pantheon going 
all these years 
he said the editors who have quit have in effect abandoned 
their authors these people by leaving have hurt pantheon 
one of those editors tom engelhardt told reporters at the 
demonstration that while pantheon had provided a forum for such 
writers since it was acquired by random house in 1962 the real 
disaster for us is that the next generation of writers will be 
marginalized they wont have that opportunity 
author studs terkel clutching a plastic coffee cup in the 
nearfreezing weather was among a number of pantheonpublished 
writers who turned out for the demonstration author kurt vonnegut 
although not a pantheon client said he was taking part out of 
sympathy for his colleagues 
vonnegut said he feared what was happening to pantheon was of 
little general interest to the country but said im disturbed 
that a great american institution like this should be destroyed 
in an unsigned statement handed out at the demonstration the 
organizers said just as we have protested censorship however 
rationalized by dictators left and right we protest censorship 
however rationalized by corporate fiat 
at a moment in history when intellectual freedom is scoring 
stunning victories around the world it is appalling that a unique 
center of american intellectual vitality should be so 
thoughtlessly the statement said

time in 20 years the moda milanese hiked hemlines above the 
knee has become a way of life for the fashionable woman in the new 
decade 
most fashion followers agree the latest gianni versace 
miniskirt which almost reaches the navel is just too short but 
at the same time versace is the clearest statement that short 
hemlines are here to stay 
once women have agreed to bare their thighs it is easy to get 
them to wear shorts in the winter too 
the new winter bermudas and shorts are loose and sporty usually 
in corduroy or light wool jersey worn with dark or printed 
stockings and comfortable walking shoes 
in general the latest moda milanese is pert rather than 
sexy with a heavy accent on sportswear 
gone are the tailored city suits and elegant coats of past 
seasons to be replaced by sweatsuits sport jackets parkas down 
and duffel coats and loads of knitwear from cozy cardigans 
pullovers and sweaterdresses to the brand new allknit jumpsuit 
colors range from the browns and reds of autumn leaves to the 
icy beige green and blue pastel shades of a winter landscape

hemline and drawstring waist in the coat department krizia offers 
cozy bathrobe coats with silk cord monk belts 
for mountain fun or cold city days krizia offers a series of 
quilted items from long down coats and duffel coats to pert quilted 
miniskirts

and sweaters for next winter she steals cherubs from a renaissance 
painting and prints them on her soft cashmere pullovers and short 
sweater dresses white horses and imperial eagles also adorn many 
of her outfits 
to dress up her sporty look mariuccia mandelli the woman behind 
the krizia label embroiders gold onto lapels hemlines and cuffs 
since last winter the italian designers have caught on to the 
ecological movement replacing their once sumptuous furs with 
exquisite lookalikes in teddybear plush thus the krizia lady can 
flaunt her tiger leopard or brightly dyed beaver knowing its all 
innocuous fluff 
missoni has been king of italian knitwear ever since he 
presented his reversible knit and quilted jackets in florence 
several decades ago but his latest collection entirely dedicated 
to the soviet union is one of the best in seasons 
beautiful reversible coats and parkas are knitted in patterns of 
russian folk art the onion towers of red square the quaint houses 
of a russian village the geometric designs of a carpet 
these patterns are also used for the knitted jumpsuits and sweat 
pants as well as for the silk evening outfits

of the sporty 199091 winter woman

the energy department plans to build the 
supercollider as originally envisioned although it has not 
determined how high above 59 billion the cost may climb 
secretary james a watkins said monday 
watkins said physics changes in the design could increase the 
cost by 12 billion while changes in labor rates could add 
another 300 million 
the cost of supercollider originally was estimated at 44 
billion then rose to 59 billion 
the increase coupled with the lack of a firm figure on the new 
estimate could spell trouble in congress as supporters seek their 
second year of construction funding for would be the worlds 
largest scientific instrument it is to be built south of dallas 
this creates some problems yes it does i wish they were able 
to give us a definite figure but we have been through this many 
times on other projects said rep tom bevill dala chairman 
of the house appropriations subcommittee on energy and water 
development 
asked if congress could reverse last years commitment to 
building the collider bevill appeared unsure of the projects fate 
thats always possible he said no i dont think thats 
going to happen i dont know i dont know at this point i dont 
know 
the collider would be a a 54mile underground ring where 
subatomic particles are hurled against each other to test theories 
about the fundamental nature of matter 
rep silvio o conte rmass ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee says the collider has no practical 
application 
watkins said two independent studies to determine the impact of 
design changes on the cost of building the particle accelerator 
likely would be finished in june and that the new estimate would 
fall close to 7 to 8 billion 
the bush administration is seeking 318 million for the collider 
in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 bevill said having a final 
estimate before he seeks an appropriation from the full house could 
be critical 
watkins told the panel that too great an increase in the cost 
could imperil the administrations support for the project

twentyone people including a lawyer who 
worked for the bush presidential campaign were chosen prospective 
jurors monday as the selection process began for the irancontra 
trial of former national security adviser john poindexter 
poindexter is charged with five felony counts one of 
conspiracy two of obstructing congress and two of making false 
statements to congressional committees in connection with 
accusations that he covered up oliver norths secret contra 
resupply network and lied about a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to 
iran 
he is the highestranking reagan administration official to go 
on trial in the irancontra affair 
us district judge harold greene disqualified one woman who 
expressed uncertainty when asked whether she could be fair and 
impartial the judge also disqualified an equipment operator who 
said that when the whole thing was going down following public 
disclosure of the irancontra affair all you heard was north and 
poindexter seventeen of the first 21 in the pool were women 
two hundred six people have filled out questionnaires to be 
possible jurors for the trial and 76 of them have said they had 
heard watched or read portions of congressional testimony 
poindexter gave in 1987 under a grant of immunity from prosecution 
based on what he said 
the judge approved for the jury pool a real estate lawyer who 
worked in president bushs campaign as part of a group doing 
background reviews of potential vice presidential candidates bush 
was president reagans vice president at the time 
the woman also said one of poindexters defense lawyers joseph 
small had babysat for her when she was a child 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb questioned whether she should be 
in the jury pool since she knew one of the defense lawyers 
just because counsel babysat for her doesnt cast any doubt on 
her said greene 
the woman also said a brotherinlaw has worked for former 
virginia govs charles robb and gerald baliles both democrats 
robb is now a us senator 
also accepted for the jury pool a clerical worker who said 
under questioning that she knew former poindexter aide north was 
on trial in the past and that he had been fined and was 
performing community service 
it was a big todo in dc said the woman 
a jury of 12 people and six alternates will be selected from a 
pool of residents from the district of columbia greene is expected 
to build a pool of several dozen prospective jurors from which to 
select a jury 
most of those questioned said they knew little about the 
irancontra affair 
a retired cook who said she had worked for seven lawers in the 
1950s said she had heard nothing of poindexters or norths 
testimony to congress she said she was unaware of reagans 
videotaped testimony taken feb 1617 and publicized extensively in 
the past week and a half 
poindexters lawyers are expected to replay reagans videotaped 
testimony in court 
several people said they would give the same weight to reagans 
testimony that they would to anyone else who might testify in the 
case 
poindexter lawyer richard beckler started off the questioning by 
asking the first pospective juror what she thought of reagan 
the young woman an unemployed delivery driver for an auto parts 
firm wasnt given a chance to answer webb objected to becklers 
question without giving a reason and greene sustained the 
objection 
the others sent to the jury pool were a data processing employee 
who works two jobs a nursing assistant and a janitor at a national 
guard armory 
each of the charges against poindexter carries a maximum 
fiveyear prison term and 250000 fine on conviction

the usled united nations command on 
monday called for a joint investigation of an invasion tunnel 
allegedly dug by communist north korea across its border into south 
korea 
the united nations command which polices the border zone formed 
by the 1953 korean ceasefire said in a letter to north korea 
we have evidence of another tunnel under the demilitarized zone 
which is an extremely serious violation of the armistice agreement 
us rear adm larry g vogt said in the letter that all the 
evidence gathered thus far by our multinational special 
investigation team indicates the tunnel began inside your side of 
the dmz and extends over a thousand meters 1000 yards into our 
portion of the dmz 
such a tunnel could be used by military forces and represents 
a flagrant violation of the armistice agreement he added 
vogt proposed that a joint observer team of the two sides meet 
tuesday to investigate the tunnel 
there was no immediate response from north korea which has 
denied digging the tunnel 
the tunnel discovered saturday in the eastern sector of the 155 
milelong border was the fourth tunnel discovered since 1974 
pyongyang has denied digging the other three tunnels 
the latest tunnel discovered is two yards wide by two yards high 
and about 2030 yards long it crosses about 1000 yards into the

the supreme court overturned a key portion of 
north carolinas death penalty law monday in a ruling that will 
invalidate the sentences of most of the 85 death row inmates in 
that state 
by a 63 vote the court set aside a murderers death sentence 
because his sentencing jury was told not to consider any factor 
suggesting a lesser sentence unless all 12 jurors could agree on 
that factor 
the decision probably will not affect any death row inmate 
outside north carolina 
the system that was condemned is the system weve been using 
since 1977 for sentencing people to death said raleigh lawyer 
malcolm hunter jr who successfully challenged the north carolina 
law he said mondays ruling could have a very broad impact 
within the state 
a spokesman for north carolina attorney general lacy thornburg 
said as many as 70 death row inmates now must receive new 
sentencing trials 
in a separate decision the court gave judges and prosecutors 
leeway in what they tell jurors choosing life or death for 
murderers voting 54 to uphold a california mans death sentence 
and in a third deathpenalty ruling the justices split 54 in 
ruling that an oklahoma murderer is procedurally barred from 
contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore sympathy 
before it sentenced him to death 
the rulings in the california and oklahoma cases are not likely 
to affect many of the some 2200 death row inmates across the 
nation 
in other matters monday the court 
agreed to decide whether louisiana officials are violating an 
insane death row inmates rights by forcing him to take 
mindaltering drugs in an effort to make him sane enough so he be 
executed 
cut back severely the right of criminal defendants to attack 
their prosecutions on constitutional grounds after an initial set 
of appeals in state courts the 54 ruling upheld a south carolina 
murderers death sentence 
ruled by a 54 vote in a michigan case that even when police 
questioning violates a criminal defendants right to legal help the 
responses may be used to contradict his trial testimony 
in the north carolina death penalty case the court set aside 
the death sentence of dock mckoy jr convicted of the 1984 
shooting death of anson county deputy sheriff william kress horne 
relying on their 1988 decision in a maryland case the justices 
said the jury that sentenced mckoy wrongly was limited in its 
consideration of mitigating evidence jurors were told they had 
to unanimously agree on the existence of each mitigating factor 
the requirement of unanimity was laid down in 1985 and the 
attorney generals office believes mondays ruling will affect only 
defendants sentecned after that said jim coman senior deputy 
attorney general but im sure all the attorneys for all the 
death row inmates will appeal 
writing for the court justice thurgood marshall said the 
unanimity requirement is unconstitutional 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and sandra day oconnor dissented 
the court upheld the california death sentence of richard boyde 
who was convicted of the 1981 murder of dick gibson a riverside 
convenience store clerk 
boydes sentencing jury was read a list of specific mitigating 
factors it could consider in choosing his punishment jurors also 
were told they could consider any other circumstance which 
extenuates the gravity of the crime california courts no longer 
use that instruction 
rehnquist writing for the court rejected arguments by boydes 
lawyers that the instruction prevented jurors from considering 
factors regarding his background and character that might be deemed 
mitigating even if they did not lessen the crimes gravity 
justices marshall william j brennan harry a blackmun and 
john paul stevens dissented 
in the oklahoma case the court never reached the merits of 
death row inmate robyn leroy parks challenge of an 
antisympathy instruction his sentencing jury received 
instead justice anthony m kennedy wrote for the court that 
parks was procedurally barred from raising that argument after 
having exhausted his direct appeals in state courts 
parks was convicted of the 1977 killing of abdullah ibrahim a 
gas station attendant in oklahoma city 
the presiding judge told jurors you must avoid any influence 
of sympathy sentiment passion prejudice or other arbitrary 
factor when imposing sentence 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the 
instruction undermined the jurys consideration of mitigating 
evidence but that ruling was overturned 
kennedy was joined by rehnquist white oconnor and scalia

a 17yearold chicago youth won a 20000 
college scholarship monday night for a project on molecular 
genetics that he believes may advance understanding of the 
conversion of nitrogen from air into ammonia 
matthew peter headrick won first place in the westinghouse 
science talent search the nations oldest high school science 
competition 
his selection was announced at an awards banquet attended by 
more than 500 leaders from science government education and 
business 
headrick is a senior at the university of chicago laboratory 
schools high school and plans to study at princeton or stanford 
universities for a career in physics or biophysics 
the next two top winners were david ruchien liu 16 of 
riverside calif who entered a neuroscience project and david 
michael shull 17 of tacoma wash who developed a method of 
placing the genetic coding for production of a molecule into white 
blood cells they each received 15000 awards 
the prestigious westinghouse science talent search an annual 
competition established in 1942 started last september when 1431 
students entered from 36 states the list was cut to 300 by a board 
of eight scientists from a variety of fields 
forty finalists received a fiveday trip to washington where 
they underwent additional judging to determine their scientific 
creativity and potential 
of the 1960 winners in the search since its inception five 
have gone on to win nobel prizes two have won field medals for 
distinguished work in mathematics and eight have been awarded 
macarthur foundation fellowships for research in the physical and 
life sciences 
for his winning project headrick used molecular genetics 
techniques to isolate for the first time the gene that is necessary 
for nitrogen fixation in a fresh water bluegreen alga nitrogen 
fixation the conversion of molecular nitrogen from air into 
nitrogencarrying chemical compounds that plants can use is 
essential for the synthesis of amino acids and for all life the 
alga in question converts the nitrogen to ammonia 
search officials said that headrick believes his work will 
help toward a better understanding of the nitrogen fixation systems 
and the process of cellular differentiation

president felix houphouetboigny on 
monday defended the violent suppression of student protests that 
have forced him to review economic austerity measures 
the ivorian leader speaking at his first news conference since 
1985 suggested multinational companies were trying to destabilize 
africa to obtain the lowest possible price for its raw materials 
houphouetboigny 84 denied protesters claims that he had 
siphoned millions of dollars from state coffers 
if you think i have that kind of money do you think i would 
leave my people in that situation he told a reporter who asked 
whether he would use his immense fortune to help ivorians 
suffering the worst economic crisis in the countrys history 
hundreds of government and other workers joined protesting 
students friday in demonstrations in abidjan and chanted 
houphouet thief houphouet corrupt 
abidjan was calm monday although dozens of armed soldiers were 
deployed and presidential guards in red berets blocked off the 
presidential office in the city center 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group has 
condemned severe beatings by soldiers and police who have fired 
tear gas and stun grenades to halt protests many demonstrations 
have been peaceful and some have been violent protests in which 
people have burned and stoned cars and ransacked several stores 
if i have to choose between disorder and injustice i will 
choose injustice because there will be time to redress that 
houphouetboigny said 
he noted that no one has been killed in the protests 
the president repeated his opposition to protesters demands for 
a multiparty democracy saying parties in africa tend to be drawn 
along tribal lines promoting ethnic rivalry and endangering 
national unity 
when everything has been debated and we deliberate on 
everything the decision always rests with one person me 
houphouetboigny said 
his critics say houphouetboigny made a fortune from shares in 
companies that buy cocoa and coffee the main ivorian exports when 
commodity prices were high in the 1960s and 1970s and farmers were 
poorly paid 
slumping prices of raw materials have caused ivory coasts 
economic crisis and led to protests which began feb 19 with 
demands the president resign he has ruled since the country became 
independent from france in 1960 
houphouetboigny confirmed monday that his government will 
reduce other expenses of ivorians to offset proposed pay cuts of 
between 15 percent and 40 percent for civil servants and increase a 
pay tax on privatesector workers from 1 percent to 11 percent 
we are going to ask for sacrifices but at the same time we 
are going to cut rents water electricity clothing and food 
costs he said 
houphouetboigny also appealed to developed nations to set a 
just price for africas raw materials 
cocoa and coffee prices have surged on exchanges in new york and 
london amid dealers concerns that the protests could interfere 
with delivery of ivory coasts 800000ton crop the ivorian crop 
a third of world supplies has mostly been sold and awaits 
shipping at abidjan docks 
in october houphouetboigny was forced to halve prices paid to 
farmers for coffee and cocoa 
he noted coffee producers in ivory coast now get 16 cents a 
pound which produces 22 cups of coffee sold in moderatepriced 
european restaurants for up to 350 a cup 
we are now back in a situation of forced labor except the 
label has changed he said 
he accused multinational companies of being at the root of 
africas political problems 
i have the feeling that someone is proceeding to destabilize 
african countries he said

strengthening 
teammate jeff fryer said monday that gathers had done something 
unusual before the game that turned out to be his last he ran on 
the track to warm up rather than jumping rope as usual

the widow of former president salvador 
allende returned for good to her homeland monday and said she would 
attend the weekend ceremony in which gen augusto pinochet who led 
the coup that toppled her husbands government gives up power 
i want to spend my last years here hortensia bussi de 
allende 75 told reporters at santiagos international airport 
she arrived from mexico where she lived for more than a decade in 
exile 
she was met by socialist party officials and by a daughter 
isabel and granddaughter marcia a small crowd cheered her 
arrival which was virtually unpublicized 
mrs allende said she would attend sundays inaugural ceremony 
in which pinochet hands over the presidency to an elected 
successor patricio aylwin in the port city of valparaiso 
asked if she planned to participate in the new government she 
replied no ive always said we have to make way for the younger 
people 
aylwin a christian democrat is backed by a coalition of 17 
centrist and leftist parties including the socialist party that 
allende once led 
mrs allende said she would lobby to have her husbands remains 
moved to a deserved spot in santiago where everyone can pay him 
homage and to have a grand monument built 
allende died in the presidential palace while it was being 
bombarded by the military during a coup on sept 11 1973 
according to witnesses he committed suicide with a machine gun 
when it became evident his leftist government was falling 
he was buried in the unpretentious plot of a brotherinlaw in 
the coastal resort of vina del mar near valparaiso the military 
kept the grave unmarked for many years 
the military forced mrs allende to leave the country within 
days of the coup 
she first returned in late 1988 after pinochet campaigning for 
an eightyear extension of his rule ordered an end to her exile 
and that of hundreds of other dissidents voters in an october 1988

the government said monday it would pay 
interim compensation of 12 per month to each of 500000 people 
living near the site of the 1984 bhopal gas disaster 
the government has been deeply concerned about the continuing 
miseries of hundreds of thousands of people of bhopal who were 
affected by this gas leak disaster said petroleum and chemicals 
minister ms gurupadaswamy 
the disbursement of final compensation may take considerable 
time and the victims who have suffered for over five years cannot 
be asked to wait any longer he said 
the leak of toxic gas from the pesticide plant operated by union 
carbide corp in december 1984 killed at least 3598 people and 
injured another 20000 in the worlds worst industrial disaster 
the announcement monday said all the people living in the 
vicinity of the pesticide plant at the time of the leak including 
minors would be paid interim compensation pending the outcome of 
legal battles with union carbide a usbased multinational 
the payments would run for at least three years it said so 
that victims may continue to get regular assistance over a period 
of time and this may help them in meeting their medical expenses 
and earning of basic livelihood on a continuous basis 
this decision to cover all the residents has been taken 
because we feel that all those people who were exposed to the gas 
have suffered even though some of the health effects may show up 
only in the long run gurupadaswamy said 
the payments he said will be adjusted against any final 
compensation arrived at 
the government said in january it will challenge a 470 million 
settlement agreed to last year by union carbide and the previous 
government arguments in the case are continuing in the supreme 
court and it unlikely a quick decision will be reached 
according to the 198990 statemans yearbook the average per 
capita income in india is 270 a year citing the latest available 
figures from 1986

prague is favorable jan martinek a foreign ministry official 
told the associated press using the acronymn for east germanys 
formal name 
dienstbier welcomed the idea of a unified germany but 
reiterated czechoslovakia supports polands demands to participate 
in reunification talks involving the german states and the allied 
powers which divided germany after world war ii 
poland insists on west german guarantees that the polishgerman 
border is inviolable a guarantee that west german chancellor 
helmut kohl has been reluctant to provide 
germans should realize they owe their unification also to 
polish solidarity and the democratization processes in eastern 
europe dienstbier said noting that only three months ago the 
idea of uniting the germanys was not expected in this century 
we have bitter experience with events such as the munich pact 
when borders of one country were determined by others dienstbier

he was referring to the 1938 munich conference involving 
germany britain france and italy it gave czechoslovakias border 
region known as the sudeten to the nazis

a shopping mall pledged to hire more 
blacks and discontinue its practice of detaining black teenagers 
under a 1960s trespass law in an agreement with the naacp 
officials said monday 
the civil rights groups national chairman william f gibson of 
greenville said the pact with the 128store columbia mall was the 
first of its kind and encouraged other naacp chapters to 
negotiate similar agreements 
the baltimorebased national association for the advancement of 
colored people had planned to boycott the mall if no agreement was 
reached gibson said 
george forbes an attorney for mall owner jacobs visconi and 
jacobs of cleveland said the agreement was reached in a spirit 
of cooperation but is not legally binding 
the columbia mall does not it has not and it will not 
discriminate as regards to race creed or color said forbes a 
longtime member of the naacp there seemed to be an indication 
that we have done that and i consistently said that we have not 
and anyone at the mall found to be involved with that would be 
immediately dismissed 
the agreement negotiated over the last month by naacp and mall 
officials calls for hiring and promoting more blacks by mall 
management and encouraging stores to do the same and for using 
more black contractors and suppliers 
however the pact does not specify the number of jobs or work 
contracts the mall will give to blacks 
the malls owners also offered to sponsor a jobs fair create an 
employment center advertise in the black media provide 
sensitivity training for employees and work with the naacp to 
closely monitor the malls relationship with the black community 
informal studies show blacks comprise 30 percent to 40 percent 
of the malls 150000 weekly customers gibson said 
about a month ago the mall discontinued its practice of 
detaining black youths under a 1960s antitrespassing law designed 
to maintain segregation jacobs said 
minority groups alleged last summer that about 50 black 
teenagers had been detained by mall security officers under the 
trespass law the youths were photographed their names placed in 
security files and many were told not to return for six months in 
most cases no criminal charges were ever filed 
in december two black teenagers were shot inside the mall in 
the latest of four such incidents 
in an interview afterwards richland county sheriff allen sloan 
was quoted by a newspaper as saying the best way to reduce mall 
violence was to keep the niggers out sloan denied making the 
statement 
forbes said the mall owner is committed to minority hiring he 
said one of the four administrators is black and that blacks 
comprised 35 percent of the security force 
we think that is not only good sense but it makes good 
business he said

china has agreed to resume participation in the 
fulbright program but on a smaller scale than in recent years the 
us embassy said monday 
chinese education officials agreed to send 16 chinese scholars 
and students to the united states next fall to do research and 
accept 16 us professors to teach said embassy spokesman sheridan 
w bell he said the embassy was still waiting a letter from the 
chinese government to formalize the agreement 
china took part in the us scholarly exchange program for a 
decade with 24 scholars traveling in each direction in recent 
years 
it abruptly canceled the 198990 academic year exchanges in 
august in anger over us criticism of the armys killing of 
prodemocracy protesters in beijing 
talks on resuming the exchanges began in december after us 
national security adviser brent scowcroft mae a fencemending visit 
to beijing 
the reduction in the number of scholars exchanges means fewer 
academic fields will be represented bell said but he did not know 
which fields the chinese had cut since june chinese authorities 
have stressed the need to learn from the west in technical areas 
but have said fewer students in the social sciences will be sent 
abroad 
resumption of the fulbrights does not indicate that a complete 
healing of uschina relations deeply shaken by the june 
killings is likely in the near future that will not be possible 
as long as the us embassy shelters two fugitive chinese 
dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian 
china has demanded the two surrender and face charges of 
counterrevolutionary crimes and shows no sign of softening that 
stance 
a range of peopletopeople contacts are resuming slowly 
however last week four nonofficial us delegations passed 
through beijing one to join in climbing mount everest and the 
others to hold talks on trade or political relations

theologians expressed surprise monday about 
cardinal john oconnors disclosure that the rare rite of exorcism 
has been performed twice in new york in a year 
but other ceremonies dealing with evil spirits including a 
baptismal prayer are more common in the roman catholic church 
oconnor mentioned the exorcisms during a sermon sunday and to 
reporters afterward he said heavymetal music spiked with satanic 
lyrics created an atmosphere conducive to devilworship and demonic 
possession 
the cardinal said the exorcisms were approved by the 
archdioceses vicar general and appeared to be successful but gave 
no other details he also said the novel the exorcist is a 
gruesomely authentic portrayal of demonic possession 
according to a story published dec 12 in the san francisco 
chronicle pope john paul ii recently increased the number of 
exorcists in rome and in turin where there are a reported 40000 
devil worshipers 
last week police in indianapolis asked an unidentified priest 
to pray and sprinkle holy water in a house after they saw a radio 
a vase and other objects inexplicably move they had been called to 
investigate a possible burglary after the resident came home and 
found smashed dishes windows a lamp and eggs a 14yearold 
relative who had been staying there was believed to have been 
involved in devil worship authorities said 
the rev simon harak a theology professor at fairfield 
university in connecticut said that exorcism recognized in the 
churchs book of rituals is performed for people under the highest 
form of attack by an evil spirit people who are no longer in 
charge of their own will 
exorcisms are confidential no figures are kept on the number 
performed in the united states said bill ryan spokesman for the 
us catholic conference in washington dc 
but channeling the phenomenon popularized by actress shirley 
maclaine of speaking through spirits has similarities to demonic 
possession the spirits that emerge in channeling however are 
supposed to be good not evil according to the rev james t 
burtchaell theology professor at notre dame university 
exorcism existed before the time of christ but is rare in 
modern times and both burtchaell and harak said they were 
surprised there would have been two exorcisms in a year in new 
york harak noted the rite may gain prevalence in times or places 
of satanic worship 
in the gospels theres quite a bit of reference to jesus not 
only healing people of diseases but freeing them from diabolical 
possession said burtchaell 
ever since then there have been outbreaks of similar 
behavior he said it was found that when very holy priests 
were sent to pray for and about these very troubled people there 
would be an increase in the behavior then eventually a complete 
liberation from it 
exorcism is more common in countries where christianity is not 
well established or where other influences such as voodoo come 
into play since the 1970s exorcism has been performed only by a 
priest approved by a bishop archbishop or cardinal 
if you ask most bishops in the country who is your 
exorcist they probably wouldnt have one its an ad hoc thing 
said burtchaell probably a number of bishops would be surprised 
to hear there were two in new york one of the largest dioceses 
in the nation 
typically he said an exorcist must be a very self possessed 
consistently holy man to survive the experience it involves a 
great deal of selfabuse bodies being flung around the room 
excrement assumed voices its pretty vile stuff 
the average catholic would have no firsthand information to 
speak of he said the darn movie is going to be the image 
everybody has but i must say events in the movie are very 
faithful to stories ive read about real exorcisms 
a battery of medical and psychological tests is ordered before 
someone undergoes exorcism if a person has lupus for instance 
and periodically has seizures where they go out of control thats 
a chemical imbalance said harak 
but there also are informal rites to get rid of or guard 
against demons 
harak said a standard prebaptismal ritual contains three 
scrutinies that are really rites of exorcism that have been kind of 
tamed in the church 
its not like oh my goodness william peter blattys the 
exorcist its a recognition that there are good spirits angels 
and bad spirits devils and the evil spirit hates human nature 
harak said 
the church also has a practice called deliverance for ridding 
infestations of evil spirit less serious than possession said 
harak they are performed somewhere in this country every day by 
laity as well as priests 
usually the name of jesus holy water holy oils prayers of 
community are so powerful that these deliverances are not 
difficult many of us do them he said 
say youve been fooling around with a ouija board or the more 
modern thing dungeons and dragons you chant incantations and 
stuff like that those practices could make you susceptible to 
evil spirits he said especially if you have a psychological or 
emotional problem 
evil spirits are like flies said harak our own personal 
hatreds or resentments lack of self worth faith or love those 
are the garbage in us around which the flies tend to cluster

israeli leaders dismissed us statements 
defining jewish neighborhoods in annexed arab east jerusalem as 
settlements and said monday that the holy city will not be 
divided again 
later monday cabinet ministers of the conservative likud party 
gave conditional approval to us proposals for peace talks with 
palestinians 
there was concern the new us statements on jerusalem would 
complicate efforts toward peace in the middle east 
israel captured arab east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 war 
and has declared the unified city home to 350000 jews and 130000 
arabs its capital 
united jerusalem the capital of israel will not be divided 
again foreign minister moshe arens said in parliament it will 
grow and will be enlarged under israeli sovereignty all the 
partners to the coalition accept this principle 
arens of prime minister yitzhak shamirs conservative likud 
bloc was supported by vice premier shimon peres of the centerleft 
labor party likuds main political rival and coalition partner 
following the statements that were heard in recent days and 
linked jerusalem with settlements the vice premier stressed 
that he and his party are committed to the unity of jerusalem 
israels capital and to israeli sovereignty over the city an 
announcement from peres office said 
mayor teddy kollek of jerusalem scheduled a city council meeting 
for tuesday morning to discuss the us position which also 
opposes housing construction for soviet immigrants in east 
jerusalem 
israel and the whole jewish people are united regarding the 
necessity to maintain the unity of jerusalem as israels capital 
and opposition to immigrant absorption there cannot be imagined 
he said in a statement 
most western countries including the united states do not 
recognize the israeli annexation and say the status of jerusalem 
should be determined in negotiations the united states says the 
city must stay united 
the latest us position first expressed saturday by president 
bush objects to israeli housing projects in east jerusalem where 
an estimated 120000 jews now live 
we do not believe there should be new settlements in the west 
bank or in jerusalem bush told a news conference on saturday 
i will conduct that policy as if it is firm and i will be shaped 
in whatever decisions we make to see whether people comply with 
that policy 
shamir said sunday there are no settlements in jerusalem it 
is part of israel and it will never be divided again 
he said the the government would try to direct as many soviet 
jews as possible to jerusalem 
previously the united states publicly objected only to jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip calling 
them an obstacle to peace about 75000 jews and 17 million 
palestinians live in the occupied territories

candidates who want faster reform won elections 
across the nations slavic heartland and boris n yeltsin easily 
gained a legislative seat in the russian republic unofficial 
returns indicated monday 
yeltsin has said he will seek the presidency of the republic 
which traditionally means a place on the communist partys ruling 
politburo that could return the communist maverick to the 
membership he lost in february 1988 for advocating speedier change 
leaders of popular movements in the ukraine and byelorussia an 
outspoken television commentator in leningrad and a defiant editor 
in moscow also appeared to have won in sundays local and republic 
elections 
were so happy such success said irina rozhenko of the 
ukrainian prodemocracy movement narodny rukh 
byelorussia the ukraine and the vast russian republic account 
for 80 percent of the soviet union and more than twothirds of its 
290 million people 
most of the 1800 contests for seats in the legislatures of the 
three republics remained undecided with no candidate getting the 
required majority state tv said fewer than 15 percent were 
resolved in the russian republic 
activists said strong showings in this round nearly guaranteed 
victories in runoff elections for candidates who want to step up 
the pace of reforms begun by president mikhail s gorbachev the 
runoffs are expected in two weeks 
in washington state department spokesman margaret tutweiler 
said monday that while for the most part these were not 
multiparty elections there were nonetheless many hotly 
contested competitive regional and local races offering voters a 
clear choice of candidates and ideologies 
this represents an important and indeed historic step 
forward in the process of democratization in the soviet union 
she said 
defeat of old guard local communist leaders probably would help 
gorbachevs liberalization he has railed against functionaries who 
hamper reform and people hoping to exercise new economic freedoms 
have told of crippling obstacles erected by local party officials 
ukraine party chief vladimir a ivashko considered a moderate 
protege of gorbachev qualified for a runoff against an opponent 
backed by the narodny rukh prodemocracy group vitaly i 
vorotnikov president of the russian republic defeated a lone 
opponent in the city of krasnodar winning 713 percent of the 
votes cast 
both are members of the politburo 
preliminary figures showed yeltsin who has said he will 
challenge vorotnikov for the republic presidency got 72 percent of 
the vote in his district of sverdlovsk in the ural mountains he 
defeated 11 other candidates said anatoly moiseyev of the russian 
federation election commission 
narodny rukh members said the movements leader poet ivan 
drach was elected in the first round along with several other 
prominent activists 
zyanon paznyak leader of the byelorussian peoples front got 
59 percent of the vote in his minsk district said spokesman victor 
ivashkevich he said activist candidates appeared to have carried 
cities but party apparatchiks including byelorussian party 
chief yefrem sokolov won rural districts 
in leningrad bella kurkova controversial commentator of the 
television program fifth wheel appeared to be the only 
firstround winner said ima press an official youth news agency 
fifth wheel is a public affairs program that includes long 
segments about politics and such social problems as crime and poor 
living conditions 
despite leningrads reputation as a conservative bastion 
prodemocracy candidates dominated the elections said yelena 
velinskaya editor of ima press she said only two of about 150 
candidates supported by the ultraright nationalist group pamyat 
survived the first round 
vladislav starkov editor of the countrys most popular 
newspaper arguments and facts was reported the winner of a seat 
to the russian republics parliament 
starkov ignored a strong suggestion from gorbachev that he quit 
last year after the paper which has a circulation of 33 million 
printed results of a poll implying human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov was more popular than gorbachev 
unofficial reports said wellknown dissident sergei kovalyov 
also won a seat in the russian parliament 
nearly 150 million voters were registered to vote sunday and 
more than 11000 candidates vied for 1800 seats in the three 
republic legislatures and thousands more places on local governing 
councils official results are expected tuesday 
official reports said 86 percent of the candidates in the 
russian elections and 80 percent in the ukraine were members of the 
communist party 
gorbachev who was not a candidate described the elections as a 
battle between reformers and entrenched bureacrats and added i 
am convinced that perestroika will win 
our elections involve a new type of people people who have 
been given new impetus from perestroika his plan for 
restructuring the soviet society and economy he told reporters 
after voting 
political tension has increased in some regions as direct 
control from the kremlin decreases in recent weeks gorbachev has 
prodded the communist party into giving up its monopoly on power 
and pressed for a new more powerful presidency 
in lithuania candidates of the proindependence sajudis 
movement swept earlier legislative elections and won more seats in 
runoffs sunday of the 25 candidates elected sunday 18 were from 
sajudis according to reports from activists and the official news 
agency tass 
some activists in the baltic republic want the legislature to 
vote on secession from the soviet union before gorbachev gets his 
new powers which would include the right to suspend the 
legislature of a republic and send in troops

an american businessman was deported monday after 
police accused him of illegally doing missionary work the official 
news agency said 
xinhua in a dispatch monday from the northeastern port of 
tianjin said john p cragin was ordered to leave china for 
conducting missionary activities since october in the guise of 
holding englishlanguage classes 
local police seized materials he was using for missionary work 
an activity incompatible with his status as a businessman xinhua 
said 
china bans proselytizing and allows only religious activities 
organized by statesanctioned church groups 
the report said cragin was on the board of directors of a 
chineseforeign joint venture in tianjin but did not identify the 
company it also did not say with what religious group cragin was 
allegedly affiliated 
the us embassy in beijing said chinese authorities had not 
been informed of cragins expulsion and the embassy had no 
information on the case 
an embassy official said it would be the first reported 
expulsion of an american for missionary activities since 12 
american tourists were ordered out in june for distributing 
religious materials in the southwestern city of kunming 
a japanese couple teaching at wuhan university in central china 
was deported in january for distributing bibles to students and 
carrying out christian missionary activities 
despite the ban on missionaries foreign christian groups 
continue to work quietly inside china mostly by sending badly 
needed language teachers to schools in the provinces 
foreigners caught proselytizing usually face no more than 
deportation but chinese christians conducting religious activities 
outside the established churches are subject to more severe 
punishment 
asia news a catholic church missionary bulletin claimed in 
january that six bishops and 20 priests deacons and lay people had 
been arrested in a crackdown on chinese catholics who are loyal to 
the pope 
chinas official catholic church has no relations to the 
vatican about 8 million people belong to the official protestant 
and catholic churches in china millions more worship in 
underground churches that are banned by the government

a witness testified monday that the 
exxon valdez would have capsized if skipper joseph hazelwood could 
have gotten it off a reef but the judge said the statement may be 
irrelevant 
in a tentative opinion following heated legal argument superior 
court judge karl johnstone said he may instruct jurors that the 
tanker was immovable so hazelwood could not have risked capsizing 
it even if he tried to move it 
johnstone said testimony so far convinced him that the ship was 
hard aground on the reef and could not be moved off by its own 
power 
the judge however refused a defense request to strike the 
testimony of william vorus a professor of naval architecture who 
said the ship was unbalanced after losing oil from some of its 
tanks and would have capsized if it got off the reef 
the judge stressed that he had not made a final ruling on the 
issue and thus continued to allow testimony by vorus about what 
would have happened if the exxon valdez was freed from the reef 
the march 24 grounding of the exxon valdez on bligh reef caused 
the nations worst oil spill spewing nearly 11 million gallons of 
alaska crude oil that devastated the rich population of wildlife in 
prince william sound 
the judge accepted a prosecution argument that hazelwoods 
apparent efforts to move the ship could be used to show that his 
judgment was impaired by alcohol 
the alaska statute covering criminal mischief includes an 
additional definition of recklessness saying that a person who is 
intoxicated and thus unaware of a risk may be considered reckless 
with respect to that risk 
in a brief filed with the judge shortly before mondays session 
the defense argued hazelwood could not have disregarded a risk 
which didnt exist 
the state must show that he actually knew of the risk that it 
was a substantial and unjustifiable one and that he consciously 
disregarded it defense attorney dick madson said in the document 
in addition to the charge of criminal mischief hazelwood is 
charged with three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a 
vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
the 43yearold hazelwood of huntington ny faces up to 7 
years in prison and 61000 in fines if convicted on all counts 
the criminal mischief charge the most serious requires a 
showing that hazelwood risked damage to someone elses property 
valued at more than 100000 
johnstone said the prosecutor specified before trial that the 
property in question was the shoreline of alaska and the wildlife 
of prince william sound 
but during the legal arguments assistant district attorney 
brent cole said he might change that if necessary to claim that 
hazelwood risked damage to his ship by trying to get it off the 
reef 
the judge did not immediately say whether he would permit such a 
change in strategy at this point 
vorus a professor at the university of michigan in ann arbor 
explained how the ship was unbalanced when holes punched in the 
hull allowed sea water to replace the oil which weighed less than 
the water 
asked for his expert opinion vorus responded if it had 
gotten off the reef our analysis shows it would have capsized 
and sunk 
prior to vorus testimony william milwee jr an expert in 
salvage of grounded ships heatedly denied a defense lawyers 
suggestion that he was coached by the prosecution into his 
conclusion that hazelwood acted recklessly when he tried to 
maneuver the ship after running aground 
i independently reached my opinion milwee said

school in neighboring lawndale marched to hawthorne high school to 
protest alleged racism in hiring in the centinela valley school 
district which encompasses both campuses 
officers from several cities and the los angeles county

the american mother who went to 
jail to protect her daughter arrived in new zealand on tuesday to 
press her custody fight with her former husband who she claims 
molested the child 
elizabeth morgan the 42yearold washington cosmetic surgeon 
who has for three years battled for sole custody of hilary 
foretich refused to acknowledge waiting journalists at auckland 
international airport 
morgan slipped through a side exit after arriving on a flight 
from los angeles and was ushered into a car as the car sped away 
she bowed her head to avoid waiting cameras 
the daughter hilary 7 was first smuggled to britain and then 
to new zealand where she has been living with her maternal 
grandparents under the name ellen morgan 
morgan was jailed for 25 months in 1987 for refusing to reveal 
her daughters whereabouts when a superior court judge in 
washington dc granted the childs father eric foretich 
unsupervised visits 
foretich spent two years tracking hilary down and arrived in new 
zealand last week 
foretich 45 a dental surgeon from falls church va has 
vigorously denied the allegations of child sex abuse and kept a low 
profile in new zealand he also has countered that morgan in 
mentally ill 
although she has not seen hilary in more than two years morgan 
said through her new zealand lawyer she would not immediately fly 
to christchurch for a reunion 
instead lawyer lyn stevens said she will spend a few days 
meeting with her lawyers and with hilarys attorney 
morgans efforts to avoid the media apparently included booking 
her air new zealand businessclass seat under the name of mr j 
morgan through to sydney australia she also booked a ticket on an 
early flight tuesday from auckland to christchurch as mr j morgan 
but that reservation was canceled from los angeles on sunday 
travel agents told the associated press 
stevens said morgan has high regard for the new zealand family 
court system which is to rule on the custody issue no date has 
been set for a hearing 
she is acutely conscious of the strong tradition in new 
zealand of keeping matters before the family court private and 
confidential stevens said accordingly she requests that all 
media respect the privacy of herself her family and hilary 
she is very pleased that in new zealand the best interests and 
welfare of hilary are regarded as the paramount consideration 
her lawyer said 
stevens said morgan would not meet the media during her visit 
he said he did not know when she will go to christchurch or how 
long she is visiting 
morgan reportedly has spoken only once to her daughter by 
telephone since she was jailed and it seemed likely on her first 
day in new zealand she would not be able to talk because all phone 
communications were down in christchurch 190 miles south of 
wellington the capital 
telecom the national telephone company could not explain the 
communications failure

an earthquake measuring 71 on the richter 
scale struck near vanuatu in the south pacific the hong kong 
observatory said tuesday there were no immediate reports of damage 
an observatory statement said an initial reading of the quake 
which struck at 1149 am est monday revealed the epicenter to be 
about 1400 miles northeast of sydney australia 
no further details were available on the quake which matched in 
intensity the tremor that rattled the san francisco bay area last 
oct 17 that quake killed 67 injured about 3000 and caused an 
estimated 7 billion in damage 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 
times greater a magnitude 6 can cause severe damage on land while 
a tremor of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread and heavy 
damage

cabinet ministers from prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc on monday gave conditional approval 
to usmediated peace talks with palestinians 
but new complications arose when leaders in the occupied lands 
said palestinians in the territories will serve on a delegation to 
talks with israel only if the plo chooses it 
the likud ministers decision came at the end of a fivehour 
meeting in shamirs office and was adopted unanimously 
israel is interested to continue the peace process according 
to its peace initiative and to hold the proposed meeting with a 
palestinian group in order to work out the methods of elections in 
judea samaria and gaza it said using biblical names for the 
occupied west bank 
however the decision released by shamirs office set several 
conditions 
it said israel should speak in one voice and therefore an 
agreement with labor was needed in essential and basic 
issues guaranteeing israeli sovereignty over the whole jerusalem 
and preventing the plo from taking over the process 
the israeli peace initiative approved by the government last 
may offers palestinian elections in the occupied lands to choose 
negotiators for talks on limited autonomy the final disposition of 
the occupied territories is to be decided later 
israel refuses to negotiate the status of jerusalem which it 
has declared its capital after annexing the citys eastern arab 
part it was captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the palestinians who have been waging a nearly 27monthold 
revolt against israeli rule in the west bank and occupied gaza 
strip demand an independent state with east jerusalem as its 
capital 
secretary of state james a baker iii trying to bridge various 
differences has suggested several compromise moves to bring about 
preliminary israelipalestinian talks in cairo egypt 
baker has reportedly suggested israel accept any negotiator 
registered as a resident of the west bank or gaza strip that may 
include palestinian exiles somehow affiliated with the plo and 
arabs who actually live in east jerusalem and thus satisfy plo 
demands 
the likud decision made no reference to the question of 
palestinians deported from the occupied lands suggesting likud may 
be ready to accept them as negotiators 
but the ministers ruled out participation of east jerusalem 
arabs saying they shall not participate in the process linked to 
the peace initiative either by participating in elections or by 
being elected 
a positive response from likud is seen as crucial in the israeli 
acceptance of the us proposals the main elements have already 
been accepted by the leftleaning labor party likuds political 
rival and partner in the coalition government 
labor has threatened to leave the coalition if likud blocks the 
peace process 
likuds conditional approval remained vague regarding the agenda 
of cairo talks which israel wants to be limited to its elections 
plan the palestinians want an open agenda enabling them to raise 
independence demands 
another part of the likud decision touched on the participation 
of the plo which the palestinians call their sole legitimate 
representative israel considers the palestine liberation 
organization a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it 
attempts by plo to penetrate or take control over the process 
in any form would lead to a stoppage of the meeting and israels 
withdrawal from it the statement said 
the likud decision was announced hours after 34 palestinian 
leaders from the occupied territories signed a statement demanding 
the plo select any delegation to peace talks with israel 
no palestinian from the israelioccupied territories will 
participate in any delegation that is not formed or announced by 
the plo it said 
bakers compromises reportedly included having egypt announce 
the palestinian delegation and the palestinian statement saying it 
should be made public by the plo was likely to further complicate 
peace moves 
another complication is the new us position of citing jewish 
neighborhoods in east jerusalem as settlements a definition 
earlier reserved for settlements in the west bank and gaza strip 
it certainly did not help a senior likud official noted 
after the meeting 
the us statements regarding jerusalem on monday drew angry 
responses from israeli leaders including labor head and vice 
premier shimon peres who stressed his partys commitment to united 
jerusalem as israels capital 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir predicted labor would accept 
likuds demands 
these are very easy in my mind for labor being committed to 
united jerusalem and the idea that the plo would not penetrate 
the process we dont foresee any special problems with labor 
ahimeir said 
president bush urged american jewish leaders monday to help 
promote a dialogue between israelis and palestinians as soon as 
possible 
this remains the surest path available to promoting a peace 
that would ensure israeli security and the legitimate political 
rights of palestinians white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
bush made the appeal in a telephone conversation with seymour 
reich president of the conference of presidents of american jewish 
organizations 
reich called national security adviser brent scowcroft asking to 
speak with the president bush called him back

president bush back from summit talks where 
he pledged a global partnership with japan now faces the 
challenge of proving he can act on his vow to turn around the us 
trade deficit with japan 
even as the president headed back sunday from the meeting with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu in rancho mirage calif 
house majority leader richard gephardt complained that the summit 
appeared to be another case of good intentions but no specific 
actions to improve the 49 billion annual trade deficit with that 
country 
nothing has changed gephardt said 
but the missouri democrat said the increasingly protectionist 
congress will wait until summer for concrete action from the two 
leaders promises before it considers trade sanctions against 
japan 
 
miami ap the united states may sharply curtail the granting 
of asylum to nicaraguan refugees because of their nations switch 
to democracy but there is little chance political exiles already 
here will be forced to return 
in theory people granted asylum are subject to review each 
year and could have that status revoked said duke austin 
spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service in 
washington 
but i know of no single case since political asylum has been 
an avenue in the united states when we have involuntarily returned 
someone because conditions in their homeland improved austin 
said its in the law but its never been done 
what is more likely is that new applicants will get tougher 
scrutiny of their applications

bombs are exploding in beirut marines are 
dying and americans are worried white house spokesman larry 
speakes is asked if president reagan has read a house report on the 
latest attack in lebanon 
i dont think hes read the report in detail speakes says 
its 5 pages doublespaced 
for paul slansky author of the clothes have no emperor a 
chronicle of the american 80s that 1984 glimpse of the free 
worlds leader said it all 
and then three weeks later reagan says that he reads every 
comic strip in the newspaper slansky said that to me is 
definitive 
almost everything the great communicator said or did seemed 
brainless to slansky most ignored reagans gaffes misstatements 
and blemishes slansky seized upon every one of them packing 10 
filing cabinet drawers with newspaper and magazine clips 
documenting a decade the author describes as wallowing in 
mediocrity 
the clothes have no emperor fireside books 1295 the 
resulting book is a digest of dirt a chronological collection of 
items documenting american cultures lowest moments 
in 1981 reagan failed to recognize his only black cabinet 
member housing secretary samuel pierce at a white house 
reception how are you mr mayor reagan asked pierce im 
glad to meet you how are things in your city 
vice president bush touring an auschwitz death camp in 1987 
said boy they were big on crematoriums werent they 
in 1988 vice president dan quayle takes his turn with the 
holocaust calling it an obscene period in our nations 
history correcting himself he says in this centurys 
history is what he meant we all lived in this century he 
says adding i didnt live in this century 
its not that slansky picks only on republicans his victims 
also include such democrats as expresidential candidate michael 
dukakis an arrogant little fool and sen joe biden of 
delaware and a range of celebrities including vanna white 
michael jackson tammy faye bakker and even the movie ishtar 
satirical is just a word applied to it said slansky a 
contributor to esquire spy village voice and the new republic 
all im basicallydoing is chronicling what people say its just 
the truth thats all 
this book is not irreverent this book is contemptuous it 
happens to be funny but it is very serious a history book of 
the 80s this book should be a textbook it should be taught in 
journalism courses this is a serious piece of work that has a 
goofy cover 
the cover sporting silly pictures of a brokennosed geraldo 
rivera gary hart with donna rice and mr t in the lap of nancy 
reagan belies an admittedly unforgiving obsessive account of 
almost every presidential misstep 
slansky does show isolated affection for some of his friends 
including comedian harry shearer and artist robbie conal 
on page 232 slansky recalls reagans visit to notre dame where 
he presides over the unveiling of a knute rockne stamp flubbing 
the one line hes probably used more than any other reagan says 
win just one for the gippet gipper was the nickname of 
football star george gipp who reagan portrayed in knute rockne 
all american 
this book is not written for anybody who voted for reagan and 
liked reagan slansky said theyd be foolish to buy this book 
this was written for everybody who for the last eight years was 
made to feel like they were freaks of culture by the media 
nixon was hilarious he was the best show there was he had 
this need to selfdestruct in public what better theater can you 
get than that 
reagan was much less funny for me i cant stand his ignorance 
the fakeness of it there wasnt a moment in eight years when i 
thought he was amusing not only was he an actor but also to me 
such a lousy actor 
mark weinberg a spokesman for the former president declined to 
comment on slanskys depiction of reagan as an incompetent we 
dont comment on other peoples books weinberg said 
the clothes has no emperor is sprinkled with celebrity lows 
from march 1988 the books offers this gem from a geraldo rivera 
interview with a man named tommy arthur your wife wants you to 
die your reaction quickly 
said slansky this wasnt an era that was totally enamored of 
excellence this is a country that was wallowing in mediocrity 
for years and here was the guy who completely reflected us just 
as we reflected him and when i say we i sure dont mean me 
were there times when he considered reagan too easy a target 
no because nobody else was shooting at him quayle could be 
considered too easy a target but i am after dan quayle he is 
my enemy in public life right now he is the stupidest man ive 
ever seen there and i dont want a stupid man like that running 
the country i was raised to think that intelligence mattered 
reagan did whatever they said heres one of my favorite 
quotes from the administration one of his aides said if we told 
reagan to walk outside turn around three times pick up an acorn 
and throw it out to the crowd wed be lucky to get a question from 
him asking why 
he just wasnt there slansky said i think he was 
emblematic of the 80s totally style over substance here was the 
emptiest suit we ever elected

she was an astrophysicist in the soviet union 
but couldnt find scientific work in israel and offered to take a 
job cleaning professor herman branovers lab 
branover a sovietborn physicist who immigrated in 1972 told 
the story to illustrate what he sees as a major problem in settling 
the thousands of soviet jews arriving in israel the lack of jobs 
especially for the welleducated 
he said the woman was desperate for work and when told there 
was no scientific job offered to clean the lab because she would 
feel at home there and might be able to do some reasearch on her 
own he turned her down 
the science ministry estimates 60000 scientists engineers and 
physicianss will arrive in the next two or three years because of 
moscows more liberal emigration policies 
we are going to have to make jobs for these people if we are 
going to keep them branover said and that has given him a cause 
he owns a factory that employs soviet immigrants and has become 
a champion of developing new private industries for the army of 
scientists arriving in israel 
the government is still talking about how to build housing for 
the immigrants he said ive never heard of anyone who didnt 
come to israel or who left because of bad housing but there are 
thousands who left because they couldnt find jobs 
officials estimate the government will need 3 billion in the 
next three years to help resettle the soviet immigrants most of it 
for housing education and hebrew instruction only 400 million is 
earmarked for job placement and retraining 
government resettlement plans are built largely on the theory 
that a growing economy will produce jobs but the economy is 
stagnant and two years of recession have pushed unemployment to 
nearly 9 percent 
universities and research institutions have few openings and 
some new arrivals find the work available is neither in their field 
nor to their liking 
in a tel aviv suburb two physicians were among several dozen 
soviet immigrants packing matzo bread for shipping 
dr anatoly roeburg a cardiologist from moldavia told 
reporters israel is a great place except we cant find proper 
work if this goes on i am not going to stay here 
in the 1970s and early 1980s israel could cope with immigration 
easily because few jews were permitted to leave the soviet union 
only 202 soviet jews arrived in all of 1986 but now 1200 land 
in israel every week 
israeli towns especially those in rural areas whose populations 
have drained away to the cities are eager to take the immigrants 
but unable to offer them work 
safad in northern israel has 400 governmentowned apartments 
standing empty but few jobs 
what we need now is investment in industries and other 
workproducing enterprises the towns mayor zeev perel told 
the jerusalem post 
branover a physicist at beersheva university agrees with 
perel he lobbies the government and business groups to create 
hightech industries for the newcomers and practices what he 
preaches 
two years ago with a 25 million investment from australian 
industrialist joseph gutnick branover started a hightech company

the ratings still begin with a decimal point but 
cable news network is standing by its fledgling dinnertime 
newscast the world today 
cnn launched the onehour program in october starting it at 6 
pm est a time slot in which its second halfhour competes 
directly with the nightly newscasts of abc cbs and nbc in the 
eastern and central time zones where 75 percent of the nations 
viewers live 
cnns new show gained some immediate attention with the 
selection of catherine crier up until last year a texas judge to 
join veteran newsman bernard shaw at the anchor desk crier in 
atlanta shaw in washington 
the ratings show they arent yet in the same league with abcs 
peter jennings nbcs tom brokaw and cbs dan rather far from it 
last weeks nielsens showed abcs world news tonight winning 
its eighth consecutive victory with an 113 ratings average 
followed by the nbc nightly news with a 101 average and the 
cbs evening news with a 99 
cnn says its ratings are averaging a 7 but the gap is even 
bigger than it looks in broadcasting one rating point equals 
921000 homes in cable one point for cnn equals 547820 homes 
the number cnn estimates it serves 
but cnn says ratings for the world today are growing every 
month and already are 16 percent better than the two programs 
previously in the same time period 
were going to move ahead and stick to our game plan said 
paul amos cnns executive vice president of news programming 
were not going to abandon this in the short term this is a very 
longtermoriented project 
amos said the program has proved to be the right move 
because weve managed to take a time period that was relatively 
stagnant and improve on it 
among other things the program will be served although not 
exclusively by the new cnn investigative unit headed by pamela 
hill who for years was in charge of abc news nowdefunct 
closeup documentary unit 
hills team whose reports will start airing this month on cnn 
broadcasts includes former nbc political correspondent ken bode 
who signed on friday as a contributing correspondent 
bode who left nbc news last year to teach will continue his 
other job as a college professor a cnn spokeswoman said 
bode is a print and broadcast news veteran but not crier cnn 
took perhaps one of its biggest chances when it hired her for the 
world today 
her journalistic debut coincided with the programs but crier 
35 a civil judge for five years said the parallels are 
tremendous between her old profession and her new one 
as a trial lawyer she said she gathered facts by interviewing 
witnesses and then delivered those facts clearly to a judge or 
jury as a judge she said she had to glean facts from piles of 
evidence and draw objective conclusions 
but while a judge might take weeks to weigh a cases evidence 
before ruling crier said tv reporting requires an enormous amount 
of spontaneity because of its immediacy 
amos acknowledged that some at cnn were concerned about criers 
inexperience 
she was an unknown commodity he said and once she 
started working at a computer terminal catherine crier became 
another staffer and the rest of our journalists came to know her 
and have warmed up to her 
cnn plans to publicize the world today this spring with a 
major advertising campaign 
many viewers have watched their evening news on the same network 
for a generation amos said adding a 25yearold ingrained 
habit thats a tough habit to break 
its going to take a long time to make the public aware that 
we are here he said less than 60 percent of the nations 
households have cable or access to the program 
 
elsewhere in television 
rather examines burnout thursdays 48 hours anchored by 
dan rather will examine the human cost of too fast a pace in life 
and business in america among other things the cbs show will 
report on a california entrepreneur who cbs says has turned his 
car into the office of the future and his life into a 
roundtheclock rush hour

christ the redeemer the famous 
statue that watches over rio is being repaired after more than a 
halfcentury of battering by rain mountain winds and dramatic 
temperature changes 
adverse weather conditions have done a great deal of damage 
said architect joel ghivelder the renovation is absolutely 
necessary and timely 
ghivelder is coordinating the 2 million renovation for the 
globo media empire which is splitting the cost with the brazilian 
subsidiary of the royal dutch shell oil company 
seeping moisture has reached iron plates beneath the 125foot 
statues light green soapstone facade causing them to rust and 
expand to up to eight times their original size ghivelder said 
the expansion has caused cracks and swelling on the statues 
surface and some chunks of soapstone have already fallen off he 
said 
no one has been hurt by the falling stones one of which weighed 
25 pounds and ghivelder attributes that to christs presence 
engineers will preserve as much of the statues original surface 
material as possible but about 10 percent of the soapstone must be 
replaced the architect said 
scaffolding will cover the christ until about july and the 
restoration to include landscaping and improvements in public 
facilities will be completed in the fall the hope is to finish 
the work by the statues 59th anniversary in october 
until then the final flights of stairs leading to the monument 
will be sealed off 
the renovation is extremely important and urgent said jose 
geraldo machado technical director of riotur the municipal 
tourism board brazils image is established through rio and the 
christ statue along with sugar loaf mountain and copacabanas 
beaches are the citys three top symbols 
heitor de costa silva conceived the statue in the early 1920s in 
a competition sponsored by a popular magazine to choose a 
national monument 
french sculptur paul landowski created the christs 12foot 
high 35ton head the hands weigh nine tons each and are 75 feet 
across 
when french engineers had designed the outstreched arms and 
body the parts were sent from paris dragged up 2400foot 
corcovado mountain and mounted on supporting pillars the statue 
was inaugurated oct 12 1931 
hundreds of thousands of people visit the site every year to 
see the statue and enjoy the spectacular view of guanabara bay the 
open atlantic the mountains hills and the vibrant city below 
in his book the insiders guide to rio christopher pickard 
wrote in truth the view is beyond description words and 
photographs are not enough 
ghivelder said christ the redeemer is one of the countrys 
biggest attractions for both foreigners and brazilians we want to 
recover the statue and give it back to the city clean neat and 
beautiful

in the past week or so claims against the 
peace dividend have been posted by the nations governors 
advocates of us aid to the emerging democracies of eastern europe 
and central america and 79 us senators 
theyll have to get into line with all the others looking to 
cash in on defense spending cuts to finance other aims or to cut 
taxes 
one of my colleagues sent me a note saying he felt that 
half of the peace dividend should be applied to education said 
speaker of the house thomas s foley and half of it to health 
and half of it to deficit reduction and half of it to tax 
reduction and half of it to the infrastructure 
and half of it to creating a new mathematics to explain how 
six halves equal one whole 
its a harmless political pastime right now because there isnt 
any peace dividend to pay for other things or cut the deficit this 
year 
the peace dividend is peace says vice president dan quayle 
but nobody doubts that the defense budget is going to be cut 
freeing resources to go elsewhere unless there is an incredible 
reversal of the already incredible change that has swept eastward 
to moscow easing if not ending the cold war 
the pentagon warns that a reversal could happen but cia 
director william h webster told congress last week that it is 
unlikely even if hardliners were to take over in moscow 
the administration isnt forecasting a budget bonus now or soon 
resisting pressure in congress to carve one out of defense 
spending there are certain to be cuts in the administrations 296 
billion defense budget an increase in dollars although not enough 
to match inflation 
but democrat foley said that in the early phases it will be 
difficult to wring major savings out of defense cuts that close 
bases recall troops from abroad or cancel weapons contracts 
the immediate impact is sometimes to increase costs in the 
short term he said but theres no question were talking 
about very significant savings to be realized foley said he 
thinks the eventual savings should be split half to reduce the 
federal deficit half to the social deficit of financially 
strapped domestic programs 
sen phil gramm rtex raised the issue in the senate last 
week with an amendment suggesting that any peace dividend be used 
to cut taxes he said the only discussion had been about ways to 
spend the money when the government shouldnt spend it at all but 
should give it back to taxpayers 
i do not believe it is too dramatic to say that the no 1 
issue of the 1990s if things continue to move in the current 
direction in eastern europe and the soviet union will be what to 
do with the peace dividend gramm said 
before the senate got to its hypothetical legislation the 
national governors conference had adopted a resolution urging 
president bush to dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced 
manner between the federal budget deficit education and other 
productivity investments 
there were no numbers attached 
nor were there any dividend estimates when congressional 
advocates of aid for the newly elected government of nicaragua and 
the fledgling democracies of eastern europe put in their bids 
saying defense savings should finance economic assistance 
there were some figures when the senate had its minidebate on 
the peace dividend but they varied so widely as to be meaningless 
gramm said he thought defense budget savings might total 50 to 70 
billion by the mid1990s sen edward m kennedy dmass said the 
cuts should add up to 163 billion over the next five years 
sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the budget committee said 
it was premature to be talking about uses for a peace dividend that 
isnt there yet but he said the debate at least produced the first 
senate consensus that there will indeed be one 
sasser and the democrats proposed their own peace dividend 
measure declaring that the savings should go toward balancing the 
budget meeting urgent national priorities and reducing taxes for 
working people 
that was approved 7919 and gramms version was rejected 
5048 neither commits anybody to do anything which makes them 
perfect electionyear exhibits for campaigning senators who can 
point to them as votes in favor of cutting taxes 
it is a kind of kissingyoursister resolution gramm said 
of the democratic version 
there may be a lot of that before the nov 6 elections

a year ago islamic fundamentalist ahmed 
kofahi had been dismissed as a university teacher and was in prison 
for criticizing the government now hes a member of parliament 
kofahi is heard regularly in state radio broadcasts of 
parliamentary debates excoriating assorted government officials 
his progress from prisoner to legislator illustrates the quiet 
changes jordan has undergone the past year 
the atmospheres different now kofahi said in an interview 
we have more freedom but its not enough 
islamic fundamentalists and leftists who won seats in the 
november elections are pressing for tough investigations of 
government corruption greater social justice and curbs on security 
agencies 
human rights are born before the human is born kofahi said 
its not a gift from a leader or a party or an authority and not 
to have these rights is equivalent to death 
jordan is bordered to the north and east by syria and iraq 
whose ruling parties brook little opposition kuwait the most 
liberal state on the arabian peninsula to the south suspended its 
parliament in 1987 
im sure the countries surrounding us are not happy about 
whats going on here said taher masri who resigned from the 
cabinet to make a successful run for parliament 
reform in this kingdom of 31 million people whose western 
neighbor is israel is more orderly and less sweeping than the 
change revolutionizing eastern europe 
as in eastern europe however popular revolt is behind it four 
days of riots last april caused by price increases and other 
grievances cost 10 lives and shocked king hussein into action 
hussein who has ruled since 1953 is relinquishing many powers 
but retains firm control and is personally popular 
in november he oversaw jordans first general elections since 
1967 which were among the freest ever held in the arab world 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood won the largest bloc of 
seats in the 80member parliament kofahi running on the 
brotherhood ticket got more votes than any of the other 650 
candidates 
mudar badran husseins choice for prime minister underwent an 
extraordinary grilling by legislators about his personal finances 
and professional record before winning a vote of confidence 
since last april the government has freed all prisoners held 
without charge and dozens convicted of political related crimes 
radicals who once took up arms against hussein have been allowed 
to return home and the pervasive general intelligence department 
has been stripped of its powers to withhold passports and bar 
people from travel or employment 
the government has promised to make officials accountable for 
corruption a former undersecretary of the supply ministry was 
arrested last month in a graft investigation 
badran has promised to end martial law imposed 23 years ago 
because of the 1967 middle east war and appointed lawyers to 
determine which of the decrees issued during that time should be 
abolished 
he also promised to repeal a 1935 defense law inherited from the 
british mandate that allows officials to ignore many civil rights 
the law now is used more widely in israel than in jordan 
although the 33yearold ban on political parties remains in 
force it was ignored during the election campaign the government 
says it will legalize parties after a new national charter of 
principles is submitted to a referendum probably this year 
police have not interfered with street demonstrations which 
have been few and small a 1988 decree nationalizing newspapers was 
canceled and they were returned to their former managers but 
government institutions retain majority ownership 
the government is not involved in any way in restricting the 
press information minister ibrahim izzeddine said 
all the changes have not been liberal the victory of islamic 
fundamentalists set back campaigns for westernstyle womens rights 
and encouraged censorship on moral grounds 
masri the former government minister said he is convinced 
hussein will not retreat from reforms 
jordan has had parliaments since the 1920s most were weak and 
any that showed signs of independence were suspended 
since 1948 however jordan has gone from a land of peasants and 
nomads with one high school to a nation that nearly equals sweden 
in the percentage of young people going to college or technical 
school 
with such an educated population masri said you cant hide 
anything anymore

they are among the more than 440000 east 
germans who have resettled in west germany in the past year thomas 
and angelika weitz and their 6yearold daughter fled their 
homeland with a train load of other embassy refugees just 
before the collapse of communism in east germany a reporter who 
interviewed them at the time recently revisited the weitz family to 
see how theyve fared after six months of freedom 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when angelika weitz first 
walked into a west german store to buy yogurt she was so 
overwhelmed by the abundance of flavors she broke out in a cold 
sweat 
when she visited a doctor for the first time she learned that 
here a patient need not bring a towel from home 
even fresh air was a novelty for mrs weitz and her family who 
fled east germany and resettled in west germany about six months 
ago 
for thomas and angelika weitz and their 6yearold daughter 
jenny there is a new job a new home they are slowly making new 
friends with no worries about being watched by the secret police 
they have no plans to return to east germany even though 
democracy is supplanting communism in their homeland since they 
boarded a train in prague czechoslovakia and arrived in west 
germany with thousands of other embassy refugees 
the family now lives in a new neatly furnished apartment with a 
large bedroom bath countrystyle kitchen and living room just 
outside offenstetten in a rural wooded area of bavaria 240 miles 
southeast of frankfurt 
thomas weitz a 30yearold trained machinist who earned about 
150 a month at a factory in east germany found a job in a 
paintandbody auto repair shop and takes home about 1050 a 
month enough for him to afford a used car a small color 
television and a stereo adorn a table in their living room 
in the east german city of zwickau about 145 miles south of 
berlin their rundown apartment had no bath and not enough water 
pressure for an inside toilet says mrs weitz 40 who worked as a 
nurses assistant in east germany 
the place was falling apart she says 
here there are lots of deer and rabbits chimed in little 
jenny cuddling a stuffed toy dog on the living room couch 
zwickaus polluted air caused her and jenny to have chronic 
breathing problems mrs weitz says 
thats one of the main reasons we wanted to leave she says 
zwickau a city of 130000 people is heavily industrialized 
with smokestacks belching noxious brown smoke into the air 
producing the sort of sooty grimness so common in such east german 
cities 
because they had applied several times to resettle in the west 
and because she had complained often about medical treatment the 
stasi as the east german secret police were called began 
monitoring the familys activities mrs weitz says 
i was often sick after jennys birth in 1983 and had trouble 
getting proper medical treatment she says then i was finally 
operated on for a uterus problem now the doctor here tells me that 
i may have to be operated on again 
but mrs weitz says she has been able to cut down on medicine 
since the family settled in offenstetten 
i can breathe again and jenny sleeps well she has an appetite 
and doesnt cough all night like she did before 
the family has been back to zwickau only to visit relatives 
since east germany opened its borders on nov 9 
the couple said they feel it will take years for east germany to 
catch up with the west despite the democratic changes 
i am 40 years old and west germany took 40 years to get this 
far mrs weitz says i dont have time to wait for that over 
there 
with some 340000 east germans arriving in west germany in 1989 
and 100000 so far this year there has been some resentment among 
west german taxpayers who complain the resettlers are getting 
special treatment in obtaining homes and jobs 
the newcomers also are eligible for social payments until they 
are resettled and find employment 
west germany about the size of oregon has a population of 61 
million people and is already overcrowded the country also faces a 
chronic housing shortage and januarys unemployment rate was 85 
percent with 2191400 registered jobless 
despite that the weitz family says they have been treated well 
since their arrival probably because they do not live in one of 
the countrys large cities where housing shortages and joblessness 
are most prevalent 
we have always been treated just like everyone else no matter 
where we go shopping or in restaurants mrs weitz says 
but she recalls a humorous incident when she first visited a 
doctor in the west 
i can tell you come from the east germany the doctor told 
her

why because of my accent she asked no because you 
brought along your own towel 
the weitzes still marvel at the abundance in west germany 
compared with their homeland 
i like yogurt mrs weitz says when i went into a store 
to buy some for the first time after we got here my knees got weak 
as i saw all the flavors there and i broke out in a cold sweat 
trying to decide on which one to buy 
i had to leave that store and walk around outside to compose 
myself before i finally got up the nerve to go back in and buy 
some 
the weitz family was in the first train load of east germans to 
arrive in hof west germany from prague on oct 1 just 17 days 
before hardline communist leader erich honecker was ousted during 
a wave of prodemocracy demonstrations 
at the time like thousands of other east germans who had fled 
to west germanys embassy in czechoslovakia the family expected no 
quick changes in their communist homeland and decided to risk an 
escape 
we packed only a few things no marriage certificate or 
anything to give a clue that we were leaving for good and caught a 
flight from schoenefeld airport in east berlin to prague because we 
didnt need a visa to go there weitz says 
we didnt tell our families no one for fear the secret 
police would find out we feared constantly that maybe we wouldnt 
make it 
the family took a taxi to the west german embassy immediately 
after landing in prague in the evening of sept 30 there they 
learned that west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
had just announced that everyone would be allowed to leave for west 
germany by train 
from there in a deal worked out between east germany and west 
germany about 6000 east germans inside and outside the prague 
embassy boarded trains that would take them to the west by crossing 
back through their homeland 
the weitz family told of the harrowing trip from prague and how 
secret police boarded the trains in east germany to tell the 
refugees they were being expelled from their homeland 
weitz says they first realized they were in west germany when 
the sound of the tracks became smoother and the train started going 
faster 
you have to go slow in the east germany because the tracks 
are all worn out he says 
at the deggendorf refugee camp in northeast bavaria the family 
was first put in a large hall with beds for 40 people 
it was overcrowded and sanitation was bad mrs weitz says 
so we moved into a small hotel for three days where we could 
sleep in private and take showers 
later they moved into a boarding house in the nearby town of 
gotteszell about 70 miles northeast of munich where they stayed 
about a month 
there weitz got a temporary job at a car repair shop cleaning up 
and helping out for 29 a day 
i didnt care as long as i could make some money he says 
through wordofmouth weitz says he was introduced to the owner 
of a small paintandbody car shop in offenstetten 
through that contact i got my job and our apartment it costs 
us 410 a month but we expected that weitz says 
asked what they think of the dramatic changes in east germany 
and if there is any chance they might return to help build up the 
country weitz replies 
im happy about most of the change that all of us leaving 
helped bring on perhaps id return if i got the backing to start 
my own business

it used to be the rare sign in a shop window 
that proclaimed se habla espanol but more and more spanish is 
the second language in the united states it reflects the 
importance of a hispanic population that the 1990 census will count 
at more than 20 million and growing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
call it the latinization of america comprende 
usted 
for instance in a martial arts movie on cable television the 
oriental warriors speak spanish 
in california the telephone company puts out special yellow 
pages in spanish 
in new york city a growing number of bus and subway ads for 
familiar products are in spanish and all the safety instructions 
are in english and spanish 
and a major american movie an american tail was recently 
released simultaneously in spanish and english versions whereas in 
the past a spanish version would have appeared months after the 
english release 
more and more spanish is heard in americas big cities 
becoming common enough to be used in business and on ballots 
the number of hispanics in the united states surpassed 20 
million last year and is rapidly growing according to census 
bureau estimates hispanics now comprise 82 percent of the us 
population 
i believe that we see ourselves in the same light as previous 
immigrants the irish the italians the germans who came 
before says eduardo pena chairman of the league of united latin 
american citizens 
we dont want to change america we just want to be part of 
it we want to be as much americans as anybody else 
yet as they try to assimilate into us life many hispanics 
feel their americanism is being questioned by efforts to make 
english the official language of the united states says ronaldo 
cruz associate director of the us catholic conference 
secretariat for hispanic affairs 
the hispanics are angry theyre hurt theyre upset he 
says 
cruz also pointed to moves to limit immigration and exclude 
illegal immigrants from the 1990 census as areas of concern to 
hispanics 
pablo sedillo director of the secretariat for hispanic affiars 
says when they get here they encounter discrimination 
exploitation in a land that they thought was free a land of 
opportunities 
problems are even greater for those arriving illegally since 
they lack documents that ease the way into jobs and face the 
continual threat of being discovered and deported 
but legal or illegal the influence of hispanics on american 
life business and politics is undeniable 
between 4 million and 45 million hispanics were registered to 
vote in 1988 and they were openly courted by spanishlanguage ads 
in local newspapers and broadcast media 
early in the 1988 presidential campaign george bush promised to 
appoint the first hispanic cabinet member president reagan beat 
him to the punch by selecting lauro cavazos as education secretary 
bush kept cavazos on and also picked manuel lujan as interior 
secretary 
americans of all backgrounds have come to enjoy the music of 
such groups as gloria estefan and miami sound machine and los 
lobos the song la bamba enjoyed a recent revival as the title 
track from a movie about the life and brief career of the late 
singer ritchie valens valenzuela 
ricardo montalban meanwhile became a widely seen spokesman for 
automobiles on national television 
the census bureau preparing for the 1990 head count is telling 
hispanics hagase contar make yourself count its something 
hispanics already are doing at the cash register 
corporate america has rediscovered the hispanic market a 
lot of major corporations are targeting advertising to hispanics 
says lisa navarrete spokeswoman for the national council of la 
raza 
hispanic food also has become more popular in major cities where 
a variety of restaurants mexican cuban salvadoran and others 
reflect the local hispanic communities 
mexican tops the list the research firm packaged facts reports 
that 38 million households eat mexican foods sales of which rose 
55 percent between 1982 and 1987 
krafts velveeta now comes in a spicy mexican version 
jalapenoflavored potato chips are sold nationally and farmers in 
new mexico report doubling their crops of chiles between 1977 and 
1987 
but there has been some confusion 
for example borden advertised ice cream using the slang mexican 
term nieve which literally means snow the campaign worked 
fine in california and texas where there are numerous 
mexicanamericans but in the east the cubans and puerto ricans 
thought the company was literally selling snow the magazine 
american demographics reports 
remember the frito bandito a mustachioed sombrerowearing 
bandit who used to sell corn chips on television 
fritolay laid him to rest in 1971 after complaints from 
hispanic groups that the portrayal was demeaning frito corn chips 
are still big sellers and the company now donates money to build 
playgrounds in hispanic neighborhoods 
in 1984 coors signed an agreement with a coalition of hispanic 
groups promising to provide 325 million over several years for a 
variety of programs for the hispanic community as well as to 
emphasize procurement and employment programs for hispanics 
univision the largest spanishlanguage television network is 
estimated to reach 17 million hispanics with at least 5 million 
regular viewers formerly known as the spanish international 
network it has been joined by a second spanish network telemundo 
with more than 33 million regular viewers according to cable 
industry experts

as far as hispanics are concerned the word minority is 
becoming extinct in some parts of the country although that may 
not have hit the policy types yet says elvira valenzuela crocker 
of the mexicanamerican national womens organization 
about twothirds of the hispanics in the united states live in 
just three states california leads with 34 percent followed by 
texas at 21 percent and new york with 10 percent 
florida has 8 percent of the nations hispanics and there are 
significant populations in illinois new jersey arizona new 
mexico and colorado the census bureau reports 
latinos are younger on average than the rest of the 
population in 1980 their median age was 23 compared to 30 for 
americans in general 
that means more are in the childbearing years and they are 
producing a higher growth rate than the rest of the nation in 
1988 hispanics averaged 94 births per 1000 women ages 18 to 44 
compared to 67 per 1000 for the rest of the country 
that also means more young latin americans are in the nations 
schools raising the issue of bilingual education in many cities 
that asyetunresolved debate centers on whether it is better to 
teach children in their own language while they learn english or 
to immerse them only in english as a means of improving their 
skills in that language while they are learning other subjects as 
well 
only about 44 percent of hispanics age 25 and over have 
completed high school compared to nearly 70 percent of 
nonhispanics 
cary davis a researcher at the private population reference 
bureau views the growing hispanic population as a source of needed 
labor in the coming years 
when the baby boom starts to retire in 20 to 30 years who 
will provide the work force it will be an increasingly minority 
and hispanic society davis says 
the labor force is going to be very different in the next 
couple of decades with a need for improved literacy and employment 
training to educate the work force adds navarrete we see this 
as a challenge for the united states but also a very positve 
thing 
we have to think through what kind of investment to make in a 
group with lower levels of educational attainment that doesnt 
have a tradition of education davis says 
and davis cautions nonhispanics against being overly 
pessimistic about these changes 
they will not be all newly arrived immigrants there is an 
assimilation process going on he says 
hispanics will soon become the majority of entrylevel workers 
in some metropolitan areas reported the population reference 
bureau in a 1988 analysis of the hispanic population 
however limited educations and language skills have held down 
incomes with percapita income in 1988 averaging 7956 for 
hispanics compared to 8271 for blacks and 13896 for whites 
while many hispanics are not citizens the constitution 
specifies that the census count all residents of the country not 
just us citizens thus when census figures are used for 
political reapportionment and distribution of federal and state 
funds areas with more people hispanic and otherwise will be 
the gainers 
their presence will mean added clout for areas where they live 
following the 1990 census 
between 1974 and 1988 the number of hispanic elected officials 
in the country grew from 1500 to 3300 including 10 members of 
the house of representatives 
william ohare of the population reference bureau has speculated 
that minorities including hispanics could gain six to 10 more 
house seats after the 1990 census 
while hispanics are not as likely to register as other 
americans that gap has been narrowed by registration drives in 
recent years 
and when they do register they are as likely to vote as anyone 
else 
in 1988 officials estimate 44 percent of votingage hispanics 
were registered compared to 54 percent of blacks and 60 percent of 
whites 
the census report estimated the total hispanic population of the 
united states at 20076000 as of march 1989 up from 19431000 a 
year earlier 
the largest segment is mexicans at 12567000 followed by 
people of central and south american origin 2545000 puerto 
ricans 2328000 and cubans 1068000 the balance were of 
spanish or other hispanic origin 
in addition to the challenges they pose davis points out that 
the growing us hispanic community can form an important resource 
in international business relationships in coming years 
the notion of a smaller world tells us that as we look to 
international trade we have a community of representatives who can 
work in central and south america and help establish linkages to 
those countries he says

southeast asias answers to the champs elysees 
and fifth avenue are orchard road in singapore and nathan road in 
hong kong both beacons to tourists and fashionconscious shoppers 
in the exotic orient here are two stories describing what has 
become some of the most expensive real estate in the world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
orchard road is the very symbol of singapore 
one of the worlds smallest and most successful countries a place 
where consumerism is indeed conspicuous 
the official guide to this citystate says orchard road is a 
testament to modern singapore with its pedestrian malls shaded by 
huge trees and enlivened by small gardens full of tropical blooms 
and lush greenery 
this 2395squaremile country with no natural resources except 
a strategic location and the skills of its 26 million people 
enjoys the highest standard of living in southeast asia and the 
secondbest in all asia after japan 
with hong kong it is arguably the most unabashed materialistic 
society in the region 
orchard road recently was rated in a private survey by the new 
york real estate firm huberth amp peters inc as the worlds 
10thpriciest street in terms of commercial space for rent 
conspicuous consumers abound both the domestic and tourist 
variety 
statusconscious chuppies as chinese yuppies are known 
sport rolex watches designer clothes jade rings mercedesbenz 
cars and a taste for the latest in food and fashion 
orchard road is where they can shop till they drop eat till 
they pop and then plop into the swimming pool at the hilton 
dynasty mandarin or some other elegant hotel 
named for the nutmeg and tropical fruit plantations that lined 
it in colonial days orchard road is centrally located and easily 
reached by singapores 2yearold subway system thousands of 
domestic servants most of them from the philippines throng the 
treelined street on sundays the usual day off for maids here 
they catch up on gossip from home and take advantage of the 
three main features of orchard road shopping eating and 
peoplewatching 
the survey by the new york real estate firm showed that one 
square foot of shop space along the 1mile thoroughfare costs an 
average of 175 a year by comparison the survey found that one 
square foot for a year costs 675 on the ginza in tokyo the 
worlds costliest shopping district 
a check by the associated press found that the more desirable 
retail space on orchard road fetched more than 350 each year rent 
for shops in the popular but by no means topoftheline lucky 
plaza is now 368 per square foot a year almost double that of 
last year 
the multistory lucky plaza houses scores of shops selling 
electrical appliances clothing jewelry watches cameras 
cosmetics shoes sporting goods luggage radios and hifi 
equipment plus restaurants and bookstores 
while the mostly locally owned retail outlets in orchard road 
pay the highest rents in singapore they also charge from 30 
percent to 50 percent more for their merchandise than other 
shopping areas much of it consists of highpriced imports and for 
everyday necessities most singaporeans eschew the glittering 
boulevard for more modest stores in chinatown and elsewhere 
the huberth amp peters survey found one common denominator to the 
most expensive streets around the world was that they almost always 
contain designer names and upscale shops 
the brands prominently displayed along orchard road include 
cartier gucci christian dior dunhill omega rolex boutiques 
and department stores offer the latest in high style and casual 
wear from the fashion centers of europe and north america 
not all the fancy branded goods are what they seem however 
many tourists are pestered by touts to buy genuine copywatches 
from certain stores at a fraction of the price of the real thing 
the selling of fakes is at the heart of the touting problem 
touts are there mainly to persuade people to buy fakes says 
police deputy superintendent ng kee hoe 
in the eight months prior to feb 1 the police arrested 126 
touts and seized 11564 fake watches from 61 shops first offenders 
can be fined up to 5000 or jailed up to six months or both 
some touts appear to have their own turf and competition among 
them is as fierce as that between mcdonalds and burger king 
one of the first mcdonalds outlets in singapore was in liat 
towers at 541 orchard road it proved so popular that after the 
burger king franchise holder bought the building big mac lost the 
coveted location to the whopper

in a city known worldwide as a shoppers 
paradise no road is better traveled by the legions of 
bargainhungry tourists than nathan road in the heart of kowloon 
peninsula 
tourists pour out of the fivestar hotels and economy guest 
houses that coexist at the head of nathan road making the retail 
space along that stretch among the most expensive on earth to rent 
retailers along the street say that from 50 percent to 90 
percent of their business comes from overseas visitors 
over the past years the number of tourist arrivals have been 
increasing at a nonstop rate so recently the rentals have kept 
going up says albert chan head of the retail department of 
vigers hong kong property consultants he estimated annual 
increases of about 30 percent in the past few years 
indeed nathan road and queens road across the harbor on hong 
kong island were listed second in a recent survey of the worlds 
most expensive commercial rental streets 
according to the survey conducted by a new york commercial real 
estate firm space on nathan road rents for 575 a square foot a 
year only the ginza in tokyo is more expensive 
the high rents apply to only the first half dozen or so blocks 
of nathan road a fourlane street that begins at the stately 
peninsula hotel and runs past kowloon park before heading into the 
overcrowded lowerrent districts to the north 
the head of the street near the british colonys famed victoria 
harbor is a bazaar of swank boutiques selling the latest 
highpriced fashions and of bargain basements offering i love 
hong kong tshirts and silk ties for just over 1 gaudy neon 
signs hang low over the sidewalk 
there also are several dank and dark alleys leading off the 
road home to venders selling cheap art luggage and various types 
of pornography 
among the designer stores on the street are charles jourdan 
diane freis alfred dunhill and benetton department store branches 
include yue hwa chinese products and lane crawford the priciest in 
town 
nathan road also has dozens of shops selling cameras 
electronics watches and jewelry and haggling is often required to 
get the best price 
for tourists who cannot afford namebrand watches on many a 
corner are young men who whisper offers of counterfeits to 
passersby 
retailers typically rent out space on the ground floors of the 
luxury hotels and rundown commercial buildings that front the 
street there are a few new structures along the road including a 
mosque and a twotiered retail center built in front of the park 
real estate professionals say that some retail space on nathan 
road can go for about 770 a square foot a year the recent asking 
price for one of the streets rare vacancies was 10 percent higher 
nathan road retailers interviewed by the associated press 
however indicated that rents can be much lower 
peter lau owner of volvo video and camera supplies says he 
pays 446 a square foot to rent the store he has occupied for two 
months 
lau says his 1000squarefoot shop jammed with the latest 
electronics must bring in nearly 9000 a day to break even he 
says he is making a profit 
retailers say the political turmoil in china hurt sales during 
much of last year scaring tourists away and dampening the spending 
mood of local consumers 
but the tourist business is recovering and nathan road still 
remains a mecca for visitors in search of the legendary hong kong 
shopping experience several factors including the colonys status 
as a dutyfree port traditionally have made local prices for many 
goods among the most competitive worldwide 
joan lyon of london giordano shopping bag in hand was in the 
latest wave of visitors to nathan road which she described as a 
new bond street that was devoid of atmosphere bond street 
is londons ritziest retail row 
we are having a little bit of a spending spree mrs lyon 
said during a break from windowshopping prices generally are 
comparable to those in london she said but quickly added i 
think there are bargains to be had here

to the chamber music society of lincoln center which she helped 
found today she is only an interested bystander but her heart is 
in it everyday 
her cousin arthur houghton jr one of the founders of lincoln 
center suggested she pay most of the costs of a small concert hall 
to be built at the center 
when he asked i had the most wonderful feeling she 
recalls and i just knew this is for me i said oh arthur i 
cant think of anything id rather do i was overjoyed 
on very important occasions that voice inside of me tells me 
things and i heard inside of me well this is what you came to 
do 
the honor role of american muses is long 
in new york gertrude vanderbilt whitney founded the whitney 
museum in 1930 to house american art 
lillie p bliss mary sullivan and abby aldrich rockefeller 
founded the museum of modern art in 1929 
jane wrightsman lila acheson wallace brooke astor and joan 
payson have contributed hugely to the metropolitan museum of art

cincinnati the university of cincinnatis collegeconservatory of 
music has corbett auditorium and patricia corbett theater and at 
the top of the cincinnati symphonys music hall is a ballroom named 
corbett tower 
miss tully is the granddaughter of amory houghton jr the 
founder of corning glass her career was as a concert singer 
my mother wasnt interested in the arts per se she recalls 
my parents never expected to have an artist in the family but 
they were very kind when they realized that i just wanted to sing 
and that was it and that i was only too anxious to work and so 
they let me do it that was wonderful that they let me go and live 
and study in paris at that time 1923 it was not the usual 
thing 
she hasnt been a philanthropist all her life i didnt have 
anything to give until after my mother died she says i always 
wished that i could because i was always so interested in that 
world 
she knew how artists struggled i had friends who were 
painters and sculptors and singers and composers they all needed 
money 
miss tully by nature a person of dignity reserve and gracious 
charm was talked into allowing alice tully hall to be named for 
her for by john d rockefeller iii i would have liked it better 
being anonymous absolutely it took me six months to make up my 
mind to give my name to the hall because i knew what would happen 
and it did 
within a week she says requests for donations poured in now 
its worse than ever when i came back on monday there was a stack 
of mail like that she gestures high above a table and i had 
taken out a stack like that when i went off on the weekend i sit 
up late at night opening mail 
in the arts the need is greater than ever expenses go up so 
steadily and of course that wonderful fantasy world of opera where 
we can lose ourselves is the most expensive of all it is so 
wonderful and i have loved it since i was a child i love all forms 
of art 
now she pours tea from violetsprigged china in the living room 
of her manhattan apartment with its mossgreen carpet and 
draperies and bleachedoak paneling flowering plants are placed on 
occasional tables and windowsills her two pet maltese dogs sophie 
and tati scamper in to bark hello 
that is present tense past tense she can remember the lunch 
when she first heard of the lincoln center project a year before 
president eisenhower turned the first spadeful of earth and gave 
the signal to start the steam shovels june 1959 
she was not just a philanthropist alice tully hall which opens 
on the street is tucked into a corner of the juilliard school 
miss tully objected when juilliard wanted to make it part of the 
school i had above all to stand my ground which i did 
it took her three years of insistence to get the wide space 
between the chamber hall rows she has more letters over the last 
20 years thanking her for the comfort than she has received about 
the fine acoustics 
arthur houghton also suggested to giancarlo menotti that he 
call on his cousin when the composer was looking for money to start 
a summer music festival in spoleto italy miss tully has been a 
supporter ever since in january a benefit to repair hurricane 
damage at the spoleto festival usa in charleston sc was held 
at alice tully hall with miss tully attending 
some have referred to miss tully as a grande dame of arts 
philanthropy but that is not how she thinks of herself 
i just do what i like to do what i think i have to do and 
what it is my privilege to do

its a posse of volunteers ready to gallop off 
after horse thieves and it keeps a noose handy the wild west no 
upstate new york circa 1990 admittedly the horse thief trackers 
of the empire state havent had much to do most of this century 
but they stay organized in case theyre ever called on 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 167th annual meeting of the 
schodack stuyvesant kinderhook and chatham society for the 
detection of horse thieves is hereby called to order any old 
business 
not since that horse was stolen 73 years ago 
new business 
not till the next horse is stolen 
whats on the menu this year 
same as always mincedham sandwiches clam chowder and oyster 
stew 
meetings adjourned lets put on the feed bags 
thats as lively as it gets these days for the horse thief 
trackers of columbia county 30 miles south of albany the group 
has met on the first saturday in february since 1824 when the most 
serious environmental emission was what landed on a dirt road 
its just a tradition said the societys president lewis 
leggett 78 who cant remember when he joined the group the last 
time anyone called on the society to track a stolen horse was in 
1917 when henry ford was busy transforming the nations stables 
into garages 
for woody klose president of the red hook society for the 
apprehension and detention of horse thieves in neighboring dutchess 
county carrying on the group is more than tradition 
its got to be the greatest organization in the world said 
klose a lawyer and county legislator it meets just once a year 
and we havent had a horse theft in years thieves are so terrified 
of us that they leave our horses alone 
in columbia county a mule went on the hoof in the 1930s but it 
came back by itself one year someone stole the hobbyhorse off a 
villagers porch another year a society member stole the group 
presidents old gray horse as a joke the prankster wasnt hanged 
or even horsewhipped 
about 10 years ago a couple of horses were stolen from a local 
breeding farm but police didnt call on the volunteer posse 
i think they figured the troopers could do a better job 
said society secretary ralph duck 
yet the group still has nearly 200 members who gather once a 
year to meet with old friends they otherwise wouldnt see said 
duck 79 who joined about 50 years ago 
the group began when eastern new york was still on the frontier 
and horse thieves ran unbridled among the farming towns hugging the 
hudson river horses were practically part of the family doubling 
as transportation and as plow power 
you could probably get away with stealing a mans wife easier 
than stealing a mans horse leggett said if you lost your 
horse you lost your heart 
the society still has the noose used to hang horse thieves but 
members dont know when if ever it was used 
ive always had the feeling they didnt hang them around here 
like they did in the wild west duck said 
similarly the minutes of the red hook society are terrific 
about writing down who didnt show up at the meetings but they 
dont say anything about catching horse thieves klose said 
i cant find any report of a member ever having done 
anything he said 
a feeling of continuity keeps the 65 members of the red hook 
society founded in 1796 crowding around the trough for their 
roast beef dinner on the first tuesday of every october klose said 
we still live in what we like to think of as a semirural 
area he said it makes you feel good because you can go back 
to minutes from seven or eight generations ago and find the same 
names of people attending our meetings today 
unable to afford fulltime posses farming villages formed 
societies like todays volunteer fire departments to trail 
horse thieves 
each year societies elected a group of riders who would be 
called in when a horse was stolen the columbia county society paid 
its riders 2 a day while they were on the trail red hook riders 
earned more money the farther they rode they got a bonus if they 
trailed a horse thief out of dutchess county and brought the bandit 
back home klose said 
the societies also acted as insurers paying farm families the 
money to replace stolen horses 
as automobiles and tractors replaced horses in the early 1900s 
most horse theft societies folded 
on todays thoroughbred ranches there are few worries about 
stolen horse flesh its tough to launder a stud horse whose value 
depends on careful documentation of its parentage 
if you wanted to take a stolen horse to outer mongolia you 
could probably get away with it said mary midkiff of the 
american horse council in washington dc 
while horses dont vanish from new york farms anymore horse 
thief detectives havent donned blinders when it comes to their 
science annual meetings feature experts discoursing on police 
trail dogs the horse in folklore and archaeological evidence of 
eohippus the prehistoric forerunner of todays horse 
even so the posses of columbia and dutchess counties wont be 
saddling up anytime soon 
with the state of modern law enforcement klose said we 
dont take things into our own hands anymore

martin mull costar of the new cbs sitcom 
his amp hers is a laidback comic performer who works hardest at 
something hes really serious about painting 
performing is my day job he explains im so serious 
about art i get crazy i paint every day i paint until im 
exhausted ill start painting and suddenly realize its 2 oclock 
in the morning 
although he has a masters degree in painting from the rhode 
island school of design mull is known primarily for his acting and 
writing 
in his amp hers he costars with stephanie faracy they play 
marriage counselors trying to make it work as partners at home and 
the office 
weve done 13 episodes of his amp hers and not a word of it is 
mine says mull its just being an actor getting a job i 
always wondered if i had diminished my acting by wearing too many 
hats 
television is really a writers medium a show will succeed or 
fail on the quality of the writing i feel in many sitcoms the 
actors are interchangeable 
one thing that makes mull funny is that he doesnt look like a 
hip comedian he looks more like an accountant 
and in his passion for art mulls businesssuit demeanor is in 
stark contrast to the artist stereotype 
my life is my art i was trained for it he says were 
talking art slapping paint on canvas art 
my work is in galleries in new york and florida the reason i 
dont have a gallery here is i dont want to be considered a 
celebrity painter even though some are pretty good sunday 
painters 
as a performer mull first became known for his television role 
on mary hartman mary hartman then on fernwood 2night and 
america 2night his movies include mr mom my 
bodyguard fm take this job and shove it clue and 
painted lips which he wrote 
hes also done television movies specials and record albums 
his last series was domestic life which lasted only six 
episodes on cbs in 1984 but was listed by time magazine as one of 
the years 10 best 
he cowrote produced and acted in the tv comedy specials the 
history of white people in america and its movie spinoff 
portrait of a white marriage 
mull was offered his amp hers while working on a movie in utah 
called ski patrol he says he and ray walston were the only 
actors over the age of 21 in the movie which he adds disappeared 
from movie houses as fast as the melting snow 
in his amp hers mull and faracy are a husbandandwife team 
of marriage counselors its his second marriage and he has a 
15yearold son played by blake soper the show also stars richard 
kline as his best friend a divorce lawyer 
im freudian and shes jungian so we have a conflict of 
psychological styles mull says ostensibly were supposed to 
have separate practices but we seem to share patients and crises 
i guess physician heal thyself is the concept 
mull recently sold his homes in montecito and hollywood and 
bought a larger house in brentwood one reason he moved was to find 
a better area for him and his wife wendy a musician and composer 
to raise 4yearold maggie rose 
ive spent the last six months building a studio he says 
its the first real studio ive had i can write or paint its 
got 14foot ceilings and special lighting 
ive also switched from airbrush to oils im back to basics 
with an airbrush i always felt i was in medicine with that 
stainlesssteel tool in my hand 
its hard to describe the kind of painting i do you know how 
when you look at something you have a split second of perception 
that split second is what im trying to capture 
mull says he gets his physical exercise by kicking a football 
around a pasttime he hopes to turn into a movie called end over 
end 
i said on a radio show that something id always wanted to do 
was kick a field goal for the cleveland browns says mull who 
grew up in northern ohio i got a call from the browns inviting 
me to cleveland i suited up and kicked the ball and ive been at 
it since now i can kick my age in yards which is 46 
its gotten into my blood and ive written this script about 
an aging kicker a producer has it and were in the process of 
getting studio backing i hope i can do it before im too old

john steinbeck always turned down requests to 
adapt for the stage the grapes of wrath his epic novel about 
dust bowl okies and their migration to the promised land of 
california 
he loved the film version starring henry fonda which was 
written by nunnally johnson and directed by john ford all three of 
them his good friends but he didnt want to see the story as a 
play 
i think john wondered if it would be visual in a theater 
says elaine steinbeck the writers third wife and most ardent fan 
after he died in 1968 she continued to reject proposals for a 
play except for a local production at actors theater of louisville 
in the early 1980s 
but the minute steppenwolf asked me i said yes adds 
steinbecks widow referring to the chicago theater company that 
has made a name for itself all over the world with its highly 
kinetic freewheeling productions 
i knew their reputation and had seen orphans in london and 
balm in gilead in new york they were professional imaginative 
exciting and had sent their actors directors and plays out into 
the theatrical mainstream 
i also knew that the 50th anniversary of the publication of 
the grapes of wrath was going to come up last april the book 
was first published in april 1939 and i felt wouldnt that be a 
wonderful time for somebody to do the play 
the steppenwolf version adapted and directed by frank galati 
opened in chicago in september 1988 and was done later in la jolla 
calif and at the royal national theater in london now it has 
made the trek to broadway where it has found a house at the cort 
theater 
the book the story of the joad family and their journey 
westward during the great depression is known everywhere in the 
united states alone in every one of those 50 years from 1939 to 
1989 it has never sold fewer than 100000 copies it has been 
published in 40 languages 
whenever anybody would say whats your favorite novel john 
would say the one ive just finished but i think he had taste 
enough to know that the grapes of wrath was his big book says 
mrs steinbeck in a soft texas twang not erased by her more than 
50 years in new york 
mrs steinbeck one of broadways first female stage managers 
worked on such shows as the original oklahoma and othello 
with paul robeson she first met her future husband in 1949 when he 
was collaborating with elia kazan on the movie viva zapata and 
doing research for a novel that eventually became east of eden 
he was recently divorced and told me im very disillusioned 
and very unhappy he had two young boys and his wife divorced him 
and he said i dont want to ever love another woman or ever write 
another book well look what happened 
the couple was married in 1950 they kept homes in new york and 
in sag harbor on long island but traveled a lot particularly to 
london and italy they made up for the time he was too poor to 
travel 
i once asked him when f scott fitzgerald and ernest 
hemingway and all those other writers were going to paris why 
didnt you go he said i didnt have the price of a ticket but 
im glad i didnt because i stayed home and wrote about my own 
people 
fans of the film version of the grapes of wrath will find a 
different emphasis in the play one that is much truer to the book 
mrs steinbeck says 
the movie was a star vehicle for henry fonda who played tom 
joad it really ends when tom leaves she says 
in the book the central figure all the way through is ma 
joad they all leave her for one reason or another even tom and 
she says we are the people we must prevail we must go on i 
feel thats what frank galati was going for in the play 
john didnt write many womens parts as a matter of fact 
critics used to say steinbeck writes better men than women he 
would always look at me and say how about ma joad 
during their years together steinbeck would write every day in 
longhand usually after sharpening threedozen pencils his widow 
recalls that was stalling she says if he was working on a 
long book steinbeck would keep regular hours but he would start 
the morning writing letters 
john always said writing letters was like a pitcher warming 
up he would write letters before he would write his work or when 
we traveled he wrote travel pieces just things that interested 
him not things that would live forever he kept a journal for 
every book 
when she first met him one of the first things they did was to 
drive to salinas calif where he was born to see the little room 
on the top floor of the house where he first started writing i 
cant remember a time when i didnt write he told her as he 
showed her the building 
steinbeck did a lot of research on the grapes of wrath he 
wrote a series of pieces called the harvest gypsies for a 
nowdefunct san francisco newspaper and then realized it was a 
book not newspaper articles 
he loved to think of himself as a journalist mrs steinbeck 
says i dont think he was accurate enough to be a journalist he 
always embroidered a bit hed always throw a little bit extra in 
when john won the nobel prize he said i dont know whether 
i deserve it or not but i certainly am glad i got it she 
recalls 
i dont think that john ever got fancy when he became 
successful he didnt start writing a different kind of story he 
still wrote about the people he knew john cared about the people 
he talked the same way to great french writers at the academy 
francaise as he did to the fishermen at sag harbor he never talked 
down to anybody

nato members are responding to eastern 
europes political revolution by trimming their military budgets 
and turning away from expensive joint weapons programs 
defense minister guy coeme of belgium rang natos alarm bells 
recently by saying his country might withdraw its soldiers from 
west germany even before eastwest agreement on reducing 
conventional forces 
considering the startling changes in the sovietled warsaw pact 
he asked how can we justify the status quo on our side 
if west germany drops out of the european fighter aircraft 
project because of domestic opposition which is possible the 
program probably would be doomed 
juergen moellemann the west german education minister said the 
fighter will be the safest airplane in the history of the 
military because it will never fly and therefore will not crash 
relus ter beek defense minister of the netherlands said a 
reconsideration of the security situation in europe is now 
necessary 
there is a new feeling among western allies that they can pare 
their budgets drop out of cooperative programs and bring their 
soldiers home from west germany 
in all likelihood spending will wither on the vine as 
much as governments feel they dare said john cross deputy 
director of the international institute for strategic studies in 
london 
even the united states has abandoned big increases in spending 
pentagon officials now feel able to talk about shutting down 
military bases withdrawing soldiers from west germany and dropping 
weapons programs 
other members of the north atlantic treaty organization are 
eager to do the same but some caution against moving too quickly 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain says the soviet 
union will have vast military capabilities even after promised 
force reductions 
denmarks defense minister gen joergen lyng finds 
developments in eastern europe so fluid that the situation 
can change rapidly 
governments are under pressure to economize however and 
somnath sen of the stockholm international peace research institute 
estimates military spending by the 16 nato members will decline 27 
percent this year from about 450 billion he said it was off 11 
percent last year adjusted for inflation 
the united states which accounts for about twothirds of the 
total probably will reduce spending by 3 percent this year and 
european expenditures could decline slightly more than 2 percent 
sen said 
it will be difficult for defense ministers to ask for more 
in the new political climate sen predicted 
officials say few members will meet natos guideline of a 3 
percent growth in spending this year the target has been in effect 
since the 1970s and the alliances defense ministers probably will 
abolish it soon 
some countries may keep spending up because of regional 
problems greece and turkey for instance were enemies long before 
they were nato allies 
greece has exceeded the united states in the share of its 
economic output devoted to defense last year it spent 6 percent 
of its gross national product on the military the highest in nato 
and greater than the 55 percent spent by the americans according 
to alliance estimates 
turkey one of only two nato members bordering the soviet union 
also worries about neighbors syria iraq and iran its military 
now undergoing modernization gets about a onequarter of the 
budget 
norway the other nato nation with a soviet frontier has 
drafted plans to increase military expenditures by 25 percent this 
year 
analysts say west germany will be under great pressure to cut 
defense spending so its powerful economy can help east germany 
bonn talks of reducing its army from 480000 to 400000 in the 
1990s and has suspended a plan to increase the conscription term 
from 15 months to 18 
military hardware is a major target of budget cutters because of 
negotiations in vienna austria on reducing conventional forces in 
europe which are expected to produce an agreement this year 
countries will for the first time be looking at actually 
reducing the numbers of equipment they require its a new 
environment for force planners said simon lunn deputy 
secretarygeneral of the north atlantic assembly made up of 
legislators from nato nations 
arms negotiators for example want to limit each side to 20000 
main battle tanks long the dominant weapon in land combat 
for the thinnedout battlefield of the future governments 
may place more emphasis on sophisticated mobile weapons analysts 
say 
nato members have begun pulling out of costly joint arms 
programs set up years ago to produce modern weapons that could be 
shared 
today as defense budgets shrink we see cooperative programs 
running into severe difficulties william h taft iv the us 
ambassador to nato said in a recent speech 
a senior alliance official who agreed to discuss the situation 
only if granted anonymity said were in this indecisive period 
now where to rush in to create new programs is probably not 
wise thats why all these countries are sort of retrenching on 
the programs 
an eightnation plan to develop the warship of the 1990s has 
collapsed britain france and italy withdrew last fall followed 
in quick succession by west germany spain and the netherlands 
leaving only canada and the united states 
britain and the united states have turned their backs on plans 
to build a weapon that fighter planes could fire from a distance 
without flying over enemy territory france and canada got out 
earlier 
spain italy and west germany are considering whether to 
continue but one official said on condition of anonymity the 
investment for research and development would be so significant 
that its not likely they will have the strength to carry it 
themselves 
the united states dropped out of an eightnation program to 
develop special 155mm ammunition to seek out enemy armor a few 
years ago it persuaded west germany to stay in officials said 
interest also is waning in a project to develop a family of 
airtoair missiles of short and medium range west germany said 
last year it no longer would participate in building the 
shortrange version leaving britain canada and norway 
spain italy britain and west germany are in the european 
fighter aircraft project but continued german participation is in 
question 
another major expense is stationing soldiers in west germany 
the front line of the western alliance 
as part of a conventional arms treaty the soviet union and the 
united states plan to reduce their troop strength in central europe 
to 195000 soldiers each with the united states allowed 30000 
more on natos flanks 
that means the soviets would remove 370000 soldiers and the 
united states would withdraw 80000 
reductions in arms should allow other nato members to call home 
the soldiers who operate those weapons

officially its business as usual in britain 
behind the scenes defense is under review 
a new nuclear arsenal is being built on schedule defense 
spending is steady and prime minister margaret thatcher has not 
abandoned the idea that west germany should install new shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
she remains the most outspokenly hawkish of the nato leaders 
but official say she has quietly initiated a review of defense 
policy and spending 
in january mrs thatcher set up an informal group of four 
cabinet ministers including herself to consider the issue 
theres an acceptance there will be change said a senior 
government source who would talk about the matter only if not 
quoted by name but there is no sign of swift cuts and no talk of 
dismantling britains independent nuclear arsenal the source said 
britain reaffirmed in january it will replace its aging 
submarinebased nuclear missiles with a 10 billion us trident 
system as planned and military spending will remain at about 4 
percent of gross national product through 1992 
mrs thatcher is resisting pressure for disarmament following 
the collapse of communism in eastern europe 
we must keep up the level of our defenses both conventional 
and nuclear weapons and not make changes until they are agreed 
with nato and at the conventional forces in europe arms 
reduction talks in vienna austria she told parliament in february 
she was lukewarm about president bushs proposal jan 31 to 
reduce us and soviet forces in central europe to 195000 soldiers 
each 
opposition parties accuse her of trying to invent new threats or 
fretting about the resurgence of old ones like a united germany 
the british government alone of governments in nato and the 
warsaw pact seems actively to resent the challenge presented by 
the ending of the cold war said gerald kaufman foreign affairs 
spokesman for the opposition labor party 
most britons apparently share mrs thatchers caution about 
turning tanks into tractors before the changes in eastern europe 
are demonstrably here to stay 
a national opinion poll in january indicated 63 percent believed 
britain should not reduce military spending despite the changes in 
the soviet bloc and 76 percent felt britain should retain at least 
some nuclear weapons as long as the soviets do 
defense analysts foresee a cut of up to onethird in the 
155000member army including the phased withdrawal of many of the 
66700 british soldiers in west germany the largest foreign 
contingent after the americans 
the dismantling of most if not all of the british army of 
the rhine before the end of the decade now looks probable said

now that the merchant of venice has 
concluded a successful broadway run dustin hoffman has two 
priorities a rare family vacation and finding a bone marrow donor 
for a terminally ill student 
my wife told me a couple of weeks ago i havent taken a week 
off in five years im going to take three weeks off take a rest 
with my family said the twotime academy awardwinner 
then ill come back tenanciously and try to solve this 
this is a drive to locate a donor for leukemia victim 
allison atlas a 20yearold business major at new york university 
who was told in august she could expect to live six months unless 
she gets a marrow transplant 
hoffman 52 felt compelled to help after seeing atlas of 
bethesda md on television he donated a sixfigure sum and made 
public appeals for help in the past all of his humanitarian 
efforts have been done in private 
i became involved to get the public to know they can be 
donors the actor said in a recent interview 
were all inundated with monumental problems of the world 
people asking us to give to the disease of the week he said 
what makes this so special is here is someone whos saying if 
you give me the money i can find a donor and it can make the 
difference for me 
it picked me sometimes you see someone and you sense that 
shes the one person who would come to my aid if something happened 
to me hoffman said its the person whos the most giving the 
most generous the most courageous 
the merchant of venice concluded a prosperous 15week 
broadway run on march 10 after getting a twoweek extension the 
play was the hit of the london theater season during a 16week 
showing last summer with hoffman making his shakespearean and 
british stage debut in the role of shylock the vengeful jew who 
seeks his pound of flesh in return for an unpaid debt 
the role brought different reactions in the two countries 
new york is a different audience hoffman said in london 
youre playing on a turf where they grew up on shakespeare the way 
you grew up on video games 
they know how the merchant of venice ends here they dont 
they keep watching to see whats going to happen its a more vocal 
audience theyre probably closer to an elizabethan audience 
the actor wearing a doublebreasted navy sportscoat and an open 
collar shirt during a recent interview a few days before the final 
performance fidgeted with a grayflecked beard as he spoke the 
whiskers would be shaved within 10 minutes of the curtain 
hoffman said with a laugh 
hoffman winner of the 1979 academy award for best actor in 
kramer vs kramer repeated the feat last year in rain man 
for his sensitive portrayal of raymond babbitt an autistic savant 
institutionalized for social disorders but who was a whiz with 
mathmetics he was nominated for best actor four other times 
rain man won him personal and financial rewards but hoffman 
also relished the gratitude of those who work with austistic people 
sure you want to entertain people and be rich and famous but 
at the same time you want to alter perceptions or help them he 
said 
the most gratifying thing about rain man was the letters we 
got letters from parents of kids and heads of organizations and 
doctors who gave us awards and plaques for putting autism on the 
map it just took a lid off for some of these people he said 
in one case a man who saw the movie called his autistic brother 
just to see how he was doing nothing was more gratifying than 
that hoffman said 
the role of raymond babbitt evolved after hoffman studied 
several reallife cases of autism including joseph sullivan of 
huntingdon wva 
theres the role that youre given and the role you create 
that was one that was created it wasnt on the page midnight 
cowboy was written the thing with tootsie was a created role 
the graduate was written hoffman said 
i enjoy something working when we create it from the ground 
up sometimes a critic comes to you and says ah its easy to do 
that it looks easy but you got to create it 
it took a year to find a prototype that you would build all 
your stuff from then to get it past doctors and get the story in 
dramatic form without intruding on the illness how do you get 
sympathy for someone who doesnt want you around 
tom cruise who costarred with hoffman in rain man but was 
shut out in the oscars is nominated for best actor this year for 
born on the fourth of july the movies boxoffice appeal could 
give cruise a boost when the oscars are presented march 26 
its very hard to predict hoffman said the odds are 
probably pretty good in the sense that the more popular the picture 
the better the odds are that the academy members have seen it 
someone like daniel daylewis who was nominated for my left 
foot apparently has a much smaller audience

veterans of what they call the movement returned 
to selma ala last week on a journey that in some respects had 
the flavor of a religious pilgrimage for a reporter who covered 
bloody sunday and the selmatomontgomery march 25 years ago the 
memories came back with startling clarity 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the city just put up a new historical marker 
in a park alongside the edmund pettus bridge on the bloodred banks 
of the alabama river 
that must mean that it wont be long before what happened here 
25 years ago will seem as distant and unreal as all those other 
happenings duly noted in passing on fading historical markers 
across america snippets of history largely ignored this new one 
records bloody sunday and the selmatomontgomery march 
what happened here was the battle of selma no not the battle 
of selma when yankee troops sacked the town and burned its 
confederate arsenal that was in 1865 this battle of selma was in 
1965 and lasted 10 weeks 
what was sacked in 1965 was an arsenal of inequality a 
systematic scheme to deny black americans the right to vote to the 
victors the voting rights act of 1965 ranks with the emancipation 
proclamation on the scale of liberty 
veterans of that battle graying soldiers of what they still 
call reverently the movement returned last week from across the 
nation on a journey that in some respects had the flavor of a 
religious pilgrimage 
they came to march in procession and to sing old hymns and to 
embrace old friends and walk on old battlegrounds some hard to 
recognize now and they came to convince a new generation of 
blacks who take the ballot for granted that even after the 
selmatomontgomery march there remains a distance to travel 
we are a long way from having our fair share of the american 
pie economically and socially said john lewis a returning 
soldier from atlanta what better place to rededicate ourselves 
to all that is left to do 
a billy stick fractured lewis skull at the pettus bridge on 
bloody sunday now he is a congressman a symbol of both the event 
and its result 
what better place indeed 
selma did more for the nation than selma did for itself 
lewis said referring to a current local racial dispute 
selma then and now is a city of about 27000 people almost 
equally divided racially about 52 percent black the issue then 
was clearcut the right to vote the issue now is less so but it 
seems that even after 25 years when disputes get hot in selma the 
sides line up according to race often reluctantly on both sides 
the dispute today is over the dismissal of the first black 
school superintendent in alabama 
the school board that hired him made up of six whites and five 
blacks voted not to renew his threeyear contract the vote was 
six to five the lines were drawn and lawmen were called to keep 
order in the schools and at city hall 
selma 25 years ago became the national symbol of racial 
intolerance even its two fishing ponds side by side were 
racially segregated 
today selma of all places qualifies at first look as a model 
of racial harmony and integration blacks and whites work live 
shop and worship side by side yet the city remains as racially 
polarized as ever 
selma today is like a marigold lovely to behold but with a 
strange odor when you get up close 
lewis spoke on march 4 at the brown chapel ame church the 
movements foremost shrine it was built by former slaves and sons 
of slaves and looks much as it did 25 years ago with its twin red 
towers and worn oak pews although two chinaberry trees that gave 
shade outside are gone inside its sweet musty smell of 
deliverance remains 
for those 10 weeks in 1965 that venerable sanctuary throbbed 
with hymns of hope and courage and the movements anthem we 
shall overcome and trembled to the oratory of martin luther king 
jr whom many white selmans back then called derisively de 
lawd 
not long ago joe smitherman who was selmas mayor in 1965 and 
remains so today said from the pulpit of brown chapel my hands 
are as dirty as the others i ordered the arrest of dr king we 
were wrong i did it im sorry 
bloody sunday was march 7 a dour and chilly day about 600 
blacks left brown chapel and crossed the pettus bridge they aimed 
to march to montgomery the state capital 54 miles away to 
petition gov george wallace in person for the right to vote 
wallace forbade the march 
the hymn they sang at brown chapel that morning was nobody 
knows the trouble ive seen 
and nobody had nobody could have forseen the orgy of official 
violence that turned back the marchers state troopers with clubs 
and tear gas and deputies on horseback with bullwhips

americans by the hundreds black and white came to selma in 
outrage 
for two weeks they camped outside brown chapel beneath the 
chinaberry trees and on the dirt road in front sylvan street a 
thick rope confined them to that street in selma 
today sylvan street has been renamed it is now martin luther 
king jr street its the longest street sign in town said 
smitherman grandly the street is now paved and lit as are all 
the streets in east selma now and there are no more outhouses in 
the neighborhood which were commonplace 
in front of brown chapel where the chinaberry trees used to be 
a bronze bust of king rests on a tall granite monument 
so much of the selma of 65 is gone largely unmourned 
a car dealership has replaced the silver moon cafe there on 
the sidewalk out front one of those white sympathizers who came to 
selma james reeb a minister from boston was bludgeoned to death 
two days after bloody sunday the night he lay dying a throng kept 
candlelight vigil on sylvan street all night behind the rope in 
the rain 
the whitesonly selma del eatery on broad street the main drag 
is gone in its place stands are you ready the booker t 
washington insurance co 
camp selma is gone too it was once an old chaingang camp long 
abandoned and then revived in 1965 sheriff jim clark whose lapel 
button said never arrested blacks by the hundreds when they 
lined up in front of the courthouse to register to vote camp selma 
was where he imprisoned them 
camp selma also accommodated the 3000 army regulars alabama 
national guardsmen and federal marshals sent to protect the 
ultimate march the victory march from selma to montgomery on march 
2125 
the night before the march 4000 people the potential marchers 
themselves slept wherever they could find a place some on church 
pews some on couches in the housing project across from brown 
chapel some on the sylvan street dirt rolled in blankets in a cold 
wind under a waning threequarter moon 
next morning the first day of spring they met at brown chapel 
prayed sang and gathered at the river at the pettus bridge and 
began a journey that seemed somehow biblical after all that had 
gone before 
even the old highway the route of the march is not as it was 
it was called then the jefferson davis highway a twolane road 
most of the way to montgomery so the marchers numbers were 
reduced by court decree to 300 when they reached the twolane 
stretch in lowndes county the rest hoofed it back to selma or 
hitched rides with volunteer drivers in hired cars and buses 
today the jefferson davis highway is simply highway 80 a 
divided fourlane motorway the sharecropper shacks have vanished 
if the reenactors of the march sipped no well water they at least 
were cheered by meadowlarks and mockingbirds which still abound 
along the way 
when the 1965 march reached the outskirts of montgomery its 
numbers again swelled to 4000 then to 10000 to 20000 and on 
the next afternoon to at least 25000 
they marched past a street now but not then named rosa parks 
avenue named for the black woman who refused to move to the back 
of a montgomery bus 
they marched up dexter avenue past the church where martin 
luther king jr was pastor the man who agreed reluctantly to take 
up mrs parks cause to eventually become the charismatic head of 
what became the movement 
and on they marched to the steps of the building where jefferson 
davis took the oath of office as president of the confederacy and 
where on that day king exhorted the great congregation of 
pilgrims in his measured cadences to keep on keep on 
how long not long because truth pressed to earth shall rise 
again 
that night the worst happened after the protecting federal army 
had departed ku klux klan nightriders shot viola liuzzo of 
detroit white one of the volunteer shuttle drivers shot her dead 
in her car in the big swamp area of lowndes county she was the 
movements 11th martyr 
no historical marker commemorates the spot where she died but 
somebody nobody seems to know who sees to a floral wreath nearby 
hanging on a fence 
it is there today

edith stricoff once loved to dance and to 
travel but now cannot even brush her teeth on her own 
her husband bernard cleans house cooks does laundry bathes 
his wife and helps her use a commode in a corner of the living 
room where a hospital bed contrasts with colorful peruvian 
weavings from a vacation a dozen years ago 
stricoff 65 said he cares for his 64yearold wife up to 20 
hours a day on call even through the night when a groan from 
downstairs will rouse him to see if shes cold or her arm is stuck 
under her body for four hours a day he has hired help 
people sometimes suggest a nursing home they say edith 
stricoff former bookkeeper and mother of three is a burden at her 
advanced stage of alzheimers disease 
but stricoff hums old songs the couple once danced to and 
sometimes thinks she murmurs his name as he hugs her in the morning 
you dont throw an injured child out of the house because the 
child is injured he said why should i do that to my wife 
a growing number of men are caring for aging and infirm wives 
parents and other relatives according to a study by lenard w kaye 
and jeffrey s applegate professors at the graduate school of 
social work and social research at bryn mawr college in suburban 
philadelphia 
mens roles as caregivers have traditionally been minimized 
if not virtually dismissed by the professional and lay public 
alike they write in their study 
although women comprise twothirds to threefourths of an 
estimated 7 million caregivers nationwide a significant number of 
men have been willing to commit a substantial portion of their 
lives both in time and effort to this challenging task the 
researchers said 
more men are doing so largely because women are stretched to the 
limit by careers other family demands and the rising number of 
elderly the researchers say other factors include mens changing 
attitudes toward family and cuts in governmental aid for elder 
care they say 
kaye said in an interview the study was intended to address the 
special needs of male caregivers 
in no way are we trying to cancel out the dominant role no 
question its a dominant role played by women he said we 
just believe that they cannot keep up at this rate we need to be 
able to turn and be willing to consider alternative routes to take 
when we talk about family caregiving 
the study is based on surveys of 152 leaders of caregiver 
support groups and 148 male participants in such groups across the 
nation the research supported by a grant from the andrus 
foundation of the american association of retired persons also 
included indepth interviews with 30 male caregivers and nine 
elderly recipients in the philadelphia region and surveys of a 
26member national expert panel 
seven of eight men in the study considered themselves primary 
caregivers and more than a third were sole care providers only 20 
percent said they were helped by more than two relatives four of 
five cared for people with alzheimers the progressive brain 
disorder that causes premature senility 
the men often continued to work while providing care and 
resisted joining support groups preferring to go it alone or 
fearing participation would be an admission of failure 
in general the men felt most competent at such tasks as paying 
bills taking people to doctors and helping with telephoning and 
letterwriting they felt least competent at helping with grooming 
bathing and dressing 
the study is limited by its size and by the fact that caregivers 
surveyed were primarily white married men over age 60 living with 
and caring for wives and relatively secure financially minority 
and lowincome men tend less than white middleclass men to join 
the support groups from which the sample was drawn kaye said 
eloise rathbonemccuan professor of social welfare at the 
university of kansas said she had not seen any evidence of an 
increasing number of men providing elder care but she agreed that 
the demographics of women and aging will force men to be 
confronted with many new roles especially caregiving 
robyn stone a research fellow at the us department of health 
and human services agency for health care policy and research 
said the study could help draw more attention to caregiving in 
general which has often been viewed as a womens issue from a 
political perspective since its still primarily a mans world 
there may be more of a serious focus on this problem she said 
kaye and applegate said their results indicate support groups 
should reach out more to men who otherwise may end up enduring too 
much of the burden and allowing their own health to deteriorate 
advertisements for support groups should include more men and 
emphasize such practical topics as legal issues finding home 
health care stages of alzheimers disease and information on 
government benefits they said 
men are probably going to hesitate getting involved in a group 
if you play up too strongly the emotional payoff the benefits of 
sharing experiences kaye said 
stricoff who prided himself on being able to work things out 
himself as his wife grew more ill resisted joining a support group 
sponsored by the alzheimers disease and related disorders 
association at thomas jefferson university hospital 
i said why do i have to go to a group for sit there and 
listen to them what are they going to tell me im living with the 
damn thing i know what it is stricoff said 
but his children and other relatives kept after him and i 
went and surprisingly enough it was fulfilling he said 
now he tries not to miss monthly meetings because of the tips 
he picks up on ways to help his wife and the moral support 
its not that misery likes company he said thats just 
not the story it makes you talk about things that you dont 
usually talk about 
stricoff said he provides most of his wifes care and does most 
of the household tasks by himself although the couples children 
who are grown and live in the philadelphia suburbs and florida 
call regularly and help on weekends 
a woman employed by a home healthcare firm also comes in four 
hours a day to give stricoff a break and allow him to maintain his 
accounts as a hosiery salesman for a dallas company 
some friends also have stayed close 
the support makes it easier to bear his wifes helplessness 
he must stroke her cheeks to get her to chew and cleans her 
daily with a washcloth from head to toe but when people ask him 
why he doesnt complain he asks what there is to complain about 
youve got to remember how my wife would have reacted had i 
been in that situation he said i honestly feel she would 
probably do as much as she physically can for me which is what im 
doing for my wife i do it because of my love for her

medicares catastrophic healthcare program is 
history but its legacy lingers in this years tax forms 
congress didnt kill the yearold medical program until after 
the internal revenue service had sent the 1989 tax returns to the 
printer so forms 1040 and 1040a contain instructions for payment 
of a seniorsonly catastrophic surtax that doesnt exist 
the catastrophic question is a oneyear quirk in the income tax 
picture that bodes well for senior citizens but several other 
continuing provisions in federal law also help to make tax time a 
little less taxing for the elderly 
these provisions which include a higher standard deduction and 
more liberal filing requirements for the elderly mean many people 
must reacquaint themselves with the tax code when they turn 65 
even if theyve been doing their own taxes for decades 
many older taxpayers are unfamiliar with the special 
provisions of the internal revenue code which become available to 
them when they reach age 65 the house aging committee said in 
its annual tax guide for older americans 
in addition to benefits that automatically become available at 
age 65 other changes in the taxfiling routine occur as older 
americans mrity benefits and rules for pension and annuity income 
the irs also offers free taxpreparation help to the elderly 
through two programs volunteer income tax assistance and tax 
counseling for the elderly people can call the taxpayer service 
number listed in their tax package or in the telephone book to find 
out where to get assistance 
volunteers in both programs can help people prepare simple tax 
forms although the latter is specifically targeted toward the 
needs of the elderly tax counseling for the elderly is jointly 
sponsored by the irs and the american association of retired 
persons which provides 30000 trained counselors to assist more 
than 15 million older taxpayers a year with federal and state tax 
forms 
the program also serves more than 47000 shutins who cannot 
visit tax assistance sites 
we find a lot of people who are intimidated by the form 
itself said aarps patty hoath we also find people who 
perhaps have not been in a situation to do the tax form in the 
past such as someone who is newly widowed 
others need help dealing with tax issues they havent faced in 
the past such as taxation of social security benefits or 
interpretation of pension benefit statements ms hoath said 
the irs has notified senior citizens that because the 
catastrophic surtax was repealed they should ignore line 54 on 
form 1040 and line 23 on form 1040a anyone who made extra 
estimated tax payments during 1989 to cover the catastrophic surtax 
will receive a refund of their overpayments 
we have tried to get the word out that even though the line 
appears on the tax form the provision no longer exists said irs 
spokesman steve pyrek some people no matter what will include 
information on that line of the return 
the repeal of the supplemental medicare premium affects about 40 
percent of the elderly who would have paid 2250 for every 150 
of federal income tax liability about 6 percent would have paid 
the maximum amount of 800 per person 
congress repealed the catastrophic program in november under 
pressure from higherincome senior citizens many of whom already 
had duplicate private coverage and who said the expanded government 
medical benefits werent worth the price tag

as the american population ages amid a 
mini baby boom an increasing number of parents must care for 
grandmother as well as bring up baby and juggle fulltime jobs 
to help families caught in that triple bind stride rite corp 
has opened what company officials say is the nations only 
intergenerational day care center 
karen leibold director of the center at the companys 
headquarters hopes it will become the kind of place where working 
parents can drop off their children and elderly relatives in the 
morning and know they will have been fed entertained educated and 
cared for when they pick them up in the evening 
the fourth floor of the shoemanufacturing company has been 
remodeled to accommodate up to 55 children and 24 older people the 
program is open both to the 500 stride rite employees in cambridge 
and community residents 
the weekly fee for elderly care is 140 child care fees range 
from 130 to 170 a week 
on a recent visit to the center 4yearolds were being dressed 
for a winter walk toddlers were puzzling over a talking toy and a 
group of very excited youngsters was getting a cooking lesson 
were making play dough one cried out 
at the other end of the floor in a sunny room affectionately 
dubbed the library a grandmother was relaxing on a couch and 
talking with a staff member its nice in here she said 
glancing around the room that will eventually have additional 
ottomans and livingroom lamps its comfortable 
stride rite was already a corporate pioneer in providing day 
care for its employees when a newspaper article on the dilemma of 
families caught between caring for elderly relatives and children 
caught the attention of chairman arnold hyatt about three years ago 
he immediately wrote a memo to the director of the companys day 
care program saying the company should create a program for the old 
as well as the young 
a survey of stride rite employees found about 25 percent were 
caring for an elderly relative and an additional 13 percent 
expected to do so in the future leibold said these figures 
mirrored national trends 
she said the study also indicated that a daughter track 
existed as well as the mommy track mommy track refers to the 
course many females take when they juggle jobs and child care 
leibold said national council on aging studies found that most care 
givers for the elderly are women who then may be forced to limit 
the time devoted to a career 
the result of the survey and hyatts memo was a 700000 
investment by stride rite in designing 8500 square feet of space 
into groups of rooms for children and the elderly with 
administrative offices and dining facilities in between 
painted in purple teal and apricot the center is designed to 
create a feeling of comfort and cheer to look like grandmothers 
front porch rather than an institution or even a corporate 
office stride rite spokeswoman deborah singer said 
at one end of the floor is an area set aside for the elderly it 
includes an arts and crafts area and the library designed to 
look like someones living room leibold said 
the other end of the floor has classrooms for ages 2 through 5 
all furnished with miniature furniture splotchy watercolors and a 
scattering of dolls and wooden blocks 
the dining area shared by both groups has adultsize tables 
and chairs and childsize tables and chairs a long counter 
featuring a sink a hot pad and adjustable chairs will provide 
facilities for the adults to cook and the children to learn to cook 
what weve done is encourage interaction between children and 
the elderly and ensure the privacy of each group leibold said 
from 730 am to 530 pm both groups have supervised 
activities meals crafts and exercise programs sometimes 
together leibold hopes this will help to get rid of stereotypes 
that old people and young people have about each other 
the program is designed for elderly who do not need extensive 
medical attention but require general supervision for daily 
activities only two are currently at the center and leibold said 
the company is working to inform employees and the community of the 
elderly program 
stride rite was one of the first companies to open its own day 
care center in 1971 and leibold hopes the intergenerational 
center will be a model for other such centers 
singer said the facility hopes to provide its elderly with 
meaningful activities a computer will be installed and singer 
hopes that one day the seniors could produce a newsletter for the 
center the company is working with wheelock college and the 
somervillecambridge elder services organization to develop elderly 
programs 
families are very stressed today leibold said fewer and 
fewer families are living within close contact with each other 
the new center will help bring the generations together she 
said

the figures on his order pad are 
harder to make out these days his hearing aids can turn 
conversations into shouting matches and he doesnt go anywhere 
without a cane 
but at 90 charlie tucker is still doing what he does best 
peddling mops and dusters can openers and furniture polish just 
about anything you might need 
and if he doesnt get around quite as good as he used to he 
still knows how to move fuller brushes 
your wife might be able to use this he says opening a box 
in his dining room and pulling out a mop head that looks kind of 
like raggedy ann as a blonde 
its regularly 5 but weve got it on special for just 399 
oh youre not married tucker hardly misses a beat well how 
about your mom 
tucker has been selling household products for fuller brush for 
59 years and if you live in this part of the country hes 
probably tried to entice you with a free spatula or vegetable brush 
i just love sales work i reckon says tucker a tidy 
compact man whose perfect white hair may be a byproduct of decades 
of making a good first impression 
mrs eugene collins 61 of chattanooga has known tucker since 
she was a teenager and figures shes probably bought about every 
product fuller has ever made 
im still using them i love them and i think mr tucker has 
been a part of that because he is so knowledgeable and tells you 
how to do it and how to use them 
tucker got his start at age 12 selling dynamite and doing odd 
jobs at a company store in the virginia coal fields after world 
war i he hawked newspapers on trains then worked as a buyer of 
piece goods and womens readytowear garments 
but in 1931 his employer went out of business and tucker found 
himself in the great depression with a wife and children but no job 
so he answered an ad for fuller brush and went to work in 
elizabethton selling 150 worth of goods his first week within a 
few weeks that was his daily total earning him the 
congratulations of company founder alfred c fuller and a promotion 
to branch manager in memphis 
he took a similar job in chattanooga in 1934 managing as many 
as 35 salesmen until fuller brush was sold in the 1960s to 
consolidated foods inc of chicago 
the new owners decided to eliminate the district offices and 
tucker decided to return to the sidewalks 
i was back where i started he said i was too old to go 
out and hunt a new job but i figured i could sell fuller brushes 
over the last 20 years tucker has been a familiar figure on 
chattanooga streets often using a mop handle to prop open the 
trunk of his portable warehouse a 1968 plymouth fury 
hes found himself thrust into roles of marriage counselor and 
baby sitter and hes had a door slammed in his face so hard the 
glass shattered 
ive been insulted and everything else but i put my high 
feelings in the closet and lock the door because i would have had 
them hurt if id taken everything seriously he said 
but tucker took his coworkers seriously 
jim clayton 72 worked for fuller brush for 47 years one day 
he said he and tucker were in dayton tenn and tucker told him 
to go to bryan college saying the maintenance department probably 
needed a dozen brooms 
well i walked to the boiler room and the guy said hello 
and i said im the fuller brush man and he said bring me a 
dozen brooms now if id been charlie tucker id have said you 
catch these customers down here and ill go tend to that college 
no use kidding myself but thats just the kind of guy charlie 
tucker always was 
when tucker went to work in 1931 the company offered about a 
dozen items now there are 400 products and 13000 sales 
representatives all of whom still work strictly on commission 
its the kind of challenge tucker likes 
were selling one day and im on this porch and hes on the 
porch next door clayton said and this lady comes to the door 
and she dont want to buy and he said well i understand but 
when you see your neighbors using our specials i want to remember 
you had a chance to turn it down ill just step in and show it to 
you and he stepped in and then stepped out in about three minutes 
with a nice order 
ive never yet found a door that id hesitate to knock on 
whether its the governors or whoevers tucker said with a 
grin im no highpressure salesman but maybe ill try to create 
a desire sufficient to overcome your resistance 
these days tucker relies mostly on telephone sales by his wife 
neoma and on repeat customers who pick up their goods at his home 
in north chattanooga 
he hasnt driven since last summer when he underwent 
complicated heart and kidney surgery but after nearly 60 years 
its hard to kick the habit 
hes feeling better and his eyes light up at the mention of 
spring 
if i get anywhere back to normal ill be back knocking on 
doors

researchers will try to determine if 
laughter really is the best medicine by showing comic films to 
about 150 nursing home residents in the carolinas 
the study will use films such as those by the marx brothers and 
wc fields to see whether humor reduces requests for 
nonprescription pain medication said fran mcguire head of the 
project 
if this kind of thing is true it would be a tremendous tool 
for activity directors in nursing homes and other group settings 
mcguire said 
a smallscale film study by the department two years ago found 
what appeared to be dramatic decreases in requests for pain 
medication he said that could have been the result of chemical 
changes in the body relieving pain or the result of reduced stress 
which would reduce pain 
however mcguire said that study was so limited that no 
conclusive findings could be documented the new study will attempt 
to broaden the scope and come up with findings that could be used 
by nursing homes to improve their residents quality of life he 
said 
in addition to the quantitative measure of pain medication the 
study also will try to measure the residents happiness through a 
written test 
in addition to classic comic movdistribution of a 
deceased persons property according to a report by a senior 
citizens group 
probate also called estate administration is the process by 
which the debts of someone who has died are paid and the deceaseds 
remaining property is distributed to the rightful owners 
the american association of retired persons said its study of 
900 probate cases in california delaware and wisconsin found that 
attorney fees sometimes exceeded 20 percent of the value of the 
property and some estates took more than a year to settle cases in 
which the deceased person had a will sometimes took just as long to 
settle as those without a will it said 
with redundant reporting and notice requirements and flexible 
deadlines that are often unenforced or ignored probate 
frequently lasts more than a year the report said 
it said the three states where cases were studied were 
indicative of problems across the country and it estimated probate 
fees could cost 2 billion or more each year nationally 
for the estates of the middle class attorney and personal 
representative fees can deplete the assets by as much as 10 percent 
even in uncomplicated cases the report said 
aarp recommended that states adopt simple less costly probate 
procedures 
probate as generally practiced in the united states is an 
anachronism the report said probates procedures and 
protections even with recent reforms are inappropriate for all 
but the most exceptional cases 
horace deets aarps executive director said probate is largely 
an olders persons issue 
many of these older consumers who want to leave their property 
with their loved ones have no idea how legal fees can affect their 
intended gifts deets said

estate planning and postmortem planning make most 
people squirm 
many of us avoid making a will or setting a plan for disposition 
of assets upon our death for two simple reasons we are uneasy with 
the thought that we will die and we feel that our estates are too 
small to justify the time and expense involved in preparing a will 
regardless of the size of your estate or your philosophy on 
death estate planning and postmortem planning involve everything 
you have worked for during your life and ensure that your wishes 
will be followed should you become incapacitated or die 
there are five important reasons for making a will you can 
choose your donees minimize taxes appoint a guardian name an 
executor and establish a domicile 
in the absence of a will up to half a married persons property 
usually will be distributed to the surviving spouse with the 
remainder passing to the deceaseds children only if the deceased 
had adopted the spouses children from a previous marriage would 
those children be included in the distribution of property 
even though this distribution of property may not be consistent 
with your wishes you have no recourse by failing to prepare a 
will you have abdicated the right to select your beneficiaries 
and what and how much each beneficiary is to receive 
a properly prepared will can help to alleviate any tax liability 
that might be levied against your estate taxable estates valued at 
less than 600000 are exempt from federal estate tax but hidden 
resources life insurance policies naming the decedent as the 
insured or qualified retirement plan benefits and iras can swell 
the estates value oftentimes making it subject to federal estate 
taxation trusts and other techniques available through your will 
can lessen this tax burden 
if you have children perhaps your greatest concern is who would 
take care of them if both you and your spouse died a will can be 
used to name a guardian courts generally will accommodate the 
wishes of the parents in cases where a guardian is named 
without a will you have no say in who carries out the 
administration of your estate if no will exists the court will 
appoint an administrator and the court could appoint a creditor 
they sometimes qualify for this position which would not 
necessarily be in the best interests of your estate by naming an 
executor you can ensure that a trustworthy person of your choosing 
will handle the administration of your estate 
finally for tax and other reasons you may want to establish a 
particular state as your state of domicile or legal residence for 
example if you have moved frequently or have homes in more than 
one state each state could claim you as a resident and subject the 
estate to multiple probate proceedings and overlapping claims to 
state death or inheritance taxes to minimize that risk indicate 
clearly in your will which state you claim as domicile 
experts agree that many people fail to recognize the importance 
of a will a person who dies intestate without a will can 
leave many problems for loved ones and greatly reduce the chances 
that undocumented intentions will be carried out the solution for 
everyone no matter the size of the estate is to have a will 
prepared now and alleviate some of the uncertainties and problems 
that could arise later

american express co said it would buy all the 
common stock in shearson lehman hutton inc that it doesnt already 
own and had ended talks with third parties about possible changes 
in ownership of the troubled brokerage 
the move culminates months of effort by american express to 
shore up shearsons finances and indicates the travel and financial 
services company has abandoned hopes of reducing its exposure to 
the volatile securities industry 
these actions affirm american expresss longterm commitment 
to shearson lehman hutton and its customers and to working with 
its management team james d robinson iii chairman and chief 
executive of american express said in a statement sunday 
american express will buy out the minority stake in shearson 
through a stock swap valued at 350 million shearson spokesman 
lawrence armour said that brings the total amount american express 
has invested in shearson in recent months to well over 1 billion 
shearson expanded rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s to 
become the nations secondlargest brokerage but its recent 
struggles to cope with a downturn in the securities business have 
led to thousands of layoffs and turmoil in its management ranks 
american expreses first moved to strengthen its grip last month 
by ousting chairman and chief executive peter a cohen the man who 
guided the firms explosive growth and replacing him with howard 
l clark jr american express chief financial officer 
as a result of a review led by clark we are confident that 
shearson lehman hutton can be returned to levels of profitability 
that will maintain its position as a premier company in the 
securities industry robinson said 
in the same statement clark said this vote of confidence from 
american express gives us the support we will need to implement the 
findings of our strategic review and achieve successful performance 
levels as a leader in the securities industry 
shearson has been searching for capital to avoid a threatened 
downgrading of its credit rating which could increase its costs by 
forcing it to pay higher interest rates on its borrowings 
at the same time american express had been seeking to reduce 
its 61 percent stake in shearson to less than half to remove the 
firm from its balance sheet and reduce its exposure to wall 
streets sharp profit swings a sharp drop in shearsons share 
price forced it to abandon that plan though 
last week american express said it would increase its ownership 
by an unspecified amount by injecting 750 million into the 
brokerage in december american express injected 250 million into 
shearson 
american express had held talks recently about a possible merger 
of shearson with primerica corps smith barney harris upham amp co 
brokerage unit but the company said last week it had terminated 
discussions 
american express may have decided to buy out minority 
stockholders now because clarks appointment has given the company 
control of shearsons management said perrin long who follows the 
securities industry for lipper analytical services 
this is the first time american express has been in the 
catbird seat since it acquired shearson back in 1981 he said 
as part of a taxfree merger of one of its subsidiaries with 
shearson american express plans to exchange 0426 of its common 
shares for each outstanding common share in shearson based on 
fridays closing prices of 2937 for american express and 1250 
for shearson the swap values the minority stake at 350 million 
they probably think this is a reasonable time to go in and buy 
the stock back because of the recent drop in shearsons share 
price long said 
american express also said it was considering adding to its own 
equity capital through either a public or private offering of 
stock no decisions have been made yet about the timing or size of 
any offering said armour the spokesman 
the latest move should help shearson by removing the uncertainty 
that has dogged the firm since american express first said it 
intended to reduce its stake long said 
i think it would be a healthy thing because once you stop the 
talk everybody can get down to business he said 
sundays announcement doesnt affect nippon life insurance cos 
holding of 13 million shares of convertible voting preferred stock 
which gives it a voting stake of about 13 percent in shearson 
like other wall street houses shearson has been beset by a 
downturn in merger activity securities underwriting and sluggish 
stock and bond trading since the october 1987 stock market crash 
shearson announced last week it would lay off 2000 workers to 
reduce its costs by about 400 million a year and it left open the 
prospect of still more job cuts the brokerage dropped 800 workers 
late last year 
the announced layoffs would reduce shearsons work force to 
33500 from a peak of 46000 in january 1988 
shearson reported 1989 earnings of 110 million up from 96 
million a year earlier but a third of the profits came from the 
sale of a money management unit investment banking revenue which 
includes merger advising and securities underwriting was down 27 
percent

an international panel is to decide in april whether an american 
law banning the import of undersized lobsters violates the free 
trade agreement between the united states and canada 
the panel which was scheduled to hear arguments on the dispute 
today is to recommend a resolution in midmay that could range 
from leaving the law as it is to banning it altogether the board 
of three americans and two canadians could also call for a 
compromise 
lobster fishing is the backbone of hundreds of coastal 
communities in canada millions and millions of dollars in lost 
income are at stake said john kearney who represents the 
maritime fishermens union in nova scotia 
bob brown director of the maine importexport lobster dealers 
association said the dispute is on everybodys lips on both 
sides of the border 
at issue is a bill that president bush signed into law in 
december prohibiting the importation or interstate transportation 
of lobsters that do not meet federal minimumsize standards 
lobsters that are shorter than 3 inches from the eye socket to 
where the tail begins are illegal under the new law by 1992 the 
minimum legal size will be 3 516 inches 
but in canada lobster fishermen can catch lobsters 116th of an 
inch shorter than those allowed in the united states 
lobstermen dealers and industry observers throughout new 
england and the canadian maritime provinces say the panels 
decision could have a major impact on the industry 
it could change the way lobsters are marketed and more 
significantly might change the way the government regulates lobster 
management said university of southern maine professor charles 
colgan a former state economist 
canadian officials argue that the law is purely a trade barrier 
that violates the uscanada free trade agreement they say their 
country has plenty of conservation laws and the united states has 
no right to tell them how to manage their resources 
american lobstermen have complained to congress that they could 
not compete against the smaller less expensive canadian lobsters 
which were being shipped to american markets the new law barring 
the smaller lobsters could mean a potential loss to canada of 20 
million to 30 million in exports each year 
american officials maintain that the law will protect the 
lobster population by allowing more lobsters to live long enough to 
reproduce 
the new law as written will help american dealers protect their 
domestic markets but it also could lead to the loss of foreign 
markets industry sources say 
maine dealers previously could buy smaller lobsters from canada 
and pack them for shipment to outofstate markets the new law 
prohibits that practice and maine and new england exporters are 
making changes to adapt to the law 
the board hearing the dispute could call for a compromise that 
would allow imports only to american export companies or only 
during certain times of the year or to place quotas on undersize 
lobster imports 
the panels decision would not be binding but both countries 
are obligated to honor it under provisions of the free trade 
agreement 
it is only the second time since the free trade agreement was 
enacted on jan 1 1989 that a panel has convened to resolve a 
trade dispute

were here to show the public that were still on strike and 
well stay on strike for dignity in the workplace said leroy 
washington general chairman of the machinists union and to 
tell people not to fly eastern and continental 
the demonstration in new york coincided with others in other 
cities on sunday 
it hasnt been the kind of strike we wanted washington 
added but today we celebrate the solidarity of the eastern 
strikers were not going to give up 
eight thousand members of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers struck over a new contract on 
march 4 1989 texas air wanted the union to take a pay cut change 
workplace rules and allow some work to be contracted out

of the industry is doing well he said so theres still a 
possibility of getting our jobs back we feel its salvageable 
gov mario cuomo was invited to the rally robert gollnick 
state deputy labor commissioner came in his place 
the governors commitment to these people is still strong

expressed frustration and anger towards lorenzo president of texas 
air the parent company of eastern and continental airlines 
there are no kind words for him said washington the 
injustice at eastern airlines was created by lorenzo hundreds of 
hardworking men and women have lost their homes and their 
standards of living because of this man

yearold dispute and show support for union members in the united

kismet

channel one a news show with advertisements 
aimed at teenagers made its national debut in an estimated 14000 
classrooms today with paid pitches for two kinds of snack foods and 
a razor 
the show was airing in about 400 schools across the country the 
producers said even as critics continued to argue that its daily 
regimen of commercials is out of place in the classroom 
the advertisers on the first day of the program were mampms candy 
from mampm mars cheetos snacks from fritolay inc and the sensor 
razor from gillette co 
the program which lasts 12 minutes with two minutes allocated 
for advertising also included an antidrug public service 
commercial 
the show is the most ambitious and controversial project yet 
from whittle communications a knoxville tennbased company 
headed by chairman christopher whittle that creates magazines and 
other media used by advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences 
a typical show begins with two young anchors giving the top 
stories of the day followed by a chapter in a fivepart series 
each week a pop quiz and some interesting facts and a closing 
story 
the first weeks featured series deals with the fall of the 
berlin wall and how events in eastern europe have affected teens 
there 
architects of the channel one program say it should produce 
handsome educational dividends for students and educators as well 
as potentially lucrative financial rewards for the company 
producing it 
but critics say the commercials represent an unwarranted 
intrusion on a captive audience of students who are required by law 
to be in school 
officials in the states of new york and california have 
prohibited public schools in those states from carrying the program 
because of the commercials a state board of education ban on 
channel one in north carolina was overturned friday by a state 
court judge freeing schools there to use the system 
several national education groups are opposing channel one and 
are backing use of a daily commercialfree news show for teens that 
the cable giant turner broadcasting system inc began running last 
august on its cable news network 
but whittle said commercials are an essential element of the 
channel one system because revenue from the 150000 charge for 
each 30second ad pays for the 150 million in video equipment 
loaned to schools that show the program and the 90 million in 
operational expenses needed to produce it 
whittle said his surveys show few if any students are getting a 
chance to watch the turner adfree news program in school because 
there are few tv sets available in most schools 
ed winter the executive overseeing the channel one project 
said more than 2700 schools in 34 states have signed threeyear

the number of working us oil and gas rigs

it was hardly a typical deal for frank lorenzo 
head of an airline empire takeover strategist and consummate 
dealmaker 
this time the wily chairman of texas air corp got burned 
his adversary wasnt the head of a rival airline or one of his 
texas air subordinates or even a union leader it was david i 
shapiro the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner for eastern 
airlines a texas air subsidiary 
lorenzo and his associates believed they had a deal with shapiro 
on eastern and that the washington attorney sandbagged them 
according to sources close to the negotiations who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the dispute wasnt over prices to be paid for assets labor 
concessions or airline routes it was over words powerful words in 
a report by shapiro that claimed texas air had shortchanged 
eastern when it bought the airline and some of its assets 
shapiro had been directed to supervise an investigation of 
eastern and its dealings with texas air and sister carrier 
continental airlines as part of easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceeding which started last march after pilots flight 
attendants and machinists struck the miamibased airline 
his report filed last thursday in federal bankruptcy court 
concluded that texas air purchased eastern assets at unfairly low 
prices and owed the carrier 285 million to 403 million 
texas air and eastern publicly called his report replete with 
faulty analyses hearsay evidence statements taken out of context 
and misstatements of fact the companies threatened last friday 
to take serious and considered actions to clear their names 
texas air spokesman art kent wouldnt say what form those 
actions might take and declined further comment 
shapiro declined comment today when reached at his law firm in 
washington dc 
there is sufficient evidence to warrant the bringing of 
charges that 12 transactions provided eastern with less than fair 
consideration or reasonably equivalent value the report said 
the court could therefore appropriately authorize litigation 
of these 12 claims 
charges litigation those were words lorenzo and his team 
werent expecting to see in the report according to the sources 
houstonbased texas air had agreed earlier with shapiro to pay 
eastern more than 280 million as a settlement on the condition 
sources said that the report not assign any liability to texas air 
texas air admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and said it 
agreed to make the payment to eastern only to bolster the airline 
although shapiros report said there were grounds for 
litigation he recommended court approval of the settlement as an 
alternative nevertheless his premise could tarnish texas airs 
image because it implied wrongdoing on the companys part 
shapiro concluded a deal on the settlement with texas air 
officials at around midnight last wednesday he was scheduled to 
submit his report to the court and speak at a hearing on the 
subject the next day 
on thursday morning texas air officials received copies of the 
report at the companys new york office in rockefeller center it 
wasnt what they were expecting 
some texas air officials initially believed shapiros associates 
at his washington office misunderstood his instructions to them 
when he called around midnight wednesday from new york after 
striking the deal with texas air sources said 
the examiner apparently had two versions of his report prepared 
the sources said after reaching agreement with the company he is 
believed to have told his colleagues to submit to the court the 
version that excluded mention of possible litigation against the 
company someone on shapiros team goofed some insiders believed 
shapiro had two reports written from the getgo said a 
source close to the investigation who described one version as 
heavyhanded and the other as wimpy 
under a later theory shapiros team failed in a frantic effort 
starting late wednesday to revise the report to reflect the 
settlement in time for thursdays hearing according to that 
scenario shapiro asked us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland for 
more time but his request was refused 
the hearing before lifland was scheduled for 2 pm est its 
start was delayed however as shapiro met in a stormy session in 
liflands chambers with attorneys for eastern and texas air 
easterns unions and its major creditors 
they went ballistic said one of those present describing 
the company lawyers behavior the company attorneys accused 
shapiro of breaching their agreement 
after the hearing began and shapiro addressed the court he 
departed from his prepared text at some points in an apparent 
softening of the language saying charges could be brought 
against texas air instead of can be brought as the report 
stated 
the examiner also added several sentences indicating that the 
purpose of his report was to determine if there is sufficient 
evidence to establish claims rather than to make a final finding 
of fact 
he said measures to be taken to protect easterns interests 
could include instead of the original should include 
establishment of a monitoring body under the courts supervision 
that issue opposed by texas air had been one of the major 
sticking points in reaching a settlement sources said 
in his report shapiro continued to reject the unions request 
that eastern be run by an outside trustee 
texas air officials said lorenzo was unavailable to comment on 
the settlement 
a union attorney said the report vindicated the unions 
longstanding claims that texas air had stripped assets from 
eastern if texas air didnt agree with the report it shouldnt 
have signed the settlement he said 
we challenge frank lorenzo to withdraw from the settlement and 
let the issues be tried in court said bruce simon an attorney 
for the pilots union

greyhound drivers walked picket lines today some still wearing 
black armbands in memory of a striker crushed by a bus driven by a 
replacement fewer companies than expected applied to take over 
greyhounds routes 
the union meanwhile said the company turned down a request to 
resume talks but americas only nationwide bus system said it 
hasnt formally been asked 
the union and greyhound lines inc also quibbled sunday over how 
many union drivers have crossed picket lines since the strike 
affecting 6300 drivers and more than 3000 office and maintenance 
workers began friday 
greyhound has been operating with 700 replacement drivers plus 
it says 350 union drivers who crossed picket lines but the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions said only 95 
unionrepresented drivers were behind the wheel 
some strikers who wouldnt cross the picket lines did stay off 
them sunday in memory of a coworker crushed to death by a bus 
while picketing in redding calif 
james la sala the unions international president called today 
for five minutes of silence by the pickets on wednesday to coincide 
with the beginning of a memorial service for the driver 
59yearold robert waterhouse 
waterhouse was on vacation at the time of his death and had been 
scheduled to retire in four months after 32 years on the job 
according to his widow dorie 
it really wasnt even his strike mrs waterhouse said 
but he was in there in support of his fellow drivers he kept 
saying its a matter of self pride 
police did not charge the replacement driver and said the death 
appeared to be accidental 
strikers in jacksonville fla olympia wash and minneapolis 
reported being struck by buses driven by replacement drivers over 
the weekend but there were no serious injuries 
shots were fired at a bus in chicago on friday charter drivers 
in spokane wash found bus electrical systems vandalized sunday 
morning and a passenger in philadelphia was charged sunday with 
spraying a striker with mace 
also in philadelphia vice president of the amalgamated transit 
union local john bal was arrested saturday and charged with 
criminal mischief for breaking a mirror off a greyhound bus police 
said 
two greyhound employees were arrested saturday in mount laurel 
nj on charges of disabling a bus there police said 
the interstate commerce commission said fewer small bus 
companies than expected had applied to serve greyhound routes 
during the strike 
an icc board approved four temporary applications in the east 
but none of the companies serves points south of virginia said 
glenn eady icc regional compliance officer in philadelphia 
the response is not what we expected he said sunday 
the president of one small bus company that is owned by 
greyhound resigned during the weekend over what he termed basic 
philosophical differences with my superiors 
john j dwyer 52 who headed vermont transit co in burlington 
vt said he quit saturday after firing four employees who refused 
to drive routes normally handled by the striking greyhound drivers 
he declined to say whether he had quit because of the firings 
one of the of the fired drivers andrew bahr said he guessed 
that dwyer resigned because he didnt want to fire anyone else 
i knew he never wanted to do it bahr said basically he 
was a very fair man everything you dealt with him on was very 
fair he fired us graciously 
the dispute over whether the union has sought to resume talks 
centers on a meeting friday night in scottsdale ariz between 
union president edward m strait and p anthony lannie greyhound 
executive vice president and chief negotiator 
chairman fred g currey said saturday the company had received 
no formal request to resume negotiations 
but union spokesman nick nichols said i dont know what he 
defines as formal what do they need an engraved invitation 
another spokesman jeffrey nelson reiterated on sunday the unions 
belief that it had sought new talks 
the two sides were reported to be divided over wages and job 
security

wheat and corn futures were moderately lower in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting 
dimming hopes for new soviet trade and forecasts for beneficial 
moisture in most cropgrowing areas 
soybean futures were mixed in early trading 
precipitation was forecast for this week in virtually all us 
and south american agricultural areas 
further selling in the wheat and corn markets stemmed from 
reports that the soviet union had deferred some imports of european 
grain possibly due to transportation or credit problems 
whatever the reason if they defer from them they probably 
wont buy from us either said victor lespinasse a trader in 
chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
buying in the soybean market appeared to reflect a spillover of 
bullish sentiment in the adjacent soybean meal and oil pits 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cents to 5 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 383 a bushel corn 
futures were cent to 1 cent lower with march at 245 a bushel 
oat futures were cent to cent higher with march at 145 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower to cent higher with march at 
569 a bushel

doskocil cos said today it and its 
subsidiaries plan to file for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
the hutchinson kanbased company and its largest subsidiary 
wilson foods corp of oklahoma city announced last week they were 
having financial problems and had defaulted on two large loans 
on friday the company said about 50 employees agreed to a 
voluntary layoff to help during the cash flow crunch 
in a news release early today larry doskocil company founder 
and board chairman said agreement had been reached with chemical 
bank of new york and other senior lenders to provide 65 million in 
secured interim financing subject to bankruptcy court approval 
the loans which replace a 50 million revolving credit 
agreement are intended to allow doskocil and wilson foods to 
continue operating without interruption while finishing the details 
of a reorganization plan 
we are not going out of business doskocil said we do not 
anticipate closing any plants although initially there may be some 
temporary disruptions 
the chapter 11 filing will relieve the company of some of the 
current payments due on its debts and allow more time for the sale 
of some assets including the wilson brands division of wilson 
foods 
that divisions sale is taking longer than anticipated meaning 
the proceeds from it havent been available to help pay off the 
debt taken on from the 1988 acquisition of wilson a muchlarger 
competitor 
in addition to the wilson brands sale delay doskocil also 
attributed the filing to lower operating profits during recent 
quarters than it had anticipated 
last week doskocil announced it was in default on a 133 million 
loan and had been unable to make some other payments to other 
creditors 
doskocil and its subsidiaries formulate process and market 
specialty precooked meat meat toppings pepperoni and other 
speciality meats

the supreme court today ruled that a dispute 
between florida and an illinoisbased bank holding company blocked 
by florida from setting up an industrial savings bank has become 
legally irrelevant 
the court unanimously ruled that a 1987 federal law giving 
states specific authority to block such moves by outofstate bank 
holding companies has rendered the dispute moot 
the decision is a victory for florida but a setback for 
continental bank corp 
the court last june agreed to review the case even though bush 
administration lawyers told the justices the 1987 change in federal 
banking law had made the case moot 
writing for the court today justice antonin scalia never 
acknowledged the bush administration advice that initially went 
unheeded 
continental bank in 1981 filed an application with the florida 
department of banking and finance to establish and run an 
industrial savings bank in mami 
the proposed bank would not accept demand deposits or make 
commercial loans making it a socalled nonbank bank that 
fell outside the federal laws definition of banks 
the application was denied and continental bank subsequently 
sued in federal court the suit alleged that floridas action was 
unconstitutional 
scalia said 1987 amendments to the bank holding company act of 
1956 bars bank holding companies from establishing or acquiring a 
bank in another state unless the latter states statutes 
specifically authorize it to do so 
the law thus effectively permits states to prevent 
outofstate holding companies from owning instate banks scalia 
said 
the case is lewis vs continental bank 871956

doctors at state hospitals nationwide went 
on strike monday for higher wages a union spokesman said 
the strike came amid continuing labor unrest including walkouts 
by 12000 tax officials protesting alleged loopholes in proposed 
tax legislation and employees in some departments of the central 
bank and national bank of greece over wages 
doctors in provincial state hospitals started a 48hour strike 
monday about 70 percent of the doctors in the athens area staged a 
fourhour stoppage in sympathy and will repeat it on tuesday said 
georgios sepirgiotis vice president of the hospital doctors union 
for athens and piraeus 
the doctors are objecting to a costcutting recommendation by 
the state audit council that a ceiling should be set on the number 
of overtime shifts doctors may work to be calculated in line with 
basic pay levels 
sepirgiotis also said hospital doctors had not received a raise 
since 1983 
an intern receives 212 per month almost half the wage of a 
17yearold factory worker sepirgiotis said 
there are nearly 9000 doctors registered in state hospitals 
with 4000 in the athens area alone

in the downtown offices of a powerful 
insurance company the walls in a secondfloor suite are decorated 
with buckets and iron bed keys 
they share a place of honor with antique firefighter helmets and 
with steampowered fire engines and hose reels in the lobby of 
cigna corps headquarters the result is a prestigious corporate 
museum 
these samples of the technology that has kept the company in 
business celebrate the long colorful history of firefighting in 
philadelphia where cigna got its start nearly 200 years ago 
insuring against fire and shipping losses 
cignas business traditions are reflected in the museum 
collection devoted to the otherwise unrelated histories of 
maritime shipping and firefighting models and paintings of sailing 
ships the company once insured are displayed around the corner from 
firemens tools and ceremonial clothing 
over the years as more sophisticated equipment gave 
firefighters better odds against the flames insurance companies 
benefited now it is cignas turn to do the salvaging and preserve 
firefighting relics 
the museum collection contains 9000 pieces says curator 
melissa hough many of the best items are exhibited in the downtown 
philadelphia museum but as much as 85 percent of the collection is 
either on loan to museums around the country or spread around 
cignas 60 corporate offices here and abroad ms hough said 
firefighting traditions in philadelphia go back to the bucket 
brigades of the early colonial times the nations first volunteer 
fire company was founded here in 1736 and the first fire insurance 
company ben franklins contributionship started 16 years later 
in the 19th century the firehouse was a center of male 
camaraderie and competition with rivalries played out fighting 
fires 
one museum painting shows a race between horsedrawn fire 
engines of rival companies each trying to be the first to a fire 
another shows several fire companies at an 1850 contest to see 
whose hoses could squirt water the highest 
the competition between volunteer fire companies ms hough 
said eventually became a problem as firemen became just plain 
rowdy they called false alarms to sabotage other companies and 
cut their rivals hoses ms hough said the problem peaked right 
after the civil war and in 1871 the city stepped in and 
established a professional fire department 
many firefighting buffs visit cignas museum in many 
pennsylvania communities volunteer fire companies remain part of 
the social fabric as they once were in philadelphia 
hough said school children come on class trips and one of their 
favorite games is to guess the use of some of the oddlooking tools 
displayed in the museum 
they play with wooden rattles once used by watchmen to rouse 
neighbors in the event of a fire and learn that a strangelooking 
piece of iron is a bed key actually a critical firefighting tool 
firemen carried bed keys so they could quickly disassemble beds 
and carry them out of burning homes beds were among the most 
expensive pieces of furniture and salvaging them was important to 
homeowners as well as to their insurance companies 
in 1794 the insurance company of north america a predecessor 
of cigna was the first to offer fire insurance on the contents of 
a building 
cigna the eighthlargest insurance company in the world had 
revenue of 17 billion in 1988 the last year for which complete 
figures are available 
the portion of company business now devoted to fire insurance is 
difficult to calculate said cigna spokesman james ely because 
fire insurance is typically part of a package including theft and 
liability insurance about 20 percent of cignas revenues are from 
such commercial packages he said

every time florida shivers brazil tightens 
its grip on the us orange juice market 
the south american giant again is shipping millions of gallons 
of juice to the united states at premium prices in the wake of the 
third major freeze in floridas citrus groves in six years 
the flood from a competitor is a mixed blessing florida 
processors may take most of the imported juice supply to blend with 
their limited local supply in making frozen concentrated orange 
juice 
we will be importing more than 50 percent of our product to 
meet market demand says executive director dan gunter of the 
florida department of citrus imports will probably exceed the 
level of 1985 which when processors needed supply help due to 
cropkilling frosts in december 1983 and january 1985 
production in florida which until 1982 was the world leader in 
citrus is expected to fall sharply due to damage from the 
christmastime freeze the states share of expected us production 
of singlestrength equivalent sse juice which includes 
concentrate chilled and canned juice is seen as falling to about 
45 percent from 706 percent last year 
brazil meanwhile is expected to have a record crop this year 
and export a record 319 million gallons of concentrated juice 
orange processors in california texas and arizona may account 
for only 6 percent of the total us juice supply this year as a 
result domestic orangejuice imports principally from brazil 
will total about 625 million sse gallons according to industry 
economists up 72 percent from the 198889 import level 
at the same time juice prices have risen sharply 
within the past year the wholesale price for brazilian juice 
has risen from 150 a pound to 212 a pound this year and 
because brazil is the worlds largest producerexporter it sets 
the price so consumers will be paying more no matter where their 
juice comes from 
american grocery store prices are expected to average 417 a 
gallon during the current processing season an increase of 124 
percent over the previous year 
particularly ironic to florida industry leaders is that 
processors in this state may take 60 percent of all imported juice 
to blend with the limited local supply in making florida frozen 
concentrated orange juice 
the state expects to pack about 93 million gallons of frozen 
concentrate this year and will import about 93 million gallons 
compared with packing of 175 million gallons and imports of 52 
million gallons in 1989 
the states citrus industry views the imported juice situation 
in a bittersweet vein in good times many bitterly criticize 
brazilian imports although some state processors traditionally buy 
brazilian product to blend with what is considered higherquality 
florida orange juice 
in bad times particularly after frigid weather ices the fruit 
or destroys trees florida depends on brazil to make up the supply 
difference and maintain a steady market and a good price 
floridas problems serve as an impetus for brazil to plant 
more trees and produce a bigger crop says bobby mckown 
executive vice president of florida citrus mutual the states 
largest grower trade association with 12000 members 
this can lead to excess supplies in the future and prices will 
drop and well need to increase demand mckown says brazilian 
imports may help in the shortterm he says but we need to work 
on a longterm basis i dont think brazil is doing enough to 
expand the markets we do most of that after a freeze they just 
clear their inventory 
but gunter said that because of brazils bumper crop and

nec corp japans leading computer maker said 
monday it will spend about 40 million to increase the use of 
foreignmade semiconductors by july 1991 when a usjapan 
semiconductor agreement expires 
nec officials said the company decided to raise its share of 
foreignmade chips to about 24 percent of the total at the request 
of the ministry of international trade and industry currently 
about 20 percent of the chips it uses are imported 
the agency was reported to have made the request out of concern 
that the united states might take retaliatory trade action unless 
usmade semiconductors account for 20 percent of the japanese 
market by the time the bilateral accord expires 
nec is reported to have been buying semiconductors worth about 
13 billion a year from outside the company with foreignmade 
chips accounting for about 267 million of that total 
according to industry statistics foreignmade chips accounted 
for 12 percent of the japanese market in the third quarter of last 
year far short of the 20 percent share the united states has been 
seeking

the chairman of swedish automaker ab volvo said 
monday that it could take until the mid1990s for the fruits of 
its alliance with frances stateowned renault to show up in the 
form of higher profits 
pehr g gyllenhammar told a reporter that while costcutting 
measures could be implemented almost immediately significant 
payoffs from the alliance will take much longer 
the big money will take four to five years i think because 
it has to do with the components and products that we can develop 
jointly gyllenhammar said we will find costcutting earlier 
but not of any dramatic nature 
the two automakers announced feb 23 an agreement in which they 
will take stakes in each other and work jointly in the future in 
such areas as research product development and purchasing 
the accord aims to achieve economies of scale and to extend the 
reach of both companies although each will remain legally 
independent executives at both companies say the volvo and renault 
brand names will remain distinct 
renault president raymond h levy accompanying gyllenhammer at a 
news conference declined to say when he thought profits would 
improve as a result of the alliance 
gyllenhammar reiterated that the decision to forge the agreement 
with renault didnt represent an effort by either of the partners 
eventually to take over the other 
asked about rumors that volvo was in talks with mitsubishi 
motors of japan and chrysler corp of the us on possible 
cooperation agreements or joint ventures gyllenhammar said 
theres an ongoing dialogue in our business 
under terms of the accord with renault each partner can enter 
joint ventures and partnerships with other companies provided that 
the other partner approves he said

wheat futures prices closed moderately lower 
monday as wet weather in the great plains prompted steady selling 
on the chicago board of trade corn and soybean futures were mixed 
rain was expected throughout the us wheat region this week 
winter wheat areas in particular have been receiving ample moisture 
recently after pronounced dryness in the fall and early winter 
wheat futures also were pressured by technical factors and 
unconfirmed rumors that the soviet union has been seeking to delay 
some imports of european grain due to transportation or credit 
problems 
strength in the soybean and corn markets reflected perceptions 
that farmers must plant more of those commodities than early 
indications suggest to meet the anticipated demand said william 
biedermann director of research with allendale inc a commodities 
brokerage in crystal lake ill 
biedermann dismissed talk of quality problems with the south 
american soybean crop which is nearing maturity 
we checked with some commercials on this and they do not think 
its anything substantial he said 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 385 a bushel corn futures 
were 1 cent lower to cent higher with march at 244 a bushel 
oats were unchanged to 1 cents higher with march at 145 a 
bushel and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 4 cents higher with march

dun amp bradstreet corp a leading marketer of 
business information and services said monday it plans to sell two 
subsidiaries that provide historical investment information and 
related services 
the company said it planned to sell datastream international a 
londonbased provider of investment information research and 
portfolio accounting services throughout europe and the far east on 
international securities 
also put up for sale was interactive data based in lexington 
mass a provider of securitiesrelated information software and 
systems to the us investment community 
while these are fine businesses we believe that it is in the 
best interest of dampbs shareowners to focus our investments and 
resources on those key markets in which dampbs participation and 
leadership positions are strongest said charles w moritz 
chairman and chief executive 
he identified some of the largest of those markets as those for 
riskmanagement information services marketing information 
services directory information services and businessapplications 
software 
datastream and interactive data had combined revenue of 155 
million in 1989 datastream was acquired in june 1984 for 102 
million interactive data was acquired in march 1988 for 140 
million 
moritz said the company expects the investment and redeployment 
of the proceeds from the sales to offset lost operating income from 
the two units 
actions such as restructuring certain dampb businesses and share 
repurchase will be considered he said 
nonetheless the company continues to expect that 1990 earnings 
per share will be in the range of 280 moritz said the company 
earned 314 a share in 1989 and 267 a share in 1988 
the company previously has blamed the impact of lower sales at 
its us credit services business and the costs of repositioning 
actions in that area for the anticipated decline in earnings 
the us credit services division was stung by complaints from 
some customers last year that they had been overcharged the 
company said it has taken corrective steps in recent months 
moritz said the divestitures will simplify dampbs business 
mix and will not affect its plans for moodys investors service 
which provides corporate and public finance debt ratings the 
company plans to maintain and strengthen moodys postition and to 
invest in its international expansion

contracts for new construction nationwide slid 3 
percent in january extending a slump that is mostly confined to 
the northeast and south atlantic regions the fw dodge division 
of mcgrawhill inc reported monday 
the dodge index which uses 1982 as its 100 base fell to 155 in 
january from 160 in december and was well off its most recent peak 
of 181 reached last september 
the yearly pace of total contracting was 24430 billion in 
january down from 25144 billion in december 
in january contracts for nonresidential buildings declined 4 
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8375 billion from

billion from 11707 billion 
nonbuilding construction contracts such as for public works 
and utility projects dropped 6 percent to 4458 billion from 
4721 billion 
the weakening of construction activity that has set in over 
the past six months has a decidedly regional tilt to it said 
george a christie vice president and chief economist of fw 
dodge 
he said virtually all of the decline has been concentrated in 
two regions the northeast and south atlantic 
states included in the northeast region are the new england 
states plus new jersey new york and pennsylvania the south 
alantic region is made up of delaware florida georgia maryland 
north and south carolina virgina washington and west virginia

american manufacturers increased foreign 
investment activity last year mainly in europe lured by potential 
commercial and financial opportunities in eastern europe the 
conference board reported monday 
us manufacturers started 217 new foreign projects in 1989 a 
20 percent jump over 1988 and are continuing to invest overseas at 
a similar rate in the first few weeks of 1990 the business and 
finance research organization said 
of the new investments last year the majority 53 percent 
were in western europe 
with events in eastern europe now suggesting a dramatic 
expansion in the european market many american firms are 
strengthening their presence in europe to take advantage of future 
growth opportunities said james greene the conference boards 
international investment specialist 
the european investments included 72 acquisitions 24 joint 
ventures 14 new plants and six expansions of existing facilities 
the united kingdom attracted 38 american projects followed by 
west germany with 17 italy with 15 france 14 and the netherlands 
13 eastern europe attracted nine investors the soviet union six 
hungary two and yugoslavia one 
but canada also emerged as a new target for us investors 
netting 35 new projects the board said 
the canadianus free trade agreement may well have ended 
canadas status as a satellite market and assured it of a much 
wider global role greene said 
twelve investment projects were started in japan last year 
including 10 joint ventures and three were in china 
manufacturing businesses that went abroad were mainly in

shearson lehman hutton inc is closing up to 50 
retail brokerage offices nationwide as part of acrosstheboard 
cutbacks under parent american express co the investment firm 
said monday 
shearson also was said to be trying to sell its troubled balcor 
real estate management subsidiary which has more than 1 billion 
in real estate loans and direct investments outstanding in a shaky 
market 
the reductions are part of an overhaul being engineered by 
american express which over the last two months gradually has 
moved to take full control of shearson its wall street investment 
subsidiary 
american express announced sunday that it was buying the 
remaining publicly held shares of shearson reversing its earlier 
stated intention of reducing its ownership stake to less than 50 
percent 
most of the shearson brokers were informed of the office 
closings some of which are to take effect immediately on monday 
and last friday the firm would not disclose specific offices to be 
closed 
shearson the nations second largest retail brokerage has 
about 10000 brokers at 600 branches nationwide 
shearson spokeswoman suzanne quigley said 45 to 50 offices would 
be closed or consolidated with other offices by april 1 layoffs 
would occur but quigley declined to specify an amount she said 
there would be no disruption to client accounts at the closed 
offices 
as part of the reduction sources at the firm said shearson 
would consolidate management of investment products in the hands of 
fewer executives per region 
shearson last week announced it would lay off 2000 off its 
35500 employees by the end of the month employees said layoffs 
were occurring daily in a variety of departments 
like other wall street firms shearsons retail brokerage 
division has been hit by a downturn in the securities industry 
since the 1987 stock market crash shearson had expanded 
drastically in the field including the acquisition of ef hutton 
amp co in january 1988 that more than doubled its retail force 
analysts said the retail closings would trim some unneeded 
personnel and reduce overhead 
the sources at shearson said the firm was cutting back much of 
its real estate activities leading with the planned elimination of 
one department this week and the expected sale of balcor which had 
145 loans worth about 11 billion last nov 30 
according to federal filings balcor had nonperforming assets of 
114 million including nonperforming loans and about 22 million 
in owned real estate the subsidiary has just 10 million in 
reserves to cover its portfolio of loans to realestate 
partnerships and client companies 
the high level of nonperforming assets and low level of reserves 
have raised concern because a downturn in the nations commercial 
property industry has raised the chances that more loans could be 
vulnerable the sources did not identify a potential buyer for 
balcor 
balcor isnt that important to the revenue or profits of 
shearson overall said perrin long who follows the securities 
industry for lipper analytical services however it could be a 
major negative to profits if they have to take reserves against bad 
loans 
a shearson spokesman steven faigen declined to comment on 
whether shearson was seeking a buyer for balcor theres a 
strategic review ongoing and its results are still being 
fashioned he said 
more job cuts and large charges against earnings are expected as 
part of the review 
american express decision to buy back shearson shares it does 
not own was viewed as a another show of support for by the credit 
card and financial services giant for its subsidiary prior to 
sundays announcement american express already had agreed to pump 
more than 1 billion into shearson 
but analysts also said the move which involves exchanging 350 
million worth of american express shares for the 28 million 
publicly held shearson shares did not eliminate the possibility of 
selling all or part of shearson 
taking shearson out of public hands will give american express 
more flexibility in tackling the restructuring at the firm 
analysts said because it will occur out of the public eye 
the buyback also ended for now talks on merging shearson with 
primerica corps smith barney harris upham amp co unit

wholesale gasoline and home heating oil posting sharp gains 
traders scrambled to buy contracts for petroleum products on the 
new york mercantile exchange on the assumption that exxon corps 
suspension in operations at a new jersey refinery could cause

andrew lebow a broker at edampf man international futures 
inc said strength in products led the energy markets higher 
he said exxons decision to suspend tanker and barge operations 
at its bayway refinery in linden nj will idle the refinery 
reducing daily refining capacity in the new york harbor area by 
130000 barrels total capacity in the area has been estimated at 
465000 barrels a day he said 
exxon indefinitely suspended the operations in the wake of two 
oil spills in waterways surrounding the refinery this year

sales of cars and light trucks made in north 
america slumped 79 percent in late february compared with last 
year when consumers rushed to showrooms to snatch up expiring 
incentives automakers said monday 
for the entire month sales of domestic and imported automobiles 
and light trucks were down 47 percent reflecting sagging interest 
in cash rebates and low interest financing that were the rage in 
january and february 1989 
the incentives in early 1989 turned many spring car buyers into 
late winter purchasers 
its not going too bad said sales manager fred voelkel of 
brown and brown chevroletgeo in mesa ariz were down a little 
from last year 
the nine major automakers making vehicles in north america said 
they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 42688 during 
the feb 2128 period this year compared with a rate of 46336 
during the same time last year 
sales of new cars fell 67 percent and truck sales were down 10 
percent 
for the first two months of this year domestic and overseas 
automakers reported vehicle sales were off 08 percent indicating 
a strong january sales rate was being watered down by a weaker 
february rate 
automakers are keeping a careful eye on their newvehicle 
inventories in anticipation of what they hope will be a return to a 
tradition of a spring buying spree in march and april 
at the beginning of last year automakers advertised the 
incentive programs that expired for the most part at the end of 
february the specter of those programs ending turned likely spring 
buyers into latewinter purchasers grabbing a good deal 
that disrupted the tradition of a sales bulge in march and 
april this year incentives in effect in january and february 
didnt generate the same buying excitement with the notable 
exception of chryslers incentives on minivans in january which 
boosted yeartodate sales figures for 1990 
we are in shape for a good spring said voelkel thats 
when we build up our inventories and build up our advertising a 
little bit 
he said he expects his current 75day supply of cars to swell to 
around 90 days by spring 
gms car and truck sales for late february ran 24 percent 
behind last years pace with car sales off 38 percent and truck 
sales up 09 percent for the entire year gm vehicles sold at a

coffee futures prices soared above 1 a pound monday on new 
yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange amid rising concern about 
tight availability of highquality coffee 
on other futures markets copper futures surged cotton futures 
were up sharply energy futures were higher precious metals were 
mixed grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock andmeat 
futures were mixed 
coffee futures settled 464 cents to 55 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 1045 a pound its highest 
settlement since june 30 
analysts said the rally which marked the markets fourth 
consecutive day of unusual strength was not related to any change 
in the supplydemand picture but to the same factors that have 
recently supported the market 
those factors include civil strife in the ivory coast a coffee 
supply shortfall in mexico a lack of availability from ecuador and 
poor growing conditions for coffee in colombia 
all the reports today were basically news we already had 
said celeste georkakis an analyst with cargill investor services 
inc in new york 
the rally was considered especially significant though because 
coffee futures surpassed 1 a pound a price at which coffee had 
not traded since early july when the international coffee 
organization lifted export quotas and exposed prices to the free 
market 
coffee futures plunged below 70 cents a pound last year as 
producers sold out their warehoused stocks but the recent rise 
indicates the market is moving toward a more balanced 
supplyanddemand situation 
with prices now above 1 chances for a return to export quotas 
look slim said sandra kaul an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc who said that at these prices producers are likely to become 
more willing sellers 
the concern about nearby availability is likely to moderate up 
here at higher price levels which should allow sales to pick up 
she said 
copper futures rose sharply on new yorks commodity exchange on 
supply worries exacerbated by the comexs report that its warehouse 
stocks of copper fell 175 short tons friday and by the london metal 
exchanges report of a 4475 metric ton decline last week in its 
stocks 
copper futures settled 23 cents to 36 cents higher with march 
at 123 a pound 
also on the comex gold futures settled 1 to 120 higher with 
april at 40660 a troy ounce silver futures were 1 cent lower 
across the board with march at 5116 a troy ounce 
some cotton futures soared the permitted daily limit of 2 cents 
a pound on the new york cotton exchange on strong technical signals 
cotton finished 85 cent to 207 cents higher with march on 
which the limit has been removed pending the contracts expiration 
at 7015 cents a pound 
heating oil and gasoline futures climbed sharply on the new york 
mercantile exchange amid supply worries linked to the shutdown of 
exxons bayway nj refinery pending an investigation into last 
weeks spill of oil in the adjacent waterway 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 37 cents 
higher with april at 2158 a barrel heating oil was 91 cent to 
212 cents higher with april at 5799 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 75 cent to 283 cents higher with april at 5930 
cents a gallon 
wheat futures prices closed moderately lower monday as wet 
weather in the great plains prompted steady selling on the chicago 
board of trade corn and soybean futures were mixed 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower with march at 
385 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to cent higher with march 
at 244 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with march 
at 146 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher

four large fastfood chains are breaking an 
agreement to offer onthespot nutritional information about their 
menus and to make sure customers know the brochures are available 
a consumer group said monday 
we are sorry to report that after initial compliance the 
voluntary program has broken down the center for science in the 
public interest said in letters to the attorneys general of texas 
california and new york 
the three state officials won agreement from five chains in july 
1986 to provide ingredient and nutrition information at all 
outlets the consumer group said that the companies were supposed 
to post signs alerting diners to the availability of a brochure and 
that the policies were supposed to apply nationwide 
the washingtonbased center a nonprofit health advocacy 
organization with 200000 members said only the jack in the box 
chain remains in substantial compliance with the agreement based 
on a survey of outlets in eight states and the district of 
columbia the consumer group said burger king mcdonalds wendys 
and kentucky fried chicken have slipped 
michael jacobson the centers executive director said in a 
statement that his organization had urged the attorneys general 
to consider prosecuting the companies unless they resume full 
compliance within 60 days 
leslie gersing a spokeswoman for new york attorney general 
robert abrams said the information program was the result of an 
informal outofcourt agreement and said she did not know if 
there were grounds to sue 
however she said all three attorneys general have asked 
officials from the four companies to meet with texas attorney 
general jim mattox to discuss why they have discontinued the 
program 
this is something wed like to do without having to resort to 
litigation she said 
a spokesman for kentucky fried chicken said brochures are sent 
to restaurants but they are not required to give them out the 
deal was that the 1986 agreement was voluntary said dick 
detwiler the companys director of public affairs 
in his letter to the state officials jacobson said consumers 
need to know for example that mcdonalds and burger king fry 
their potatoes in beef fat that mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets 
contain groundup chicken skin that burger kings whopper with 
cheese contains 711 calories and that milkshakes often contain 
artificial colorings 
the consumer group surveyed restaurants in virginia louisiana 
ohio wyoming new mexico texas california and new york in 
addition to washington dc 
jacobson said the centers survey showed that 
of 14 burger king outlets surveyed none had signs and only six 
had brochures customers who requested information were told to 
write or call corporate headquarters 
spokeswoman cori zywotow said burger king provides all its 
restaurants with nutritional guides and requires companyowned 
outlets to distribute them this is the first complaint that 
weve received she said we certainly will go back and take a 
look ourselves and if they are not being given out remedy the 
situation 
kentucky fried chicken is creating a new brochure and not 
distributing the old one which didnt contain ingredient 
information anyway customers ho requested information were told to 
contact corporate headquarters stores were not required to keep 
brochures on hand and only three of 13 surveyed had any 
detwiler the company spokesman said monday that the new 
brochure has been sent to outlets which may or may not distribute 
them asked about ingredient listings and signs he said im not 
aware that we ever agreed to provide anything other than 
nutritional information 
mcdonalds has a policy that all outlets are supposed to have 
booklets and signs but the policy is being ignored by many of their 
stores only eight of 18 stores surveyed had brochures 
spokeswoman terri capatosto said mcdonalds never entered into 
any agreement except a oneyear program to distribute nutrition 
information in new york but she said that we provide complete 
ingredient information at our restaurants we send it to our 
restaurants regularly and it is available at all times from the 
nutrition information center at corporate headquarters 
wendys tells customers who want information to write to 
corporate headquarters one california wendys had a sign noting 
the availability of product information but had no brochures on 
hand none of 14 stores surveyed had any 
they might have run out of them said wendys spokesman 
denny lynch thats easily fixed well just remind our 
restaurant operators that the ingredient and nutrition brochures 
are available and ask them to have a supply on hand

lockheed corps chief executive 
attacked the motives and management skills of harold c simmons 
the texas financier who leads a group that is seeking control of 
the aerospace companys board 
daniel m tellep in interviews sunday defended his record in 
the year since he became chairman and chief executive he cited 
recent costcutting and restructuring at lockheed and said simmons 
has never taken him up on repeated invitations to discuss the 
companys future 
were completely open to future options tellep told the 
wall street journal but he has never put forward his ideas 
simmons has gained control of 189 percent of lockheeds stock 
and is attempting to overturn poison pill provisions adopted by 
the calabasasbased company that make it prohibitively expensive 
for an outsider to acquire more than 20 percent of the shares 
he has proposed his own directors for the company which elects 
a board march 29 at its annual shareholders meeting simmons 
nominees include elmo r zumwalt jr the former chief of naval 
operations and former sen john g tower who headed the senate 
armed services committee names intended to defuse critics who say 
he has no experience in running a defense contractor 
tellep told the los angeles times that simmons only concrete 
plan for the company so far is a plan for taking over 
shareholders will have to ask themselves what about this 
uncertainty he said 
he was unavailable for interviews monday lockheed spokesman 
robert slayman said simmons did not return phone calls 
simmons slate of 15 candidates for the lockheed board also 
includes himself and j landis martin the president and chief 
executive of simmonscontrolled nl industries a houstonbased 
chemical company that has accumulated the 189 percent of 
lockheeds shares 
tellep cautioned against any breakup of lockheeds major 
operating units if someone started breaking it up the parts 
couldnt help each other he said any splitup diminishes the 
value of the whole 
our board stacks up well compared to simmons he added 
separately sunday lockheeds machinists ended six months of 
negotiations by voting to accept a 3year contract the contract 
covers about 128000 members of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers at company plants in palmdale 
burbank sunnyvale and marietta ga 
it provides 4 percent wage scale increases or bonuses 
retroactive to october and an immediate 2500 signing bonus for 
all workers under the contract and currently on payroll 
wages will rise 7 percent over the final two years of the 
contract which runs until march 1993 
under the pact the firm can match employee contributions to a 
companysponsored savings plan by using lockheed stocks the new 
employee stock ownership plan is slated to begin in july 
lockheed management successfully obtained a 6 percent employee 
contribution for dependent medical care it also won a twotier 
wage scale that would create a lower salary range for newly hired 
workers in certain jobs 
in addition the contract calls for roughly 20 percent of 
covered workers to receive quarterly bonuses rather than an 
increase in wage scales during the first year of the pact that 
percentage will rise to about 47 percent of all workers by the 
contracts third year

motorola inc on monday unveiled a new computer 
line that the technology company hopes will propel it into the 
industrys major leagues 
but some industry analysts said motorola could end up alienating 
companies that buy its computers for resale under their own brand 
names others questioned whether motorola stands a chance in the 
highly competitive computer field 
motorola is doing so many great things in other parts of the 
company you hate to be negative about their computer effort but i 
dont think it has too much prospect for success said richard l 
whittington of kidder peabody amp co 
the new computers are designed to operate in a network with 
machines made by other companies such as ibm and apple they are 
based on the unix operating system which is becoming the industry 
standard 
motorola said the computers undercut the price of a similar line 
of ibm machines by 35 percent and more while offering comparable 
or better performance the ibm computers which were introduced 
with great fanfare last month were praised by experts for their 
low price relative to peformance 
motorola based in schaumburg ill has made computers for 
years but they primarily have been sold to the federal government 
or to other computer companies that resell them under their own 
names 
the new computers are file servers an increasingly popular 
form of desktop or sideofdesk machine that serves as the central 
data repository for a network of desktop terminals 
analysts generally are impressed by the new motorola computers 
which they said are competitive with the best in the field 
john rymer managing editor of the trade publication unix in the 
office said he believes motorolas strategy is similar to that of 
intel corp a computerchip maker that also makes complete 
computers it sells to third parties for reselling he said these 
chip makers hope to leverage their microprocessor expertise to 
become major computer manufacturers 
some of the companies that buy intel chips to make computers 
have criticized intel for its strategy saying it is not fair for 
their supplier of the most crucial part of a computer to also 
compete in the end product 
however one major user of motorola chips welcomes the companys 
new strategy 
data general corp uses motorolas 88000 chip the same one used 
in the new motorola machines in its computer workstations stan 
dolberg marketing manager for the workstations said the market 
for computers based on this chip is relatively small and additional 
players are needed to help establish it 
nv philips the dutch electronics company uses a relabeled 
motorola computer as the heart of its computer line outside the 
united states philips spokesman cor vraven said he had no comment 
on motorolas strategy because it was his understanding motorola 
had no immediate plan to sell the computers overseas 
however motorola spokeswoman karen simeone said the company 
planned to distribute the computers abroad starting in may 
analysts say motorola needs to improve its marketing and 
distribution to become a major seller of computers in its own 
right to this end the company has launched a 30 million 
advertising campaign 
motorolas machines called the multipersonal computer line 
range in price from about 24000 to 60000 each system comes 
with three desktop screens and a processing unit 
each also is equipped with a localarea network which is a 
cable and related software than allows various computers and 
printers from other companies to be linked 
the new machines which will be available in may are aimed at 
the commercial computer market instead of the engineering and 
scientific customers that often are the target for file servers and 
for workstations which are similar to file servers

mgmua communications co pulled off 
the auction block in january has reached a fiveyear deal to 
distribute much soughtafter films from pathe communications co 
the companies said monday 
the deal had been widely expected to go to warner bros but mgm 
and pathe officials said a final contract was never signed 
nevertheless warner spokesman rob friedman insisted his studio 
already had reached an agreement with pathe even though he would 
not describe it 
warner has a deal as far as were concerned friedman said 
weve been working on their movies for a couple of months 
the releases from the pathe subsidiary alan ladd jrs pathe 
entertainment include russia house with sean connery and 
michelle pfeiffer at christmas and quigley down under with tom 
selleck and laura san giacomo this fall 
mgmua said it will boost the number of major films it releases 
in theaters to at least 15 this year that is good news for the 
studio which virtually shut down movie production of its own for 
most of two years while controlling shareholder kirk kerkorian 
looked for a buyer 
the hollywood reporter an entertainment trade paper quoted 
unidentified insiders as saying that continuing negotiations 
could lead to pathe communications or its head giancarlo parretti 
buying mgmua under one scenario warner might pick up 
distribution rights to the 1000picture ua library mgmuas 
biggest asset the paper said 
friedman and pathe spokesman craig parsons declined to comment 
on the report parretti an italian financier and restaurant owner 
was among those who considered buying mgmua when it was up for 
sale but parsons said he had no knowledge of any recent talks 
mgmua has started up its own production again but for now must 
depend largely on distributing movies from independent production 
companies like pathe 
it gives them some great product and they need it right 
now said alex ben block editor of the industry newsletter show 
biz news 
pathe will finance the costs of the films and oversee marketing 
and distribution mgm gets exclusive distribution rights to home 
video releases as well as domestic theatrical releases other 
details werent released 
this arrangement reaffirms mgmuas ability and commitment to 
supply major motion pictures to all media jeffrey c barbakow 
the companys chairman said in a statement 
australias qintex group outbid rupert murdochs fox studio for 
mgmua last year but the deal collapsed when qintex failed to line 
up financing cable tv baron ted turner then discussed a buyout 
he already owns most rights to the old mgm film library but those 
merger talks died in january and kerkorian said he would go back to 
the business of making movies 
many observers believe kerkorians goal remains to sell mgmua 
jeffrey logsdon a securities analyst with the crowell weedon 
brokerage in los angeles said the company may have aggressively 
outbid warner for the pathe deal to help create the illusion they 
are a fullfledged company with product in the pipeline 
thats got to always be in the back of ones mind anyway 
he said 
in addition to russia house and quigley down under 
mgmua will distribute such pathe films as fires within 
starring jimmy smits not without my daughter starring sally 
field and life stinks written and directed by and starring mel

the theatrical release of 15 films this year brings mgmua to 
what once was a standard level for a major studio although such 
studios as disney fox and warner are now trying for about double 
that number each year as worldwide demand soars for hollywood 
entertainment

president of mgmuas film group richard berger spent 9 million 
this year for rights to desperate hours a mickey rourke film

the board of directors of general motors corp 
approved an antigreenmail policy prompting a stockholder to 
withdraw her proposal against such payoffs 
the policy approved monday prohibits the purchase of shares at 
an abovemarket price from anyone owning more than 3 percent of the 
voting power of the corporations stock the policy applies only if 
the stockholder has held his or her shares for less than two years 
shareholder evelyn y davis of washington dc proposed a ban 
on greenmail three years ago after gm paid h ross perot and some 
associates 750 million for their class e stock in exchange for his 
leaving the company perot founded electronic data systems and had 
sold it to gm a few years before 
most shareholder proposals attract only a tiny fraction of 
votes but hers garnered 20 percent the first year and nearly 28 
percent last year 
there was a growing stockholder interest in having a formal 
statement or formal policy in opposition to greenmail gm 
spokesman william b winters said 
in a statement gm said it has consistently opposed the payment 
of greenmail 
this adoption of an explicit policy reinforces its belief that 
the corporations funds must be employed for the benefit of all 
stockholders the company said

students across the country got the news 
along with a sales pitch for candy shaving razors and cheese 
snacks monday as the advertisersupported classroom program channel 
one went on the air 
i think it is a good idea said powell high school student 
jim addington 17 one of the first to see the channel one news 
program beamed to 400 schools nationwide 
i dont see why there is so much controversy over the 
commercials he added noting hed seen channel ones ads for 
mampms gillette shavers and cheetos before on his television at 
home i thought the programming was good i think it will work 
christopher whittle chairman of the knoxvillebased whittle 
communications that produced the show agrees 
despite criticism from national education groups and bans by 
public educators in new york and california whittle told a news 
conference at the high school that 2900 schools in 34 states have 
signed up for channel one and he predicted a total of 8000 would 
be committed by december 
i predict that within 5 years a system like this will be in 95 
percent of all middle and high schools in the united states in a 
sense it will be a new institution in americas schools he said 
but timothy dyer executive director of the national association 
of secondary school principals worried that channel one which 
already has been tested in a number of schools marked the 
beginning of the commercialization of the classroom 
added peggy charren founder of action for childrens television 
in cambridge mass its obvious that schools signing on to 
whittles operation are doing it for the free tv sets i think it 
is outrageous to barter pieces of the school day in return for a 
mess of equipment and to use that equipment to keep reminding 
children of how much they need particular products 
mondays broadcast by channel ones fivemember team of under30 
anchors and reporters gave a capsule of breaking news voting in 
three soviet republics the escape of a 17yearold cuban to the 
united states on a sailboard the return of the space shuttle 
atlantis and president bushs talks with japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu 
the program produced in new york and sent by satellite to the 
participating schools had longer stories on a japanese high school 
in tennessee and an army recruiting office in kentucky 
maps preceded several of the stories to show where the action 
was taking place students interviewed approved it gives you a 
perspective of where it is actually happening said stacey 
surber 16 it gives you a better understanding 
the program also contained the first of five daily reports on 
the rise and fall of the berlin wall i like the way it combined 
history with news it showed what was happening in the 40s said 
gabe thrasher 16 
the 12minute program was interspersed with two minutes of 
30second commercials the fourth ad was an antidrug public 
service announcement 
al poe spokesman for mampmmars inc said that while the 
hackettstown nj candy company believes that subscribing to 
channel one is a local community matter it deserves corporate 
support 
everyone wins with the whittle concept students school 
systems communities and the sponsors poe said our experience 
has been that situations like this tend to be productive for a long 
time 
whittle said 29 advertisers whom he wouldnt name have 
contracted to run commercials on channel one at 150000 per 
30second spot ads for tobacco alcohol political and religious 
groups and contraceptives are rejected 
we have 65 percent of our commercial time sold for the first 
three years whittle said it is from a business standpoint 
the most successful television launch ever 
there is widespread support for this in the corporate 
community for two reasons they think it is good business but 
they think it is good education too and they see this as a way 
that they can help schools 
whittle said commercials are necessary in order to pay for the 
150 million in video equipment loaned to the schools that show the 
program and the 90 million in annual operational expenses to 
produce it 
earl hoffmeister superintendent of the 50000student knox 
county school system said the televisions video recorders and 
satellite dishes provided by whittle for channel one separate it 
from other programming geared to teenagers such as turner 
broadcasting system incs cnn newsroom that has been carried 
since august on cable news network 
we think it is a tool that will help many many school systems 
as our own school system in being able to do some things that we 
either do not have the money for or a teacher is not available 
hoffmeister said adding that the school system planned to use the 
equipment for other programming 
what effect channel ones commercials will have remains to be 
seen both teachers and students said monday they tended to ignore 
them its almost like when you watch tv at home miss surber 
said when the commercials come on you dont even want to 
watch really

the union representing striking greyhound bus 
drivers on monday aske the company to return to the bargaining 
table to end the 4dayold walkout against the united states only 
nationwide bus system 
meanwhile a spokesman for greyhound lines inc acknowledged the 
company was losing some of the drivers it had hired to replace 
strikers 
the strike has been marred by violence and vandalism since 6300 
drivers and more than 3000 office and maintenance workers walked 
out early friday shots have been fired at buses and a striking 
driver was killed saturday in redding calif when he was crushed 
by a bus backing up to get around a picket line 
in los angeles on monday a superior court judge ordered 
striking greyhound drivers in the southwestern united states not to 
interfere with the work of newly hired replacement drivers 
the temporary restraining order by judge david yaffe applies to 
strikers from los angeles to el paso and also bars picketers from 
intimidating replacement drivers with fear of bodily harm or 
death 
union officials on monday sent a message to greyhound chairman 
fred g currey requesting a meeting with him as soon as possible 
the message asked currey to contact ed strait president of the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions or jim la sala 
international president of the amalgamated transit union 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said the company tried but 
failed to contact la sala after receiving the request monday and 
is again awaiting word from the union 
there have been no formal negotiations since talks broke off 
early friday strait met briefly friday night with p anthony 
lannie greyhounds executive vice president and chief negotiator 
at that point lannie said the union had no new proposals union 
spokesman jeffrey nelson would not say monday if the drivers had a 
revised offer to make to the company 
the two sides entered negotiations last week far apart the 
company said it couldnt afford more than the 63 million contract 
it was offering the union claimed its offer was lower than 
managements but the company valued that offer at more than 200 
million 
the company has been operating with 700 replacement drivers plus 
any union members who cross picket lines 
currey said 350 union drivers are at work and the company is 
providing about 29 percent of its normal service the union says 
only 95 members have crossed picket lines 
sources close to the union claimed monday that some replacement 
drivers have walked off the job including 32 in the companys 
central region which stretches along the northern third of the 
country from just west of pittsburgh to west of denver 
an internal message sent to some greyhound officials says the 
company is having to lower its level of service in the region 
partly due to the loss of newly hired drivers 
gravley said the change was forced because not as many 
replacements were hired for that area as had been expected and did 
not reflect defections 
there have been a few of them that have left he said and 
we are not surprised by that they knew what they were getting 
into these people were recruited and they were told honestly and 
forthrightly the nature of the work 
we told them that there could be times when they might be 
intimidated 
there have been several incidents of strikers pounding the sides 
of buses as they crossed picket lines in chicago on friday shots 
were fired at a departing bus 
on sunday charter bus drivers in spokane wash found bus 
electrical systems vandalized and a passenger in philadelphia was 
charged with spraying a striker with mace 
the aflcio on monday asked its other member unions to help 
striking driver where possible 
because greyhound bus riders are primarily students older and 
lowerincome americans you should continue to work with our allies 
in community and minority organizations to carry our message that 
scab operations will only prolong the dispute aflcio officials 
said in a letter to local officials

the national basketball association is 
crying foul at gte corp accusing the company of trademark 
infringement by launching a sweepstakes contest with a tiein to 
the nba championship series 
in a lawsuit filed last week in us district court the nba is 
asking for an injunction halting gtesylvanias step up to the 
line sweepstakes as well as unspecified monetary damages for 
alleged trademark infringement and unfair trade practices 
if the court orders the contest cancelled the suit asks that 
gte be required to notify all entrants by mail and to run 
corrective advertising 
the nba said the contest is substantially similar to a 
sweepstakes being conducted by fritolay inc which paid a 
substantial sum for the privilege to link its contest to the 
nba finals 
the gte sweepstakes is simply an attempt to take 
plaintiffs valuable property rights by improperly associating 
themselves with the good will and reputation of the nba the suit 
said 
a spokesman for stamfordbased gte said monday the company 
could not comment on the suit until its attorneys had a chance to 
study it 
fullpage advertisements for the gte sweepstakes appeared in 
inserts in newspapers and magazines nationwide on feb 18 
according to the suit the ads were constructed and designed to 
imply and suggest the sponsorship endorsement or approval of the 
nba 
ryan partnership a stamford marketing firm sought permission 
in november to use the nba trademarks for a gte sweepstakes but was 
denied the suit said a woman who answered the telephone at ryan 
said there was no one available to comment 
the nba said it sent a letter to gte and ryan on feb 26 
demanding they call a halt to the contest but that the defendants 
refused 
the gtesylvania sweepstakes ad invites entrants in the body of 
the promotion to win a trip to the championship finals and a 
share of 25000 in prizes 
in smaller print readers are advised that four grand prize 
winners will receive an expensepaid trip for a family of four to 
the first two games of the nba championship finals and that 
prizewinners will participate in a freethrow shootout with 
25000 in prizes 
in addition the official entry form states yes i would like 
to win a trip to the nba championship finals and a share of 25000 
in prizes 
the nba said gte has not been authorized to conduct any 
freethrow contest in connection with the championship series but 
that the ad falsely suggests otherwise 
entrants in the fritolay contest on the other hand are vying 
for the opportunity to win a trip to the nba playoffs and the 
chance to compete in a freethrow shooting contest during halftime 
of a conference playoff game or during game 4 of the finals the 
nba said

the dollar was sharply lower against the japanese 
yen tuesday and the key index on the tokyo stock exchange rebounded 
moderately 
trading remained light during the morning as many investors 
stayed on the sidelines anticipating the bank of japan would 
increase interest rates possibly during the afternoon 
the 225share nikkei stock average recouped 12052 points or 
036 percent ending the morning session at 3396572 on monday 
the index lost 21236 points 
the dollar ended the morning session at 14877 yen down 118 
yen from mondays close it had opened at 14897 yen and weakened 
during the morning as the bank of japan sold dollars actively to 
support its currency 
the yens rebound sparked a rally in the japanese government 
bond market that pushed down interest rates the yield on the 
benchmark no 119 10year bond fell to 7075 percent from 712 
percent late monday 
the dollar continued to weaken in tokyo after falling against 
almost all major currencies in overseas markets earlier following 
internationally coordinated intervention traders said 
central banks from japan britain france and west germany 
bought their own currencies and sold the dollar in an attempt to 
weaken the us currency said toru kanai a foreign exchange 
analyst with new japan securities co 
finance minsiter ryutaro hashimoto told reporters tuesday that 
the framework of international cooperation remains strong and 
coordinated action will continue to be taken to ensure stability in 
foreign exchange markets 
he said us concern over the dollaryen rate was made clear at 
last weekends summit meeting between us president bush and 
japanese prime minster toshiki kaifu in palm springs calif 
in rising above 150 yen in recent days the dollar hit its 
highest level since last june 
the bank of japan was seen selling some 1 billion tuesday 
morning to bolster the yen traders said the central bank does not 
comment on its market intervention activities 
many market players are now trying to reduce their 
dollarholding positions now in case the bank of japan raises its 
discount rate today kanai said 
thats mainly because they speculate there might be a raise 
before central bank governor mr yasushi mieno leaves for europe 
tomorrow and they think there will be no hike while hes gone 
until march 15 he added 
japanese markets have been expecting a discount rate hike to 
stem inflationary pressures ever since the nation held major 
parliamentary elections last month after three hikes last year 
the nations key lending rate stands at 425 percent still the 
lowest among the group of seven industrial nations 
partly as a result of the bank of japans inaction growing 
uncertainties in the market began discouraging stock investment and 
yenbuying causing a rapid decline in share prices and leading to 
a 156910point plunge feb 26 the secondworst fall ever 
on the stock exchange dealers attributed the morning rally to 
the yens strength as well as the rise in the government bond 
prices
