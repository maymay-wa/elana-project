the governing party said thursday that it and 52 of 
its members received more than 800000 in donations from the 
pinball industry at the center of japans latest scandal over 
alleged influencebuying efforts 
donations by the industry known as pachinko have been the 
subject of two days of debate in parliament this week 
the governing liberal democratic party first took up published 
allegations that legislators of the opposition socialist party used 
their influence to fight efforts to tighten regulations on the 
industry after receiving such donations 
police say the industry is a major taxevader 
questions also were raised as to whether such donations violate 
laws against political donations by foreigners and may have 
security implications 
many pachinko parlor owners are korean residents of japan and 
an estimated 30 percent have links to communist north korea 
the socialist party maintains close ties with the north the 
government recognizes only north koreas capitalist rival south 
korea 
the pronorth korean residents association denied making any 
political donations in japan 
seiji ozawa the liberal democrats secretarygeneral has 
reported 52 party members received a total of 553000 from an 
association of pachinko parlor operators said a party spokesman on 
condition of anonymity 
ozawa also said the party itself received about 278000 from 
the association from 1972 to 1989 the spokesman added 
ozawa said former prime minister noboru takeshita received 
12500 former prime minister takeo fukuda received just under 
7000 and former chief cabinet secretary masaru gotoda 34700 
prime minister toshiki kaifu and seven other cabinet members 
accepted 34500 from pinball parlor owners ozawa said he said he 
did not include them in his list because they already publicly 
announced receipt of these donations 
the socialists said earlier their investigation showed that 
party members had received 56000 in donations from the pinball 
industry 
socialist secretarygeneral tsuro yamaguchi said party officials 
found no trace of wrongdoing in the case 
the socialists urged disclosure of pinball industry donations to 
the liberal democrats 
the governing party was shaken earlier by sex and money 
scandals the scandals along with an unpopular sales tax led in 
elections in july to the partys losing its majority in 
parliaments upper house for the first time in its 34year history 
party support has been recovering in recent public opinion polls 
however 
in one scandal the recruit co an information and publishing 
conglomerate was accused of trying to buy influence among 
prominent politicians and bureaucrats with donations and cutprice 
stock sales

interviews to radio reporters the white house said wednesday 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said bush intends 
to give the radio interviews on friday afternoons it will be not 
every week but occasionally he added 
the interviews will be with radio reporters who regularly cover 
the white house fitzwater said 
bush has given numerous oneonone interviews with newspapers in 
his first 10 months in office but had not made a habit of granting 
radio interviews 
former president reagan a onetime broadcaster broadcast 
weekly saturday radio talks but bush never copied that practice 
fitzwater said the interviews would be with individual radio 
correspondents and will be exclusive to the radio receiving the 
interview just as any other interview 
he said the first one is not scheduled but bush did give an 
interview wednesday to hal bruno for the abc radio network

the environmental protection agency tightened 
controls wednesday on radioactive releases from hospitals nuclear 
power plants and other facilities although officials said in many 
cases the tougher standards already are being met 
the new regulations were issued 10 years after the federal clean 
air act called on the agency to establish emission standards for 
radioactive byproducts such releases already are controlled by the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
william rosenberg the epas assistant adminstrator for air and 
radiation said the long delay in the regulations reflects the 
difficulties the agency faces in reducing hazardous releases under 
current federal air quality laws 
he said some changes would shorten the process by years such as 
the proposal by president bush to no longer require the epa to make 
risk assessment for each type of release and instead establish 
broader requirements for industries to use the best available 
pollution control technology 
so far the epa has only established regulations for eight of the 
hundreds of toxic or carcinogenic chemicals released into the air 
by industry and other sources 
the new regulations on radionuclide emissions cover nearly 7000 
facilities most of then hospitals laboratories research 
facilities atomic power plants and uranium mines or processing 
plants where atomic materials are used causing radioactive 
byproducts to be released into the air 
under the new standards the epa aims at reducing the lifetime 
risk of cancer faced by the most exposed individuals to one in 
10000 these are people who live 70 years adjacent to the 
installations in question 
many facilities such as nuclear power plants and hospitals 
already meet such stanards but some do not the agency said 
richard guimond director of the epas office of radiation 
estimated that currently as many as 10000 people may live in areas 
where they are exposed to a higher than 1in10000 risk level 
under the new regulations that number would be cut to fewer than 
1000 people 
some environmentalists have argued the epa should use a risk 
level of 1 in 1 million even for those living close to such 
facilities but rosenberg said such a standard would be 
counterproductive since it likely would cause significant 
restrictions in the use of radioactive therapy that is aimed at 
saving lives 
guimond said the regulations likely would require no changes 
other than perhaps in record keeping at most of the facilities 
especially hospitals power plants and medical laboratories 
because they already meet the tighter risk standards 
but other facilities have risk levels as much as 6 in 10000 
at some phosphorous plants for example that will require tighter 
controls on emissions to meet the new standard he said 
according to the epa tigher controls to curb radioactive 
releases likely will be required at 
seven of the countrys 15 underground uranium mines at a cost 
to the industry of 400000 a year as many as five of the mines 
may choose instead to shut down officials said 
a number of energy department sites where excessive radon is 
released from radioactive wastes some dating back to the early 
days of the nuclear program in the 1940s and 1950s 
some of the countrys five operating elemental phosphorous 
plants where health risks to nearby residents exceed epa standards 
a phosphorous plant in pocatello idaho likely will have to install 
a 24 million scrubber to reduce emissions because radioactive 
pollution there poses an estimated cancer risk 12 times as greater 
as the 1in10000 standard allows according to the epa

ten years ago the iran hostage crisis 
transfixed two nations and alarmed the world an ap correspondent 
who helped cover the international drama has revisited the scene 
here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a leader of the iranian militants who 
stormed the us embassy in 1979 a man who now holds a seat in 
tehrans parliament says the seizure of american hostages a decade 
ago helped save the islamic revolution 
the stillardent revolutionary mohammad ibrahim azgharzadeh 
also insists that even today there can be no accommodation with 
america 
in the light of the very nature of the united states the role 
washington plays in guiding antirevolutionary elements and its 
antiislamic stand theres no possibility of considering the 
resumption of diplomatic relations azgharzadeh said 
the tehran embassy was overrun on nov 4 1979 many embassy 
personnel were soon freed but 52 diplomats and other staff members 
were held hostage for 444 days accused of operating a den of 
spies they were finally released jan 20 1981 the day jimmy 
carter left the us presidency and ronald reagan was sworn in 
the crisis was resolved when the united states pledged not to 
interfere in irans internal affairs and the two countries 
established a framework for settling billions of dollars in claims 
against each other washington severed formal relations with iran 
during the crisis and they have not been resumed 
the bearded azgharzadeh bespectacled and intense is as 
antiamerican now as he was in the chaotic early days of the 
revolution 
if the socalled embassy had not been seized and the 
americans spying activities stopped the revolution would have 
been in danger he told the associated press in an interview 
azgharzadeh 34 one of 270 members of the majlis irans 
parliament said the embassy takeover was carefully planned 
taking into account all the possible consequences 
one of these consequences was to bring down irans first 
revolutionary government headed by a liberal prime minister mehdi 
bazargan because of what azgharzadeh said was its alleged secret 
dealings with washington 
we knew that the capture of the embassy would result in the 
fall of the interim government and we had information about the 
secret dealings between the two he added 
a week before the embassy seizure bazargan had met with 
carters national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski in 
algeria two days after the hostage seizure in tehran bazargan 
resigned 
azgharzadeh said the bazargan government had refused to take any 
action against the united states and this was against the views 
of the leader of the revolution ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who 
branded the united states the great satan for supporting shah 
mohammad reza pahlavis regime brought down in february 1979 
three of us planned the seizure of the embassy because we were 
convinced that the mission was doing things other than conducting 
normal diplomatic activities azgharzadeh said 
he did not name the other organizers but several leaders of the 
embassy militants have like azgharzadeh risen to positions of 
power and influence in the past decade 
among them are hussein sheikholeslam now a deputy foreign 
minister and a key radical another is a middleranking cleric 
hojatoleslam mohammad musavi khoeiniha who was prosecutorgeneral 
until he was dropped by president hashemi rafsanjani after his 
election last july 
the former embassy compound covering a city block and sealed 
off to most iranians and all foreigners is now a school for irans 
revolutionary guards corps 
young guards with closecropped black beards symbol of 
revolutionary manhood and armed with automatic weapons stare down 
stonily from elevated sentry boxes atop the embassys perimeter 
wall along talaghani avenue in central tehran 
the walls are daubed with slogans in foothigh letters one 
reads we will make america face a severe defeat another if 
god wills this century will be the period of victory of the 
oppressed of the world over the oppressors 
officials decline to say what goes on behind the high walls of 
the sprawling compound which housed the embassy living quarters 
for diplomats and a pinestudded park 
but a cloth banner strung above the iron gates of the main 
entrance advertise classes in martial arts karate and taekwondo 
open to all who register 
ten years ago the embassy was besieged every day by thousands 
of iranians chanting support for khomeini and fired up by 
antiamerican speeches 
these days it is much more tranquil but that could be shattered 
saturday 10th anniversary of the takeover radicals have called 
for antiamerican protests although the government has not 
officially scheduled demonstrations 
officials have also said that some of the scores of iranians 
arrested earlier this year as alleged us spies will publicly 
confess in tehran on sunday probably inflaming antius passions 
at a time when rafsanjani leader of tehrans pragmatists is 
believed to be seeking to end irans political isolation

a man depicted as a good samaritan after 
the san francisco earthquake actually stole traffic flares from 
legitimate volunteers and provoked his own shooting death a police 
official said wednesday 
some news reports wrongly portrayed desoto barker a 24yearold 
former mississippian as a volunteer who helped police direct 
traffic but was shot to death by a passing motorist upset by the 
chaos said police inspector michael byrne of san francisco 
this is not a good samaritan case byrne said in a telephone 
interview 
the salvation army gave the initial favorable account of 
barkers actions but several witnesses have given a much different 
version of the events leading to his death within an hour of the 
oct 17 quake byrne said 
the inspector said barker and others apparently stole flares 
from police and legitimate volunteers directing traffic on a 
highway a few blocks from his home 
witnesses said that at one point barker used flares to stop 
traffic so he could cross a busy street to his home byrne said 
as he was crossing the street he caused a motorcycle to 
swerve out of his way the inspector said a neighbor 
28yearold william carter criticized barker 
after calling each other names mr carter challenged mr 
barker to fight byrne said witnesses said barker threatened to 
kill carter as he headed home 
barker returned five minutes later and carter fearing that 
barker would hurt him because barker had been armed with a gun 
shot him byrne said 
about two hours later carter surrendered to police he has been 
charged with murder byrne said 
barkers mother and other family members live in jonestown in 
northwest mississippi his body was returned there last week with 
the help of the salvation army

relatively brief onthejob exposure to a highly 
toxic form of asbestos appears to dramatically increase the risk of 
death from asbestosrelated illnesses according to a study 
published today 
the researchers studied 33 men who had worked in 1953 at a paper 
factory that made cigarette filters containing crocidolite fibers 
a form of asbestos twentyeight had died triple the expected 
death rate 
the increased mortality was almost entirely attributable to 18 
deaths from three asbestosassociated diseases lung cancer 
malignant mesothelioma and asbestosis the men had worked in the 
factory a median of under two years 
work exposure to other forms of asbestos also has been linked 
with lung diseases but crocidolite is thought to be especially 
hazardous 
the researchers said doctors should be alert to the appearance 
of asbestosrelated diseases from unusual sources of industrial 
exposure 
these results emphasize that intense localized occupatonal 
exposures to asbestos may have effects decades after the exposures 
cease and that such effects may remain unrecognized and 
unreported they wrote in the new england journal of medicine 
they said it is unclear whether smoking cigarettes with the 
asbestosladen filters increased the risk of disease 
the study was conducted by james a talcott of danafarber 
cancer institute in boston

a judge who called two murder victims queers 
and said he considered their homosexuality a mitigating factor in 
sentencing their killer was cleared of bias charges tuesday by a 
special master 
special master robert r murray ruled that state district judge 
jack hampton violated texas judicial code by commenting on a 
pending case but rejected allegations of bias and discrediting the 
judiciary 
murray ruled that hampton would be impartial in any case that 
came before him including those involving homosexuals 
the ruling drew an angry reaction from the dallas gay alliance 
which has urged hamptons removal from the bench since his remarks 
were published last december 
this is like saying yes he was a bigot but he wont be one 
in the future said alliance president william waybourn 
in an interview last december in which hampton discussing the 
doublemurder trial of richard lee bednarski said he considered 
the victims homosexuality as a mitigating factor when he sentenced 
him last november 
bednarski 18 could have been sentenced to life in prison but 
got 30 years from hampton for shooting two men to death in a park 
in the dec 15 interview with the dallas times herald hampton 
said these homosexuals by running around on weekends picking up 
teenage boys theyre asking for trouble they really are 
i dont much care for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys the judge said 
murray also considered statements hampton made to the associated 
press on dec 16 the day the original interview was published in 
the herald 
in that interview hampton was quoted as saying that had the 
murder victims not been out there trying to spread aids around 
theyd still be alive today 
murray a retired appellate judge from san antonio was 
appointed to make findings on the facts of the case but not to 
recommend what action if any the state commission on judicial 
conduct should take regarding hampton 
his findings are expected to be reviewed by the commission at a 
special meeting possibly in november the commission has the power 
to impose sanctions or to begin a process to remove hampton from 
the bench 
hampton acknowledged tuesday that he has seen murrays report 
but he declined to comment 
im not talking to any reporters anymore he said

a judge on tuesday ruled that the citys 
ordinance banning desecration of the american flag is 
unconstitutional and granted an injunction requested by 10 local 
artists banning enforcement of the law 
cook county circuit judge kenneth l gillis said the 7monthold 
ordinance was too vague and violated the freedom of expression by 
the artists all of whom used the flag in some form in their works 
gillis ruled on a lawsuit against the artists by the city 
the artists included dread scott tyler who was one of four 
people arrested on the steps of the us capitol on monday for 
setting fire to american flags 
a conceptual work tyler did as a student at the school of the 
art institute of chicago prompted chicagos flag desecration 
ordinance that work titled what is the proper way to display 
the us flag featured a flag laid on the floor where gallery 
visitors could step on it 
gillis ruled in march that the work did not violate illinois 
existing flag desecration law so the city council drafted the 
local ordinance which specifically forbids such display of the 
flag 
it is the nations resilience not its rigidity which is at 
work here gillis said in his injunction citing a recent us 
supreme court decision in a texas flagburning case that permitted 
such acts that ruling led to passage of a federal flag desecration

the kremlin clearly hopes president bush in an 
early december meeting with mikhail s gorbachev will be open to 
agreement on steps that would help give the battered soviet economy 
a badly needed boost 
although foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze bristled as he 
denied us reports the meeting would develop an aid plan for the 
soviet economy there was little doubt that cooperation was on the 
minds of soviet officials 
when they say to help or assist the soviet union it 
touches our national dignity because we have everything to 
implement the plans of perestroika and to lead the cause we started 
to the end shevardnadze said as the shipboard summit dec 23 
was announced tuesday 
but equal and mutually beneficial cooperation was another 
matter he said cooperation a favorable general situation in 
the external world would of course help us realize our plans 
news of the summit comes as soviet shoppers struggle to find 
groceries to put on the table 
soviet legislators on tuesday approved an emergency budget 
designed to cut in half this years 193 billion deficit by 
reducing military spending and capital outlays 
unemployment is up to 27 percent in some places with millions 
of people being thrown out of work by efforts to restructure the 
staterun economy the communist party daily newspaper pravda 
reported 
a spasm of strikes has cut the stockpile of coal for heating and 
electricity as winter approaches and the official media abounds in 
reports of mismanagement that has left vital goods sitting 
undelivered 
the tough economic situation has contributed to a dark mood 
among many soviets and there has been open talk about the 
possibility of civil war revolution or a military coup 
a meeting with bush right after his scheduled visit to italy 
emphasizes gorbachevs successes in foreign policy where he has 
accomplished much more than in his efforts to rebuild his own 
country 
gorbachev has said the defense budget will be cut by 161 
billion by the end of 1991 and he and other top soviet officials 
have said lower defense expenditures would allow the country to 
turn more attention to its ailing economy as the soviet union 
retires missiles tanks and other weapons it has turned some of 
the factories that produce them over to domestic production 
in a report on the legislative budget debate tass quoted 
communist party central committee member yevgeny velikhov as saying 
such factories should concentrate on hightechnology products that 
could bring in large amounts of foreign convertible currency 
the soviets also would like to see the end of us trade 
restrictions but officials understand that in order to join the 
international economic community the country has to make the ruble 
convertible 
the most difficult problem for us and other western businesses 
seeking to do business in the soviet union is to find a way to 
export their profits since rubles cannot be taken out of the 
country 
ruble convertibility was one of the issues that federal reserve 
system chairman alan greenspan discussed with top soviet officials 
in october 
shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii already 
had announced plans for a summit meeting between gorbachev and bush 
in 1990 that was expected to take up the possibility of deep cuts 
in both sides longrange nuclear forces 
shevardnadze said the meeting with bush would be informal and 
that no specific agreements are likely to emerge but asked about 
the 1986 summit between gorbachev and ronald reagan that approached 
a comprehensive arms control agreement despite also being billed as 
an informal meeting shevardnadze only said lets wait and see 
on oct 16 baker said the united states was prepared to provide 
advice and technical assistance to help gorbachevs restructuring 
policy baker said gorbachevs policies provide a historic 
opportunity to make lasting improvements in ussoviet relations 
in an interview monday he said gorbachev clearly faces some 
very major problems

the protester who started the furor over flag 
burning says its a miscarriage of justice that he wont be 
part of the first court test of the nations new flag protection 
law 
this is a case of selective nonprosecution attorney 
william kunstler complained tuesday after the government decided 
not to charge gregory johnson who was arrested with three other 
demonstrators during a flagburning protest monday on the capitol 
steps 
johnsons conviction for burning a flag at the 1984 republican 
national convention led to the supreme court ruling in june that 
such activity is protected under the first amendment 
charges were filed tuesday against the other three protesters 
but the us attorneys office said there was insufficient evidence 
to charge johnson 
i was there complained johnson i am outraged at not 
being prosecuted he said adding that the governments decision 
was a miscarriage of justice 
putting johnson in the case with the three other demonstrators 
would have been too much of an organizing tool for opponents of 
the new law which took effect on saturday said kunstler 
johnson who spent monday night in jail with the three 
codefendants called the governments decision an act of 
cowardice on the part of president bush and the administration 
us attorney jay stephens said his office not bush 
administration officials decided the evidence was too thin to 
charge johnson 
the charges against the three vindicate the deep offense 
americans feel regarding desecration of the national symbol 
said stephens 
the protesters chanted burn baby burn as they ripped and 
burned american flags on the capitol steps capitol police tore 
pieces of a shredded flag from the hands of one protester and later 
aimed fire extinguishers at the burning remnants 
the flag protection act of 1989 which took effect saturday 
without president bushs signature carries penalties of up to one 
year in jail and a 1000 fine for anyone who knowingly 
mutilates defaces physically defiles burns maintains on the 
floor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the united states 
bush has sought a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning 
contending that the statute would not withstand a court test 
the law sparked a series of protest flag burnings in cities 
across the country over the weekend 
us magistrate deborah robinson released the defendants on 
their own recognizance requiring them to report weekly to federal 
pretrial services offices 
the case will be assigned to a us district court judge in 
washington kunstler said he hoped the case would be before the 
supreme court on an expedited appeal within two months 
the three charged with violating the law are dave blalock a 
vietnam veteran who became an antiwar activist shawn eichman a 
24yearold new york city artist and scott tyler 24 whose 
controversial display of the flag at a chicago art exhibit earlier 
this year prompted demonstrations

the house ethics committee is laying the 
groundwork to determine whether rep robert garcia dny keeps 
his seat in the wake of his conviction for extortion and conspiracy 
a preliminary inquiry announced tuesday by the committee could 
lead to a recommendation to expel garcia who faces up to 45 years 
in prison 
the lawmaker could cut the investigation short by resigning but 
he has not said if he plans to quit 
rules of the committee on standards of official conduct the 
formal name of the ethics panel require an investigation when a 
member is convicted of an offense carrying at least a oneyear 
prison term 
a preliminary inquiry determines whether the ethics committee 
has enough evidence to issue a statement of alleged rules 
violations which is similar to an indictment in criminal cases 
the committee could then determine if any alleged violation 
occurred and whether punishment ranging from reprimand to 
expulsion should be recommended to the full house 
only the house can unseat one of its members 
garcia and his wife jane lee garcia were convicted oct 20 of 
extortion and conspiracy for taking checks and interestfree loans 
from the nowextinct wedtech corp 
a federal jury found they conspired from 1984 to 1986 to get 
175000 in payments and a 1900 emerald and diamond necklace for 
mrs garcia in exchange for garcias political influence in helping 
the military contractor get government business 
the garcias were convicted of conspiracy and two counts of 
extortion they were acquitted of bribery and receipt of illegal 
gratuities 
the conspiracy charge carries a maximum fiveyear sentence and 
each of the extortion counts carries up to 20 years sentencing 
before us district judge leonard sand is scheduled for jan 5 
garcia 56 has held his seat since 1978 
under house rules a convicted member is urged but not 
required to abstain from voting in committee or on the floor 
unless he is later cleared of wrongdoing or is reelected

a vietnamese man who rode for two days 
on a tankers rudder housing to escape his homeland has been 
granted temporary asylum in this country 
the immigration and naturalization service will let nguyen van 
tuan 23 stay for one year then decide if he can apply for 
permanent status said bill bryant a spokesman for sen claiborne 
pell dri 
the state department initially denied him asylum 
the ins found that nguyen had a wellfounded fear of persecution 
if he returned to his homeland said carl krueger a lawyer from 
the international institute of rhode island a private agency that 
handles immigration cases 
nguyen was found crouching on a makeshift plywood seat on the 
rudder housing about 4 feet above water during a lifeboat drill 
aug 30 said jerzy kolasinski captain of the cypriot tanker 
success the ship had left ho chi minh city two days earlier and 
steamed down the saigon river to the south china sea 
kolasinski said nguyen had held onto a rope hanging from the 
ship and survived only because the tanker was empty keeping the 
rudder housing above sea level 
nguyen endured two days of 100degree temperatures and had only 
a nearlyempty container of water a pack of cigarettes and a 
butane lighter when he was found 
speaking softly to translator joseph r le at a news conference 
tuesday nguyen said his family was being watched by the government 
because his father now a welder once was a soldier nguyen worked 
with his father in vietnam 
he didnt know where the vessel would go said le he 
doesnt know very much about america but hes heard that people 
are treated well 
nguyen said his parents and four siblings knew he was leaving

write to them he also said he has an uncle in california 
kolasinski had detoured to singapore and asked immigration

east providence nguyen accompanied by krueger and le was 
interviewed for five hours by an immigration official

nasas top officials are trying to assure 
skeptical congressmen that a scaleddown space station now on the 
drawing boards will have the same capabilities as originally 
promised 
space station freedom assemblycompleted is going to be 
essentially the space station freedom we have been committed to 
nasa administrator richard truly told the house science and 
technology committee on tuesday 
he said an extensive review that resulted in major technical 
changes to the proposed space station was necessary because of 
threatened cuts in nasas budget nasa he said must get off the 
funding seesaw 
we have requested multiyear appropriations for each of the 
last two years without success truly said he said longerterm 
funding is critical to the ultimate success of this program 
the space station truly said will still cost 13 billion in 
1984 dollars 19 billion currently but the cost will be spread 
over an extra 18 months because of a new schedule designed to 
stretch available funds 
the toptobottom design review of the proposed space station 
was conducted this summer when it appeared the program might be cut 
by 400 million from president bushs requested 205 billion for 
1990 the actual cut was about 200 million 
the changes angered the committee that authorizes funds for the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
william lenoir head of the nasa space station office said the 
station now estimated for completion late in the next decade 
still is being planned to house eight astronauts and to have 75 
kilowatts of electrical power 
these are the capabilities we had promised and they still will 
be there he told the house panel it will have more 
capabilities than any space station this country has ever flown or 
any country has ever flown 
truly and lenoir were summoned to the hearing by its chairman 
rep robert a roe dnj who called the revisions a great 
disappointment to the committee whose members he said had sold a 
far different project to their colleagues in the house 
todays hearing is not a pleasant occasion roe said adding 
that one capability involving the space station definitely was 
gone that is the capability as a government to set our sights on 
a goal and work toward it with a common commitment 
truly said because of the level of budget threats we were 
facing there was no other responsible management action i could 
take 
we cant continue to provide capabilities on schedule without 
money he said 
the major changes to the station are technical involving types 
of power and the means of maintaining the stations position one 
of the changes simplifies the assembly of the station in orbit 
cutting down on the amount of space walking astronauts will be 
required to do also nasa will save about 200 million by not 
developing new space suits

democrats are hailing president bushs plan 
for a high seas summit with mikhail s gorbachev but sen jesse 
helms dismisses it as a public relations move by the soviet 
president 
the bushgorbachev meeting to be held aboard us and soviet 
warships in the mediterranean could lay the groundwork for 
progress on arms control and other issues many lawmakers said if 
bush sheds what some term an overly timid approach to eastwest 
relations 
several said tuesday the meetings planned for dec 23 appear 
designed to bolster gorbachev at a time when prodemocracy 
movements in eastern europe are overshadowing his policies of 
restructuring and openness 
but the conservative helms rnc dismissed the whole process 
saying it sounds as if mr gorbachev is just engaging in more 
public relations 
i hope that no fundamental decisions of any sort will be 
made helms declared 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said the meeting is a 
very positive thing that could stimulate greater speed in 
moving on arms control proposals 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he hopes 
the meeting will aid the effort to achieve meaningful arms 
control at the summit set for next spring 
but mitchell said the announcement of the meeting does not 
change his opinion that bushs approach to increased liberalization 
in eastern europe to date has been overly cautious and timid 
one change the president could begin with is to support aid to 
poland and hungary mitchell said complaining that aid proposals 
are stalled in the senate by a republican attempt to attach a 
capital gains tax cut 
several senators noted a ussoviet summit at sea would provide 
a maximum of privacy and limited press coverage 
a saltwater summit is a good idea said sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas an informal meeting at sea could provide the right 
atmosphere to get things moving in several channels including 
trade as well as arms control 
to get away from the media and everything else for a couple of 
days could be very helpful said senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
sen steven symms ridaho also approved of a meeting on a ship 
away from the fanfare and the frivolity 
but symms had advice for bush you can always hope for the 
best with a meeting with the soviet union but you have to prepare 
for the worst 
i hope this signals a more aggressive attempt on the 
presidents part to seek to respond to a very positive turn of 
events said sen james sasser dtenn from my standpoint hes 
just been nonreactive and not involved on such matters as 
political freedoms and arms control that have traditionally been 
the backbone of american foreign policy 
but sen alan simpson rwyo the gops deputy leader said 
that kind of stuff about being timid or too cautious bounces off 
george bush like a 22rifle bullet off a tank 
sen joseph r biden ddel a senior member of the senate 
foreign relations committee said the president has obviously 
got to the point where he feels comfortable with his positions on 
glasnost and perestroika and developments in eastern europe and i 
think that was what was most needed 
sen john warner rva was asked if the meeting was a move to 
boost gorbachev at home in view of the many challenges his policies 
face 
absolutely warner replied adding we want to see 
perestroika and glasnost succeed right now those two things are 
being outpaced by events in eastern europe so it was necessary for 
gorbachev to sit down with a strong credible leader like george 
bush 
dole echoed that opinion saying obviously the soviets have 
problems obviously this is going to be helpful to mr gorbachev

of 225 selected issues rebounded in the afternoon to gain 1499 
points or 004 percent ending the day at 3556443 the nikkei 
gained 13200 points tuesday 
dealers said the index began to recover as individual investors 
bought a range of issues in the afternoon session 
most market players were reluctant to make major moves ahead of 
the us jobless rate report for october scheduled for friday they 
said 
in currency dealings the dollar was higher in tokyo following 
similar upward trends on overseas markets traders said 
although the 14250yen line was a turning point for many 
japanese investors the dollar jumped over the line overnight and 
they just let it go said yuji nakao a trader with chemical bank 
in tokyo 
comments tuesday by david mulford us treasury undersecretary 
for international affairs that the dollar has shown modest 
adjustment since the last meeting of seven major industrialized 
nations in september also prompted dollarbuying nakao said 
investors saw his comments as an indication that the us 
central bank will no longer intervene aggressively in the market at 
the current exchange rate he said 
but responding to a question from a member of the house banking 
subcommittee mulford also said intervention can send signals to 
the market and thats important 
nakao said the dollaryen rate could be stuck at the current 
level for a while 
the us economic fundamentals dont seem very good the 
trade deficit increased last month and the interest rate gaps 
between the united states and other major industrial nations are 
narrowing although demand for the us currency is still great

president bushs policies toward mikhail s 
gorbachev have undergone a sea change in the five months since his 
spokesman dismissed the soviet leader as a drugstore cowboy 
tuesdays announcement of a shipboard mediterranean minisummit 
in december is an aboutface from bushs original opposition to the 
concept of a getacquainted meeting a change of heart the 
president acknowledged 
it also is a departure from the skepticism and initial wariness 
he had voiced toward the policies of the new soviet leader 
asked pointblank tuesday if he now takes gorbachev at his word 
bush said i think hes committed to reform absolutely 
during his presidential campaign bush sought to put distance 
between himself and thenpresident reagans often ebullient praise 
of the soviet leader 
he urged caution toward gorbachevs perestroika the soviet 
word for economic restructuring and said a bush presidency 
would avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated 
pessimism 
the cold war is not over he declared in a foreign policy 
speech in san francisco on june 29 1988 
bush told a chicago audience on aug 2 1988 we should not 
let our hopes outrun our practical experience soviet ideology 
has proven bankrupt 
in his acceptance speech to the republican national convention 
later that month bush asserted a prudent skepticism is in 
order 
and it was a prudent skepticism that bush pursued early in his 
term delaying resumption of strategic arms talks for months while 
his administration conducted a wideranging foreign policy review 
bush also repeatedly voiced skepticism toward an array of 
gorbachevs arms reduction initiatives saying he didnt want to be 
stampeded into taking actions and didnt want to get into a 
public opinion battle with the charismatic soviet leader 
it was last may when gorbachev announced a unilateral cut 
in 500 shortrange weapons in eastern europe that white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater questioned the intentions of the soviet 
leader and called him a drugstore cowboy 
however since then the administrations policies have changed 
dramatically both on an overall approach toward the soviet union 
and in terms of dealing with gorbachev 
you know there was one time when i felt that such a meeting 
an informal early summit wouldnt be productive bush said on 
tuesday in his nationally televised news conference announcing the 
upcoming session 
bush and top administration officials traced the evolution in 
us policy to bushs visits in july to poland and hungary and 
then discussions with us allies at the sevennation economic 
summit in paris 
i now have a much clearer view of how our allies feel on 
eastwest relations bush said 
a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said the idea of a preliminary nonsummit summit 
came into bushs mind as he talked to officials in the two 
fastchanging eastern european nations 
the discussions ranging from polish solidarity leader lech 
walesa to communist government officials helped persuade bush that 
gorbachev was sincere in his desire for political reforms both in 
his own country and in soviet satellites 
then the official said bush discussed the situation with major 
us allies at the economic summit in paris the leaders of those 
countries expressed a hope that he would be meeting with 
gorbachev the official said 
bush solidified his plans at a meeting with top aides on the 
veranda of the us ambassadors residence in paris then 
handpenned an invitation to gorbachev while flying home to the 
united states on july 18 the official said 
although the mediterranean summit was not announced until 
tuesday it was always considered a joint venture with the 
formal bushgorbachev summit to be held in the united states next 
year which was announced in september the official said 
bush says hes pleased he changed his mind about meeting with 
gorbachev this year and thinks the ussoviet relationship is 
moving in the right direction 
im looking forward to this meeting i think its the right 
thing to be doing as i say there was a time when i wasnt sure 
that it was but with this rapidity of change i dont want to miss 
something he said

in an effort involving schoolchildren and 
corporations about 120000 old telephone directories are being 
saved from tulsas trashtoenergy plant to be recycled into tissue 
and other paper products 
its called project redirectory and it culminates saturday with 
the directory games a kind of novelty olympics at lafortune 
stadium 
i dont think anyone estimated the enthusiasm in this 
project said wayne campbell spokesman for southwestern bell 
telephone co and chairman of the effort this is raising 
everyones consciousness of recycling after this is over its 
still going to do something good for tulsa 
mayor rodger randle has endorsed the project and is having old 
telephone directories stored in the city hall basement where they 
will be available for schools or civic groups 
dozens of tulsas major companies are gathering their phone 
books for the project which coincides with distribution of the new 
directories 
collection points have been set up in stores and all 31 fire 
stations in the city for the fourweek effort campbell said 
groups from at least a dozen schools also are collecting 
telephone books the school that arrives at the games saturday with 
the most books wins 300 the games will feature bookstacking 
contests bookbalancing races a bookthrowing event and other 
contests involving directories the entry fee is one used telephone 
book per person 
cash prizes also are provided for civic groups and individuals 
who bring in the most books 
theyre really out hustling to get books were going to make 
120000 its going to happen campbell said 
that would represent about onefourth of the books distributed 
last year 
telephone directories cant be recycled as easily as newspapers 
because of the glue used in the binding and the yellow pages 
content campbell said 
directories that once brought up to 60 a ton to recyclers now 
bring only about 5 a ton he said 
its not a project anymore that can be done by boy scouts and 
girl scouts its not a moneymaker the bottom has dropped out 
of the paper market he said 
fort howard paper co in muskogee has agreed to accept the books 
for recycling campbell said 
until now campbell said the telephone companys best 
market for surplus directories was to bundle them aboard a 
freighter destined for taiwan where the directories were made into 
insulation 
a similar recycling effort was tried last year in tucson ariz 
campbell said a civic group in seattle also has gathered telephone 
directories for recycling with limited success he said 
if the tulsa project is as successful as sponsors hope 
southwestern bell will plan to make the same effort in oklahoma 
city next year when new directories are distributed there he said

a judge who refused to delay a 
pregnant womans 60day jail sentence so she could have an abortion 
admitted he acted irresponsibly in saying she wanted to murder 
her baby 
pasco county judge dan c rasmussen last week denied the womans 
request for a 10day delay of her sentence for violating probation 
on a drunken driving charge saying 
you want a continuance so you can murder your baby is that 
it 
on tuesday he said yes it is true i made the quote 
attributed to me i believe it yes it was inappropriate for me to 
state my beliefs in that forum 
the judges statement did little to calm abortion rights 
activists about 30 members of the national organization for women 
picketed outside the judges office tuesday afternoon 
pamela forney who is in her third month of pregnancy has 
remained in jail since the judges decision oct 23 sheriffs 
officials have since said they will help her get an abortion if she 
wants one because the denial of medical attention could constitute 
cruel and unusual punishment 
ms forneys attorneys wont discuss whether she will go ahead 
with an abortion 
the judge refused to take all the blame for a situation that has 
prompted the american civil liberties union to take over ms 
forneys case 
he said ms forneys own irresponsibility and the medias poor 
reporting of the case resulted in an invasion of the womans 
privacy 
the transcript reveals i was concerned with this defendants 
irresponsibility not her right to an abortion rasmussen said 
she can have an abortion now if she wants one and our sheriff 
has said he will make the necessary arrangements if she so desires 
of course she could have pleaded not guilty and had her 
hearing at a later date and not have revealed her reason 
rasmussen said news accounts of his order never reported that he 
said there are agencies out there to help you with this 
whatever your decision is you might as well take advantage of 
them you dont have to be alone 
he said the case wasnt as much about abortion as it was about 
the irresponsibility of drunken driving and the state of mind that 
contributes to the problem 
the loss of life through any irresponsible conduct is always a 
tragedy rasmussen said adding that in the future he will 
refrain from airing his personal views in open court 
an assistant to rasmussen said the judge planned no further 
comment on the case 
ms forney 26 an unmarried parttime bartender said she 
needed the delay in her sentence because she was scared that when 
she got out of jail it might be too late for a safe abortion she 
also said she was unable to financially support a child

energy department auditors say the department 
bungled its investigation of losses of nuclear bomb material from a 
government laboratory and isnt seriously studying the possibility 
of theft 
in an internal memorandum alfred k walter of the departments 
inspector generals office criticized the failure to pinpoint a 
reason for the losses and urged a special probe focused 
specifically on whether material was diverted for illicit weapons 
making 
copies of the memo dated sept 7 were released tuesday by rep 
edward markey dmass who has been critical of the departments 
handling of tritium a radioactive gas used mainly to boost the 
explosive power of nuclear warheads 
the department in recent days has acknowledged it cannot account 
for significant amounts of tritium apparently lost in transit 
from the oak ridge tenn national laboratory to several 
commercial customers it has said there is no evidence of theft 
but that this cannot be ruled out 
small amounts of tritium are sold by the energy department to 
private companies in the united states and abroad for use in 
biological and energy research and in making luminous lights and 
dials 
about 7 grams have been lost in shipping during the last two 
years according to other internal documents obtained by the 
associated press last week tritium supplies are classified by the 
government but private analysts estimate about 4 grams is needed 
to make a single nuclear warhead 
in his memo to a superior in the inspector generals office 
walter questioned why the department made no serious attempt to 
investigate the tritium losses for nearly a year after a series of 
major shipping discrepancies were reported 
the major losses were in july and august 1988 the first 
investigation began in june 1989 
walter also said results of the department investigation were 
based more on speculation than fact 
last week the lab said it had been ordered by the department to 
halt all commercial shipments until energy secretary james d 
watkins reviewed the results of the various investigations 
walter wrote that although the department has made some progress 
in attempting to explain the losses it had not given enough 
attention to the possibility of theft 
it does not appear that the department has adequately 
addressed the possible diversion of tritium walter wrote adding 
he would recommend the department start an investigation aimed 
specifically at the diversion question 
in a written statement tuesday markey said the department 
failed to take seriously enough the possibility that tritium could 
fall into unauthorized hands 
do we have to wait until pakistan libya or south africa 
announce theyve got an hbomb before we start taking the risk of 
diversion seriously markey said 
markey also released copies of an oct 16 internal memorandum 
from john layton the energy department inspector general saying 
the unanswered questions had become more troublesome in view of oak 
ridges discovery oct 5 that tritium disappearances were 
continuing 
the oct 5 report of a partial loss of a tritium shipment to 
california triggered the departments decision to halt all 
shipments from oak ridge the second stoppage in four months 
shipments were halted from late july to midaugust because of 
losses

the bush administration and the federal 
reserve are both insisting there is no major policy rift between 
the two over the proper level for interest rates 
but separate appearances on capitol hill tuesday by treasury 
undersecretary david mulford and federal reserve vice chairman 
manuel johnson revealed the white house and the fed are not 
entirely on the same wavelength on some crucial economic questions 
mulford defended the administrations efforts to push the dollar 
lower to restart stalled efforts to lower the united states huge 
trade deficit 
but johnson who followed mulford as a witness before a house 
banking subcommittee left no doubt the central bank still viewed 
fighting inflation as its no 1 priority 
he indicated that efforts to push the dollar lower to cure the 
countrys trade problems were doomed to fail as long as fundamental 
problems such as the budget deficit and americas low savings rate 
were not addressed 
many economists support the feds view contending the best way 
to correct the imbalance between us exports and imports would be 
to lower americas demand for goods by boosting the personal 
savings rate and cutting the federal budget deficit 
there is little room for substantial further reduction in us 
trade deficits absent a significant reduction of the 
savinginvestment balance johnson told the panel 
president bush and other administration officials have been 
pushing for the fed to lower interest rates to spur domestic growth 
and us exports they charge the central bank is overly worried 
about the threat inflation poses to the economy 
lower interest rates stimulate domestic demand and push the 
dollars value lower because foreign investors do not earn as much 
on their dollar assets when us interest rates are lower 
a lower dollar in turn boosts us export sales by making 
american products cheaper and thus more competitive on overseas 
markets 
the debate between the fed and the administration was brought to 
a head following a sept 23 announcement by the group of seven 
industrial nations that they planned to cooperate jointly on the 
dollar and interest rate policies in an effort to curb the dollars 
rise this year 
japan and west germany did increase rates but the federal 
reserve has not moved to lower interest rates in the united states 
mulford sought to play down news reports of a dispute between 
the fed and the administration contending the consultations 
between the treasury and the fed have been close and friendly 
there appeared to be a substantial split among members of the 
committee over the longterm success of intervention in currency 
markets the process by which governments buy and sell currencies 
on the open market in an attempt to influence their price 
rep jim leach riowa argued that with 400 billion in foreign 
currencies being traded every day foreign governments could spend 
only limited amounts to influence that process 
but mulford said joint intervention was still useful to 
demonstrate the resolve of the united states and its major allies 
to work together in solving trade imbalances and other economic 
problems 
rep john lafalce dny said the administration and treasury 
secretary nicholas brady are being complaent about the dollars 
rise this year and have not intervened quickly enough 
he said unless stronger efforts are taken backed by the fed 
the countrys trade deficit could balloon to a record 200 billion 
in a few short years 
mulford said the current account deficit which declined to 
1266 billion last year may worsen next year after two years of 
significant improvement

environmentalists say the governments plan 
for assessing damages to natural resources from the alaska oil 
spill could save exxon millions of dollars in recovery costs 
the countrys major environmental organizations said tuesday the 
plan doesnt give enough time to judge the longterm damage 
wrongly allows exxon a part in assessing some harm and puts too 
much emphasis on direct economic costs without examining damage to 
alaskas overall ecosystem 
if this draft is any indication president bush is preparing 
to let exxon off the hook said jay hair president of the 58 
millionmember national wildlife federation 
interior department spokesman bob walker said the plan may yet 
be revised and officials putting the procedures together will take 
into account the criticism and changes suggested by the 
environmental groups 
if they the environmentalists have suggestions well be glad 
to consider them said walker 
the interior department drew up the plan in august and gave 
interested parties until the end of october to comment the plan 
outlines procedures that federal trustees intend to use in 
determining what exxon will have to do to restore alaskas 
environment 
the proposed plan which will be used by the federal trustees 
overseeing the damage assessment does not set a dollar value on 
possible damages but does establish broad outlines for how damages 
are to be determined 
but environmentalists said in formal comments to the proposed 
plan that it could limit the governments ability to recover all 
natural resource losses 
the environmentalists objected most strongly to a feb 28 1990 
deadline for the completion of environmental damage studies saying 
many longterm damages from the spill cannot be determined by then 
the deadline is less than a year after the exxon valdez tanker 
ran aground in alaskas prince william sound spilling more than 10 
million gallons of oil hundreds of miles of alaska shoreline have 
been polluted and many birds and wildlife have been killed by the 
oil 
oil will not disappear in a year the environmental groups 
said in a joint statement they said such a deadline will result 
in the serious underestimation of damages and inadequate recovery 
from exxon 
they also charged that the plan ignores the big picture and 
gives too little attention to damage caused to alaskas total 
ecosystem focusing instead on damages to resources that have 
direct economic value to humans such as damage to the salmon and 
herring fisheries 
the environmentalists said the government should undertake a 
multiyear study to determine longterm effects from the oil which 
continues to pollute hundreds of miles of alaska shoreline 
the critics also objected to the proposed plans failure to 
specifically exclude exxon corp from taking part in making damage 
assessments 
given the potential liability faced by exxon the company has 
every incentive to minimize the damages and should not be relied on 
to conduct any part of the damage assessment said the 
environmental organizations 
the groups that sent a letter to bush protesting the assessment 
plan were 
the natural resources defense council national wildlife 
federation wilderness society national audubon society 
environmental defense fund defenders of wildlife the izaak walton 
league of america sierra club national parks amp conservation 
association sierra club legal defense fund center for marine 
conservation trustees for alaska and a coalition of the 
environmental policy institute friends of the earth and oceanic 
society

top thrift regulators in washington placed 
unusual restrictions on an audit of lincoln savings and loan 
association conducted after the rejection of an earlier 
examinations conclusions a field examiner says 
david w riley an examiner who helped last year with the second 
audit of lincoln and its holding company american continental 
corp said he was not allowed to see the first report prepared by 
thrift agency officials in san francisco in 1987 
he and his colleagues also were not permitted to see original 
documents only copies he said adding that they were told to 
deal with only one lincoln official and stay away from other top 
officers and were denied access to lincolns corporate 
headquarters 
these instructions were unusual riley said adding that he 
also was discouraged from criticizing lincolns high salaries 
the examiners sent from offices around the country to 
scrutinize the operations of the irvine califbased lincoln 
offered that assessment in sworn testimony tuesday to the house 
banking committee 
the panel is investigating the failure of lincoln which was 
controlled by phoenix ariz millionaire charles h keating jr 
and is expected to become the nations biggest thrift collapse at a 
cost to the government of up to 2 billion 
the committee is focusing on why m danny wall director of the 
office of thrift supervision rejected a 1987 recommendation to 
close lincoln from his agencys san francisco office instead 
ordering a second examination that delayed government seizure of 
lincoln until april 1989 walls office formerly was known as the 
federal home loan bank board 
kevin oconnell the thrift agency supervisory agent in charge 
of lincoln disputed rileys complaints saying in a telephone 
interview certainly it was an unusual exam but the end 
product was we found significant insider abuse and far more losses 
than the previous exam had found and we were the ones who 
finally seized the institution 
also at tuesdays hearing california state savings and loan 
examiner richard e newsom testified that three months ago he 
referred to the fbi documents showing that keating contributed 
850000 to three voter registration drives after he was solicited 
by sen alan cranston dcalif 
the contributions have been previously reported but were not 
known to be the subject of an fbi probe they included 400000 to 
the center for participation in democracy which was run by 
cranstons son kim cranston and 325000 for the forum institute 
which in 1987 gave 550000 to a group headed by kim cranston 
called the organizing institute 
in march newsom also referred to the fbi a document identifying 
a top aide to sen dennis deconcini dariz as a principal in ra 
homes inc which failed to pay back a 30 million loan from 
lincoln 
cranston and deconcini were two of the five senators who met 
with federal regulators on lincolns behalf in april 1987 all five 
have received campaign contributions from keating although 
deconcini and sen donald w riegle jr dmich have returned 
theirs 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house panel 
said after the hearing that no decision has been made about whether 
to subpoena the senators or ask them to testify gonzalez said 
cranston and riegle have offered to appear before the committee 
the others are sens john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
keatings attorney leonard bickwit said keating will appear 
before the house panel as scheduled on nov 7 but he would not say 
if the sampl executive will respond to questions 
he said allegations made against keating tuesday were 
groundless and complained that the hearings had become shrill 
and unreasonable 
meanwhile two officials of the seattle district of walls 
agency testified that last year a top thrift agency official 
regulation director darrel dochow urged them to consider approving 
the purchase of a small ailing sampl in oregon by lincoln 
patricia a mcjoynt senior vice president of the agencys 
seattle office said keating acknowledged he sought the acquisition 
so he could move his headquarters to oregon and escape the 
regulatory jurisdiction of the san francisco office which a year 
earlier had recommended that lincoln be closed

texas air corp owner frank lorenzo would be 
barred from buying any more airlines under an amendment approved by 
the house 
despite opposition from both democratic and republican sponsors 
of an airline takeover bill the house voted 283132 on tuesday to 
add the antilorenzo language to the bill 
the house was resuming debate with a final debate expected 
today the legislation would give the transportation secretary 
expanded power to stop airline buyouts or mergers before a 
transaction is completed current law allows for a review of 
safety financial fitness and foreign ownership only after a sale 
is completed 
the amendment sponsored by rep douglas bosco dcalif does 
not mention lorenzo but prohibits purchase of an airline by anyone 
who has taken more than one airline into bankruptcy 
lorenzo reorganized continental airlines under bankruptcy laws 
and earlier this year began similar action with strikebound 
eastern airlines 
bosco dubbed it the twotime loser amendment opponents 
labeled it the dont let frank lorenzo take over another 
airline amendment 
the main bill which had broad bipartisan support in the 
committee that sent it to the house floor is opposed by the bush 
administration transportation secretary samuel skinner said monday 
he doesnt need new powers to stop takeovers that would hurt the 
aviation industry 
the legislation broadens the secretarys authority to stop sales 
that would inhibit competition or lead to a selloff of an 
airlines assets 
rep james oberstar dminn chairman of the public works 
aviation subcommittee said although he didnt want lorenzo to 
acquire another airline the main bill gives the secretary enough 
power to stop lorenzo or any other unworthy owner 
rep peter defazio dore said the amendment would exclude 
flybynight artists those who bankrupt airlines for shortterm 
gain and make themselves fabulously wealthy while the consumers 
of the airline are left holding worthless pieces of paper that only 
moments before were tickets 
rep tom delay rtexas said prohibiting owners with a record 
of bankruptcy could result in disastrous consequences for airline 
competition 
he said without lorenzos actions the country would have two 
fewer major airlines and 54000 fewer jobs delay said since 
continental filed for bankruptcy it has grown into a 50 percent 
bigger carrier serving 100 cities with 34000 employees

private pension coverage is declining among 
us workers particularly younger employees suggesting future 
retirees may depend more on social security and other kinds of 
retirement income a government report says 
the share of fulltime private workers participating in 
employerfinanced pension plans fell to 46 percent last year from 
48 percent in 1983 and 50 percent in 1979 according to a report 
tuesday in social securitys monthly bulletin 
because coverage rates probably were underestimated by 1 to 2 
percentage points in 1979 and 1983 the decrease may be more 
pronounced the report said 
the decline represents a reversal from the growth of earlier 
decades when pension coverage rose from about onefourth of 
private workers in the early 1950s to onehalf by the late 1970s 
the statistics suggest decreasing rates of private pension 
receipt among future generations of retired workers and a 
corresponding increased reliance on other sources of retirement 
income including social security benefits the report said 
the employee benefits research institute a nonprofit research 
group attributed the decline in part to employment shifts toward 
industries with lower pension coverage and to a drop in the number 
of union workers whose coverage rates are higher 
merton bernstein a law professor at washington university in 
st louis said employment has been shrinking in areas such as 
manufacturing that traditionally have had high rates of pension 
coverage areas where employment is expanding such as service and 
retail jobs traditionally have low pension coverage he said 
he said less pension coverage would cause a greater drain on 
many government services 
future retirees without private pensions may have to delay 
retirement or they may have a very inadequate income the less 
adequate income is the more demand there is for other government 
services such as medical care and supplementary income he said 
the social security report written by john r woods of the 
agencys office of research and statistics found the declines in 
pension coverage have been concentrated among younger workers 
and primarily among younger men 
coverage among those ages 1624 dropped by 10 percentage points 
from 31 percent in 1972 to 21 percent last year and coverage rates 
fell 6 percentage points for those 2529 and 4 percentage points 
for those 3034 coverage was virtually unchanged for those 3554 
and rose for those 55 and older 
the report said coverage rates for women which traditionally 
have lagged behind those for men have been steadily gaining 
ground with the gap narrowing from 16 percentage points in 1972 to 
6 percentage points by 1988 
last year 49 percent of fulltime male workers were covered 
compared with 43 percent of women 
while younger women achieved parity with men in pension 
coverage it was at relatively low levels of coverage the report 
said middleaged and older women made more significant gains but 
men in those age groups continued to have coverage rates that were 
8 to 14 percentage points higher it said 
the report also detected a shift from traditional 
definedbenefit pension plans toward 401ktype retirement savings 
plans that allow employees to make taxdeferred contributions to 
their retirement accounts 
of the 46 percent of fulltime workers participating in 
employerfinanced pension plans 7 percent were covered only by a 
pretax retirement savings plan comparable information for earlier 
years was limited but data suggest pretax coverage has 
increased substantially in recent years and that coverage under 
defined benefit plans has declined substantially the report said

the dollar surged against the japanese yen today 
while the tokyo stock exchanges key index recovered from early 
losses to close slightly higher 
the 225issue nikkei stock average more than made up its 
9554point morning losses to climb 1499 points or 004 percent 
closing at 3556443 it gained 13200 points tuesday 
an active 900 million shares traded hands but buying pressure 
was limited by investors concerns over the yens weakness against 
the dollar and speculation on possible domestic interest rate 
rises a dealer with nomura securities said on condition of 
anonymity 
in currency dealings the dollar ended trading at 14308 yen up 
093 yen from tuesdays 14215yen finish the currency started 
trading at 14280 yen and ranged between 14277 yen and 14315 yen 
todays trading was dominated by dollarbuying said masaaki 
tanahashi a trader at mitsui bank in tokyo 
the dollar continued to rise as institutional investors and 
investment trust companies bought so much of it compared to little 
amount sold he said 
tanahashi said the dollar continued to strengthen in tokyo 
following an overnight surge in new york surpassing the 
psychological barrier of 14250 yen 
they market players just let it go after the dollar jumped 
over the line overnight said yuji nakao a trader at chemical bank 
in tokyo 
tanahashi said the dollars recent strength was difficult to 
understand given economic data indicating the united states could 
fall into stagflation rising prices without economic growth 
regardless of the economic fundamentals there is large demand 
from institutional investors he said 
nakao said comments tuesday by david mulford treasury 
undersecretary for international affairs that the dollar has shown 
modest adjustment since the last meeting of the group of seven 
major industrialized nations in september prompted the 
dollarbuying in tokyo 
investors saw his comments as an indication the us central 
bank is no longer intervening aggressively in the market at the 
current exchange rate he said 
other traders said fridays us jobless rate release is being 
watched carefully as another important economic indicator

the prices farmers get for raw products are 
picking up this fall according to agriculture department price 
watchers 
preliminary figures reported tuesday showed the farm price index 
rising 07 percent from september to october in september usda 
reported the monthly index dropped 07 percent 
the preliminary figures for october also left the index 07 
percent above the yearago level 
higher prices for hogs milk lettuce and tomatoes were mostly 
responsible for the increase from the september average the 
departments agricultural statistics board said lower prices were 
reported for broilers soybeans cattle and corn 
prices for hogs milk and oranges were major contributors to 
the increase over a year ago but lower prices for soybeans corn 
and broilers were partially offsetting the report said 
meanwhile prices paid by farmers to meet expenses a figure 
computed only every three months was unchanged from july but 
averaged 29 percent more than in oct 1988 
compared to july prices were up for feeder livestock but down 
for feed and gasoline the report said 
a survey made twice a year showed prices farmers pay for 
building and fencing material and machinery were up generally from 
last spring fertilizer prices however were down from the april 
survey 
department economists say net cash income of farmers gross 
cash income minus cash expenses is expected to decline from last 
years record of 599 billion to a range of 52 billion to 57 
billion 
economists say the cash income decline this year is expected to 
stem from farmers larger cash expenses as they boost plantings 
and also because of lower federal subsidies 
usda economists expect consumer food prices to rise about 6 
percent this year following a 41 percent increase in 1988 no 
forecast has yet been issued by the department for 1990 but some 
in the agency believe next years increase will be less than 6 
percent

the governments national research council is 
telling the world where to find the lost treasures of the incas 
not gold but 31 different crops that could enrich diets here and 
in many other countries 
for example few people outside peru and bolivia have heard of 
ahipa a white tuber the council says is succulent flavorful and 
crisp as an apple even when cooked with a bolivian variety coming 
in purple or magenta stripes it can adorn a salad while adding 
flavor 
nearly 500 years ago the inca empire spread over 2500 miles 
from what is now southern colombia to central chile 
but it was conquered for its gold and silver by a small band of 
spaniards under francisco pizarro who executed the last inca 
ruler atahualpa despite a huge ransom paid in precious metals 
but while conquerors were searching for gold and other 
treasures the incas were growing some 70 crops more than in 
europe and asia combined 
more than 30 of the crops still being grown are described in 
lost crops of the incas a 427page volume published by the 
council earlier this month 
the potato is the one crop from the andes mountain region that 
spread quickly through the rest of the world because the study 
says it was convenient in the silver mines and on the galleons 
that carried silver to spain 
the spaniards considered inca crops inferior and insisted 
european foods like carrots and barley be grown instead but 
peruvians in remote areas still cultivate their own plants today 
the panel found ahipa which has been grown in denmark a likely 
candidate for wider modern consumption because it is small tasty 
and adaptable 
the plant thrives even in short periods of daylight unlike 
other root crops it has bacteria in the root that help fertilize 
it so it can grow in otherwise unfavorable areas 
ahipa resembles jicama which is already sold in many 
supermarkets and is popular with people who look for specialty 
vegetables the authors of the report think ahipa could be grown in 
the united states and parts of europe japan australia and new 
zealand 
many of the other plants could also tickle the america taste 
theres a bean that pops like popcorn a kind of potato with a 
buttery taste and another thats slightly acid so that it wouldnt 
need sour cream when baked 
there are at least five more varieties of potatoes unknown 
outside the region 
some are golden yellow inside a number have a decidedly nutty 
taste and almost all are more concentrated in nutrients than the 
common potato the study said 
the hardy oca has become popular in new zealand it looks like a 
stubby wrinkled carrot in a variety of shades of pink red and 
yellow the books authors think it has a future in highland areas 
and its being tried in nepal 
an international conference three years ago proposed that the 
seed called tarwi or chocho in latin america be rebaptized with the 
more romantic name of andean lupin because of its brilliant 
blue blossoms it contains more protein than peas and beans and 20 
percent of the oil researchers are working on it in britain east 
and west germany poland and the soviet union 
some have created sweet varieties that get rid of most of 
its natural bitterness so the seeds need little or no washing 
the authors are optimistic inca foods can win acceptance 
the english refused to eat potatoes for two centuries in part 
because the irish ate them they said northern european 
ignored tomatoes even longer in part because italians ate them and 
even today in the united states collard greens are unacceptable to 
many people who consider them poor folks food

federal inspectors are reviewing travel and 
other expenses martha hesse billed the government during her three 
years as chairwoman of the federal energy regulatory commission an 
agency spokesman says 
the expenses include the cost of official trips abroad and 
several personal costs including repairs to mrs hesses car and a 
374 reimbursement for a blouse that was ripped on the job 
ron harris a commission spokesman said tuesday the energy 
departments inspector generals office began reviewing the 
documents early last week the commission is part of the energy 
department its five members are appointed by the president 
harris said mrs hesse would not answer a reporters questions 
about the auditors review but he said she believed she had done 
nothing wrong 
everything was approved everything was legal he said 
harris said the auditors were given commission documents on mrs 
hesses official travel expenses and spending related to security 
precautions taken by the government in response to alleged personal 
threats against mrs hesse 
harris said there had been no allegations of wrongdoing he said 
he did not know what triggered the inspector generals interest in 
mrs hesses official expenses 
the inspector generals inquiry was first reported in mondays 
editions of the weekly publication legal times it reported that 
among other personal charges billed to the government by mrs hesse 
was 374 to replace a 535 blouse torn on the job 
the legal times also cited commission documents indicating mrs 
hesse had taken 11 foreign trips as commission chairman since 1987 
and that this year she has made at least 19 domestic trips it said 
the foreign trips cost the government 28000 
harris said all the reported trips were speaking engagements 
mrs hesse accepted as a spokeswoman for federal regulation of us 
energy and power industries 
harris acknowledged mrs hesse has traveled more frequently than 
her predecessors but said it was just her style to keep a 
heavier schedule of public speaking 
the legal times also reported the government paid 3825 for a 
home security system and 3090 for a cellular phone for mrs 
hesse it said the equipment was necessary because of allegations 
that her former government chauffeur threatened her numerous times

a senate panel will continue the investigation 
of multibillion scandals at the department of housing and urban 
development now that a house committee is stymied by the refusal of 
former top officials to testify 
our goal is to make sure our housing program doesnt get 
sacked again said sen bob graham dfla who was named 
chairman of the special investigations subcommittee of the senate 
banking committee 
working with our colleagues in the house well establish 
causes for the breakdown at hud and propose corrective 
legislation he said 
sen donald riegle dmich chairman of the banking committee 
announced the new panel tuesday and named graham as chairman 
graham said no decision was made on whether the panel would seek 
testimony from former hud secretary samuel pierce jr who has 
refused to testify before a house investigative panel by invoking 
constitutional guarantees against selfincrimination or three 
former aides who have also refused to testify 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the government operations 
employment and housing subcommittee said last week after pierces 
second refusal to testify that his panel was about to wrap up the 
hearings it began last spring 
the subcommittee conducted a long series of hearings on 
influencepeddling fraud and mismanagement that hud secretary jack 
kemp acknowledged he found at the department 
graham presided over a hearing tuesday by the senate banking 
committee on hud in which a pair of former reagan white house 
officials denied they exerted any influence for projects seeking 
hud grants 
a third witness william m diefenderfer iii deputy director of 
the office of management and budget acknowledged a massive 
failure of collective oversight responsibilities which includes 
omb was responsible for the hud scandals 
the cost of the scandals has been estimated at 2 billion to 6 
billion or more 
there was a particular responsibility on the reagan 
administration because they had given such a high visibility to the 
elimination of waste fraud and abuse that had become almost a 
litany graham said 
the cliche of waste fraud and abuse was just that it was 
a banner with no substance he said 
richard h davis former associate director for cabinet affairs 
at the reagan white house and assistant attorney general carol 
crawford who during the reagan administration was associate 
director for economics and governments at omb also testified 
davis who was the white house liaison to hud said he talked 
daily with pierces executive assistant deborah gore dean who has 
cited her fifth amendment rights in refusing to testify before 
congress but davis said he only passed along correspondence or 
calls the white house received from political figures or others 
with no value judgment 
i cant recall an instance where i was advocating a particular 
project with miss dean davis said 
sen alfonse damato rny who has come under scrutiny in the 
hud investigations because of his active role in securing hud 
grants offered a spirited defense of such congressional efforts in 
a statement before the committee 
he said legitimate efforts by members of congress on behalf of 
prospective hud projects were tarnished by revelations of big fees 
paid to consultants to obtain hud grants sometimes my blood 
boils when i see activities of us in the senate lumped with the 
hud scandal damato said 
also named to the new panel besides graham were republican 
sens connie mack of florida and christopher bond of missouri and 
democratic sens richard c shelby of alabama and richard bryan of 
nevada

prime minister benazir bhutto 
weathered the first major political test of her 11monthold 
government today surviving a noconfidence motion in parliament 
the opposition failed to secure the necessary majority in the 
237seat national assembly mustering just 107 votes ms bhuttos 
governing pakistan peoples party has 116 seats in the chamber 
i have no rancor nor any ill will against those who have moved 
the notrust motion against me ms bhutto said after house 
speaker meraj khalid read the count with todays clear vote of 
confidence in the government of pakistan this chapter is closed 
the debate lasted just 2 hours despite predictions it might 
stretch on until thursday 
the noconfidence motion the first in the governments 42year 
history stemmed from brutal ethnic violence in this nation of 109 
million people 
the violence has chipped away at ms bhuttos power base 
turning the slums of karachi pakistans largest city into 
virtual war zones and creating a big business in illegal arms 
some observers feared before the vote that whatever the outcome 
it could ignite new violence 
ms bhutto 36 who is expecting her second child by the end of 
the year told a crowded news conference her party wants to open 
negotiations with some of her opponents 
this is a time for reflection by the government she said 
we are exploring the possibility of negotiating with the more 
moderate elements of our opposition 
she ruled out early elections predicting her party would be 
returned with a simple majority as it was in november 1988 
ms bhuttos supporters rose in applause as she entered the 
chamber at the start of the debate clad in a loose green native 
dress and a white scarf the colors of the pakistani flag 
her entrance interrupted a speech by fazle urrehman of the 
small moslem fundamentalist jamaatiulemaiislam party who said 
he objected to ms bhuttos leadership because she is a woman 
lawmakers received a military escort to the flat modern 
building that houses the legislature which was protected by a ring 
of troops and police 
the extraordinary security was provided at the request of the 
opposition helmeted troops in khaki uniforms some gripping 
machine guns manned barricades in a 3500yard radius of the 
assembly the policymaking lower house of parliament 
police in riot gear patrolled intersections near the building 
but there were no signs of trouble 
authorities banned demonstrations in islamabad and some other 
pakistani cities to prevent any clashes between pro and 
antigovernment forces 
ms bhuttos opposition most of whom belong to the nineparty 
islamic democratic alliance sought the noconfidence motion after 
a small party of indian immigrants who had supported the government 
abruptly changed sides on oct 23 
the immigrants called mohajirs accused the 11monthold 
cabinet of failing to fulfill promises to combat discrimination and 
provide more jobs 
ms bhutto denied the accusations and her aides alleged the 
party was dishonestly lured into the opposition camp 
both sides in the quarrel have accused the other of bribery and 
coercion as they scrambled for votes in the days leading up to the 
noconfidence vote 
ms bhuttos party emerged as the countrys largest one year ago 
in pakistans first free elections after 11 years of military rule 
under late president gen mohammad zia ulhaq who died in a plane 
crash in august 1988

the boeing corp has invited three japanese firms 
to participate as equal partners in the development of a new 
300seat jetliner one of the japanese companies said today 
a spokesman for kawasaki heavy industries ltd said chairman 
kenko hasegawa and the chairmen of mitsubishi heavy industries ltd 
and fuji heavy industries ltd received official invitations from 
boeing to join in the design production and sale of the new 767x 
the widebody designed for fuel efficiency and quiet 
performance would be seattlebased boeings entry in the 
300passenger jetliner class 
the european joint venture airbus industrie and mcdonnell 
douglas of the united states now dominate that market 
the three japanese firms long have had close ties with boeing 
and now act as subcontractors for the boeing 737 747 and 757 
series of jets boeings new proposal would enable the japanese to 
participate in all aspects of the planes production and marketing 
it will allow us to learn both the hard and soft aspects of 
the airplane industry from a toplevel firm said a mitsubishi 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
so far japanese firms have been minor players in the world 
aircraft market producing just one civilian airliner entirely 
designed and manufactured in japan the ys11 a turboprop plane 
for 60 passengers 
the 767x project also might compete for time and resources with 
a japanese governmentsponsored program to produce a small 
energyefficient plane the companies say 
they said they will consider boeings offer only after extensive 
studies of the feasibility of the 767x 
dick schleh of boeing said the 767x has been under consideration 
for more than a year and discussions with fuji kawasaki and 
mitsubishi have been going on for three months or more 
so far there has been no decision on whether to proceed with 
the 767x schleh said 
japan also produces but does not export military planes 
mostly under license from us manufacturers 
it has agreed with the united states on joint development of 
japans next generation jet fighter the fsx critics in the united 
states say the 6 billion project amounts to a giveaway of us 
technology that japan could use to become competitive in the 
civilian aircraft market 
defenders of the arrangement note that japan originally wanted 
to develop the fighter on its own and say there will be a mutually 
beneficial exchange of technology they say the project is 
important to usjapan defense ties and will provide about 25 
billion worth of work for american companies 
the new plane is to be based on general dynamics corps f16 
the weekly japan economic journal said this week that the 767xs 
total development cost is estimated at 4 billion and the three 
japanese firms are expected to bear about 20 percent of that 
the first jetliner in boeings 767 series began service in 
september 1982 the largest version the 767300 has 261 seats a 
range of 4100 miles and a cost of 75 million to 80 million 
boeings largest plane the 747400 can seat as many as 509 
passengers

a guilty plea by gulf power co has ended one 
phase of a lengthy federal investigation of the florida utilitys 
corporate parent the southern co but the overall probe continues 
for more than a year a federal grand jury has investigated 
allegations of tax fraud improper accounting and illegal political 
contributions by atlantabased southern and some of its five 
utility subsidiaries 
on tuesday pensacolabased gulf power pleaded guilty to charges 
of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and to impede 
the internal revenue service the company paid a 500000 fine 
which it may not pass along to its customers 
us attorney robert l barr jr said he considered the gulf 
power plea significant but said his office still has much work in 
the southern co case 
the investigation is a very active one barr said we 
anticipate further activity but exactly what will happen i cant 
say 
the investigation of gulf power drew attention because of a 
mysterious plane crash april 10 that killed a key figure in the 
investigation and the discovery of a dead canary perceived as a 
ganglandstyle warning against singing by a grand jury 
witness 
barr said the crash which killed former gulf power senior vice 
president jake horton and two southern co pilots remains under 
investigation 
gulf power admitted a longrunning scheme in which the company 
contributed to various political campaigns and disguised the 
payments through padded invoices from companies that did business 
with the utility said a governmentfiled criminal information 
the company blamed most of the illegal activities on horton 
the government said the contributions were made mainly to 
florida legislative candidates but also included some for 
presidential candidates contributions went indirectly to 
thendemocratic presidential hopefuls albert gore gary hart and 
john glenn the atlanta constitution reported today 
we acknowledge with deep regret that federal statutes were 
violated and we must accept full responsibility for the actions of 
a member of our management team said a statement from southern 
co president edward l addison and gulf power president douglas l 
mccrary 
horton 57 died en route to atlanta after being told he might 
be dismissed because of alleged accounting improprieties uncovered 
in a company audit 
among other things the government said horton pressured 
vendors of the utility primarily three advertising agencies to 
contribute to political candidates 
gulf power was interested mainly in candidates for president of 
the florida senate and speaker of the florida house because those 
positions have influence in appointing members to the state public 
service commission the government documents said 
a panel of gulf power executives including horton decided 
which candidates were good for gulf power according to the 
criminal information 
horton and others instructed the vendors to make the 
contributions and then submit fraudulent invoices to the utility so 
that the vendors could be reimbursed the information said 
carter haynes a gulf power spokesman in pensacola said two 
other executives named in the agreement as having involvement with 
horton in political contributions left the company in the past week 
ray yarborough 62 took early retirement and doug knowles 42 
resigned haynes wouldnt say if the departures were related to the 
guilty plea 
the utility said gulf powers management structure has been 
reorganized a comprehensive ethics code for employees has been 
adopted and vendors have been told they are not expected to make 
contributions as a condition of doing business with the utility

of course unless that horse is a donkey named amos 
the question of amoss horsehood has been nagging question in 
this township but a judge is about to apply some horse sense and 
settle the dispute between the knowles family and municipal 
officals 
the officials say amos is a horse that should be ridden out of 
town thats because an ordinance limits property owners to one 
horse or pony per acre of property and the family already has two 
horses plus amos on its two acres 
sharon and michael knowles say the 250pound donkey is a pet and 
should be able to kick around on their property 
id say its a horse of a different color said township 
zoning officer wayne pilato 
citing a dictionary definition that places donkeys in the horse 
family pilato told municipal judge george esposito that amos 
should be subject to the same law that limits horses and ponies 
but ms knowles is adamant the law is very clearly written 
she said it says horses or ponies it doesnt say horses or 
ponies or their relatives 
besides she said amos is more like a big dog 
the judge was expected to issue his ruling by the end of the

a longtime companion and an exwife of the late 
abbie hoffman are criticizing connie chungs cbstv show for what 
they say are its plans to to dramatize one aspect of his life his 
manicdepressive illness 
the companion johanna lawrenson said in an interview tuesday 
she particularly objected to the dramatized segment in saturday 
night with connie chung being done in what is said to be a news 
program 
my basic complaint is that docutainment presented as news 
with hired actors is certainly not a form that should be used at 
all for news she said in a telephone interview from her 
manhattan apartment 
it should not be done either with a person who is not here 
to defend himself she said referring to hoffman the founder of 
the yippie radical movement he died last april at age 52 in what a 
coroner said was suicide 
cbs news president david burke did not respond to a request for 
comment 
lawrenson who said she lived with hoffman for 15 years spoke a 
few days after writing a letter to cbs the oct 23 letter also was 
from hoffmans former wife anita and one of hoffmans three 
children america 
the letter sent to chung andrew lack executive producer of 
her show and burke called the planned segment unfair and 
exploitative 
lawrenson said she had received no reply from cbs 
the letter made available by lawrenson included a 36page script 
thatshe said was of the hoffman segment in which actor paul leiber 
plays hoffman the script was sent her by mail but the sender did 
not give his or her name or a return address she said 
in a telephone interview chung said no date had been set for 
the broadcast of the segment she also said she had seen the 
letter but declined to comment on its accusations the segment or 
say if those complaining about the segment would be invited on her 
show to discuss it 
its a story in progress and we never talk about stories in 
progress she said 
her shows recreations are interspered with interviews of 
people connected with the topic or news figure of a segment the 
show made by cbs news has been criticized by traditionalists for 
its use of actors and reenactments 
chung whose show succeeded lacks previous west 57th 
series said the main point of such criticism seems that a viewer 
might have difficulty determining between what is real and what is 
portrayed 
and i think in what we do the viewer has no confusion 
suffers no confusion i think anyone who watches our program 
can see that

a communications device lost by a 
us submarine and sold at a wreckage sale for 50 turned out to be 
worth a lot more and the americans want it back newspapers 
reported today 
but mogens soerensen the 41yearold electrical engineer who 
bought the device at the auction has turned down a 500 offer from 
the us embassy 
the device is a paravane which submerged submarines release 
towards the surface to receive longfrequency radio messages 
the components alone in the paravane are worth more than 
500 i cant say how much i want for it my professional interest 
in the paravane cant be measured in money soerensen was quoted 
as saying in the jyllandposten newpaper 
estimates of the paravanes value range from 30000 to 800000 
the device which looks like an inverted dingy with three fins 
at the bow washed ashore on denmarks west coast last summer it 
came from an american nuclearpower submarine on patrol in the the 
atlantic according to reports 
local police notified danish naval authorities who failed to 
react to news of the find and it was put up for auction in the 
town of hjoerring 
the us embassy is negotiating with the danish government for 
its return the newspaper said 
a few years ago soerensen bought a soviet paravane from a 
fisherman who caught the receiver in his net but danish military 
intelligence seized it 
soerensen who heads an electronics workshop connected with 
denmarks state fisheries and marine research institute has hidden 
his latest acquisition until it can be sold to the highest bidder

a state appeals court upheld the final 
murder conviction of a couple who said their three victims were 
witches who had to be killed 
michael and suzan carson described themselves in a 1983 
jailhouse interview as religious warriors involved in a holy war 
against witches 
police said they confessed at that time to the three killings 
in san francisco humboldt and sonoma counties between 1981 and 
1983 in each case they were convicted and sentenced to at least 25 
years to life in prison 
the 1st district court of appeal which had upheld the carsons 
two other convictions on tuesday affirmed 30 the third conviction 
in the may 1982 shooting death of clark stephens near the humboldt 
county community of garberville 
police quoted the carsons as describing stephens as a petty 
witch and a demon who wanted to live off suzans life 
officers said michael carson also accused stephens of a sexual 
attack against suzan they quoted michael as saying he had to kill 
stephens under an islamic command as he viewed it to defend his 
wife 
michael shot stephens and suzan who was present at the 
killing helped drag the body to a gravesite and burn it the court 
said 
the appeals court rejected the carsons claims that their 
confession had been coerced saying the same arguments had been 
resolved in the previous two cases and could not be reopened 
the court also rejected suzan carsons argument that a portion 
of her husbands confession had been used improperly against her 
in that portion michael said their attacks have really been 
ordered by suzan suzan then interrupted and said by 
allah michael continued right i mean but by suzans 
voice to me 
justice donald king said the evidence did not violate legal 
rules that limit use of outofcourt confessions by one person 
implicating another 
suzan by adding the explanation that allah had given orders 
through her thereby adopted michaels confession and made it her 
own king said 
the carsons were also convicted of the 1981 murder of keryn 
barnes who lived with them in san francisco and the 1983 murder 
of jon hellyar who had picked them up hitchhiking and taken them 
to sonoma county

a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton discovered by 
a pair of amateur fossil hunters is yielding new insights on the 
fearsome carnivore because it includes the only complete arm yet 
found 
paleontologists unearthing the fossilized skeleton in the 
badlands of eastern montana say it appears to be the most complete 
yet found of the biggest species of predatory dinosaur 
were pretty excited said patrick leiggi one of those at 
the site t rex may be a household name among dinosaurs but no 
ones ever found a complete one and thats what weve done 
the skeleton was spotted a year ago by tom and kathy wankel of 
angela mont on a fossilhunting trip they picked up some bones 
they found protruding from the ground and turned them over to 
experts at the museum of the rockies in bozeman 
we decided that what we had didnt mean much to us and might 
be important to someone else mrs wankel said tuesday at the 
museum they were very excited they knew immediately that it was 
part of the shoulder blade and arm of a large carnivore 
the pieces brought to the museum by the wankels proved to be the 
most complete arm of a trex ever discovered according to jack 
horner head of the museums paleontology effort it will help 
researchers learn how the short but strong arms of the dinosaur 
were used 
the crew from the museum began digging up the fossils last 
month theyre keeping the exact location of the find secret to 
deter looting generally its in the hells creek area north of 
jordan a rich area for dinosaur hunters 
working in a pit 20 feet long and up to 10 feet wide workers 
uncovered 24 connected vertebrae in a serpentine pattern preserved 
in spot where the dinosaur died 65 million years ago 
trex skeletons are rare only nine nearly complete skeletons 
have ever been discovered and all but two came from montana only 
three complete skulls have been found 
although an adult trex could be to 35 feet long 18 feet high 
and weigh as much as an elephant at nearly 65 tons the arms were 
no longer than an adult man researchers had theorized that the 
arms were either used only for mating or perhaps were slowly 
evolving away 
matt smith of the museums paleontology crew said that studying 
the bones found by the wankels show that the arm was very stout 
and very strong 
until now all the trex skeletons found in montana have been 
shipped to museums out of state but this one will stay at the 
museum of the rockies

rifletoting police disappeared from outside the 
us embassy today for the first time since june after former 
president nixon told the chinese he didnt want to visit an embassy 
surrounded by guns 
an american diplomat told nixon he had accomplished in one day 
what the embassy had been trying to achieve for five months 
also today nixon told one of chinas hardline leaders that 
many americans feel the june crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators was excessive and unjustified and question 
whether political repression in china is permanent 
nixon speaking at a banquet hosted by president yang shangkun 
said americans will long remember the tragedy that recently 
occurred in this city 
yang and premier li peng are thought to be behind the june 4 
military attack on prodemocracy protesters that claimed the lives 
of hundreds of unarmed civilians 
nixons speech also repeated the theme he has sounded throughout 
his fiveday visit that chinaus relations are too important to 
be hurt by what has become one of the worst rifts since nixon 
restored official contacts in 1972 
we must not permit our real enemies misunderstanding 
fruitless resentment endless recrimination to close the door we 
opened with such high hopes 17 years ago he said 
nixon on the last full day of his visit earlier told embassy 
staff members he had reached few points of agreement with chinese 
leaders over the governments bloody suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement 
we see it from totally different vantage points he said 
describing the discussions as like two ships passing in the 
dark 
a member of the nixon party said the former president in a 
meeting with premier li monday told the chinese he didnt like 
guns and didnt want to see guards with ak47s outside the us 
embassy when he visited 
the embassy has protested three times in the past week over the 
alleged harassment of diplomats and their families including 
police pointing rifles at diplomats children american officials 
also have expressed concern over sharply increased surveillance of 
the embassy compound in recent days 
li told nixon the police presence was needed to guard against a 
possible escape by dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian 
fang and his wife sought refuge at the embassy after the june 
military crackdown when troops killed hundreds of unarmed 
civilians in clearing central beijing of protesters both are 
wanted by chinese police on charges of counterrevolutionary 
agitation 
alhough the rifles disappeared for nixons visit a large 
contingent of peoples armed police remained on guard today outside 
the embassy buildings six stood at posts around the main embassy 
office that nixon visited two guarded a consular office down the 
street and seven congregated outside the residence of ambassador 
james lilley several blocks away 
all wore belts with small pistols most embassies have only one 
or at most two chinese guards stationed at their gates 
on tuesday senior leader deng xiaoping said china has not done 
a single thing harmful to the united states and accused the united 
states of being involved too deeply in the turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion the governments terms for the 
prodemocracy movement 
nixon and the chinese leaders have agreed on the need of the two 
countries to have strong relations that transcend ideological 
differences 
china is indispensable in todays increasingly complex 
international scene nixon said 
early today nixon spent 30 minutes walking around the xidan 
free market in western beijing chatting with shoppers 
he is to return to the united states on thursday nixon aides 
said it is likely he will provide a written account of his talks to 
president bush

no one blinked when west germans bought aampp or 
when britons bought burger king not even when swiss bought mighty 
dog canned dog food but japanese buy rockefeller center and 
suddenly youre hearing jokes about office workers having to take 
their shoes off at the door 
in reality all was normal at the midtown manhattan complex 
tuesday the rainbow room did not replace its french wines with 
sake the american festival cafe did not introduce sushi sumo 
wrestlers did not shove aside the skaters on the ice rink the 
rockettes were not kicked out of radio city by godzilla 
but listen to sen joseph lieberman of connecticut who rose on 
the floor of the senate to warn this year when they turn on the 
lights to that christmas tree in rockefeller center we americans 
are going to have to come to grips with the reality that that great 
national celebration is actually occurring on japanese property 
well sort of mitsubishi estate co is going to buy a 
controlling interest in the company that owns rockefeller center 
for 846 million and it is the latest in a series of major 
japanese real estate purchases in this country 
but the original 12building portion of rockefeller center 
including radio city may not be controlled by mitsubishi past the 
year 2000 when public sareholders of a real estate investment 
trust could take control 
meanwhile the center will continue to be managed by the same 
organization that has swept the sidewalks and polished the brass 
for 50 years the new owner will at any rate have to obey us 
laws pay us taxes and generally observe us customs if it 
hopes to succeed in a competitive real estate rental market 
still there seem to be jitters whenever japanese citizens or 
companies buy american these days 
many people have said to me isnt there going to be a public 
backlash about japanese investment richard voell president of 
the rockefeller group said tuesday 
mayor edward i koch said he too had noticed an 
undercurrent of talk that the sale is a threat because the 
new equity participants happen to be japanese or not american 
citizens 
and what did the mayor think about that 
ridiculous bellowed koch its called xenophobia or 
gee were alone lets keep everybody out thats a worldwide 
phenomenon and you would expect that it would exist in every 
country but that it would exist to a far lesser degree in an 
international city like new york 
i believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with foreigners 
investing in the city the mayor added who cares i mean what 
difference does it make 
koyata hosokawa executive vice president of mitsubishi estate 
said american opposition to japanese investment was an 
unfortunate sentiment but its not a sentiment which the 
japanese are particularly troubled by 
the largest foreign investors in the united states are not the 
japanese but the british who last year invested twice as much as 
the japanese and held assets worth twice as much 
although japanese investors have bought a few wellknown 
buildings such as the exxon building in manhattan their 
acquisitions largely have been unremarkable fearing an 
antijapanese backlash the tokyo government discouraged japanese 
companies from bidding on chicagos sears tower the worlds 
tallest building when it was offered earlier this year 
you know its funny a british or a west german company can 
buy something here and you dont hear much about it said 
moriyuki sawamoto head of the new york office of a japanese 
economic research firm but if its a japanese company thats 
right up in the headline 
to sawamoto the rockefeller center deal seemed like the most 
logical thing in the world mitsubishi is a conservative longterm 
investor thats willing to pay top price for a worldfamous complex 
with a peerless location 
no one forced the rockefeller group to sell he said they 
went to mitsubishi 
sawamoto was a student at vanderbilt university 32 years ago 
when the soviet union launched sputnik he remembers how americans 
accustomed to a decade of global supremacy were suddenly scared 
and frightened by one little satellite 
these days you are not number 1 at everything but you can 
still be the number 1 nation he said you shouldnt be too 
excited or threatened by daytoday events

rj reynolds tobacco co has mailed 
smokers videotapes to get its message on tv screens despite the 
twodecadelong ban on cigarette commercials 
the nations secondlargest cigarette maker says the 78second 
videotape commercial about its lowtar now cigarette is targeted at 
smokers of carlton made by american brands in reidsville 
reynolds says the videotapes do not violate congress intent 
when it banned cigarette commercials 
were not forcing anyone to watch it if someone is not 
interested they could simply throw it away said reynolds 
spokeswoman maura payne 
the fact is there are roughly 48 million americans who choose 
to smoke and they have a right to know about the products ms 
payne said tuesday we would defend our right to give customers 
access to information about our brand 
ms payne would not say how many tapes were involved in the 
august mailing or how much the effort cost 
in the commercial an announcer compares the two lowtar brands 
and suggests that now smokers are inhaling less tar than carlton 
smokers the tape is labeled as an advertisement and includes the 
surgeon generals warning that smoking is harmful 
ms payne said the company was encouraged by a 1988 test in 
which it mailed videotapes to smokers the mailing lists come from 
smokers use of coupons and calls to a tollfree number that 
provides information on smokers rights ms payne said 
among those who contend the videotapes violate congress intent 
are phil wilbur director of the health advocacy resource center in 
washington and david hudgins spokesman for the north carolina 
group greensboro to alleviate smoking pollution 
im opposed to any type of cigarette advertising hudgins 
said he said that he was concerned that the videos not be mailed 
at random but that he was not questioning smokers rights to watch 
the commercials in the privacy of their own homes 
i hate to be on their side but i do believe in certain civil 
rights he said 
reynolds holds about a third of the domestic cigarette market 
second only to philip morris its now brand has a 265 percent 
market share and carlton 468 percent according to the maxwell 
consumer report

gay activists reacted angrily to a report 
recommending a judge be cleared of bias and misconduct charges for 
calling two murder victims queers 
special master robert r murray on tuesday said state district 
judge jack hampton was wrong to comment publicly on a pending case 
but that hampton would be impartial in any case that came before 
him 
this is like saying yes he was a bigot but he wont be one 
in the future said william waybourn president of the dallas 
gay alliance which has urged hamptons removal 
murrays findings will be reviewed by the state commission on 
judicial conduct which could impose sanctions or begin a process 
to remove hampton from the bench 
but murrays report probably will weigh heavily with 
commission members said executive director robert flowers 
the judges comments came in a 1988 interview about the murder 
trial of richard lee bednarski 18 sentenced by hampton the 
previous month to 30 years in prison for shooting two men in a 
park bednarski could have received life in prison 
these homosexuals by running around on weekends picking up 
teenage boys theyre asking for trouble they really are 
hampton said in the interview with the dallas times herald i 
dont much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage 
boys 
hampton added i put prostitutes and gays at about the same 
level and id be hard put to give somebody life for killing a 
prostitute 
in his report murray said the statements did not reflect a bias 
against homosexuals and did not discredit the judiciary 
judge hampton has a reputation for fairness and impartiality 
and has never exhibited bias or prejudice toward any group class 
or individual the report said 
the only thing hampton did wrong murray said was comment on a 
case still pending because of bednarskis efforts to get a new 
trial 
david bryan of the texas human rights foundation which

president daniel ortega today ended 
his governments 19month truce with the contras citing continued 
rebel attacks and threatened to cancel elections scheduled next 
year he accused president bush of supporting terrorism in 
nicaragua 
by suspending the truce ortega has invited renewed us 
military aid to the contras 
ortega made the announcement this morning at a news conference 
that was broadcast live on a nationwide radio chain 
on friday the sandinista leader stunned a summit of western 
hemisphere leaders when he announced he would not renew the truce 
which the government has done monthly 
ortega was immediately condemned and world leaders expressed 
concern about his risking the painstaking peace process in central 
america as well as nicaraguas scheduled elections feb 25 
by going through with the threat he could trigger international 
condemnation and loss of support of western european friends who 
have defied us pressure and aided nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government 
bush said tuesday he would review us policy toward nicaragua 
if ortega ends the ceasefire 
we are waiting for that reevaluation said a contra leader 
adolfo calero in miami for our part we have to defend 
ourselves every man has the right to survive and we have to look 
for the way to survive 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today well consider the situation analyze the options 
determine the appropriate response but at this point no decisions 
have been made one way or another 
asked if this might prompt the administration to seek renewed 
military aid for the contras fitzwater said we havent even 
considered that we havent considered any response except that 
we were trying to preserve the ceasefire and preserve the peace 
process 
fitzwater added that he did not expect the administration to 
make any immediate response to the move by ortega 
ortega said the february elections in nicaragua depend on the 
willingness of bush and congress to divert humanitarian funds to 
demobilize the rebels 
ortegas comments differed from the text of an official 
communique which said the nicaraguan government independent of 
the attitude that the mercenary forces assume will guarantee the 
good development of the electoral process 
in fact ortega said now it will depend on the yankee 
congress and the yankee president that these elections take place 
on feb 25 
under an agreement signed aug 7 by ortega and four other 
central american presidents the rebels are to be disbanded and 
relocated by dec 8 in exchange nicaragua has pledged that 
elections will be free and fair 
according to the sixpoint government communique more than 
1100 contras have infiltrated nicaragua across the border from 
their honduran jungle camps over the past three weeks the 
communique said the number of contra attacks against civilian 
economic and military targets in nicaragua has intensified 
dramatically 
at the news conference ortega referred specifically to the 
latest reported attack by the contras on monday night that left 
four civilians dead and five wounded 
we have the responsibility of defending the lives of 
nicaraguans ortega said therefore we cant allow 
assassinations to be committed against civilians ortega said 
calero denied contra involvement in the attack its too 
coincidental not to have been staged he said 
ortega blamed bush in part for his decision saying bush was 
supporting terrorism in nicaragua 
this is very clear when the us government instead of using 
congressapproved nonlethal funds for the demobilization of 
the contras uses these funds as logistical support for the 
rebels ortega said 
ortega complained that his government had been making a 
onesided effort to bring peace to nicaragua 
we made an effort for a long time more than a year he 
said referring to the truce signed in march 1988 we would 
present the cheek then the other cheek 
but even christ ran out of patience and used the whip to push 
out the merchants from the temple ortega said 
ortega his defense and interior ministers international 
observers of nicaraguas electoral process and a us embassy 
official traveled by helicopter tuesday to the site of the latest 
reported attack by the rebels 
the defense ministry said a group of about 30 contras attacked 
an eightfamily farm cooperative near san migeulito killing four 
people wounding five and kidnapping one woman 
after returning from the site a remote village 200 miles 
southeast of managua the top sandinista officials met for four 
hours with their top military officers 
the contras were forced to the negotiating table with the 
sandinistas after congress refused to renew weapons and ammunitions 
supplies to the contras in february 1988 
a month later the contras and sandinistas signed a temporary 
ceasefire which the sandinistas have renewed on a monthly basis 
talks to turn the agreement into a lasting peace broke down in 
september 1988 
ortega said today his government was not interested in talking 
about the truce any more but rather about putting a definite end 
to hostilities 
the problem here is not the ceasefire the problem here is the 
demobilization he said heatedly 
about 11000 contras have since withdrawn to base camps in 
jungles across the border in honduras 
at the san jose summit called to celebrate 100 years of costa 
rican democracy ortega said continued attacks by the 2000 to 
3000 contras who remain in nicaragua were forcing him to break the 
truce 
more than 730 people have been killed and more than 1000 
wounded in contra attacks since the truce was signed he said

scientists at the university of southern 
california and the university of illinois say they have confirmed 
the theory that the mind stores memories by hard wiring new 
connections between brain cells 
the findings were to be released today at a meeting of the 
society for neuroscience in phoenix the los angeles times reported 
today 
psychobiologists richard f thompson of usc and william 
greenough of illinois worked jointly to prove that the brain 
circuitry the network of links between cells goes through 
actual physical changes when a task is learned 
the socalled hard wiring memory theory is used to explain 
why some learned activities such as riding a bicycle are never 
forgotten 
thompson and greenough based their findings on a study of 15 
rabbits that were conditioned to behave in certain ways thompson 
rang a bell and blew a small puff of air into one eye of each 
rabbit causing the animals to blink soon the rabbits would blink 
every time the bell sounded without the puff of air 
thompson discovered through electrodes planted in the rabbits 
brains that there was increased activity in a group of cells called 
purkinje cells located in the cerebellum 
greenough then studied the rabbits and discovered a greater 
number of intercellular connections in the side of the cerebellum 
that had learned the blinking than in the side that had not 
in the 15 rabbits studied over a twoyear period the 
differences were statistically reliable and clearly visible 
greenough said we really have isolated a case where in brain 
cells that are clearly involved in the performance of a task we 
have crystalclear structural change that indicates a change in 
anatomical circuitry 
the discovery is not surprising in that it fits theory but 
there has been no particular evidence to support the theory 
before thompson said we were convinced there would be 
something like this because memories are never forgotten 
the scientists also did similar experiments with 19 rats which 
were trained to walk up an elevated pathway the rats also showed 
increased hard wiring after the learning the task but in a 
different part of the brain 
thompson and greenough said the findings suggest that memories 
can be stored in several parts of the brain not only the 
cerebellum

antiapartheid groups said 
today 11 activists have been killed in unsolved cases this year and 
demanded a public judicial investigation 
in pretoria walter sisulu and three other recently freed 
leaders of the outlawed african national congress today visited a 
courtroom during sentencing proceedings against three white anc 
members convicted of terrorism 
at a johannesburg news conference today seven antiapartheid 
groups said they supported calls for a probe of what they called 
the unexplained deaths of 11 activists this year 
until the police produce evidence to the contrary the 
suspicion will continue in the minds of south africans that death 
squads with alleged police links are carrying out these 
assassinations said judith hardin of the black sash civil rights 
organization 
such suspicions were heightened when a former security policeman 
on death row said last month he was part of a police death squad 
the black sash a group made up of white women said there have 
been 61 unsolved killings of activists since 1977 the human rights 
commission documented 11 such deaths this year 
in the pretoria courtroom the three whites embraced the anc 
leaders during a short adjournment at pretoria regional court after 
the presiding magistrate ordered defendants iain robertson and 
damian de lange to remove neckties of green gold and black the 
ancs colors the third defendant is susan westcott 
greetings comrade leaders robertson shouted upon seeing 
the four men in the courtroom 
in addition to sisulu 77 the visiting anc delegation included 
ahmed kathrada 60 elias motsoaledi 65 and andrew mhlangeni 63 
the four were released unconditionally oct 15 after spending 26 
years in prison for planning an antigovernment sabotage campaign 
the three whites pleaded guilty in june to terrorism charges and 
face life in prison sentencing is expected within the next few 
days after completion of arguments on whether the judge should 
consider any mitigating circumstances 
a senior police commander maj gen herman stadler testified 
today that the anc had recently adopted a more pragmatic approach 
but remained committed to the use of violence 
de lange robertson and ms westcott were arrested at a 
farmhouse outside johannesburg in may 1988 police seized a cache 
of sovietmade weapons that included assault rifles hand grenades 
and a sam7 heatseeking missle 
terrorism can carry the death penalty but the magistrate ruled 
it out by conducting the trial without two lay assistants whose 
presence is required when capital punishment at stake

a federal inspector says the discovery of a 
spiralbound ledger supports what farmworker advocates have said 
for decades that credit sales of wine cigarettes and drugs are 
used to bind migrant workers to the fields 
the notebook was given to inspectors oct 10 by the wife of a 
johnston county crew chief when she was asked turn over records for 
inspection of their labor camp where 19 migrant workers are 
harvesting sweet potatoes 
such ledgers are called wine books in migrant camps for the 
cheap wine they often include 
most of the time we are relying only on the word of the 
worker but in this case you can see the charges that are being 
made against the workers pay said dewey thornton a wage and 
hour director for the labor department 
investigators believe recurring charges in the book of 60 cents 
are for soft drinks while 150 and 250 entries are believed to 
be for cigarettes and pint bottles of cheap wine that can be bought 
for half that price 
a few entries are marked light apparently for an electric 
bill said thornton but most entries carry no designation workers 
have their own pages in the book with lists of deductions from 
their pay 
thornton said some of the entries could have been for crack and 
other drugs 
for the crew leader that would give him a captive work 
force thornton said if you can get your workers addicted to 
crack then theyre not going to leave you theyre going to stay 
with you to keep getting the drug 
the unlicensed resale of alcohol and cigarettes is illegal even 
if the seller makes no profit 
migrant workers for generations have said crew chiefs push a 
sometimes daily ration of wine on them whether they want it or not 
deducting the amount from their pay 
labor investigators say such practices bind migrant workers to 
the fields either by getting them drunk or plunging them so far 
into debt with the crew leader that they cannot move on 
ledgers of such sales are only rarely found but such 
discoveries are akin to finding betting sheets at a bookie joint 
the ledgers provide documentary evidence backing up allegations 
made by usually illiterate farm workers 
another record book discovered earlier this year in eastern 
north carolina carried 50 and 100 fees for coyotes 
smugglers who help illegal aliens cross the border from mexico 
thornton said 
he said that the investigation of the johnston county camp could 
lead to a fine for unfair wage practices and loss of the crew 
chiefs federal license to operate a labor camp the inspector 
would not identify the crew chief 
an estimated 40000 to 50000 migrant workers pass through north 
carolina each year helping with tobacco fruit and vegetable 
harvests

lithuanias communist party has proposed splitting 
from its soviet parent and declaring itself independent in defiance 
of president mikhail s gorbachev moscow radio reported today 
the proposed platform of the baltic republics party which was 
published this week represents the most radical move by a branch 
of the soviet communist party in almost five years of escalating 
reform under gorbachev 
gorbachev has said he strongly opposes any break in the soviet 
communist party kremlin doctrine requires that the party be highly 
centralized to ensure control over its farflung units 
the lithuanian partys platform must be approved by a party 
congress 
radio moscow quoted lithuanian party chief algirdas brazauskas 
as saying the republics transition to economic independence 
required corresponding political moves as well 
the draft platform sets the seal on the partys 
independence radio moscow said 
lithuania along with the other two soviet baltic republics of 
latvia and estonia is negotiating the details of a plan for 
economic independence from moscows centralized ministries the 
change will taken effect jan 1 
far from all lithuanian communists support moves of this kind 
but we will try to steer clear of a party division brazauskas 
said according to the staterun radio 
the lithuanian branch of the komsomol the communist youth 
league has already formally withdrawn from its soviet mother 
organization and announced the creation of a new youth group the 
communist union of youth of lithuania 
a congress of the nationwide komsomol last week recognized the 
lithuanian move and began working out details for the transfer of 
power 
the radio report did not define party independence and 
lithuanian party activists were not immediately available for 
comment because of another recent change in the largely roman 
catholic republic nov 1 all souls day and christmas were 
declared state holidays last month after decades of purely atheist 
holidays 
a lithuanian activist reached at home said the draft would end 
soviet control over the lithuanian party vytautas bogusis of the 
helsinki group added that the republics party could still 
cooperate with other communist parties of the soviet union and 
other communist parties in the world 
bogusis said the draft had been put forward by party leaders and 
members of the lithuanian academy of sciences

east german leader egon krenz said the widespread 
protests in his country are a very good sign of public support 
for the reforms he discussed today with president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
krenz who said he and gorbachev reached total agreement on 
all questions that we discussed said many of the hundreds of 
thousands of prodemocracy demonstrators in east germanys streets 
were showing their support for the renovation of socialism 
in this sense i consider this a very good sign krenz told a 
moscow news conference during his first visit since succeeding 
hardline leader erich honecker last month 
despite some negative aspects about the protests the main 
fact of these demonstrations is to show the goal of improving life 
in east germany he said 
krenzs remarks notably more positive toward the protests than 
previous statements indicated the government will tolerate 
continued activism 
speaking forcefully in his hoarse powerful voice and smiling 
often krenz described an intense meeting with gorbachev at which 
the time flew by unnoticed as they discussed soviet reforms and 
their possible applications in east germany 
krenz said his governments aim is to further strengthen 
socialism in our country and start reform in all aspects of our 
society 
he ruled out the idea of tearing down the berlin wall as well as 
the possibility of reunification of the two germanys 
but he said his government plans to create expansive 
opportunities for each citizen of east germany to obtain a visa and 
passport to go to any country in the world 
he said the plans for broader travel rights would be discussed 
by the government the public and parliament 
krenz assumed power as the government struggled to grapple with 
the exodus of tens of thousands of east germans to west germany and 
growing public unrest at home

three nights of curfews and 399 arrests helped 
control halloween night fires authorities said today as they 
tallied destruction from the annual arson spree known as devils 
night 
police rounded up 65 youngsters on the last night of the 6 
pmto6 am curfew down from 165 on monday and 169 on sunday 
said spokesman sgt christopher buck the arrests included at least 
four arson suspects he said 
detroit had only one confirmed arson fire on halloween compared 
with monday nights dozens of blazes in homes trash bins and 
garages the monday fires left at least five families homeless but 
no injuries were reported 
tracey bryant said her home was gutted tuesday evening 
i thought it was just a cheap little joke bryant said 
just like an april fools joke a stupid little joke 
elsewhere halloween found scores of youths rampaging through 
new york city committing robberies on the streets and in 
businesses and injuring at least five people police said 
sixtyseven people were arrested and charged with taking part in 
tuesdays terror sprees which began in the morning new york 
police said 
halloween was te excuse for random violence said officer 
jimmy lee 
this day every year brings out the worst said capt stephen 
p davis 
in detroit about 30000 volunteers joined the battle against 
devils night arson this year and police were allowed to detain 
minors caught on the streets without a parent 
most of those detained were released to their parents after 
paying a 50 fine said robert berg a spokesman for mayor coleman 
a young 
city officials said the number of devils night fires would not 
be released until later in the day 
the detroit fire fighters association said however about 285 
blazes were reported monday if true the number would approach 
that of 1984 when 297 fires were reported on oct 30 
last year 229 devils night blazes raged and so far this year 
the number is higher city councilman mel ravitz said tuesday 
weve got to find a way to either reeducate or incarcerate 
those who engage in this sport he said

house fires said officer joe florida 
detroits devils night tradition began about 10 years ago with 
pranks such as ringing doorbells and soaping windows the practice

the number of blazes apparently peaked in 1984 when 
firefighters battled 808 fires during the last three days of 
october the number of fires has declined steadily

a son of philadelphia mob boss nicodemo 
little nicky scarfo was shot and wounded at an italian 
restaurant in what a prosecutor said may have been an attempt to 
punish the elder scarfo 
a man in a yellow halloween mask and black clothes tuesday night 
walked up to nicodemo scarfo jr 24 as he dined at dante and 
luigis and opened fire apparently dropping his gun on the 
pavement as he fled police said 
scarfo was hit at least four times once in the neck and the 
left arm and in each side of his chest and was in critical but 
stable condition today at thomas jefferson university hospital 
hospital spokesman steve brown said 
the gunman was like greased lightning said joseph oberman 
who was dining in the restaurants main room he came in and out 
of the door 
after the shot nobody moved oberman said 
but another diner fran tosconi said the dining room was in 
chaos 
assistant us attorney joel friedman said the shooting may have 
been aimed at the elder scarfo for failing to keep some mobsters 
from becoming informants he is serving a 69year sentence 
racketeering at the federal prison in marion ill 
there would be many out there that would wish to punish scarfo 
for the lack of discipline within his family friedman said 
friedman speculated the shooting was not part of a struggle for 
control of the philadelphiasouthern new jersey mob triggered by 
the 1980 slaying of mob boss angelo bruno at least 24 men have 
been killed in that war 
many of the important members and leaders of the la cosa 
nostra are currently cooperating and testififying and some major 
mob figures have been convicted friedman said that could be 
deemed an embarrassing situation for nicodemo scarfo as the 
leader 
the elder scarfo has been imprisoned since his indictment in 
1986 in a 1 million extortion attempt he was convicted in that 
case and later on a murder charge 
until his sentencing with 16 others last april the elder scarfo 
was considered the leader of organized crime in the area 
the younger scarfo has had several brushes with the law but none 
in connection with the mob 
police said he apparently was shot with a semiautomatic version 
of the mac10 machine pistol

three guerrilla rockets hit the 
capital today and killed an 8yearold boy the government said 
supplies began arriving in the city after government troops 
dislodged rebels blocking a key highway 
trucks carrying flour and gasoline entered kabul for the first 
time in 11 days a day after sovietbacked troops cleared blockades 
by usbacked guerrilla forces 
soldiers with knowledge of the salang highway said two weeks 
worth of steady traffic was backed up on the road and waiting to 
come to the capital 
most of the trucks today were privately owned vehicles the 
govermnment recently has ended its monopoly on the transportation 
and sale of fuel and sugar because of shortages now it is relying 
on private truckers to feed its people and supply them with fuel 
for the winter 
the rocket attacks came after the government had said it was 
intensifying efforts to clear guerrillas from the mountains 
surrounding kabul 
on tuesday reporters were shown a captured guerrilla hideout 15 
miles south of the city tuesday night government troops fired 
dozens of rockets at the paghman mountains to the west another 
guerrilla stronghold 
since june rocket attacks on the city have killed about 400 
people and wounded 900 the government blamed the guerrillas who 
deny rocketing civilian targets and say the government is killing 
its own people 
at the united nations the general assembly was expected to 
approve an unprecedented resolution today calling on afghanistans 
communist government and the guerrillas to open negotiations on 
forming a coalition government 
the un resolution called for a government of national 
reconciliation that is nonaligned and islamic passage of the 
resolution in the general assembly is a formality since the soviet 
and pakistani delegations worked out mutually acceptable language 
weeks ago 
the general assembly had never before ordered the combatants in 
the 10yearold civil war to open peace talks nor has it specified 
the ideological or religious orientation of the resulting 
government of national reconciliation 
under a unmediated plan moscow completed the withdrawal of 
more than 100000 red army troops on feb 15 more than nine years 
after the first soviet forces rolled into the country to back the 
marxist government 
the rebels control most of the countryside but have made little 
military or diplomatic progress since the soviet withdrawal ended

the iranian government today passed a law 
allowing it to arrest americans anywhere in the world as it 
prepared for an antius rally that officials said will include 
the burning of 160 american flags 
the new law passed by parliament on tuesday was approved by 
the council of guardians it gives the iranian government the right 
to arrest americans who act against its interests anywhere in the 
world and bring them to the islamic republic for trial by islamic 
courts 
the parliament members who introduced the measure said it 
mirrors a similar power the us government granted itself to bring 
terrorists to the united states for trial 
you who scream about human rights and talk about terrorism 
are yourselves innately terrorists and criminals who have taken 
security away from the people of the world parliament speaker 
mahdi karrubi said on a tehran radio broadcast monitored in nicosia 
the new law precedes celebrations saturday marking the 10th 
anniversary of the takeover of the us embassy in tehran by 
iranian militants 
as part of the celebrations protesters will burn 160 flags 
before the sprawling compound of the former embassy in downtown 
tehran the islamic republic news agency reported 
the 160 flags will honor 16 kuwaiti shiite moslems beheaded in 
saudi arabia for planting bombs in mecca during the annual moslem 
pilgrimage earlier this year that killed one pilgrim and wounded 16 
others 
iran has rebutted televised confessions by those convicted that 
tehran trained them and supplied the explosives for their mission 
the iranians have turned the beheadings into a cause celebre 
denouncing it as a us plot 
an iranian newspaper suggested that the former captain of the 
american warship vincennes be the first person brought to trial in 
iran under the new antiamerican law 
the radical daily abrar said capt will rogers ii commander 
of the navy warship when it shot down an iran air passenger jet 
over the persian gulf could be brought to trial in iran under the 
measure 
the vincennes shot down the plane during fighting in the gulf in 
july 1988 killing all 290 people on board the navy said the crew 
mistook the ascending passenger plane for an attacking f14 fighter 
jet 
the new law empowers the iranian president to take all 
necessary steps for capture and prosecution of americans as well 
as their direct and indirect elements who have been prosecuted in 
iranian courts the radio said 
it added that citizens of countries which cooperate directly or 
indirectly with america in abducting iranian citizens or conspire 
against their lives or property of the islamic republic will be 
tried in iranian courts according to islamic principles

some activists say the town meeting is no 
longer serving the 50000 residents of plymouth where americas 
first such governmental gathering took place 3 centuries ago 
the group government for the people wants a salaried town 
manager and a 13member town council whose members might receive a 
stipend to replace the five selectmen and 104 town meeting 
representatives 
the selectmen who get a 2000 annual stipend meet once a 
week town meetings whose participants are volunteers are held 
once a year unless something extraordinary comes up 
the reformers submitted a petition monday asking that the 
proposal be put before voters in april they needed 2900 
signatures to get the measure on the ballot they collected 3608 
and are preparing for the campaign 
the group says plymouth has grown too big to be governed by 
parttime public servants 
they just cant be responsive to the needs on a daily basis 
said william nolan a former selectman and coleader of government 
for the people 
the council would be more responsive because theyre elected 
by geographic area and town meeting which has been a real 
tradition in this town is just not working 
town meetings have governed plymouth since around 1636 said 
grace karbott who heads the plymouth librarys reference 
department and is a town meeting representative 
last year voters rejected the reform proposal by 55 percent to 
45 percent adocates of the change said voters were confused by 
disputes over the ballot 
opponents argued that the town council led by a manager 
considerably more powerful than the executive secretary who is now 
the towns top employee would be a far less democratic form of 
government 
selectmen proposed to amend the current charter which was 
established in 1973 when the town meeting was altered from an open 
forum to one for representatives 
the board of selectmen can continue to run the town said 
david malaguti a nineyear board member before we scrap the 
charter the one we have deserves modification

bands of teenagers have been jabbing women 
passersby with sharp objects in a series of racially motivated 
attacks police say 
all but one of 28 women jabbed between oct 21 and oct 27 on 
the citys diverse upper west side were white and the attackers 
were black teenagers or young women 
none of the victims has been seriously hurt and police have 
minimized fears of infection with aids hepatitis or other diseases 
i would doubt if it was a hypo needle said capt maurice 
collins these are very quick jabs for somebody to be injecting 
anybody with a hypo needle would take time 
it could be any kind of a sharp object it could be a needle 
it could be a brooch pin it could be a compass point something 
thats sharp enough to prick the skin the wounds are basically 
shallow collins said 
collins who heads the departments bias incident squad said 
the victims are selected it appears that theyre selected on the 
fact that theyre white 
most of the women were walking alone on the street in the 
evening and were approached usually from behind they felt a 
pricking as the black female teenagers passed them they observed 
laughing and giggling collins said 
no remarks have been made during most of the attacks however 
in one of the assaults a teenager cursed her victim and in 
another case a teenager was heard to say were going to cut 
your hair off the captain said

todays tradition in louisiana is our version of memorial 
day said michael boudreaux the assistant director of the new 
orleans archdiocesan cemeteries 
its very much a family day he said some of our 
cemeteries are 200 years old so you might have 10 12 15 members 
of a family buried in a tomb 
the tombs which exist because of new orleans high water level 
resemble windowless houses churches and monuments many are 
surrounded by wrought iron fences built close together they line 
the narrow paths and streets that wind through the cemeteries they 
are designed for several generations 
the custom extends throughout south louisiana and is popular 
with roman catholics and protestants boudreaux said

the rjr nabisco foundation announced today a 
30 million fund to support risktaking education programs in 
elementary and secondary schools 
the biggest risk in education today is not taking one said 
nabisco chairman louis gerstner timid finetuning approaches 
are not up to the task of revitalizing an education system that is 
failing our young people and jeopardizing the future of our nation 
our goal is to nurture risktaking not reward entrenched 
conventional wisdom he said 
over five years the program titled next century schools 
will make threeyear grants of from 100000 to 250000 a year to 
teachers principals and community groups with bold and 
innovative ideas and strategies said gerstner 
fifteen grants will be made this spring for fall startup and 
applications will be accepted nationwide but north carolina will 
receive preference the first year because it is the home of three 
of rjr nabiscos four operating companies 
in the second and third years the program will make grants to a 
much larger number of schools in urban suburban and rural 
districts throughout the united states officials said 
criteria for awarding grants include prospects for improving 
student performance a commitment to reform shared by parents 
teachers and the community as a whole and a plan for sustaining 
and expanding the program once it proves successful 
with gerstner as chairman a 17member board will determine how 
the grants will be distributed board members include former 
tennessee gov lamar alexander now president of the university of 
tennessee arkansas gov bill clinton national education 
association president keith geiger new jersey gov thomas kean 
former labor secretary ann mclaughlin now a visiting fellow at the

the american bar associations decision to 
give a key federal court nominee only a qualified rating could 
bolster opposition to the nomination a civil rights attorney said 
today 
the abas qualified rating given federal appellate court 
nominee clarence thomas will stimulate some concern about the 
nomination said william taylor a washington civil rights attorney 
thomass sevenyear tenure as chairman of the equal employment 
opportunity commission has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil 
rights groups who say he has undermined enforcement of age 
discrimination laws 
the aba rating lends some credence to the concerns that some 
of the advocacy groups have been voicing said taylor an 
official of the leadership conference on civil rights 
the group successfully lobbied last summer against the 
nomination of william lucas to head the justice departments civil 
rights division 
taylor said the coalition of civil rights groups has not taken a 
formal position on the nomination even though some organizations 
already have expressed opposition individually 
now that the nomination has been made the sentiment of the 
various groups will crystallize taylor said 
justice department spokesman david runkel on tuesday played down 
the rating of thomas as qualified instead of well qualified 
to sit on the us circuit court of appeals for washington a court 
that takes on many of the nations most heavily spotlighted cases 
anyone who is qualified is by definition an appropriate 
nominee runkel said 
but thomas supporters expressed anger about the rating 
i know him to be an absolutely firstrate lawyer lawyer and 
beyond that i know him to be a firstrate human being sen john 
danforth rmo for whom thomas once worked said tuesday 
i am concerned about what i fear might happen to my friend 
clarence thomas when he comes before the senate judiciary committee 
in his hearings danforth said on the senate floor 
thomas has one thing going against him and that is that he is 
a black lawyer of fairly conservative political and judicial 
philosophy danforth said 
the interest groups that did a job on william lucas in the 
senate judiciary committee are going to be mobilizing again to do a 
job on clarence thomas danforth said 
the nomination of lucas a black republican to head of the 
civil rights division of the justice department died in committee 
this year because of concerns over his qualifications and 
commitment to civil rights 
on tuesday the alliance for justice and 21 other civil rights 
groups wrote senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden 
jr ddel to urge a careful investigation of thomas record at 
eeoc 
it is his actions as head of the eeoc which suggest that he 
lacks the commitment to equal justice the qualifications and the 
judicial temperament for a lifetime appointment to one of the 
nations most important courts said the letter 
the aba report card on thomas also revived the debate over the 
groups role in screening judicial candidates which conservatives 
say is heavily skewed by the panels alleged liberal bias 
the aba has no legitimate role in judicial selection said 
patrick mcguigan senior scholar at the free congress foundations 
center for law and democracy the fact they gave a man like 
clarence thomas a qualified instead of a well qualified is just 
further evidence 
mcguigan noted roughly half of federal judicial nominees 
have received the qualified rating from the 15member aba panel 
according to the abas judicial screening handbook a 
qualified rating means that the nominee meets minimum 
qualifications for satisfactory performance as a judge 
to be rated well qualified a nominee must have the 
committees strong affirmative endorsement and be regarded as 
one of the best available for the vacancy from the standpoint of 
integrity competence and temperament the handbook said 
the evaluation of qualified indicates that it appears the 
prospective nominee would be able to perform satisfactorily as a 
federal judge with respect to integrity competence and 
temperament according to the handbook

said robert odonnell playboy publishing groups vice president of 
retail marketing and sales theyre going beyond legal bounds 
afa has picketed and threatened to boycott stores that carried 
the targeted magazines the publishing interests decided to sue 
after the association distributed a letter in september to store 
operators and corporate officers 
the letter told the stores they were violating floridas 
obscenity statute by selling adult magazines and promised to name 
those stores as violators and demand enforcement 
the plaintiffs said the statute applies only to publishers and

customers the afa acknowledged in a news release that was included

have acceded to defendants extortion and ceased distributing 
various publications

doll based on the ghoulish killer in nightmare on elm street 
movies

oren teicher the groups executive director if they dislike a 
tv show or a magazine they want to drive it out of the market 
thats unamerican and were going to stop them

hundreds of east germans fled to czechoslovakia 
today after the government lifted travel restrictions and a top 
communist official for the first time said the future of the berlin 
wall could be open to discussion 
also east german officials acknowledged that the countrys 
rigidly planned economy is in serious trouble and that sweeping 
reform may be on the way 
east germany today lifted restrictions that had barred most 
travel to czechoslovakia since oct 3 former communist party 
leader erich honecker imposed the ban to stem the flow of thousands 
of refugees fleeing west through west germanys embassy in prague 
czechoslovakia 
new party leader egon krenz rescinded the ban and has also 
hinted that a new law giving east germans greater travel freedom 
would be studied czechoslovakia is the only country east germans 
can visit without permission 
hours after the ban was lifted more than 200 east germans 
arrived at the west german compound in prague 
earlier communist authorities in east berlin agreed to issue 
documents allowing east germans in the west german embassy to 
travel west a similar arrangement is under way in poland 
in moscow krenz ruled out the idea of tearing down the berlin 
wall as well as the possibility of reuniting the two germanys 
but in kiel west germany a communist official for the first 
time publicly said the government may be willing to relax its view 
on the need for the wall 
the opening of borders in other soviet bloc countries was making 
the berlin walls significance limited and illusory said 
johannes chemnitzer the topranking communist in neubrandenburg 
replying to a question about whether that meant the future of 
the berlin wall is now open to discussion chemnitzer replied 
surely 
krenz held talks this week in moscow with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to discuss possible reforms in east germany 
krenz said he and gorbachev reached total agreement on all 
questions that we discussed and said many of the prodemocracy 
demonstrators in east germanys streets were showing their support 
for the renovation of socialism 
in this sense i consider this a very good sign he said 
on another topic guenter schabowski a member of the 
policymaking communist party politburo told a west german 
magazine the government must lift a wide range of subsidies on 
goods and services 
we subsidize even flowers and taxi fares thats an impossible 
situation schabowski was quoted as saying 
schabowski in the interview published today with the magazine 
wirtschaftswoche or economy week was quoted as saying the 
leadership also was considering an overhaul of the countrys 
industry 
schabowski said the leadership would examine whether the 
organization of industry into huge combines still makes 
economic sense 
the exodus of tens of thousands of east germans has added to the 
mounting problems for the nations industry while continuing 
protests have increased pressure on the government to institute 
reform 
for years the east germanys communist leadership has spoken of 
its economic system as an unqualified success although the 
countrys standard of living has been the envy of many of its 
soviet bloc allies ordinary citizens still have to deal with many 
hardships 
quality consumer goods are in short supply and buying a car can 
take 10 years 
a top manager told an east german newspaper that food and 
consumer goods supplies were falling far below the expectations of 
a dissatisfied population 
heinz warzecha director of the machine tools combine named 
october 7 told the east berlin newspaper berliner zeitung that 
more openness was needed in the way the economy was run and that 
such problems as inflation must be publicized 
the level of food supplies consumer goods and services in 
many areas does not meet the expectations that citizens of one of 
the 10 leading industrial nations have the right to expect 
warzecha told the governmentcontrolled newspaper in todays 
edition 
whether we like it or not the people are comparing us with 
west germany and other capitalist countries he added 
warzecha said salaries should be linked to performance 
asserting that whoever produces more deserves better pay 
the communist party newspaper neues deutschland in a frontpage 
article today also spoke of a lack of raw materials and workers in 
a machine took factory in goerlitz 
nearly 70000 east germans have fled to west germany in recent 
months and many are skilled young workers 
west germanys ard television reported the opposition group 
democratic awakening has demanded a major change in east germanys 
legal system 
ard said the group has demanded the formation of a 
constitutional court so that every citizen has the right to have 
the legal and constitutional basis of government decisions 
reviewed in court

a man so skilled at burglary that he once 
made training videotapes for police has been implicated in more 
than 1000 florida breakins in which at least a halfmillion 
dollars in gold and gems were stolen 
richard makofski 35 is charged in a fugitive warrant with 
dealing in property stolen in the past nine months said palm 
beach fla detective rob hawkins howard county md police 
arrested makofski on sunday at his home 
hawkins said 12 pounds of gold ingots were seized from 
makofski the gold came from stolen jewelry that had been melted 
down hawkins said 
makofski was convicted of burglary in maryland in 1985 and 
police said then he had been linked to 63 local burglaries he was 
sentenced to three years in jail 
at the time county police were so amazed by his skill that they 
asked makofski to teach a class at the police academy on how to 
detect burglars he also made a videotape for detectives on methods 
of burglary 
a search of makofskis home revealed books and tapes on 
burglaries and electronic equipment and tools said howard county 
detectives 
makofski has been linked by the palm beach county fla 
sheriffs office to a group of at least four people who committed 
as many as five to six burglaries daily at apartments in the three 
florida counties hawkins said

and plundered the apartments while a lookout waited in a car 
outside with a twoway radio

residents have also been arrested in connection with the 
burglaries he said many of the burglaries were performed by gang

a top federal health official said today he 
intends to extend indefinitely the current ban on federal funding 
for research using fetal tissue from induced abortions 
james mason assistant secretary for health at the department of 
health and human services said he has the authority to make a 
decision on the ban and the moratorium should be continued 
indefinitely 
permitting federal funding for such research he said would 
be unacceptable federal policy 
conservative supporters of the bush administration have promised 
a firestorm of protest if the administration lifts the ban 
masons predecessor as assistant secretary for health robert 
windom last year forbade use of government funds to finance such 
research and established a special adivsory committee on whether it 
should continue 
later last year the committee recommended the ban be lifted 
i have a vast array of authority mason told reporters but 
would not make the decision without consulting health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan were in that process right 
now he said 
mason told reporters he would write a letter to the national 
institutes of health within 10 days informing it of his decision 
this is a moral issue he said im concerned that in 
sponsoring fetal tissue transplantation there will be a clear 
perception that the government is encouraging or promoting 
abortion 
many scientists believe parkinsons disease and other conditions 
could be treated by transplanting fetal tissue into patients 
allowing federal funding for fetal tissue transplants from 
induced abortions would create a demand for aborted fetuses which 
would increase the number of abortions mason said 
he said he believes there are other ways that science can 
approach treatment for these diseases including the use of fetal 
tissue from spontaneous abortions which are not now included in 
the ban he also said research using fetal tissue from induced 
abortions could be conducted without federal funds

the bush administration today condemned as 
deplorable nicaraguan president daniel ortegas suspension of 
the ceasefire with the contras but steered clear of calling for 
renewing military aid to the antisandinista rebels 
we dont want to go that route we want to get free elections 
we want the tela agreement to be carried out white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said at a briefing 
we just dont think its helpful to speculate on actions 
beyond that fitzwater said 
ortega today ended the 19monthold ceasefire and threatened at 
a news conference in managua to cancel elections scheduled next 
year he accused bush of supporting terrorism in nicaragua 
his deplorable action which was foreshadowed during the costa 
rican celebration of democracy is an affront to the hemisphere and 
the democratic traditions we hold so important fitzwater said 
he said it demonstrated that the nicaraguan government 
continues to swim against the tide of democracy in the region 
it is obvious that ortega is afraid of the ballot box 
fitzwater said 
its important that the world understand our emphasis is on 
the elections and the democratic processes in nicaragua so we 
continue to push for that said fitzwater if mr ortega wants 
to pursue a military conflict if he wants to reopen war if he 
wants to resume the killing again that is his business 
our purpose is to try to get the peace process back on 
track said fitzwater he said president bush has been in contact 
with other leaders in the hemisphere he declined to name them 
pressed on whether the administration might consider asking 
congress anew to rearm the rebels fitzwater said we are 
evaluating the entire situation but we do not think its 
appropriate to speculate on military assistance 
he said the united states has no advice now for the contras on 
how they should conduct themselves 
vice president dan quayle meeting separately with afghan 
resistance leaders was also asked by reporters if the 
administration had advised the contras not to fight we have made 
our position very clear on the matter that we support the 
ceasefire quayle said we do not want violence we want 
peace 
over the past decade our hemisphere has witnessed a 
tremendous growth of democracy unfortunately the nicaraguan 
government continues to swim against the tide fitzwater said 
the sandinista unwillingness to negotiate with the democratic 
opposition its military harrassment in the country and now its 
unilateral breaking of the ceasefire confirm president ortegas 
desire to maintain power at all costs and at the expense of the 
wishes of the nicaraguan people 
one can only assume that his actions are being taken to thwart 
the democratic opposition as the elections draw near it is obvious 
that hes afraid of the ballot box fitzwater said 
when bush was asked tuesday about the possibility of renewed 
military aid to the contras he told a news conference i would 
reevaluate this situation in a minute if the ceasefire is 
broken 
the sandinista leader shocked a meeting of western hemisphere 
leaders in san jose costa rica last friday with his announcement 
that he planned to call off the 19month ceasefire because of 
savage attacks inside nicaragua by the contra rebels 
a unanimous us senate on tuesday condemned ortegas plan to 
end the ceasefire 
a strongly worded resolution approved 950 demanded that 
ortega renew his commitment to the ceasefire and conduct elections 
scheduled for feb 25 in a free fair and open manner 
it expressed concern that ortegas cancellation of the 
ceasefire could be a prelude to a sandinista effort to cancel or 
postpone the elections 
even ortegas strongest apologists in congress are having a 
hard time coming up with excuses for this one said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas referring to the declaration 
made by ortega that he would end the ceasefire because of alleged 
violations by the contras

leftist rebels said today that 
the slayings of 10 union activists could endanger planned peace 
talks with the government 
a general strike called to protest the slayings had little 
effect on the capital however public transportation and business 
was normal despite the strike call tuesday by the national 
federation of salvadoran workers also known as fenastras 
a homemade bomb at fenastras headquarters on tuesday killed 10 
people and wounded 29 the attack came a day after leftist rebels 
bombarded the defense ministry compound with mortars killing one 
person and wounding 15 
president alfredo cristiani addressing the nation tuesday 
night cautioned that these deeds could signify an escalation of 
terrorist violence in our country 
fenastras in a communique said from now on all workers are at 
war with the rightwing government led by the republican 
nationalist alliance known as arena 
in another statement the leftist farabundo marti national 
liberation front guerrillas blamed the army for the massacre at the 
union hall adding the attack endangers a meeting for peace 
talks with the government to be held in caracas venezuela for 
nov 20 
government and army spokesmen routinely characterize fenastras 
and comadres the committee of mothers of political prisoners 
disappeared and assassinated of el salvador as fronts for leftist 
guerrillas 
two americans mark anner of greenwich conn and brenda 
hubbard of los angeles were injured in the attacks anner was 
wounded at fenastras and miss hubbard at the comadres office 
hubbard and anner are socalled solidarity workers members 
of north american and european organizations that work with local 
leftists in the belief that the presence of foreigners makes 
official repression less likely 
we the workers see more clearly than ever that we are at war 
against arena the rightist governing party said humberto 
centeno of the national union of salvadoran workers the countrys 
largest labor federation 
the government of cristiani whose party has in the past been 
linked to death squad activity said it energetically condemns 
the terrorist acts against comadres and fenastras 
it called the attacks as well as mondays guerrilla mortar 
assault on the defense ministry part of a conspiratorial plan 
whose goal is to create obstacles to the process of dialogue 
government and guerrilla representatives have met twice since 
september in an effort to find a way to end the 10yearold civil 
war the two sides far apart have been able to agree only to 
continue talks in venezuela on nov 20 
the government said the bombings were being investigated and 
that it would not allow escalating violence to knock the peace 
process off track 
we should not lose our serenity and the hope of finding a 
solution to the conflict by civilized means it said in a 
communique 
the blast at fenastras virtually destroyed the twostory 
building in the center of the downtown area just two blocks from 
the national police barracks six people were killed immediately 
and four died later tuesday in the hospital 
one of those killed was febe velasquez a leading figure in 
fenastras the unions secretarygeneral gerardo diaz was among 
the wounded 
fenastras was attacked sept 5 with an antitank rocket that 
damaged the buildings facade but caused no casualties 
tuesdays bombings came a day after leftist rebels attacked the 
defense ministry and headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff with 
homemade mortars killing one person and wounding 15 
this is a response to the attack on the joint chiefs hector 
recinos a member of the directorate of fenastras told journalists 
at the news conference 
the armed forces press committee in a communique rejected the 
accusation and condemned the bomb attacks as terrorism 
ruben zamora one of the countrys top leftist politicians 
condemned the fenastras bombing as part of a wave of attacks 
against all democratic and progressive forces in el salvador 
zamoras house was bombed before dawn on oct 19 slightly 
wounding two of his bodyguards two days earlier while peace talks 
were being held in costa rica gunmen killed the 23yearold 
daughter of an army colonel 
the government and armed forces blamed the rebels who denied 
any responsibility in the slaying

the federal government should build one 
central site to store radioactive waste from nuclear power plants 
until a permanent dump is ready to operate early in the 21st 
century a panel told congress today 
the recommendation by a congressionally ordered study group is 
expected to revive a national debate over whether a temporary 
storage site is necessary and safe as well as where it would be 
situated and who would pay the bill 
the panel which studied the issue for 18 months recommended 
that congress authorize the construction of a temporary waste dump 
capable of holding 5000 metric tons of uranium the fuel that 
nuclear reactors use to make electricity 
it said this would be enough to satisfy the nuclear utilities 
storage needs until the year 2006 the capital cost of the facility 
was put at 500 million to 600 million 
the panel said only those nuclear utilities that used the dump 
should pay for its construction and operation 
the energy department in 1987 proposed building as soon as 
possible a temporary storage facility near oak ridge tenn later 
that year however congress annulled the proposal and created the 
review commission to report on the need for interim storage 
the panel is known as the monitored retreivable storage review 
commission 
tennessee is opposed to being the site of an interim waste dump 
the review commission did not recommend a specific site for the 
dump but said it expected the siting question to be a major public 
issue 
about 20000 metric tons of spent or used nuclear fuel have 
accumulated at nuclear plants around the country since the start of 
commercial nuclear power in the 1960s 
even if no more nuclear reactors were built in this country 
spent fuel from existing reactors is projected to reach 87000 tons 
by the time their licenses expire 
congress in 1987 ordered the energy department to study the 
feasibility of building a permanent dump for the nuclear wastes at 
yucca mountain in nevada but a series of technical and political 
problems have delayed that project the department still says the 
permanent dump could open as soon as 2003 but the storage review 
commission said it believed further delays were likely 
in light of the yucca mountain delays the panel recommended 
building a federal emergency storage facility capable of holding up 
to 2000 metric tons of uranium its purpose would be as a safety 
net of storage capacity for emergency purposes such as an 
accident at a nuclear power plant the panel said it should be paid 
for by all utilities that operate nuclear reactors 
the 1987 law known as the nuclear waste policy amendments act 
also authorized the construction of an interim storage facility but 
said construction could not start until a license had been issued 
for the permanent dump 
the linkage was designed to avoid the possibility often cited 
by critics of the interim facility that continuing delays in 
building the permanent dump could in effect mean waste at the 
temporary site would stay there indefinitely

gunmen killed a saudi arabian embassy 
employee in moslem west beirut today and the iranbacked islamic 
jihad which holds at least two americans hostage claimed 
responsibility for the assassination 
the group said in a statement that it killed mohammed ali 
marzouqi 42 the personnel officer at the saudi embassy in 
damascus syria to avenge the recent execution in saudi arabia of 
16 shiite moslems convicted of terrorism 
the typewritten statement in arabic was accompanied by a picture 
of american hostage terry anderson to prove its authenticity they 
were delivered to the offices of a western news agency in moslem 
west beirut 
police said marzouqi was visiting the moslem sector of the 
lebanese capital when he was killed 
islamic jihad is among the proiran shiite moslem groups in 
lebanon believed to be holding eight americans hostage anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press was 
captured in beirut on march 16 1985 and is the longestheld 
western hostage 
the islamic jihad statement said a few weeks ago the rulers 
of saudi arabia the servants of the devil committed a massacre 
against 16 moslem pilgrims 
marzouki it added was one of the most senior saudi security 
officers in lebanon his activities were not hidden from the eyes 
of the mujahedeen mujahedeen is arabic for holy warriors 
the 16 convicted terrorists were beheaded on sept 21 they were 
all shiite moslem kuwaitis convicted of bomb attacks in the holy 
city of mecca in july in which one pakistani pilgrim was killed and 
16 wounded 
a lebanese police spokesman said marzouqi was climbing into a 
grey embassy limousine in the tallet khayyat district at 930 am 
when three gunmen opened up with submachine guns equipped with 
silencers 
death was instantaneous a police spokesman said 
marzouqis driver a syrian suffered a gunshot wound in the 
hand said the spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations 
marzouqi was a frequent visitor to beirut because he was in 
charge of the affairs of the lebanese employees of the saudi 
embassy in beirut closed down since it was ransacked and burned by 
proiranian shiite moslem zealots in 1985 
his assassination was preceded by a flurry of anonymous calls to 
western news agencies in recent weeks in which men claiming to 
speak for proiranian factions vowed to undermine a peace accord 
worked out in taif saudi arabia 
the arab leaguesponsored accord aimed at ending lebanons 
14yearold civil war was approved oct 22 by lebanons aging 
parliamentary deputies 
because of the civil war which has largely pitted christian 
against moslem militias the country has not held parliamentary 
elections since 1972 
iran has openly rejected the peace accord claiming it asserts 
christian hegemony over the moslem majority in lebanon 
police said a security committee in charge of overseeing a 
ceasefire brokered by the arab league was called to an emergency 
meeting to discuss marzouqis assassination 
saudi embassy employees around the world have been the target of 
assassins over the past year 
on oct 16 abdelrahman shrewi an embassy employee in ankara 
turkey lost his legs in a car bomb blast another saudi diplomat 
was killed there in an earlier attack 
the saudi prayer leader in a brussels belgium mosque was 
assassinated in march and an egyptian driver working in the saudi 
embassy there was found murdered in june an officer of the saudi 
embassy in thailand was killed in bangkok in january 
proiranian groups in beirut claimed responsiblity for the 
assassinations 
also today a newspaper quoted christian army commander gen 
michel aoun as threatening to dissolve parliament to block the 
election of a new president and saying he will punish the deputies 
who approved the taif accord 
in an interview with the conservative addiyar newspaper aoun 
said the deputies acted outside the constitution when they approved 
the accord 
aoun has rejected the peace plan which was welcomed by most 
christian groups because it did not include a specific timetable 
for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops deployed in lebanon 
since 1976 
the syrian troops arrived under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but later sided with moslem militias against the christians

fort worth texas startelegram on financing former presidents 
the next time members of congress insist they are earnestly 
trying to save money taxpayers should ask them why they continue 
to vote for outrageously generous stipends to expresidents 
there is a certain amount of irony in the fact that the same 
week that automatic spending cuts went into effect to conform to 
the grammrudman deficitreduction act the house voted 38330 to 
give 18 million to four expresidents and one expresidents 
widow 
the money is to cover pensions office costs and other expenses 
when the 18 million is added to the 125 million that the secret 
service will spend to provide security for former presidents and 
their families the price tag is sizable 
rep paul kanjorski dpa was on target in complaining that 
this congress should examine whether we are too great in our 
largesse in providing services and costs to former presidents who 
engage in personal income endeavors 
he was specifically referring to ronald reagan who is to 
receive 559500 in pension and expense money to add to the 2 
million he was paid by his japanese sponsors to make two speeches 
in japan last week 
that kind of expenditure is an absurd expense for a 
government that is billions of dollars in debt former presidents 
deserve a reasonable pension but common sense should dictate that 
what they are receiving now exceeds reasonable by a healthy amount

we were all taught about the presidents in grade school our 
respect for the presidency came from the towering example set by 
such great men as washington jefferson lincoln and fdr people of 
intuitive dignity 
forget it the role model our children are watching is ronald 
reagan shill 
reagan is stuffing his pockets with money presumably his reward 
for being entertainingly incompetent for eight years neither he 
nor his loyal hangerson see anything remotely strange or 
inappropriate about his accepting 2 million for two 20minute 
speeches and a promotional tour for a japanese entertainment 
company specializing in quiz shows 
it is easy to understand the japanese affection for reagan he 
is a charming old guy besides his administration developed the 
50 billion annual trade deficit with japan that has made so many 
of his hosts even richer than his friends are gratitude is a 
powerful force 
reagan makes money so do his hosts the only loser is the 
united states

beginning to subside victims of the former first ladys criticism 
are still returning verbal fire but people the media at least 
seem to be tiring of the nonsense 
nancy may have settled some old scores but its costing her 
some dignity don regan angered and embarrassed nancy by 
revealing in his book that the first lady consulted an astrologer 
to help plan the presidents schedule nancy strikes back by saying 
that regan often acted as if he were president nancy admits 
that she wanted regan out but she claims her role in forcing him 
out was exaggerated 
its interesting stuff but its so trivial the book comes off 
sounding like another chapter of soapopera details from an 
administration that already has been relegated to history with 
due respect to the former first lady well pass on buying her book

members of congress tackle the job of creating spending bills 
like children decorating a christmas tree with ornaments they pile 
items on willynilly and dare the others to touch their part of 
the masterpiece then they show the president what theyve wrought 
president after president has wanted to trim the excess without 
stripping the tree bare but congress has been adamant about 
denying presidents that privilege no changes are allowed the tree 
must be accepted as is or rejected entirely 
does the president have the right to pull a single item out of a 
bill and veto it sparing the remainder of the legislation or is 
it a right that must be conferred by congress vice president dan 
quayle suggested this week that president bush thinks the answer 
will never be clear until a president tries it and said the 
president reportedly is seeking a test case to give it a shot by 
midweek quayle was backpedaling but if bush is contemplating the 
idea he has no reason to apologize for it 
this argument over the presidents authority to veto specific 
line items will not be decided in congress it has languished there 
for years at least since the grant administration it is time to 
let the courts have their say

the daily chronicle centralia wash on jim bakkers sentence 
television evangelist jim bakker can count himself lucky that he 
will have to spend only 10 years in federal prison before being 
eligible for parole 
bakker once one of the most influential televangelists in the 
nation was sentenced by us district court judge robert potter to 
a fitting 45 years in prison and fined 500000 for defrauding his 
faithful followers of millions of dollars to finance his luxury 
homes cars and vacations 
had judge potter strictly observed his reputation for severe 
punishment he could have sentenced bakker to a maximum of 120 
years and a fine of more than 5 million many of his disillusioned 
flock would say he deserved the maximum 
one of the most disturbing aspects of bakkers sensational 
sixweek trial was his general lack of remorse although he 
admitted he had sinned he steadfastly maintained he had not 
committed fraud 
his insistence despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary 
that he was innocent of the 24 charges of swindling followers of 
his praise the lord ptl ministry illustrates a moral bankruptcy 
that offers little hope for rehabilitation

west central tribune willmar minn on bakkers sentence 
as much as we abhor the fraudulent ministry of jimmy bakker 
we think the sentence handed down upon his conviction was extremely 
harsh for a nonviolent crime fortyfive years and a 500000 fine 
are far greater than sentences for many violent crimes 
but in the long run it will make bakker a martyr in a few 
years with time off for good behavior he will be right back where 
he was before raking in money from his followers 
while bakker was guilty of fraud a part of the blame should 
rest with the people foolish enough to give him so much money 
separating people from their money is the goal of every economic 
venture most of the time people get something in return 
in bakkers case perhaps they were trying to buy their way into 
heaven

the 45year prison sentence and 500000 fine handed down by

jail cell 
criminals are criminals whether they are millionaire tv

albuquerque nm journal on accountability of the federal 
reserve board 
two democratic members of the us house of representatives want 
to extend political accountability to the federal reserve thats a 
quaint concept political accountability coming from an 
institution where incumbents are virtually guaranteed reelection 
until their dotage 
legislation sponsored by reps lee hamilton and byron dorgan 
would open up operations of the fed and make it more accountable 
and more responsive to congress and the administration 
our statesmen in washington might wield this new economic power 
wisely or they might just let monetary policy flap in the 
political winds like fiscal policy has in recent years as congress 
and presidents scrambled to serve parochial interests and special 
constituencies 
the legislative and executive branches play an enormous role in 
the nations economy already of course neither is willing to 
accept responsibility for the budget deficits that sap the economy 
the proper reply to advocates of putting the federal reserve 
under the thumb of congress and the president get real

the five brought heavy pressure on federal regulators to ease up 
on lincoln savings amp loan association of irvine calif which at

unlimited campaign spending has long since turned american

kenosha wis news on gun deaths 
the us governments national center for health statistics put 
out a grim report the other day on the relationship between 
firearms and young people 
it said that about 11 percent of all deaths of youngsters aged 1 
to 19 are gunrelated 
most at risk are black male teenagers more than 40 percent of 
deaths in that group during the period studied resulted from 
shootings the rate for white teenagers was 16 percent 
louis sullivan secretary of the federal department of health 
and human services said the statistics show that we are losing 
our youth not only to disease but increasingly to injury and 
violence 
imagine one out of 10 americans who die under the age of 20 are 
shot to death either accidentally or deliberately 
yet the national rifle association continues to mouth its 
mindless slogan guns dont kill people people kill people 
tell that to the parents of the approximately 3400 youngsters who 
die by the gun annually 
sullivan said in a statement accompanying the report just as 
we have controlled so many childhood diseases we must now mount an 
equally aggressive campaign to rid our childrens lives of the 
causes and tools of injury and violence lawmakers would do well 
to listen more to people like sullivan and less to nra officials 
who resist all government control of firearms

evening express portland maine on acid rain 
the world is getting used to surprising political initiatives by 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev even to the point of accepting 
a backseat role for the united states 
well he did it again during a visit to finland last week among 
other things gorbachev signed an agreement to reduce sulfur 
dioxide emissions from soviet factories that are killing forests in 
northern finland 
canada would appreciate that sort of gesture from george bush 
sulfur dioxide is the main ingredient in acid rain eighty percent 
of the air pollution afflicting this part of north america is 
believed to come from coalburning utilities and smelters in the 
midwest 
although this has been one of the principal concerns affecting 
uscanadian relations for years the white house has yet to patch 
over the diplomatic damage inflicted by a reagan administration 
which largely refused even to admit the existence of a serious acid 
rain problem

they are responding eagerly from this dialogue has come among 
other things a proposal to establish an american university in 
moscow one aim of which would be to help communists become if 
not capitalists then some close relative 
a school to promote western economic values can only help 
encouraging the spread of such enthusiasm from the

the times trenton nj on president bushs veto of abortion 
bill 
president bush vetoed the massive labor health and human 
services spending bill blocking funding for aids research 
childrens immunizations against crippling diseases and dozens of 
other important health initiatives 
he did it because the bill contains a modest provision to pay 
for abortions for the most vulnerable of american women those 
suffering from the double brutality of poverty and rape or incest 
mr bush threatens to veto the foreign aid spending bill if it 
reaches him with a senatepassed amendment removing restrictions on 
funding un family planning programs those restrictions were 
imposed under the reagan administration at the behest of the 
righttolifers who claimed that the un money supported forced 
abortion policies in china the senate bill requires the us 
contribution be kept seperate from any funds spent in china but 
thats not good enough for president bush 
becasue of this incredible policy the united state has withheld 
birth control information and supplies from third world countries 
where exploding populations make a mockery of all attempts to 
provide food shelter education and jobs and to protect the 
environment the poorest and most vulnerable who suffer directly 
but in this case all the world people in a few decades will be 
paying the price 
the presidents abdication on these issues is a disgrace

a judge ruled that a fundamentalist couple 
who took to heart the biblical admonition against sparing the rod 
abused their children by spanking them with a stick and paddle a 
family supporter said today 
the ruling made in a closeddoor juvenile proceeding that 
raised the question of how far adults may go in disciplining their 
children endorsed social workers decision to take the youngsters 
from their parents in august 
the parents stephen and joann decosta of rumney still face 
assault charges brought separately in a criminal indictment earlier 
this year 
former gov meldrim thomson who was called as a character 
witness but never testified said he learned that district judge 
edwin kelly ruled tuesday that the decostas abused their 3yearold 
daughter and 7yearold son 
thomson said the judge also ruled the couple abused their other 
children a 9yearold son and a 14yearold daughter 
there was no immediate confirmation of the ruling the ruling 
means the children will remain in state custody for up to 18 months 
unless the parents regain custody on appeal or the family is 
reconciled through counseling 
the state brought abuse charges against the parents after 
spankings left the childrens rear ends red and bruised 
authorities said 
court clerk phil tapply confirmed a decision was reached but 
would not say what it was 
andrew mcevoy the decostas lawyer declined to comment today 
citing a state law that prohibits talking about child abuse or 
neglect cases 
mrs decosta citing the same statute would not comment 
the familys supporters maintain that the state is unjustly 
penalizing the decostas because their religious beliefs dictate 
that parents should use corporal punishment on their children they 
also say the statute barring discussion of the case is harming the 
family by leaving it unable to answer rumors 
judy bell a lawyer for the division of children and youth 
services said earlier that such charges brought by the division 
are ruled either founded or unfounded state officials 
would not discuss the decision

former president richard nixon on wednesday ended 
five days of talks with top chinese leaders in which he expressed 
american concerns over political repression and suggested ways to 
restore damaged chinaus ties 
nixons trip had one immediate effect rifletoting police were 
removed from outside the us embassy for the first time since the 
bloody military crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in june 
nixon on a private visit will leave for home thursday and will 
send a report of his talks to president bush next week a member of 
the nixon entourage said 
he is the most prominent american to come to china since the 
crackdown 
the bush administration suspended all highlevel official 
contacts after the crackdown and relations have reached one of 
their lowest levels since nixon reopened ties with china with his 
dramatic 1972 visit to beijing 
nixons 20 hours of talks with senior leader deng xiaoping 
premier li peng communist party chief jiang zemin and others were 
marked by blunt statements on both sides 
the nixon aide who declined to be further identified said 
nixon was successful in explaining in unminced fashion the 
reasons for the strong us reaction to the crackdown and in 
assessing chinaus relations as seen by the chinese 
he also was able to engage the chinese in a dialogue on the 
soviet union indochina eastern europe and other international 
issues 
among the conclusions the aide said were that the chinese want 
to restore good relations but insist the initiative must come from 
washington and that the chinese are not yet willing to confront or 
reassess the events of june 
deng while agreeing that the two countries must put strategic 
interests above ideological differences accused the united states 
of becoming involved too deeply in the prodemocracy 
demonstrations he said china was the real victim of the events 
and it is unjust to reprove china 
some chinese leaders the aide said do see a resurrection of 
the past before 1972 when the united states tried to totally 
isolate the communist government in beijing 
among the measures nixon suggested the chinese could take to 
improve ties were restoration of the fulbright program attention 
to human rights issues and the removal of police with automatic 
rifles from the outside the us embassy 
on wednesday for the first time in four months police posted 
outside the embassy compound were not armed with rifles in an 
apparent gesture to the former president 
however harassment of embassy staff and visitors continued 
several dozen uniformed policeman plus at least 10 plainclothes 
police milled outside one of the embassy gates and shined a 
spotlight into the compound 
the police armed with pistols forced visitors to park hundreds 
of yards away even though there were many empty spaces in front of 
the embassy 
premier li told nixon the police were needed to guard against 
escape by dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian who have 
been hiding in the embassy since june 
the nixon aide asked whether the subject of fang came up in the 
discussions said only that there was hardly any issue that was not 
taken up 
nixon addressing hardline president yang shangkun at a 
banquet noted that many americans believe the military attack on 
the student movement was excessive and unjustified 
but he said he was confident chinaus relations would survive 
and prosper 
enemies do not have fallingouts enemies do not fear they are 
being misunderstood only friends do he said as the 
bitterness of the last few months recedes and as our common 
interests draw us together our relationship will emerge stronger 
than ever

the first person to contract the aids virus in 
china has been identified in beijing an official said wednesday 
the man was a former shop assistant in a beijing food store who 
had long been sexually promiscuous and had homosexual relations 
with foreigners said cao qing vice director of the department of 
epidemic prevention in the public health ministry 
the man was detained for committing homosexual acts a crime in 
china but left the country before it was confirmed he had the aids 
virus cao said in an interview declining to give the mans name 
or whereabouts 
this in regard to our country of 11 billion people is a 
very dangerous signal the science and technology daily quoted 
cao as saying about the victim 
one chinese man died from the disease after contracting the 
virus in the united states four people in hangzhou one a 
hemophiliac who later died from what the chinese said were 
unrelated causes tested positive for the aids virus after 
transfusions with imported blood 
but china says that none of the previous 25 cases of aids 
infection mostly involving foreigners originated on the mainland 
despite the near nonexistence of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in china authorities have raised a nationwide alarm about 
the disase 
all foreigners taking up residence in china must show proof that 
they are aidsfree and earlier this year legislation took effect 
that gives health officials the right to test any chinese deemed at 
risk of contracting the killer disease 
imports of blood products have been banned and chinese returning 
from more than a year abroad must be tested for aids 
the official press television movies and streetside billboards 
have also linked aids to western liberalism now being condemned by 
chinas conservative leaders with the message going out that those 
attracted to decadent western ways run the risk of aids infection 
a positive test for the aids virus detects the presence of aids 
antibodies meaning the person has been exposed to the virus those 
carrying the virus could later develop aids 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

a shipboard fire that injured nine sailors 
in the atlantic today extended to five the string of serious 
accidents this week that have cost the navy up to seven lives 
sailors were trying to start a boiler when it caught fire on the 
oiler uss monongahela in the eastern atlantic the navy said the 
blaze disabled the ship nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and 
one also was burned officials said 
one sailor was missing in each of two incidents earlier this 
week involving men overboard and a plane crash aboard an aircraft 
carrier on sunday killed five people 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said he saw no connection 
between the recent accidents he said the navy has an excellent 
safety record 
a wave swept three sailors and 38 missiles off the aircraft 
carrier uss dwight d eisenhower early tuesday in the atlantic 
about 90 miles southeast of cape hatteras nc the wave struck a 
freight elevator as sailors moved missiles from one deck to 
another the navy said 
late monday a sailor fell off the carrier uss carl vinson into 
rough pacific seas about 620 miles north of wake island the navy 
said 
rescuers in a helicopter plucked one eisenhower sailor from the 
water a second was rescued by boat they were being treated aboard 
ship where one was in serious condition and the other in good 
condition the navy said 
it looks like theyre both going to make it said lt paul 
jenkins a navy spokesman in norfolk 
craig a harris 22 of uniontown pa was missing from the 
eisenhower navy vessels and aircraft searched for him tuesday 
before giving up 
there were no plans to salvage the missiles because they have 
been ruined by the salt water said lt cmdr mike john a 
spokesman for the atlantic fleets air command he said he had no 
information on their value 
the 18 sparrow and 20 sidewinder missiles swept off the ship 
were not nuclearpowered said an atlantic fleet spokeswoman 
senior chief petty officer cindy adams therefore theyre 
harmless she said 
on the vinson a sailor fell into the sea while the carrier cut 
through 12foot swells while returning to its home port at the 
alameda naval air station near san francisco after taking part in 
exercises 
the navy searched choppy waters by air and sea tuesday for the 
sailor whose name was not released 
on sunday a pilot making his first landing on a carrier crashed 
on the uss lexington in the gulf of mexico killing him and four 
people on the ship a videotape of the crash will not be made 
public because it is part of the investigation the pentagon said 
on monday a pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on the guided 
missile cruiser uss reeves in the indian ocean injuring five 
sailors 
a navy spokesman at the pentagon lt bruce cole said the pilot 
apparently mistook lights from the reeves for flares marking 
barrels in the water that were to be used as bombing targets in a 
nighttime weapons training exercise 
the worst navy accident this year was the explosion in a turret 
of the battleship uss iowa in april the blast killed 47 sailors 
before the most recent accidents sailors had fallen or been 
swept off navy ships at least four times during the past five 
months at least four sailors were killed

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods remained flat last month but would have fallen had it not 
been for the second largest increase in defense orders in history 
the government reported wednesday 
analysts viewed the report as another sign of weakness in the 
manufacturing sector which will produce in continued sluggishness 
in the overall economy in the months ahead 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2367 
billion in september that included a 596 percent gain in defense 
orders to 127 billion the largest advance in that category 
since a record 683 percent advance in june 1988 
without the defense factor orders actually declined 21 
percent the department said 
it continues to show sluggishness in the manufacturing 
sector economist david berson of the federal national mortgage 
association said of the report i think well see it pretty flat 
for a while 
berson pointed to the second consecutive drop in nondefense 
capital goods as an indication of things to come 
those orders a barometer of business investment plans were off 
52 percent after dropping 104 percent in august 
the economy particularly the manufacturing and housing sectors 
have been hit hardest by high interest rates as the federal reserve 
tightened credit in its attempt to slow inflation 
underlining that the commerce department also reported 
wednesday that construction spending was unchanged in september 
after a 15 percent spurt in august but it too was propped up by 
a 43 percent increase in public construction 
factory inventories posted their first decline since february 
1987 but that was a fractional 01 percent fall to 3712 billion 
if inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new orders 
it could signal production cutbacks in the future as factories 
attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 16 percent to 2344 
billion 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years rose 02 percent to 127 billion boosted 
by a 72 percent increase in electrical machinery to 208 billion 
primary metals orders were up 09 percent to 114 billion 
but nonelectrical machinery orders including computers were 
off 07 percent to 225 billion 
transportation equipment orders on the other hand fell 47 
percent to 348 billion as declines in autos and nonmilitary 
aircraft more than offset gains in military aircraft orders 
without the drop in transportation total orders would have 
risen 08 percent 
orders for nondurable goods were down 03 percent to 1097 
billion led by a decline in food products 
total orders for the first nine months were 75 percent over 
those of the same period a year earlier

the government today said it put 
troops on alert because hundreds of namibian guerrillas reportedly 
crossed into namibia from angola in the past week 
foreign minister pik botha said his country is prepared to act 
even if it delays next weeks unsupervised elections that are a 
step toward namibian independence from south africa its southern 
neighbor 
guerrilla leaders accused botha of trying to sabotage the 
election by making false allegations 
botha told a news conference that foreign affairs personnel 
intercepted messages from un soldiers referring to the 
infiltration from angola of more than 600 guerrillas of the 
southwest africa peoples organization between oct 23 and oct 31 
swapos secretarygeneral andimba toivo ja toivo denied 
bothas assertion saying it was a concoction by the south 
african government in a bid to sabotage the election 
it is wellknown that the south african government sends it 
own troops dressed in other armies clothing when it wishes to 
fabricate an offensive maneuver toivo said 
eddie amkongo a guerrilla spokesman in windhoek namibia 
challenged botha to prove his naive and childish remarks 
if it can be proved that mr botha is spreading lies days 
before the people of namibia are about to exercise their democratic 
rights swapo would have no choice but to assume that south africa 
has a hidden agenda 
but francois giuliani the chief un spokesman told reporters 
in new york we are not aware of any such action along the 
namibian border this is the first we have heard of it 
giuliani responding to a question at a daily news briefing 
said botha had telephoned the un chief at 830 am edt to 
inform the secretarygeneral of his allegations 
undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding in charge of un 
peacekeeping operations also was informed he said 
swapo maintained bases in angola during its 23year bush war 
against south african rule but is not supposed to have armed 
personnel in namibia during the transitional period under the un 
plan south africa also withdrew its troops from the territory 
swapo is favored to get the most votes in a fiveday election 
starting next tuesday for seats in an assembly that will draft a 
constitution for namibia 
after a cabinet meeting botha said he met with ambassadors of 
the united states britain canada west germany and other western 
countries urging them to do whatever they can to end this now 
the messages made it clear that swapo warned united nations 
patrols they they shouldnt interfere or they would be shot 
botha said the tendency of un peacekeeping troops is that 
they are wishing to evacuate to run 
he said the un peacekeeping force is certainly not doing its 
job it is frightened to do it where swapo is involved 
unless this is resolved within days the south african 
government is reserving the right to take whatever steps would be 
required to ensure that all parties comply with their 
obligations botha said the south african security forces have 
been put on alert 
botha said military units in walvis bay a south african enclave 
on namibias coast had been included in the alert 
if south africa was forced to act botha said the election 
definitely would be delayed 
south africa has ruled namibia a former german colony since 
1915 in december south africa signed accords with angola and cuba 
agreeing to cooperate with a un plan for namibias transition to 
independence as cuba withdraws its 50000 troops from angola

the transportation department intends to draw

workers in the transportation industry 
following the pattern of drugtesting rules the department says 
in a notice in thursdays federal register that it is considering 
several steps to combat alcohol abuse the department asks for 
public comments on alcohol problems in the transportation industry 
to be submitted by jan 31 
we ought to find ways of dealing with alcoholimpaired 
operators in a safety environment transportation secretary 
samuel skinner said in an interview earlier this week on tuesday 
he discussed proposals for rules on alcoholabuse testing with 
trucking groups meeting in chicago 
tests for alcohol abuse were not included in the transportation 
departments drugtesting rules which take effect in december 
portions of the rules covering highway transportation workers 
opposed by many truckers have been stopped by a court injunction 
separately congress is working on legislation that would 
require drug testing in the transportation industry a senate 
measure would add alcohol testing 
among options being considered by the department are requiring 
preemployment periodic reasonablecause postaccident and 
random alcohol testing of transportation employees in jobs where 
public safety is at stake 
another proposal would set up programs to identify alcohol 
abusers and persuade them to enter rehabilitation programs with 
the understanding that the identified abusers could retain their 
jobs after successful rehabilitation 
a third proposal would establish assistance programs to educate 
employees and employers on the dangers of alcohol abuse and how to 
detect it on the job 
the federal aviation highway and railroad administrations 
already have rules that prohibit drinking on the job and set a far 
tougher standard for blood alcohol content among commercial 
operators than the levels used by police departments to determine 
intoxication

construction spending after surging ahead in 
august was unchanged last month the government said wednesday in 
another report reflecting continued weakness in that segment of the 
economy 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4156 billion in september after jumping 15 
percent in august following declines of 18 percent in july and 08 
percent in june 
spending had spurted in august because of a strong 53 percent 
increase in government building and a 29 percent gain in 
nonresidential construction 
but economist david berson of the federal national mortgage 
association said that pace of spending is unsustainable because of 
government budget problems and a glut of vacant office buildings 
the construction industry has been among the sectors of the 
economy hardest hit by the federal reserves campaign to keep 
inflation in check 
but the fed has been easing its grip on the economy and analysts 
have been looking for a slight pickup in construction spending as 
interest rates fall 
fixedrate mortgages declined from a peak of 1122 percent in 
march to 1016 percent at the end of september according to the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
private construction was off 12 percent last month to an annual 
rate of 3276 billion reflecting declines in both residential and 
nonresidential building 
residential building which accounts for nearly half of 
construction spending fell 09 percent to a 1919 billion rate 
that included a drop of 11 percent in singlefamily construction 
to 1115 billion and a 22 percent decline in apartment building 
to 227 billion 
nonresidential construction such as factories and office 
buildings that represent about 20 percent of construction spending 
fell 26 percent to 991 billion at an annual rate 
the volatile government projects category representing another 
20 percent of construction spending was up 43 percent to 88 
billion 
the total construction spending figure for the first nine months 
was up 1 percent from the same period of 1988

a fairhousing group has sued the cincinnati 
enquirer charging that the newspapers real estate advertising 
violates the fair housing act by featuring only whites in 
illustrations 
karla irvine executive director of housing opportunities made 
equal or home said tuesday that among 1000 ads appearing in the 
enquirer between nov 8 1987 and oct 15 1989 only nine 
featured nonwhite models 
if you only advertise with white models youre saying your 
market is only for whites ms irvine said 
the lawsuit filed in federal court asks for an end to the 
alleged practices and seeks unspecified damages 
george blake editor of the cincinnati enquirer said the suit 
was misdirected 
it is unfortunate that housing opportunities made equal inc 
has chosen to sue the enquirer and to engage in costly and 
timeconsuming legal proceedings rather than working directly and 
constructively with the advertisers home complains about in its 
lawsuit blake said 
we do not agree with the basis of the lawsuit and will proceed 
to exercise our rights in the federal court system we have and 
will continue to abide by the laws that cover the operation of the 
newspaper 
robert b newman a lawyer who filed the lawsuit for home said 
asking the newspaper to make changes was more economical than 
pursuing each advertiser in court 
ms irvine said only two builders advertising in the newspaper 
use nonwhite models in their real estate ads

the chairman of the new york stock exchange 
said today he could support giving the federal government authority 
to suspend program trading during times of wild swings in stock 
prices 
chairman john j phelan jr testified before a house commerce 
subcommittee which is considering legislation to permit the 
securities and exchange commission to suspend trading that is 
controlled by computer program 
we have to sit down with the commission to see how they feel 
about such emergency powers phelan told reporters after 
testifying in a closed session of the subcommittee 
phelan said he will take up the issue when he meets thursday 
with the board of governors of the new york exchange 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance said disruptions 
associated with broad swings in stock prices leave the impression 
with many potential investors that the stock market has become 
the playground of a few privileged firms 
the bottom line is that we are messing with the golden goose 
capital formation markey said 
phelan said in an earlier interview with the washington post 
that if broad price swings are left unchecked it is going to 
destroy the markets as a capitalraising mechanism much less as a 
place where people can invest intelligently 
a lot of people think it is a new york stock exchange issue 
he said it is a national issue liquidity in all markets and 
volatility in all markets 
it affects individual investors because they get frightened to 
death of this volatility that is there and we dont blame them 
phelan said 
phelans remarks came as he was preparing to testify today to 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications 
and finance and meet thursday with the exchanges board of 
governors 
the closeddoor hearing on capitol hill was to examine the 
causes of the oct 13 market plunge that saw the dow jones 
industrial average plunged more than 190 points 
considerable criticism has been focused on the practice of 
massive buying and selling triggered by computer programs that have 
caused stock prices to move quickly and dramatically phelan 
offered no specifics on what if anything should be done about the 
program trading

the shipboard summit next month between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will take 
place in the waters off malta a group of five islands in the 
central mediterranean the white housesaid today 
the location was disclosed as the white house said preliminary 
meetings had begun to plan the issues that bush would raise at the 
dec 23 meeting and logistics for the trip 
original speculation about the summit site had centered on the 
waters off italy since gorbachev will conclude a visit there on 
dec 1 however white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
issued a midday announcement pinpointing the waters off malta as 
the site 
malta is an independent republic in the central mediterranean 
consisting of five islands two of them uninhabited it lies 58 
miles south of sicily 220 miles north of libya and 180 miles east 
of tunisia 
earlier today a soviet government spokesman joined the chorus 
of american praise for the seawater summit next month saying the 
meeting could be the end of the cold war 
bush said tuesday he and gorbachev would meet on ships in the 
mediterranean sea for informal discussions of a wide range of 
topics including the dynamic change in the communist world 
bush said the meeting would not focus on strategic arms 
reduction talks but instead would allow the leaders to put up our 
feet and deepen our respective understanding of each others 
views 
i dont want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night 
because of failed communication bush said i just didnt want 
to in this time of dynamic change miss something something 
that i might get better firsthand from mr gorbachev 
gennady gerasimov soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
today i think that this meeting can just be the end of the cold 
war the cold war will be dumped down to the bottom of the 
mediterranean sea 
he was interviewed from moscow on the abctv show good 
morning america 
also interviewed from moscow was zbigniew brzezinski who was 
national security adviser to former president carter i sense 
that were reaching a point in which we can seriously tackle some 
of the most basic issues for the cold war he said 
the december meeting to be held on us and soviet warships on 
alternate days would be the first presidential meeting between 
bush and gorbachev they met previously in new york on dec 7 
1988 when bush was vice president and presidentelect 
bush and gorbachev still plan to meet next spring or summer to 
discuss arms control in a more formal setting said the president 
and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who made a 
simultaneous announcement in moscow 
the decision to meet less formally before the end of 1989 is a 
very positive thing said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
adding that he hoped the meeting would stimulate greater speed in 
moving on the arms control proposal 
i think a saltwater summit is a good idea said sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas an informal meeting at sea could provide the 
right atmosphere to get things moving in several channels 
including trade as well as arms control 
the deputy gop leader in the senate alan simpson of wyoming 
said it is a good time to have a meeting 
but the senior republican on the senate foreign relations 
committee sen jesse helms rnc said it was more public 
relations by gorbachev 
i hope that no fundamental decisions of any sort will be 
made said helms one of the few members of congress to criticize 
the announcement 
one of bushs most vocal critics senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine applauded the meeting but repeated his charge 
that bush was too timid in responding to gorbachevs domestic 
reforms the democratic changes in poland and hungary and the 
demands for freedom in east germany and czechoslovakia 
bush who earlier had rejected calls for an early meeting with 
gorbachev told a news conference that what changed my mind on it 
was consultation with our allies the rapidity of change in eastern 
europe the emergence of democracies in this hemisphere and this 
concept of dynamic change is something that i might get better 
firsthand from mr gorbachev 
the president rejected suggestions that he proposed the informal 
meeting to deflect domestic criticism and to help gorbachev fend 
off rivals 
thats not why we are doing it but if that should be the 
fallout so be it said bush ive elected to remain very quiet 
in the face of a good deal of sentiment that we were missing an 
opportunity 
officials said they did not know if first ladies barbara bush 
and raisa gorbachev would accompany their husbands 
the idea for the informal meeting began when bush visited poland 
and hungary in july and reformers there urged him to support 
gorbachevs efforts to change the soviet bloc on the plane home 
he wrote gorbachev a letter proposing the meeting aides said 
although gorbachev responded immediately and 
enthusiastically in august said bush the planning was secret 
known only to top white house advisers secretary of state james a 
baker iii and a few of his senior aides 
it was a bolt from the blue to working level officials said 
one administration source speaking on condition of anonymity 
bush and gorbachev are expected to hold the talks only with a 
handful of senior aides rather than the cumbersome working groups 
typical of earlier summits said administration sources 
bush and shevardnadze said they were not calling the planned 
meeting a summit echoing comments by thenpresident reagan on the 
eve of his october 1986 meeting with gorbachev in iceland where 
the two leaders ended up competing to make the most sweeping 
proposals to destroy superpower nuclear weapons the meeting 
foundered over reagans plan for star wars antimissile defenses 
the seawater summit will not be a repeat of iceland said bush 
its not going to be an arms control meeting said bush 
neither president gorbachev nor i anticipate that substantial 
decisions or agreements will emerge from this december meeting

two weeks after a human rights group filed 
suit against the military government in connection with dozens of 
prison deaths more than 2000 inmates have been freed the justice 
ministry said wednesday 
the ministry also said a committee would be set up to facilitate 
the release of detainees and inmates 
the statement provided no details on who would be released in 
the past the government has freed those awaiting trial or 
convicted of minor crimes in some cases prisoners have waited 
years to go to trial 
the civil liberties organization a nigerian group that has 
pressed for human rights in the west african nation alleged last 
month that 78 inmates died in one prison this year because of 
malnutrition lack of medical care and inhuman conditions 
the organization demanded 1 million in compensation for the 
relatives of the dead prisoners 
hundreds of deaths have been reported in nigerian prisons 
recently 
amnesty international reported this year that jail cells and 
prisons had grossly deficient sanitation and overcrowding and 
a large number of prisoners died from disease and medical neglect

sympathy should not be a factor when a jury 
decides whether a convicted murderer deserves the death penalty a 
lawyer for oklahoma told the supreme court on wednesday 
we think that sympathy is among a catalogue of things that 
could improperly influence the sentence oklahoma assistant 
attorney general robert nance told the justices 
nance urged the court to reinstate the overturned death sentence 
of robyn leroy parks convicted of the 1977 killing of abdullah 
ibrahim an oklahoma city gas station attendant 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals while upholding parks 
conviction threw out his death sentence last year 
the judge at parks sentencing trial told jurors among other 
things you must avoid any influence of sympathy sentiment 
passion prejudice or other arbitrary factor when imposing 
sentence 
the appeals court said that instruction undermines the jurys 
consideration of mitigating evidence factors suggesting life 
imprisonment rather than death as the appropriate punishment 
nance argued wednesday that the appeals court was mistaken 
this instruction did not construct any additional barriers to 
the consideration of mitigating evidence he said 
but vivian berger a new york city lawyer appointed by the 
justices to represent parks contended that jurors could be mislead 
by the antisympathy instruction 
we have to look at this through the eyes of lay jurors she 
said this instruction interferes with the full consideration of 
mitigating evidence 
at parks sentencing trial jurors were told about eight 
mitigating factors most of them based on parks troubled 
childhood 
but ms berger said jurors could have mistakenly thought that 
along with avoiding any sympathy they must also avoid considering 
mitigating factors presented by parks 
parks does not assert any constitutional right to a 
sympathetic jury only a right to a sentencer not precluded from 
considering any mitigating factor ms berger said 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice antonin scalia 
voiced skepticism over the potential for juror confusion 
many of the courts questions however centered on whether a 
decision favoring parks could be applied retroactively to other 
death row inmates across the country several justices said they 
doubted such a ruling would have to be applied retroactively 
that question was not among those presented by oklahomas 
appeal and its discussion during the oral argument session may 
or may not indicate at least five votes among the nine justices 
to uphold parks victory in the appeals court 
the justices in 1987 upheld a california murderers death 
sentence even though jurors in that case were told they should not 
be swayed by mere sympathy 
the justices by a 54 vote said in the california case that a 
reasonable juror would understand the instruction not to rely on 
mere sympathy as a directive to ignore only the sort of sympathy 
that would be totally divorced from the mitigating evidence 
the court is expected to announce its decision in parks case by 
july 
the case is saffle vs parks 881264

prime minister benazir bhutto 
defeated the first noconfidence motion in pakistans 42year 
history wednesday her opponents in parliament claimed the vote was 
rigged 
the combined opposition mustered 107 votes in the 237seat 
national assembly 12 short of a majority 
i have no rancor nor any ill will against those who have moved 
the notrust motion against me she said after speaker meraj 
khalid read the tally 
khalid called it a historical moment for the country 
ghulam mustafa jatoi leader of the opposition sominated by the 
centerright islamic democratic alliance said we will bow to 
the decision of the house 
he said at a news conference however that 22 members of ms 
bhuttos leftleaning pakistan peoples party were confined to her 
office to keep them from voting against her 
a spokesman for the prime minister called that absolute 
nonsense 
ms bhuttos leftleaning party has 111 seats in the assembly 
and governs with the aid of smaller parties and independents 
she said after the vote this is a time for reflection by the 
government we are exploring the possibility of negotiating with 
the more moderate elements of our opposition 
her supporters rose to applaud as the 36yearold prime minister 
entered the chamber before the debate wearing the colors of the 
pakistani flag a loose native dress of green and a white scarf 
she expects her second child by the end of the year 
members were given military escorts to the parliament building 
which was surrounded by soldiers and police opposition legislators 
had requested the special security to ensure them access to the 
session 
authorities banned processions in islamabad and some other 
cities to prevent clashes between supporterw and opponents of the 
government 
police in karachi pakistans largest city said young men set a 
bus ablaze and fired shots into the air but no one was injured 
they said it was not clear whether the disturbances were related to 
events in the capital 
in lahore a northeastern city where no ban was imposed 
supporters of ms bhuttos party chanted slogans and set off 
fireworks in celebration of her victory no violence was reported 
opponents accuse ms bhuttos government of corruption and say 
she has not pursued economic reforms they deem necessary 
she has denied the corruption charges but said wednesday 
what mistakes weve made weve made were not angels 
the opposition put the noconfidence motion forward after a 
small party of indian immigrants who had supported the government 
changed sides oct 23 
pakistans first free elections in 11 years were held in 
november 1988 three months after the death in a plane crash of 
president mohammed zia ulhaq 
gen zia overthrew ms bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar 
ali bhutto in 1977 bhutto subsequently was convicted of plotting 
to murder a political foe who was not killed and was hanged in 
1979

investigators may have found a flaw in 
an engine fan made from the same batch of titanium as the dc10 
disk suspected of causing a jet crash that killed 112 people a 
metallurgist testified today 
james wildey ii chief metallurgist for the national 
transportation safety board said however there was no evidence 
the disk pulled from another plane could have caused an accident 
similar to the july 19 crash which 184 people survived 
wildey testified on the second day of a hearing on the crash of 
the united airlines jet at sioux gateway airport investigators say 
the rear engine disintegrated in fight severing the jets 
hydraulic lines and making the plane nearly impossible to control 
wildey said a hairline crack in the rear engine fan disk of the 
plane existed before the crash and was visible to the naked eye 
after the accident but he said it is too early to say whether the 
crack could have been detected before the crash 
wildey made no conclusion on how long the crack had been on the 
general electric co engine 
after the crash ge pulled out of service six other engine disks 
made from the same source of titanium wildey said preliminary 
tests show a possible flaw in one of the disks but that he could 
not conclude it might have led to similar engine failure 
there was no evidence of any type of fatigue or crack he 
said although he did not otherwise describe the possible flaw 
ntsb investigators also said they had not concluded that the 
crack was responsible for the crash joseph nall the ntsb member 
in charge of the sioux city hearing said no final decision on the 
cause will be issued for months 
wildey said in his report that two cracks were found in the 
united jets disk but that only one a hairline crack existed 
before the engine exploded in flight 
wildeys report is based on testing of the fan disk found in 
two pieces in corn fields near alta about 80 miles east of the 
airport where the airplane cartwheeled and burst into flames as 
pilots tried to make an emergency landing 
last week a federal aviation administration official said tests 
on the disk indicated that the crack was caused by a flaw in the 
metal that probably was present when the disk was built 18 years 
ago 
united spokesman rob doughty said tuesday that it was too early 
to pinpoint the cause of the engine explosion he said experts have 
only had 12 days to study the disk and a full analysis takes two 
months 
phillip battaglia an engineering test pilot from mcdonnell 
douglas which made the dc10 testified tuesday that the company 
had not anticipated an explosion severing all three hydraulic lines 
and did not have instructions on how a pilot should deal with the 
problem 
he said that it was unlikely any instructions could help a pilot 
safely land such a crippled plane 
its my opinion that this is not a trainable maneuver he 
said

wimpbaiting has been a factor in american 
politics since early in the republics history and the result has 
been a compulsive masculinity among recent presidents says a 
professor who has studied the wimp factor in history 
the wimp theme has persisted since thomas jefferson who was 
called womanish through martin van buren who was accused of 
wearing corsets and taking too many baths and george bush who had 
to battle what newsweek magazine called the wimp factor in a 
1988 cover story that asked if he could overcome it 
adlai stevenson the democrats candidate against war hero 
dwight eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 was called adelade and 
walter f mondale who ran against ronald reagan in 1984 had to 
confront bumper stickers that said mondale eats quiche quiche 
is considered wimp food unsuitable for manly presidential palates 
ask bush who made a campaign point of eating manly pork rinds 
their cholesterol count be damned 
bruce curtis who teaches american thought and language at 
michigan state university says in an age thats less muscular than 
the past presidents have felt obliged to reveal themselves as 
tough and their opponents as sissies 
now that the ideal masculine man is farther removed from 
reality than ever many nostalgic menand not a few nostalgic 
women demand that our public leaders appear more masculine than 
ever he says in an article in the november issue of american 
heritage 
the result he says is for politicians to assert their virility 
thus he says no president has been more earthily vulgar 
than lyndon johnson who ridiculed opponents of his vietnam 
policies as nervous nellies 
richard nixon reached for a pugilistic methaphor to describe his 
kitchen debate with nikita khrushchev saying he felt he had 
been up against a bareknuckle slugger who had goughed kneed and 
kicked 
even jimmy carter among recent presidents seemingly the least 
driven by machismo revealed during the 1988 campaign his 
susceptibility to its public demands by remarking that bush seemed 
rather effeminate notes curtis 
in his day carter too was accused of acting like a wimp in a 
famous mistake the boston globe went to press in 1980 with an 
editorial bearing a prankish headline that had not been intended to 
see the light of day more mush from the wimp 
to offset perceived wimpishness candidates often talk tough 
bush bragged the day after his 1984 vice presidential debate 
with geraldine ferraro that he had kicked a little ass 
teddy roosevelt outraged that woodrow wilson initially shied 
away from plunging america into world war i said what wilson had 
done was to emasculate american manhood ronald reagan 
threatening to veto a bill if congress sent it to him borrowed a 
line from movie strongman clint eastwood make my day 
in the 19th century reformers were ridiculed as nambypamby 
goodygoody gentlemen who sip cold tea andrew jackson the 
war hero and indian fighter described another politician as miss 
nancy jefferson was called womanish because he took 
counsel of his feelings and imagination 
stevenson was adelade to the new york daily news which also 
said he used teacup words and had the support of harvard 
laceliberals and lacepanty diplomats 
the need to prove himself tough sent michael dukakis the 
democrats presidential candidate last year into a tank turret for 
the filming of a campaign commercial which backfired dukakis 
didnt look like he belonged there 
bush fought to overcome the wimp factor although there was 
an occasional lapse once he was overheard saying hed have just 
another splash of coffee 
women in politics like ms ferraro or rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo who shed tears when she withdrew as a candidate for the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1988 are condemned no 
matter what they do curtis wrote 
if gentle they are womanish if tough they are not womanly 
by tradition a female cannot be a courageous charismatic wise 
effective leader as a woman 
the point concludes curtis is not that the manly 
characteristics of the myth courage assertiveness in the face of 
aggression righteous defense of the weak are undesirable or 
dangerous in themselves the cinematic myth is dangerous because it 
is labeled for men only and because it may be distorted and 
debased by actors on the public scene

cambodias defense minister admitted 
khmer rouge guerrillas captured pailin a western town and said 
the city of battambang was under martial law a thai newspaper 
reported wednesday 
it was the first cambodian acknowledgment of the loss of pailin 
near the thai border taking the town was the most important khmer 
rouge victory since a vietnamese invasion in december 1978 ousted 
pol pots khmer rouge government 
north vietnam blames china and other supporters of cambodian 
guerrillas for an increase in fighting since vietnamese occupation 
troops withdrew late in september hanois official news agency 
reported wednesday 
the three guerrilla factions fighting the government north 
vietnam installed in phnom penh have made significant military 
gains since the withdrawal the khmer rouge said it captured pailin 
on oct 22 
tea banh the defense minister was quoted as saying in the 
nation that government forces retreated from pailin after three 
days of heavy shelling and an assault by thousands of khmer rouge 
fighters 
it is hard to concentrate large numbers of our troops in one 
area so when the resistance troops moved in to avoid loss of life 
we retreated it quoted him as saying the nation said the 
interview was conducted in phnom penh but it did not say when 
khmer rouge radio has reported a drive by its forces toward 
battambang a provincial capital east of pailin the paper quoted 
tea banh as saying battambang was put under martial law oct 26 
a dusktodawn curfew lifted at the beginning of 1989 was 
reimposed monday in phnom penh 
western diplomats and other observers have expressed doubt the 
cambodia army described as poorly trained and led can survive 
without vietnamese support some analysts fear the khmer rouge 
largest of the guerrilla groups will return to power by military 
means 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians were killed in the bloody

university officials will not stop 
production of a critically acclaimed play about homosexuals and 
aids despite a groups claim that it glorifies homosexuality and 
promotes antifamily values 
marshall gordon president of southwest missouri state 
university said the school will not yield to detractors of the 
normal heart and will allow it to be shown at a campus theater 
nov 1520 
the play we feel is irresponsible said paul summers 
chairman of a citzens group he says numbers about 100 people 
theres nothing educational theres nothing artistic about it 
we take strong exception to the language to the portrayal of 
homosexuality and its political agenda 
gordon said tuesday that students clearly have a consitutional 
right and given the growing number of cases of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome even a duty to produce such a play 
ive said all along that the university should promulgate the 
truth about the aids issue gordon said the university 
community the city state and nation should be aware of the 
problems that are posed by the threat of aids to continue to sweep 
the issue under the rug is not in the nations longterm interest 
the controversy began last month when a student at the 
university which has an enrollment of 19000 gave a copy of the 
script to republican state rep jean dixon 
the play is in my opinion political propaganda to evangelize 
and recruit young people to the homosexual lifestyle she said 
mrs dixon asked gordon the board of regents and arts and 
letters dean bethany oberst to prohibit the drama department from 
staging the play department officials refused after consulting 
attorneys who said canceling the production would violate the 
students constitutional rights of free speech 
the normal heart by larry kramer is set in new york in the 
early 1980s the drama which premiered offbroadway in 1985 
attacks societys slow response to the aids epidemic 
kramer said he was amazed the play was controversial in 
springfield the city with about 150000 residents is the 
international headquarters of the assemblies of god church and home 
to several religiousaffiliated colleges 
the play has had over 600 productions all over the world and 
this is the first time this has happened kramer said from his 
manhattan apartment i wonder what exists in springfield that 
doesnt exist anywhere else 
the opposing group citizens demanding standards took out a 
fullpage advertisement sunday in the newsleader in springfield 
denouncing the play 
do you want your tax dollars to promote homosexual 
antifamily lifestyle the ad asked 
gordon said feedback he is getting shows the majority of 
townspeople and by far most students and faculty support the 
play members of the faculty senate voted 371 tuesday to support 
the administrations decision to allow the play to go on 
he said actress kathleen turner a graduate of the university 
called him monday to praise school officials for standing behind 
the play ms turner contacted two other smsu theater graduates 
actors john goodman and tess harper and the three plan to visit 
springfield during the plays run to show their support gordon 
said

voters get to decide tuesday whether taking 
the oath of office in texas is undignified 
proposition 7 would eliminate the centuryold section of the 
oath to which an officeholder must swear publicly that he or she 
didnt bribe anyone to get the job 
if the proposed state constitutional amendment passes 
officeholders still would swear to faithfully execute their duties 
and preserve protect and defend the constitutions and laws of the 
united states and texas 
and they would be required to sign a written oath denying that 
any bribery took place 
but public disavowals of bribery would be out 
opponents said during the legislative debate that the oath as 
it stands is no problem they also said such amendments clutter 
the ballot and detract from more important issues 
secretary of state george bayoud said he didnt find taking the 
oath undignified 
i kind of like it bayoud said during my swearing in 
there were people from around the state here and they said they 
liked it 
the bribery provision was added to the 1876 texas constitution 
as a reaction to corruption during reconstruction 
backers of the change say it is an outdated remnant of another 
time and its not as if the constitutional oath were sacrosanct 
it has been changed before 
until approval of a 1938 amendment officeholders were required 
to swear that they hadnt participated in a duel

and calamity jane fired into the air at high noon on main street 
today signaling the start of legal gambling in the old west town 
where hickok was killed in a card game 
the start of limited poker blackjack and slotmachine games 
marked a return to deadwoods past a century after gold miners 
rushed to the black hills town hoping to strike it rich 
as soon as the word was given evelyn klocko of central city 
stuck six quarters in a slot machine pulled the handle and won 
30 it doesnt take any brains to pull the handle she said as 
she counted her winnings 
the franklin hotel lobby was jammed with people many of whom 
staked out chairs to grab when the gambling began in the hour 
before the games began people crowded around the poker and 
blackjack tables some asking dealers how to play 
deadwood got 8 inches of snow overnight so most of the opening 
ceremony was moved indoors the noon temperature was just above 
freezing but the sun shone and main street was crowded with the 
curious and people itching to gamble 
thirtyfour businesses are offering gambling at first many of 
them saloons none call themselves casinos however because thats 
forbidden by law 
the state gaming commission on tuesday approved 120 licenses for 
gambling parlor employees including dealers and cashiers about 90 
dealers had been licensed earlier and officials were unsure how 
many of the new licensees were dealers 
officials said about 200 dealers were needed even with the new 
dealers approved tuesday bill fisher floor manager in the bella 
union gaming saloon said we are going to be short dealers im 
sure 
gambling organizers say deadwood gambling wont rival las vegas 
or atlantic citys highstakes games but maximum 5 poker bets 
still could lead to winnings or losses of several hundred 
dollars a game 
deadwood dicks bar owned by mary dunne didnt even have its 
sign up tuesday but promised to have slot machines and blackjack 
ready for today 
frantic lastminute construction continued 
it isnt safe to go in a bar anymore because someone hands you 
a hammer and asks if you want a job she said over the din of 
hammers and saws 
in 1988 gambling supporters persuaded statewide voters to allow 
the limitedstakes games for deadwood 
its hard to predict how much money the games will bring into 
government coffers said don gromer the gaming commissions 
executive secretary he thinks deadwood will get 400000 the first 
year the state will get 500000 and lawrence county will receive 
100000 
the citys cut of gambling proceeds is to be used for historic 
preservation 
deadwoods colorful past includes gambling prostitution and 
shootouts wild bill was shot in the back while holding aces and 
eights in deadwoods saloon no 10 in 1876 
police chief les bradley hopes those days wont return he just 
added an officer to the force bringing the total to six for the 
community of 2000 
im not looking for any major crime bradley said but 
its possible i might eat my words 
opposition to gambling in deadwood has been slight and efforts 
have started in at least two other south dakota towns to offer 
limited gambling 
the gaming commission on tuesday approved 24hour gambling for 
four businesses that are combination bars and restaurants 
gromer said bars must close at 2 am so gambling must stop in 
the bars then but it can continue in restaurants no liquor can be 
served during the hours that bars are closed 
licensed establishments that dont sell liquor can have gambling 
24 hours a day 
despair engendered by a decline in tourism in recent years has 
given way to excitement and investment said bill walsh owner of 
the 85yearold franklin hotel 
deadwoods going to be fun again that i believe with all my 
heart walsh said were returning to the good old times of 
deadwood and if we do that were going to be successful

the state if not the nation said sherry johnson chairman of

jordan who became one of the most prominent black women in 
american politics 
in 1980 41 percent of the districts residents were black and 
31 percent hispanic 
i dont believe there is any question that it is a democrats 
seat said jack carter chairman of the harris county democratic 
party the question is which democrat 
seven of the 11 candidates are democrats three are republican 
and one is libertarian the four frontrunners are democrats 
elected officials and like leland black they are state sen 
craig washington city councilman anthony hall and state reps ron 
wilson and al edwards

house and six in the senate he has a reputation as a champion of 
liberal causes including abortion rights gay rights and better 
aids care and concerns of the poor

and make hard decisions washington said i am afraid of 
politicians who have no ideas of their own but merely regurgitate 
what other politicians say you may not always agree with me but 
you always know where i stand 
hall 45 also a lawyer has served on the city council the past 
10 years and as a state representative from 197378 he credits

colleagues are governed by instructions from washington

the dispute 
we continue to be deeply concerned by the house arrest of the 
coleaders of burmas principal opposition party the national

large numbers of political opponents of the military government

release all political prisoners and will allow them to take part in 
the national elections planned for next may

who represent burmese aspirations for democratic change that is 
the aspirations which the burmese people clearly desire cannot be

one in six american women gets inadequate 
prenatal care according to a study released wednesday 
pregnant women in the south are the most likely to receive 
inadequate care while those in the north central region of the 
country get the highest level of care the study by the alan 
guttmacher institute found 
the study estimated that 585000 women nationally begin care in 
the fifth month of pregnancy or later or begin receiving prenatal 
care early but make fewer than half of the 13 doctor visits 
recommended by the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists 
a disproportionate number of women receiving this level of care 
which the institute considers inadequate are teenagers unmarried 
women blacks and hispanics according to the report 
more than 660000 women or 18 percent of women who give birth 
begin receiving prenatal care early but make only half to 80 
percent of the recommended visits the survey found 
this study demonstrates how very far we have to go as a 
nation if we are to guarantee that all women get even relatively 
adequate prenatal care said jeannie rosoff president of the new 
yorkbased nonprofit research and education group 
the department of health and human services in 1980 set as one 
of the nations health goals to be achieved by the end of the 
decade that at least 90 percent of women would start prenatal care 
within the first three months of pregnancy 
the study concluded that prenatal services must become more 
available and more accessible to decrease the number of babies born 
prematurely and underweight chief causes of infant mortality 
the us rate of infant mortality is 104 per 1000 ranking the 
country 19th among industrialized nations 
the institute said more public funding would be needed to 
provide more needed services but it didnt estimate how much 
the report estimated that 157 percent of pregnant women in the 
united states receive what the institute considers inadequate 
prenatal care the report found 188 percent of women in that 
category in the south 165 percent in the west 144 in the 
northeast and 123 percent in the north central states 
the report was based on data from the national center for health 
statistics and the american hospital association as well as a 
survey of all state health departments and some local health 
departments

pan american world airways is trying to prove 
that israel and west germany warned us authorities about an 
impending terrorist attack on flight 103 which was blown up last 
december according to papers filed in federal court 
pan am has filed subpoenas demanding documents on any advance 
warning given to the cia the drug enforcement administration the 
fbi the national security council the national security agency 
and the state department 
the airline also is demanding to question beginning in 
midnovember anyone at the six agencies with knowledge of any 
prior notice given to the us government indicating that flight 
103 was targeted for attack according to the documents 
attorney general dick thornburgh refused today to comment on the 
subpoenas except to say the justice department would give them 
due consideration and respond in court 
the court papers said pan am and its security firm alert 
management systems inc were taking action to prove west german 
police warned us officials of suspicious activities in the 
baggage area at frankfurt 90 minutes before the flight left there 
dec 21 
the airline said it is seeking a possible videotape of the 
baggage containing the bomb being loaded in frankfurt onto the 
boeing 727 that flew to london on the first leg of the new 
yorkbound flight 
the airline in papers filed in court in brooklyn ny and 
washington dc also said it wanted all documents concerning 
warnings tips alerts and other communications about possible 
plans or threats of a terrorist attack on flight 103 
the london newspaper the independent which first reported the 
court filings quoted lawyers for families of flight 103 victims as 
saying pan am was on a fishing exercise to try to shift blame 
for the disaster the airline has been sued for more than 300 
million 
lee kreindler an attorney representing the victims families 
called the pan am subpoenas a lot of nonsense and a 
diversionary tactic 
its probably an exercise by the public relations department 
of pan am that wont have any effect on his case and wont 
get anywhere said kreindler 
the boeing 747 that passengers boarded in london exploded over 
lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the 
ground 
the documents filed by pan am call on the six us agencies to 
disclose any documents relevant to surveillance by the bka west 
germanys fbi of the pan am baggagehandling area at frankfurt 
including video recordings made on the evening of 21 december 
1988 
the papers demand all documents relating to what they say were 
warnings from the israeli secret service mossad within the 2436 
hours before december 21 1988 that pan am flight 103 was the 
target of a terrorist attack 
the british government has said it received telephone warnings 
of a bomb on a us carrier in the weeks prior to dec 21 and us 
diplomats in europe had been told to avoid pan am during the 
christmas season 
paul hudson an albany lawyer who lost his 16yearold daughter 
on the plane said his reaction to pan ams demand was oe of 
shock one of dismay followed by a furious reaction by most of 
the relatives 
hudson chairman of a group called families of pan am flight 
103 also predicted a tremendous outcry for accountability if 
authorities knew that this flight or one very close to it was to 
be bombed 
a cia spokesman would not comment today on the allegations that 
the mossad warned the agency of the bombing 24 hours before it 
happened cia spokesman mark mansfield said by telephone from 
mclean va that the cia was among us agencies subpoenaed by pan 
am lawyers he said he had no further comment on the case because 
it is in litigation 
the independents report said at least five people on the doomed 
plane were us government employees either members of the cia or 
attached to it it said the five included matthew k gannon a 
political officer at the us embassy in beirut who it said was 
the cias deputy station chief in lebanon 
the paper said intelligence sources believe the team was on a 
mission in beirut connected to the american hostages there

government to halt program trading when share prices drop too 
rapidly 
phelan who testified at a closed session of a house commerce 
subcommittee said in earlier interviews that if left unchecked 
price volatility could destroy the stock market 
the telecommunications and finance subcommittee headed by rep 
edward markey dmass is ready to draft legislation that would 
give the securities and exchange commission authority to halt 
computerprogrammed trading when prices move wildly 
we have to sit down with the commission to see how they feel 
about such emergency powers phelan told reporters after the 
subcommittee session the new york exchange could support such a 
grant of power if the commission feels capable of administering it 
he said 
phelan pledged to work with congress to find a solution he will 
meet thursday with governors of the exchange amid speculation the 
big board may take new action of its own to battle the volatility 
problem 
phelan indicated he would like to see the chicago markets join 
with the new york exchange in any action aimed at curbing broad 
swings in share prices 
in earlier newspaper interviews phelan acknowledged wide 
discontent among investors and brokers about how program trading of 
huge blocs of stock can induce wild price swings that make many 
people hesitant about buying shares 
a lot of people think it is a new york stock exchange issue 
he said it is a national issue liquidity in all markets and 
volatility in all markets if it keeps up long enough it is going 
to destroy the markets as a capitalraising mechanism much less as 
a place where people can invest intelligently he told the 
washington post 
his fears were echoed by markey and other members of the 
subcommittee 
the bottom line is that we are messing with the golden goose 
capital formation markey said the stock market matters its 
not disconnected from ordinary peoples lives it assures jobs 
are there for bluecollar americans 
wednesdays hearing was scheduled after the dow jones industrial 
average dropped 190 points during a wild day of computergenerated 
trading on oct 13 
congress is ready to move with legislation aimed at 
correcting the violatility problem markey said there is a real 
sense in our committee that something has to be done 
the new york exchange moved on its own last year to respond to 
big swings in price the exchange halted program trading through 
its own computers any time the industrial averages moved 50 points 
in one day traders quickly found a way around the prohibition

former president carter says he wouldnt 
accept a milliondollar speaking fee like his successor ronald 
reagan reportedly received during his recent trip to japan 
but ive never been offered that much carter joked tuesday 
night before speaking to san diego county business leaders about 
habitat for humanity a nonprofit group that helps lowincome 
families build their own homes 
carter refused to criticize reagan directly for reportedly 
accepting 2 million in speaking fees during his trip to japan 
including 1 million for a single speech to the fujisankei 
communications group last week in tokyo 
ive never criticized what presidents nixon ford or reagan do 
with their postwhite house years he said when asked about 
reagans fees but thats not what i want out of life we give 
money we dont take it 
carter did criticize the scandalplagued government housing 
programs of the reagan administration 
it was absolutely disgusting to see a whole bunch of rich 
friends of the president stealing millions of dollars from a 
program that had already been robbed of 85 percent of its 
resources carter said

pulitzer prizewinning author alice walker 
says the violence in some of her writing is an outgrowth of her 
childhood as the daughter of georgia sharecroppers 
it was a bad system where people could not get out of debt 
ms walker told about 600 people tuesday at temple university we 
lived in shacks i was 17 before i lived in a house that didnt 
leak 
i was trying for myself to understand how this system of human 
exploitation so killed the spirit of people that they were 
unable to love their own and why is it that they turned on their 
own 
ms walker also read from her latest novel the temple of my 
familiar whose characters stories span several lives over 
thousands of years 
she said the farreaching settings from latin america to 
california to baltimore and africa show the similarity in 
oppression of people throughout the world and how their struggles 
and origins are connected

market street divides a corner of san 
francisco into different worlds one is the prosperous financial 
district largely untouched by the earthquake the other is south 
of market 
an intriguing mix of old and new shabby and chic south of 
market is little known by outsiders and in the days since the oct 
17 disaster its been all but forgotten even here although it was 
one of the areas hardest hit 
south of market where warehouses residential hotels and 
wholesalers in recent years have been joined by fashionable 
restaurants offices and artists studios was the seconddeadliest 
place in the quake 
five people died under a torrent of bricks when the 15second 
upheaval wrenched off the top of a fourstory building and sent it 
tumbling onto a narrow street only the nimitz freeway collapse in 
oakland with 41 known deaths claimed more lives 
as for damage south of market is the secondmost affected 
area of san francisco said michelle pla spokeswoman for the 
citys bureau of building inspection pla said dozens of buildings 
were redtagged or judged unsafe 
the most affected city district was the marina an affluent 
neighborhood where entire apartment buildings crumpled and burned 
everyone feels sorry for the people in the marina said eric 
pryor whose south of market residential hotel was redtagged 
but the people here are also victims of what i call the social 
disaster in the city the real victims 
for some of the most unfortunate of the neighborhoods 
displaced the quake also took their jobs goodwill industries was 
forced to lay off about 150 people after suffering 2 million in 
property damage and 3 million in equipment damage at its 
83yearold headquarters 
weve laid off the disabled the disadvantaged the working 
poor south of market people that we serve with our rehabilitation 
job training and placement said goodwill spokeswoman charleen 
harty 
a lot of them live in the area they now stand to lose 
jobs and homes in one shot some of them arent english speaking or 
have hearing or vision loss they cannot go through the normal 
channels to get help she said 
city and relief officials had no count of south of market 
residents made at least temporarily homeless for many a traumatic 
time has been made worse by being moved to different shelters 
theres a certain amount of confusion to being in one place 
for only a couple of days then have to go the next place and the 
next it makes things even more difficult said michael robb a 
registered nurse working in the mental health center of a red cross 
shelter 
the shelter one of several in the city started out at the 
convention center then for single men moved to a navy helicopter 
carrier then to a large building a few blocks from city hall 
women and families were moved to the presidio an army base 
while its residents differ from those of the marina south of 
market is like that neighborhood in that areas most devastated are 
built on fill rubble mud and sand extending the original 
shoreline into san francisco bay 
south of market was hard hit also because many of its buildings 
are decades old often unreinforced one historic warehouse facing 
possible demolition dates to 1867 
in some places narrow buildings lean slightly and the top lines 
of broader structures appear to wave following the buckling of the 
street and soft earth below others show little or no damage from 
the outside but are blocked off by yellow plastic tape and a 
warning on the front door 
a lot of these buildings look ok but go inside and step on 
some of the floors and id be surprised if you dont fall 
through pryor said 
south of markets wholesale sellers of every product from 
flowers to expensive furniture its discount clothing outlets and 
its restaurants and bars were mostly spared serious damage 
still there is a decline in traffic affecting mostly the 
service industries that depend on walkin business retail 
restaurant car repairs said patrice mccarthy spokeswoman for 
the south of market business association

food aid from the west could discourage 
production by polands own farmers the chairman of the house 
agriculture committee told the bush administration on wednesday 
we dont want to get into that type of situation it could 
very well happen in poland rep kika de la garza said at a joint 
hearing on food aid by the agriculture and foreign affairs 
committees 
i know it has happened in several countries said de la 
garza dtexas polish farmers are among the best in the world 
poland is one crop away from selfsufficiency he said 
his remarks followed close questioning of bush administration 
representatives by rep gary l ackerman dny who said that 
food aid given for political motives had discouraged farming in 
egypt and el salvador 
de la garza said the law on food aid passed in 1954 under 
president eisenhower was designed originally to fight communism 
what do we do now that were playing tennis with mr gorbachev 
every day he asked 
alan larson deputy assistant secretary of state for economic 
and business affairs said it was important to keep food aid 
flexible 
president bush has promised 100 million worth to poland larson 
said another 150 million worth is expected from the 12 countries 
of the european economic community 
we are using food aid to fill the gaps and ease the shortages 
that are resulting from what we hope will be a transition of poland 
from a centrally planned communist nation to a free enterprise 
democratic system he added 
the flexibility to use our food aid program to support 
democracy as we are doing in poland is one of the best features 
of our current law larson said 
larson said about half us food aid is now in the form of 
grants the other half is paid for with money lent by the united 
states on easy terms 
today many countries that receive food aid have large debt 
service burdens and can no longer afford even those generous 
terms he added 
the united states has provided 35 billion worth of food aid 
over 300 million tons over the past 35 years said philip l 
christenson assistant administrator in the us agency for 
economic development 
the present program about 15 billion a year accounts for 
60 percent of all food aid in the world he added

a woman jailed overnight when she failed to 
appear in court to explain overdue library books said she is sure 
she returned the books and was never told of the court date 
karen lindsay 48 said tuesday she was arrested at her 
apartment friday night and held without bond until she was released 
on her own recognizance saturday 
ms lindsay said she was asleep when a gwinnett county sheriffs 
deputy arrived with the arrest warrant charging her with failure to 
appear in court which carries a maximum sentence of one year in 
jail and a 1000 fine 
the police were very nice to me and acted quite embarrassed 
over the whole ordeal she said 
john shelton director of the lake lanier regional library 
system said the library has been turning over offenders to the 
courts since 1983 to face charges of failure to return library 
books 
i sympathize with the lady but most of my sympathy is with the 
people he said taxpayers should not have to pay more for 
libraries because of unreturned books 
ms lindsay pleaded innocent monday to a charge of failure to 
appear in state court no arraignment date had been set 
she said she was shown a list of four books she allegedly did 
not return but she couldnt remember any of the titles and found 
no unreturned library books when she moved recently 
the library said the books were 15 months overdue but would i 
deserve to go to jail because of it ms lindsay asked 
ms lindsay said authorities knew she never received a summons 
to appear in court because it had been returned to them unopened

a utah congressman appealed to a house panel 
wednesday to approve a 100 million trust fund to pay damages to 
forgotten guinea pigs of the west whose health was destroyed by 
radiation from government uranium mines and atomic bomb tests 
rep wayne owens dutah said several victims or their 
survivors won federal suits in which the judges concluded the 
federal government was negligent only to have the decisions 
overturned on appeal because of a law that protects the government 
from being sued except in the rarest of instances 
republican sen orrin g hatch of utah who is sponsoring the 
legislation in the senate said the cost will amount to only a 
fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of 
the problems that the government his caused 
hatch and others have been pushing similar legislation for years 
without success 
proponents are more hopeful now in the wake of recent 
legislation setting up a trust fund for japanese people locked in 
us camps during world war ii and another bill providing 
assistance to us servicemen exposed to the harmful effects of 
atomic radiation while in the line of duty 
hatch reminded the house judiciary subcommittee on 
administrative law and governmental relations that senate approval 
in 1985 of a compact with the governments of micronesia included a 
trust fund for victims of fallout from atomic testing in the 
pacific ocean 
if the government is willing to provide such treatment for 
foreign residents how can it do less for its own citizens hatch 
asked 
referred to as downwinders the people exposed to fallout 
from open air nuclear testing in nevada in the 1950s live mainly in 
southern nevada southern utah and northwestern airzona 
even more appalling than the plight faced by the downwinders 
if such is possible is the case of those who mined uranium in 
colorado new mexico arizona and utah from 1947 to 1961 said 
hatch even though the government had adequate warning of the 
hazards involved these miners most of whom were native americans 
were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no 
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation 
owens referred to the mining and testing as an unnoticed part 
of this nations nuclear cold war with the soviets and said 
earlier congressional investigations concluded that the residents 
of this region were used as guinea pigs in a deadly experiment 
he noted that the house commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations recommented a decade ago that sufficient evidence 
exists for the federal government to accept at least compassionate 
responsibility 
then after wringing its hands over the suffering of these 
forgotten guinea pigs congress unfortunately forgot again 
said owens who told the subcommittee his brotherinlaw a former 
uranium miner recently died of lung cancer 
assistant attorney general stuart m gerson head of the justice 
departments civil division said the administration opposes the 
legislation because it would dramatically change current law by 
making the united states subject to unprecedented liability for 
implementing policy decisions and functions

former norwegian foreign minister thorvald 
stoltenberg will be nominated to head the scandalplagued un high 
commission for refugees the top un spokesman said wednesday 
the former high commissioner jeanpierre hocke resigned oct 
26 over charges he misused a special education fund for refugees in 
order to upgrade his air travel to first class 
stoltenberg an international lawyer who also was a norwegian 
defense minister has been named norways new un ambassador but 
he has not yet taken up the post he declined comment on the 
possible new appointment in oslo 
francois giuliani spokesman for secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar said the secretarygeneral intends to nominate the 
58yearold norwegian 
i do not deny that what you say is correct he told said in 
response to a question 
the general assembly is expected to choose a new high 
commissioner this month on the recommendation of the 
secretarygeneral 
we hope the election will be short and swift and that no other 
candidates will come forward said another un official 
hocke who defeated stoltenberg for the threeyear position in 
1986 reportedly had been favored by the us state department 
because he supported the restrictive immigration policies of the 
united states and other western countries 
stoltenbergs views on immigration and refugee issues were not 
immediately known the un high commission for refugees handles 
more than 10 million refugees worldwide including 5 million afghan 
refugees in iran and pakistan more than 1 million in southern 
africa 1 million in the horn of africa and several hundred 
thousand in southeast asia and central america 
stoltenberg is an international lawyer and was an unsuccessful 
candidate in 1986 for the refugee position he is backed by 
finland iceland sweden norway and denmark which are the 
secondlargest contributors to the refugee agency paying 84 
million while the united states pays 124 million 
the us state department had no comment on stoltenbergs 
candidacy 
stoltenberg was foreign minister from march 1987 until the gro 
harlem bruntland labor party government resigned in october from 
1979 to 1981 he was defense minister in two different labor 
governments 
he was international secretary for norways largest labor union 
several times between 1970 and 1983 from 1971 to 1979 he was 
undersecretary in the foreign defense and trade ministries 
he was deputy consul in san francisco from 1959 to 1961 later 
served in belgrade and in the foreign ministry in oslo and in lagos 
in 1970 
hocke who had hoped to be reappointed this month has been 
criticized for financial mismanagement and favoritism including 
the use of funds to upgrade his airine flights hocke who is 
swiss has admitted using the funds to get better airline seats but 
denied misusing un funds 
he and others have said that the fund although labeled for 
education in fact was intended to help augment his un 
salary a swiss tv report said internal documents showed hocke had 
drawn 300000 since 1987 from the education account to upgrade his 
flights from business to first class only the un 
secretarygeneral is authorized to travel first class the united 
nations is investigating the matter 
he had been criticized by staff and by private refugee relief 
groups for not opposing the increasingly rigid asylum policies of 
the united states east germany and other major donors to the 
commission 
in january 1988 hocke ordered that all 138000 copies of the 
agencys monthly magazine refugees be burned because it contained 
an article critical of west germanys policies he said the article 
was outdated

the superpowers announced wednesday they had 
picked waters off malta for next months mediterranean summit as 
us officials began preparing president bush for a session with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev that they said would produce no 
startling breakthroughs 
a dramatic statement on american television by gennady 
gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman that the dec 23 
shipboard summit could mark the end of the cold war was 
shrugged off as overstatement 
gorbachev is unlikely to ask bush for specific economic 
assistance a wellplaced us official said adding i dont 
think we expect substantive results 
even concerning eastern and central europe where fastmoving 
political reform could challenge the marxist system and the 
cohesion of the sovietled warsaw pact bush and gorbachev are 
expected only to make sure we have good lines of communication 
said the official commenting only on condition of anonymity it 
is not an area ripe for agreements he said 
the lowkey appraisal of a session bush declines even to 
describe as a summit stood in sharp contrast to the version 
conveyed to the american public by soviet spokesman gerasimov 
i think that this meeting can just be the end of the cold 
war he said from moscow on good morning america an abctv 
program the cold war will be dumped down to the bottom of the 
mediterranean sea 
administration officials were hewing closely to bushs 
description tuesday of a feetup informal getacquainted session 
with gorbachev on american and soviet naval vessels in order to 
deepen our respective understanding of each others views 
the site selected with the hope it could be kept at least 
partially secluded was announced simultaneously wednesday at the 
white house and in moscow 
malta is an independent republic consisting of five islands two 
of them uninhabited it lies 58 miles south of sicily 220 miles 
north of libya and 180 miles east of tunisia 
for years malta had strong ties to col moammar gadhafi the 
libyan leader accused by the united states of fomenting bloody acts 
of terrorism but over the past two years the government has taken 
a sharp turn and welcomed american investment 
preparations for the meeting initiated in july by bush and kept 
secret from most of the us bureaucracy began in earnest with 
officials of the state department and the national security council 
drawing up the issues to be fleshed out in position papers 
before bush packs them in his briefcase secretary of state 
james a baker iii and brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser will review them and probably highlight specific 
items and subjects they feel ought to be stressed 
the pentagon and other government offices will be invited to 
contribute but again emphasizing the limited us summit 
expectations the us official said the national security council 
would not hold a meeting on the summit during the 4 12 weeks 
before bush sees gorbachev 
the principal summit topic of discussion is expected to be 
gorbachevs arduous attempt to boost the faltering soviet economy 
through a reconstruction program known as perestroika it is 
spilling over into the political arena encouraging political 
reform at home and in eastern europe 
the soviet leader is bound to describe in detail to bush the 
problems he faces but the officials said moscow has given no 
indication through diplomatic channels that gorbachev would ask for 
specific technical or other us help 
the bush administration has already told moscow trade barriers 
erected by congress in the jacksonvanik amendment of 1974 will not 
be removed until the soviets complete legislation liberalizing 
emigration procedures 
asking for direct help would not be suitable an official 
said its one thing to talk about your problems its another to 
appear to be relying on the united states for help the soviets are 
strongly independent about this 
as preparations got under way favorable reaction from congress 
grew 
it is a good time to have a meeting said sen alan simpson 
of wyoming the deputy republican senate leader 
i think a saltwater summit is a good idea said sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas an informal meeting at sea could provide the 
right atmosphere to get things moving in several channels 
including trade as well as arms control 
at this stage however bentsens expectations did not square 
with the administrations modest goals and that suited sen jesse 
helms rnc perfectly 
i hope that no fundamental decisions of any sort will be 
made he said 
in this vein marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman 
momentarily referred to the meeting as a summit and than retracted 
what he called the s word 
chuckling he advised reporters lets call this the 
meeting the big m

pan american world airways is demanding 
documents and interviews at the cia and other us agencies seeking 
support for its contention that israel and west germany warned that 
flight 103 had been targeted by terrorists days before it was blown 
from the sky over scotland 
the airline also seeks all documents linking flight 103 to a 
reported syrian arms merchant whose name came up in the irancontra 
affair 
flight 103 was blown up last december with 259 people aboard 
the airline is trying to defend itself against more than 300 
million in lawsuits filed by families of victims of the explosion 
in which 11 people on the ground were also killed 
the airline is demanding to interview personnel at us 
intelligence and law enforcement agencies about warnings from 
mossad an israeli intelligence agency within the 2436 hours 
before dec 21 1988 that flight 103 was to be hit by 
terrorists according to subpoenas and notices of depositions filed 
in federal court 
pan am also wants information about any warnings from the bka 
west germanys fbi within the 90 minutes before the scheduled 
departure from frankfurt of flight 103 concerning suspicious 
activities that appeared to be taking place in the baggage 
loading area 
the airline in addition is subpoenaing any documents 
concerning the activities of monzer alkassar 
the congressional irancontra committees found that the 
organization of richard secord had paid 15 million to alkassar 
to buy weapons in 1985 and 1986 white house aide oliver north had 
enlisted secord as part of a secret operation to run arms to the 
usbacked nicaraguan contra guerrillas 
at the 1987 congressional hearings rep jack brooks dtexas 
said alkassar had been identified as a syrian arms merchant whose 
associates included the palestine liberation organizations abu 
abbas abbas is accused of masterminding the hijacking of the 
italian cruise ship achille lauro in which an american passenger 
died 
in its papers filed in late september in new york and 
washington the airline is seeking all documents concerning 
photographic andor video surveillance by the bka at pan 
ams baggage loading area at frankfurt on dec 21 
pan am subpoenaed the cia the fbi the national security 
council the national security agency the state department and the 
drug enforcement administration with interviews due to begin in 
midnovember 
justice department spokesman david runkel said no decision had 
been made on whether the government would attempt to quash the 
subpoenas against the six federal agencies 
runkel said the agencies working in conjunction with the 
department of justice are currently collecting and reviewing the 
requested data 
the pan am subpoenas are a lot of nonsense and a 
diversionary tactic said lee kreindler an attorney 
representing the families of the victims aboard flight 103 
its probably an exercise by the public relations department 
of pan am that wont have any effect on his case and wont 
get anywhere said kreindler 
the state department never received any specific and credible 
threat against pan am 103 said state department deputy spokesman 
richard boucher 
the british government has said it received telephone warnings 
of a bomb on a us carrier in the weeks prior to dec 21 and us 
diplomats in europe had been warned to avoid pan am during the 
christmas season 
paul hudson an albany ny lawyer whose 16yearold daughter 
died in the explosion said his reaction to pan ams demand for 
data on any advance warning was one of shock one of dismay 
followed by a furious reaction by most of the relatives 
hudson chairman of a group called families of pan am flight 
103 also predicted a tremendous outcry for accountability if 
authorities knew that this flight or one very close to it was to 
be bombed 
a cia spokesman would not comment on the allegations the mossad 
warned the agency of the bombing 24 hours before it happened cia 
spokesman mark mansfield said by telephone from the agencys 
mclean va headquarters that the cia was among us agencies 
subpoenaed by pan am lawyers

the un general assembly passed a 
resolution wednesday calling on afghanistans communist government 
and moslem guerrillas to open negotiations to establish a coalition 
government 
the resolution adopted by consensus says a government of 
national reconciliation should rule an afghan nation that is 
nonaligned and islamic 
the general assembly has never before ordered the combatants in 
the 10yearold civil war to open peace talks nor has it specified 
the ideological or religious orientation of the resulting 
government of national reconciliation 
this was very gratifying for us efforts have been going on 
for some months to arrive at a consensus said pakistani 
ambassador nasim ahmed he praised the soviet union united states 
and the nonaligned movement for working to reach accord on the 
resolution 
both the security council and general assembly have previously 
focused their peacemaking efforts on conflicts between nations 
rather than any internal crisis 
the assembly has no power to enforce its resolutions 
last week a delegation of afghan guerrillas led by farooq azam 
representing the governmentinexile declared they would never 
negotiate with or form a government with afghan president najib or 
any senior officials of his communist party called the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
najib has called for a ceasefire and talks with the guerrillas 
and offered to bring them into his government conditions they have 
rejected 
the un resolution also welcomes the soviet unions completion 
of the withdrawal of more than 100000 troops by feb 15 the 
deadline for their pullout set by the geneva agreements on 
afghanistan 
that accord mediated by diego cordovez then a un 
undersecretarygeneral called for the soviet withdrawal and 
obliged pakistan and afghanistan not to interfere in each others 
affairs 
the guerrillas control most of the countryside in afghanistan 
but have made little military or diplomatic progress since the 
soviet withdrawal 
the united states and pakistan have not recognized their 
governmentinexile organized earlier in february during a 
convening of the afghan guerrillas and refugees in rawalpindi 
pakistan 
only saudi arabia bahrain malaysia and sudan have recognized 
the government of the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
the united states supplies the guerrillas with weapons 
reportedly distributing them through pakistans military 
intelligence service supplies weapons and reinforcements are sent 
from guerrillas camps in pakistan 
the guerrillas besieged the eastern city of jalalabad after the 
soviet withdrawal but the afghan army eventually broke the siege 
conflicts among various guerrillas factions prevented the groups 
from mounting a coordinated attack just as it has thwarted their 
attempts to adopt any coherent political program beyond opposition 
to najib 
diplomats said the guerrillas were hoping to take an afghan city 
so they could move their government into afghan territory 
increasing their chances of winning diplomatic recognition

a major earthquake registering 71 on the richter 
scale struck off northeastern honshu island early today officials 
said three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of 
tidal waves officials said 
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the 
quake which struck at 326 am thursday 126 pm wednesday 
est it was centered about 60 miles off the coast and at a depth 
of 20 miles the central meteorological agency in tokyo said 
after the quake officials closed the major expressway through 
the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were 
stopped to check the condition of the rails 
the agency warned of a tsunami or seismic tidal wave hitting 
coastal towns on northeast honshu and the northernmost main island 
of hokkaido the agency said sea levels two hours after the quake 
had risen nearly three feet in the region 
officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of taro 
sanriku and ozutsu about 300 miles northeast of tokyo on honshus 
eastern coast 
the agency said the quake had a magnitude of 71 on the richter 
scale the same as the oct 17 earthquake that devastated the san 
francisco bay area in washington the us geological survey said 
the quake measured 73 on the richter scale 
us geological survey scientists said they recorded an 
aftershock measuring 58 about 10 minutes after the main quake 
the main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more 
than 58 years since a magnitude 77 earthquake march 9 1931 said 
don finley a spokesman for the us agency 
the earthquake occurred in the same general area as a series of 
earlier tremors during the past several weeks the strongest of the 
earlier quakes was a magnitude 65 on sunday 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
japan is situated on a major fault line that produces frequent 
earthquakes few of which cause serious damage

prosecutors said wednesday that 120 
radical students and dissidents have been charged with antius 
antigovernment protests and ideological links to north korea 
the public prosecutors office said charges have been brought 
against 82 radical students and 38 dissidents who allegedly armed 
themselves with north koreas revolutionary ideas to overthrow

fivemonth crackdown they said about 40000 pronorth korean books 
have been seized this year 
the prosecutors pledged a systematic and steady crackdown 
saying pronorth korean forces have instigated violent protests 
calling for the withdrawal of us troops based in south korea 
under a mutual defense pact 
government officials claimed radicals have used campuses to 
disseminate pronorth korean ideas and attacked us military and 
diplomatic facilities to dramatize their campaign 
radical students a powerful minority on campuses have failed 
to earn broad support because of their violent tactics and 
ideological extremism since president roh taewoo took office in 
february 1988 and carried out reforms

a colonel who led a military 
revolt last year against the government of former president raul 
alfonsin was ordered wednesday to retire 
col mohamed ali seineldin led the december 1988 uprising to 
protest the governments decision to prosecute officers accused of 
human rights abuses during the 197683 dictatorship 
rebels also demanded a more money for the military and a shakeup 
of the military command 
seineldin has been held under military arrest since the failed 
rebellion his promotion to brigadier general was turned down by 
the armys promotions board last week 
because he was passed over he could not remain in the army and 
was ordered retired said army chief gen isidro caceres 
the 54yearold career soldier distinguished himself in fighting 
against leftist subversives trying to overthrow argentinas 
government in the early 1970s and against the british during the 
74day war in 1982 over the falkland islands 
seineldin and the others may appeal for reinstatement to defense 
minister italo luder and menem who succeeded alfonsin this year 
on oct 7 menem pardoned seineldin and 173 other rebels whose 
three insurrections threatened to destabilize the alfonsin 
government 
also pardoned were 39 officers accused of kidnapping torture 
and murder during the dictatorship and about 60 leftist guerrillas 
the pardons were necessary menem said to end military 
grievances and achieve national reconciliation between the 
armed forces and societys other important institutions 
tensions between the army and leftist and human rights groups 
has simmered since alfonsin took office in december 1983 over 
issues such as the military budget the human rights trials and the 
armys role in domestic intelligence surveillance 
the lack of common ground between them undermined popular 
support for the alfonsin government 
menem made no mention of the retirements when he addressed about 
300 officers wednesday but said the actions of his government 
which took office on july 8 would close a chapter in argentine 
history 
today begins the reconstruction of the glorious army of the 
nation he said 
newspapers in the capital buenos aires reported wednesday that 
seineldin a former commando might be given the quasimilitary 
assignment of forming an antiterrorist rapid deployment force 
comprised of about 400 soldiers federal police and border guards

the crack in the fan disk of a jet that 
crashed killing 112 people probably existed when the disk was last 
inspected in 1988 an expert testified wednesday but a united 
airlines official said testing required at the time could not have 
detected the flaw 
united spokesman robert doughty said that since the july 19 
crash of the airlines dc10 jumbo jet at the sioux gateway 
airport the federal aviation administration has ordered ultrasonic 
examination of all disks similar to the titanium disk that split 
apart in the tail engine of flight 232 
ultrasonic testing can detect cracks and other flaws beneath the 
surface of a block of material before the sioux city crash 
surface testing of disks was deemed adequate 
if the ultrasonic testing had been required it the crack 
would have been discovered doughty said during a break in 
testimony at the national transportation safety board hearing 
the crash occurred as the crew of the crippled plane attempted 
an emergency landing after the planes rear engine disintegrated 
over northwest iowa metal spewing out of the engine severed all 
three of the planes hydraulic systems rendering the aircraft 
nearly uncontrollable 
the rear engines huge fan disk was found in two sections in 
northwest iowa farm fields and initial tests found a crack onehalf 
inch deep and just more than one inch long in the larger section of 
the disk according to an ntsb report 
ntsb chief metallurgist james wildey ii also testified wednesday 
that the crack is visible to the unaided eye and appears to have 
existed before the disk broke apart but he said he does not know 
how long it had existed 
chris glynn a design engineer for general electric co which 
made the engine testified that tests by his company indicate the 
crack would have been present when the fan disk was brought in for 
routine testing by united airlines in february 1988 he estimated 
that the crack would have been about onequarter inch deep when the 
disk was tested glynn said ultrasonic testing might have been 
needed to detect the crack 
doughty said the crack could not have been at the disk surface 
in february 1988 he said the testing procedure used at that time 
involving coating the disk with a dye would have revealed any 
surface imperfections 
it is our feeling at least based on information available at 
this time that the crack was not on the surface doughty said 
six other dc10 engine disks made from the same block of 
titanium as the flight 232 disk have been recalled for testing 
since the crash wildey said a possible flaw has been detected in 
one of them

a collection of priceless religious items that 
popes from the middle ages to the baroque era commissioned or 
received as gifts goes on display thursday the first time many 
have been seen in the united states 
the exhibit at the walters art gallery commemorates the 
bicentenntial of the baltimore archdiocese and the beginnings of 
the roman catholic hierarchy in this country 
since we are celebrating the presence of the papacy on 
american shores every object has been commissioned by or given to 
the pope said robert bergman director of the public museum 
the collection consists of nearly 30 works most of them created 
for use in the vaticans sistine chapel the papal households 
private chapel 
it includes a ninthcentury gold enameled reliquary cross said 
to have held pieces of the cross on which christ was crucified and 
one of the most important medieval enamel objects in existence 
also in the collection are two tapestries designed by raphael 
goldthreaded vestments made for pope clement vii 15231534 and 
several illuminated manuscripts 
about half the items have never been displayed in the united 
states and most have never been seen together bergman said 
the exhibit splendor of the popes treasures from the sistine 
chapel and the vatican museums and library runs through jan 7 
and is the culmination of two years of negotiations 
it was sort of an elegant ballet of courtesies bergman 
said the negotiations took place on a clerical and 
museumprofessional level we benefited from intervention from the 
highest levels of the church 
the tapestries vestments artworks crucifixes and manuscripts 
have been arranged to resemble a chapel a mock altar has been set 
up at the head of the exhibit with tapestries and vestments along 
the walls and religious manuscripts and other items in the center 
the exhibit gives you the impression of the cascading levels 
of embellishment of the sistine chapel that would have descended 
from michelangelos frescoes bergman said 
the two 15foot tapestries designed by raphael depict the 
stoning of st stephen and the conversion of st paul and are part 
of a set of 10 made to be hung below michelangelos frescoes on the 
sistine chapels ceiling 
raphaels designs for the sistine tapestries are considered 
his most perfected and heroic works bergman said the 
monumental scale of raphaels figures and their highly energized 
character were clearly influenced by michelangelos recently 
completed ceiling frescoes 
the tapestries have had eventful histories stolen twice and 
taken as far paris and constantinople they were reassembled during 
the reign of pope paul iii 15341549 in 1932 pope pius xi had 
them placed in the raphael gallery of the vatican museums 
the reliquary cross was made for pope paschal 817824 and is 
one of the vaticans most precious treasures it is the highlight 
of the sancta sanctorum treasure a collection of objects and 
relics found in the private chapel of the lateran basilica the 
seat of the papacy before the 14th century 
both the tapestries and the reliquary have never been seen in 
the united states

sentence for a fur robbery she said she didnt commit had her 
conviction overturned wednesday by an appeals court

john f kennedy jr a recently hired prosecutor 
in the manhattan district attorneys office has failed the state 
bar examination a spokesman for the office said wednesday 
the spokesman gerald mckelvey said a 10yearold office policy 
allows kennedy son of the slain president two more chances to 
take the exam and pass if he fails the third time he will be 
asked to resign from his 30000ayear job mckelvey said the 
next exam is in february 
meanwhile kennedy will continue to work as he has since august 
under the state rules kennedy may handle misdemeanor cases in 
manhattan criminal court and certain felony matters under the 
supervision of an admitted attorney 
a graduate of new york university law school kennedy 28 was 
among 69 new prosecutors hired in manhattan last summer he is 
assigned to the special prosecutions unit which handles cases such 
as consumer fraud

the senate labor and human resources committee 
on wednesday rejected the nomination of debra r bowland to head 
the labor departments wage and hour division citing her work to 
overturn a louisiana wage law covering government contracts 
we shouldnt put somebody in charge of a law that they dont 
believe in period said sen paul simon dill one of the 
nine senators to vote against the nomination six voted for it 
this is putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop said 
sen brock adams dwash another opponent 
bowland had been louisians secretary of labor from 1980 to 1982 
under dave treen the only republican governor in louisiana in 
modern history she opposed the law under his administration 
later as a lobbyist she represented the opposition to the 
prevailing wage law which was eventually repealed 
prevailing wage laws require government contractors to pay 
the prevailing wage in the area of the work and those wages 
generally are defined by reference to union pay scales 
bowland would have been in charge of enforcing the federal 
prevailing wage law the davisbacon act 
bowland supporters said she has pledged to enforce federal laws 
vigorously and should be taken at her word sen james m 
jeffords rvt said bowlands opppositon to the louisiana law was 
based on problems with the way it was being carried out and 
regulations derived from it 
they noted that the repeal occurred after her involvement and 
under a democratic administration 
but sens edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the committee 
and howard metzenbaum dohio both said it was clear from the 
campaign in louisiana that bowland has a philosophical objection to 
government involvement in wage and hour regulation 
you have to ask yourself whether she is going to be committed 
to the implementation of this legislation said kennedy i find 
it difficult to give her the benefit of the doubt 
bowland 45 has been with the labor department since 1985 and 
heads the womens bureau 
sen dave durenberger rminn abstained his spokesman said it 
was because durenberger had serious reservations about the 
nomination but thought the president should be able to pick his 
nominees

the state department on wednesday denounced 
terrorist attacks on civilian targets in el salvador that left 10 
people dead and dozens injured 
in one incident three people including an american were 
injured in a bombing at the office of a group that represents 
families of the victims of violence in el salvador 
subsequently 10 union activists were killed and 29 were wounded 
in the bombing of a union headquarters 
deputy spokesman richard boucher declined to assess blame for 
the incidents but criticized extremists of both the left and the 
right for continuing to engage in politicallymotivated violence 
boucher called them reprehensible acts and condemned them in 
the strongest possible terms 
the violent extreme on the left and the right seek power 
through violence and terror he said 
the extreme left murders salvadorans in the name of order but 
the extreme left and right in el salvador bring neither liberation 
nor order they bring suffering terror and death we condemn these 
acts of violence 
he said attacks were the work of terrorists and murderers and 
we vigorously denounce them violence only serves the interests 
of extremists who oppose democracy and national reconciliation

scientists have made tobacco plants produce an 
animal protein an ability that may one day make plants useful for 
soaking up pollutants a study says 
animal proteins may also eventually help make plants resist 
disease or produce higher levels of useful substances said 
researcher andrew hiatt 
the work is reported in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by hiatt and colleagues at the research institute of scripps 
clinic in la jolla calif 
another scientist cautioned that ideas about potential uses are 
only speculation 
the researchers made tobacco plants produce antibodies a kind 
of protein best known for its role in the bodys immune system 
antibodies latch on to specific germs as one step in fighting 
disease 
the plants produced the antibodies because researchers had given 
them genetic material based on mouse genes 
researchers experimented with a type of tobacco that is not used 
for smoking hiatt said while it lends itself to laboratory work 
other plants such as beans would be better suited for largescale 
production of antibodies he said wednesday in a telephone 
interview 
antibodies bind to specific substances while ignoring others 
which suggests that antibodybearing plants might be able to trap 
pollutants hiatt said 
for example a large quantity of such plants might be harvested 
and used for filtering river water that carries a low level of a 
suitable pollutant he said 
plant antibodies might also fend off plant diseases make a 
plant produce higher levels of useful substances by altering its 
biochemistry or serve as a relatively inexpensive source of 
antibodies for medical use he said 
but peter day director of the center for agricultural molecular 
biology in new brunswick nj said relatively simple technologies 
already exist for filtering out pollutants 
he also noted that the antibodies had not yet been shown capable 
of fighting plant diseases by binding to microbes 
the nature paper is quite an interesting piece of work he 
said it hasnt gone far enough to show exactly what the 
potentials are and what are the problems that remain to be 
solved

the house on wednesday voted to step up 
spending in the war against drugs by almost 32 billion 900 
million more than what president bush requested when he launched 
the campaign almost two months ago 
the money represents the major congressional contribution to the 
war against drugs this year and lawmakers said it was urgently 
needed to combat the scourge of illicit narcotics 
its destroying our morals its destroying our lives 
appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten dmiss declared 
as the house approved the funding increase on a voice vote 
the money was included in a transportation money bill fashioned 
by a housesenate conference committee and the overall measure must 
be acted upon by the senate before going to the presidents desk 
for his signature 
the measure would add almost 32 billion in spending to the war 
against drugs bringing the total to 88 billion for the fiscal 
year that began oct 
contained in the new funding package is 1 billion for the 
federal prison system for buildings 308 million for justice 
assistance block grants and 727 million for programs involving 
alcohol drug abuse and mental health 
everything in the package except for a few details was worked 
out between the administration and senate negotiators in september 
and the measure moved easily through the house 
a number of nonmoney portions of the antidrug package were 
dropped in the conference committee with house members saying the 
senate should never have put them in a money bill 
they ranged from requiring states to have drug programs to 
laying the groundwork for stepped up aid to andean nations house 
leaders said lawmakers would consider them later 
the sole snag in house action on the bill came tuesday when rep 
william frenzel rminn blocked an immediate vote saying the 
measure violated the budget act sponsors retreated to the house 
rules committee and obtained permission for action on the bill 
despite that objection 
under the plan spending would be offset by cuts in other 
programs leading sponsors to call it deficit neutral they 
brushed aside frenzels complaint that the levels were still too 
high 
we can have a balanced budget and a whole lot of other things 
at the expense of our economy and our whole country said whitten 
rep bill alexander dark said the important thing was to 
make the money available to combat the problem 
we have lost control of the streets of the schools and of the 
workplaces to the drug lords who have gotten control of this 
country alexander said 
spend we will do declared rep silvio conte rmass this 
is no paltry pennypinching response

president carlos salinas de gortari told 
mexico on wednesday that its long recession has bottomed out and 
the economy is growing again 
we are resuming growth at a faster rate than expected and even 
at a faster pace than is desirable he said in his first state of 
the nation address 
he told a joint session of congress that inflation is down 
sharply negotiations are nearly complete to reduce the burdensome 
foreign debt exports are up and economic growth is expected to 
reach 25 to 3 percent by the end of the year 
salinas said the government is becoming leaner and more 
efficient because of his efforts to reduce government controls over 
the economy and sell off dozens of state companies and monopolies 
a decade of crisis has damaged the living standards of the 
population in an unprecedented way salinas said he said the 
biggest problem was feeding mexicos 86 million people following 
two years of dry weather 
the president said he put high priority on law enforcement and 
combating corruption long entrenched in the government to show 
that no individual or group can be above the law 
impunity generates corruption and arrogance and goes against 
the interests of society he declared 
salinas put heavy emphasis on modernizing mexicos economy 
selling off stateowned companies and shedding government controls 
that he says stifle production and private enterprise 
the crisis showed us that a larger state is not necessarily a 
more capable state a state that owns more is today not a fairer 
state he declared reversing his partys traditional policy 
he was interrupted several times by applause but opposition 
members stood and jeered when he spoke of election reform 
sen porfirio munoz ledo a leader of the centerleft 
revolutionary democratic party spoke before salinas and raked the 
government for deciding to liquidate the public economy 
abel vinicio tovar a leader of the conservative national action 
party said he could not forget that the government frustrated 
hundreds of thousands of voters in western michoacan state 
salinas institutional revolutionary party popularly known as the 
pri denies accusations that it stole july 2 state assembly 
elections there 
salinas said the pri has the political and moral imperative of 
returning to the original meaning of the 191020 revolution 
salinas 41 was elected in july 1988 by the slimmest margin in 
pri history amid cries of fraud 
the party lost a governorship for the first time last july when 
ernesto ruffo of national action was elected in baja california 
salinas arranged to fly to mexicali to attend ruffos inauguration 
wednesday night 
salinas promised to end election fraud when he took office dec 
1 for a sixyear term 
leftwing opponents argue that a recent reform law does not do 
enough to ensure fair elections and will merely entrench the pri 
munoz ledo called salinas speech very autocratic and told 
reporters salinas was following the tradition of a monologue by 
the executive branch 
but ruffo said he believed salinass speech was truly 
positive we are opening up toward citizen participation in 
government decisionmaking 
after sustained growth averaging 5 percent annually in the 1960s 
and 70s the economy nosedived in the early 1980s when prices 
plunged on the world market for crude oil mexicos main export 
economic ills followed inflation unemployment a drop in 
earning power of wages by about half coupled with mexicos 
inability to make payments on its foreign debt second largest in 
the developing world behind brazil at 107 billion 
salinas administration has pushed a trend to export 
diversification in an effort to reduce mexicos dependence on oil 
and salinas said growth in imports had slowed to a 14 percent 
annual rate 
he spoke in the palace of fine arts because the chamber of 
deputies is still under repair after a fire 
about 10000 demonstrators including many union members 
marched toward the palace but were turned onto side streets by 
police without incident

a panel of private experts told congress 
wednesday the nation should build a small facility to store wastes 
from nuclear power plants until a permanent dump is opened 
the recommendation following 18 months of study by the 
threeman panel drew immediate criticism from both supporters and 
opponents of longstalled plans for building an interim facility to 
store spent uranium from the plants 
nuclear utilities which support the idea of an interim storage 
site called the recommendation too limited while 
environmentalists and other opponents said it skirted the central 
issue of safely managing nuclear waste in the long run 
the panel was created by congress in 1987 to reassess an energy 
department plan for building a largescale interim waste storage 
site in tennessee it rejected key aspects of the departments 
proposal but accepted the need for an interim facility 
it also recommended building a smaller facility to hold nuclear 
waste in emergencies such as a reactor accident this would not be 
intended for general waste storage 
the review panel made no recommendations on where an interim 
storage facility should be situated but members of the tennesee 
congressional delegation were quick to say the group was wrong to 
have concluded that any such facilities are needed 
its recommendations are as wrongheaded as the department of 
energys original plans tennessees democratic sens albert gore 
and jim sasser said in a joint statement 
the state of tennessee sued the energy department to stop its 
original plan to build a facility known as the monitored 
retreivable storage site near oak ridge tenn 
tennessee and other opponents of interim storage contend among 
other things that other states unwillingness to be host to a 
permament waste dump would mean any temporary storage site would 
risk being stuck with the waste indefinitely 
a desert site in nevada is under study by the energy department 
as a proposed permanent waste dump but the state is attempting to 
stop the project congress has not authorized the department to 
study any other permanent sites 
in its report to congress the review panel recommended building 
an interim waste storage facility about onethird as big as that 
proposed by the energy department and said it should be constructed 
only if enough nuclear utilities agree to put up the money the 
department plan called for all utilities to pay the cost 
the panel said its proposed storage facility would cost 500 
million to 600 million 
the group also rejected the idea incorporated in the 1987 
nuclear waste amendments act that created the review panel that 
the start of construction of an interim facility be held up until 
plans for a permanent dump were licensed 
it said such a linkage would because of delays in the building 
the permanent dump force some utilities to close down license 
reactors because of a lack of waste storage capacity 
the edison electric institute representing the nations 
investorowned utilities said congress should reject the panels 
idea of a scaleddown storage facility and instead go back to a 
more flexible version of the energy departments original plan 
public citizen the consumer and antinuclear group said the 
panels recommendation fudged the central issue of ensuring that 
all nuclear waste can be safely disposed of in the long run 
they tried to give a little something to everyone and they 
ended up givng nothing much to anybody said scott saleska a 
nuclear policy analyst at public citizen

the house completed final action thursday on 
legislation containing a provision banning most airline smoking and 
sent the measure to the senate 
the prohibition is part of a compromise housesenate bill 
providing 12 billion for transportation and 32 billion for 
antidrug programs for the fiscal year that started oct 1 
the chamber actually had voted tuesday to forbid smoking on all 
routes in the continental united states and on all flights to and 
from hawaii and alaska scheduled for six hours or less on 
thursday it finished action on the transportation appropriations 
bill by voice vote also approving separate provisions involving 
spending for antidrug abuse programs 
the antismoking language in the 152 billion bill would allow 
passengers to light up on just 28 us flights 24 to alaska and 
hawaii and four to guam of 17500 the airline industry says are 
scheduled daily according to sponsor rep richard durbin dill 
the ban would take effect 96 days after the measure is signed into 
law 
in february or march of next year airline passengers across 
america can finally start to breathe a little easier durbin said 
current law bans smoking on domestic flights of two hours or 
less 
durbin said the proposed smoking restrictions which the house 
adopted on a voice vote and with little debate indicate a shift in 
federal policy toward the tobacco industry the next target he 
said could be cigarette company advertising aimed at attracted 
young new smokers 
our agenda must move forward durbin said

its been a bad week for the navy 
starting with the sunday jet crash that claimed five lives on 
the uss lexington and continuing through wednesdays fire aboard 
the oiler uss monongahela each day has brought another mishap at 
sea that has navy brass shaking their heads and hoping its just 
a streak of bad luck 
one civilian specialist on industrial hazards warns that 
cutbacks in navy training could lead to more accidents 
congress is always trying to cut training budgets but if a 
pilot cant practice flying those on the deck dont get trained 
either its a prescription for an accident said karlene 
roberts an industrial psychologist participating in a fiveyear 
study of nimitzclass aircraft carriers and hazardous industrial 
systems 
she said however that overall the navys safety record is 
excellent 
operating at sea is an arduous life and the lesson is that 
even at peacetime there are dangers said rear adm brent baker 
the head of the navys information division 
thats no consolation to the families who have lost sons or 
daughters but those who have been around the navy a long time 
realize thats why we train so hard and emphasize safety you 
cant prepare for war at the pier said baker 
its frustrating its a real streak of bad luck he said 
in the latest incident the navy reported that nine sailors 
suffered smoke inhalation and four of those were treated for burns 
following an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the uss 
monongahela some 500 miles west of gibraltar 
the other incidents include 
three sailors and a reported 4 million worth of nonnuclear 
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier uss 
eisenhower near cape hatteras nc on tuesday with one sailor 
still missing and presumed dead 
a sailor aboard the aircraft carrier uss carl vinson fell into 
the pacific about 620 miles north of wake island late monday and 
was presumed lost 
a fa18 pilot dropped a 500pound bomb on the guided missile 
cruiser uss reeves in the indian ocean also on monday causing 
minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a fivefoot hole in the 
ships bow 
in the weeks most deadly event a jet pilot making his first 
landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the uss lexington in 
the gulf of mexico on sunday killing him and four others on the 
deck of the huge ship 
the accidents bear down on the navy at a time when the service 
has been under intense scrutiny for its controversial report on the 
april explosion aboard the uss iowa in which 47 sailors were 
killed 
critics have found fault with the navys report which concluded 
that gunners mate clayton hartwig was the most likely person 
to have used an explosive device to touch off the fireball in the 
ships 16inch guns 
on sunday a washington post editorial accused the service of 
having not a shred of evidence to back up its claim against 
hartwig meanwhile the general accounting office and congressional 
aides are looking into the navys investigation 
the navy has 599000 fulltime personnel and some 566 ships 
and usually a third of those are at sea for training operations 
potentially the navy has thousands of opportunities to kill 
people every day on any given carrier with the chance of aviation 
accidents fires explosions or even being washed overboard said 
ms roberts the civilian specialist 
very rarely do we see these accidents happen she said 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee and former navy secretary called the 
weeks events an extraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents 
the navy released figures late wednesday saying that since the 
beginning of calendar year 1989 there have been 101 operation 
and training related fatalities 
however included in this number are the 47 fatalities that 
resulted from the explosion on baord the uss iowa excluding those 
there have been 54 fatalities in calendar year 1989 the navy said 
according to navy figures the fiscal year that just ended was 
the best year on record for navy aviation with a flight mishap 
rate of 18 per 100000 flight hours a mishap is a death or major 
loss of aircraft 
according to the pentagons annual report on active duty 
military deaths 44 sailors fell overboard and drowned or were lost 
at sea from oct 1 1979 to sept 30 1988 over that same time 
201 lives were lost in aircraft lost or crashed at sea and 224 
lives were lost in aircraft accidents not at sea there were 272 
accidental drownings recorded as well 
in contrast over the same nineyear period the navy recorded 
2225 accidental deaths from vehicle accidents and 539 deaths 
attributed to suicide the study showed 
the navy did not figures available for fiscal 1989 
ms roberts said the large number of motor vehicle deaths is due 
in large part to motorcycle accidents and a good number of those 
are tied to alcohol consumption during offhours 
when youre dealing with a largely teenage population thats 
not that surprising compared to the normal population she said

substantial numbers of antisandinista rebels 
have reinfiltrated nicaragua from honduras over the past month 
encountering government troops on searchanddestroy missions 
government sources said wednesday 
congressional and administration sources said more than 1000 
contra rebels have left their base camps in honduras along 
nicaraguas northern border in recent weeks bringing rebel troop 
strength inside nicaragua to about 4000 
at the same time the rebels have asked the us agency for 
international development which administers the current us 
humanitarian aid program for the contras for food packaged in 
smaller more easily portable quantities and for increased amounts 
of cash in nicaraguan currency said an official familiar with the 
aid program 
aid has refused the requests believing that to help the 
reinfiltration effort would be a wrong signal said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity an aug 7 accord 
among the five countries in the region called for gradual 
demobilization of the contras and their return to participate in 
nicaraguas electoral process 
we made a conscious decision with concurrence at the highest 
levels of this building that we not do anything to increase 
support of increased reinfiltration said a state department 
source 
it appears the process is headed away from demobilization and 
back toward war said rep george crockett dmich chairman of 
the house foreign affairs western hemisphere subcommittee 
it is quite clear the contras do not have demobilization plans 
in mind quite conversely they appear to have mobilization 
plans he said 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega cited increasd contra attacks 
wednesday as his reason for calling off a 19month ceasefire with 
the rebels 
but some on capitol hill said ortega also was responsible for 
any increased skirmishing between the two sides because he 
increasingly had been sending sandinista troops into northern areas 
of nicaragua which they had traditionally not controlled 
this is in part precipitated by sandinista searchanddestroy 
missions said rep doug bereuter rneb a member of the foreign 
affairs and intelligence committees its no wonder there are 
conflicts

house members on wednesday urged the removal 
of judge walter l nixon of mississippi from the federal bench for 
lying under oath as the senate began floor action in its second 
impeachment trial in two weeks 
judge nixon has broken the law tainted the federal judiciary 
and brought disrepute on the courts said rep don edwards 
dcalif in calling for removal of the judge who was convicted of 
perjury 
if convicted by the senate nixon would be the seventh federal 
official ever removed through impeachment and the third judge to be 
ousted from the bench in the last three years 
nixon took the senate floor and declared that i have been 
wrongfully convicted he said witnesses against lied and 
prosecutors held him to an unreasonably high standard of accuracy 
in sworn statements 
i had nothing to hide nixon said i had done nothing 
wrong i had not committed any corrupt act why would i lie 
about something that i hadnt done 
the senate began floor action in the case just 12 days after it 
removed alcee l hastings as a district court judge in miami on 
charges of plotting to obtain a bribe and lying about it to a jury 
which acquitted him of that charge 
hastings was the first federal official ever removed on 
impeachment charges of which he had been acquitted in a criminal 
trial 
nixon in contrast last year began serving a perjury sentence 
for telling the fbi and a grand jury he never discussed a marijuana 
smuggling case with a local prosecutor who was an old friend 
drug charges against drew fairchild son of a wealthy 
contractor were made inactive after nixon discussed the case with 
forrest county district attorney paul holmes an old friend 
according to the articles of impeachment 
despite serving a sentence at eglin air force base in flrida 
nixon has continued to collect his 89500 judicial salary and says 
he will go back on the bench and preside over court cases if the 
senate acquits him 
the house on may 10 approved 4170 three articles of 
impeachment 
the articles say nixon lied by telling the grand jury holmes 
never discussed the fairchild case with him and by saying he never 
had anything to do with the case 
the third count says that by concealing conversations with 
various figures in the case after entering into a lucarative oil 
and case investment with contractor wiley fairchild nixon raised 
substantial doubt as to his judicial integrity undermined 
confidence in the integrity of the judiciary betrayed the trust of 
the people of the united states 
after hearing arguments in the case on wednesday the senate 
planned to debate it in closed session on thursday and most likely 
vote on friday 
conviction by a twothirds vote of senators present and voting 
on any of the three articles of impeachment would mean removal of 
nixon as a judge and halt payment of his salary 
taking the senate floor nixon told lawmakers he had always 
acted fairly in his courtroom in accord with advice from my good 
friend former sen john c stennis 
stennis long a fixture in the congressional establishment 
retired in 1988 after representing mississippi in the senate for 40 
years 
i have served honestly and faithfully as a federal judge for 
21 years nixon said i have always been mindful that i was 
appointed not annointed 
defense attorney david stewart admitted that he nixon made 
errors in his testimony but saidd they represented honest mistakes 
he didnt think of it stewart said he messed up his 
testimony wasnt perfect 
rep james sensenbrenner rwis another house manager of the 
case scoffed at the notion that misstatements by nixon in his fbi 
interview and grand jury testimony were merely blunders and not 
lies 
are they deceits or just a series of mistakes sensenbrenner 
asked the senate in an incredulous voice fourteen mistakes

east german leader egon krenz called public 
protest at home a good sign wednesday and said his country 
rigidly orthodox until now would follow president mikhail s 
gorbachev on the path of reform 
krenz said he and gorbachev reached total agreement on all 
questions we discussed one of which was reform in the soviet 
union and east germany 
many of the hundreds of thousands marching for democracy in east 
germany were showing support for the renovation of socialism 
he said 
in this sense i consider this a very good sign krenz told 
a news conference after meeting with gorbachev on his first trip 
abroad since replacing hardliner erich honecker his 77yearold 
mentor two weeks ago 
the remarks about protest were his most tolerant to date 
krenzs government has embarked on dialogue with the opposition and 
more open dealings trying to gain the peoples trust after decades 
of repression 
honecker who led the country for 18 years was brought down by 
the flight of tens of thousands of east germans most of them 
skilled young workers and weeks of mass demonstrations 
flight and protest continued on wednesday 
more than 500 east germans showed up at the west german embassy 
in prague czechoslovakia seeking passage to the west 
adn the official east german news agency said 8000 east 
germans had crossed the czechoslovak border under the new policy of 
visafree travel to the neighboring soviet bloc ally thousands of 
east germans already have fled to west germany through 
czechoslovakia 
the agency said 20000 people marched in neubrandenburg on 
wednesday eveningand tens of thousands filled the streets of 
frankfurt an der oder 
more signs of change emerged at home while krenz was in moscow 
officials in east berlin acknowledged serious problems in the 
planned economy and indicated sweeping reforms may be in store to 
restructure industry and improve production quality consumer goods 
are rare in east germany and many people wait 10 years for a car 
wolfgang vogel a prominent government lawyer was quoted by the 
west german newspaper die welt as saying political prisoners were 
being released and we hope there will be no new convictions based 
on political grounds 
manfred gerlach chairman of the free democratic party and an 
ally of the communists said the government needs overhauling the 
cabinet should be streamlined and his party should have a greater 
role 
on a visit to west germany a city communist party chief even 
questioned the berlin wall the symbol of east german repression 
built in 1961 johannes chemnitzer of neubrandenburg said the 
opening of borders by other soviet bloc countries made the walls 
significance limited and illusory 
krenz expressed the opposite view in moscow however declaring 
that the wall is not a border between two states its a 
border between two social systems a border between two military 
blocs and this is a border in the vicinity of which are a great 
concentration of weapons 
he told the journalists he and gorbachev discussed soviet 
reforms and their possible applications in east germany in an 
atmosphere which exists only between true friends 
his governments aim he said is to further strengthen 
socialism in our country and start reform in all aspects of our 
society 
gorbachev said on east german televisions there were 
differences and similarities in the reform processes of east 
germany and the soviet union and each must set its own course 
tass the official soviet news agency said gorbachev assured 
krenz of soviet support in the face of great changes and 
expressed confidence the east german party having rich 
traditions can overcome the difficulties that arise and with the 
support of the people can lead the process of renewal 
krenz would not go into detail about reforms planned in east 
germany but denied reports that he took issue with some aspects of 
gorbachevs program called perestroika 
we wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of 
perestroika in the soviet union he said adding that he 
especially wanted to explore its aim of giving communist more 
appeal for the average citizen 
if we resolve the problems of making socialism more 
attractive im sure people will stay in our country he said 
he promised to create expansive opportunities for each citizen 
of east germany to obtain a visa and passport to go to any country 
in the world and said proposals would be discussed by the 
government public and parliament 
as east german leaders have before him krenz rejected the idea 
of reunification with west germany 
the separate nations are an integral part of the stability of 
europe he told the news conference and quoted a frenchman 
unidentified as saying i love germany so much im glad there 
are two of them

practitioners of shock art have danced barefoot on 
glass and bitten the heads off live animals now one of them faces 
possible arrest for lighting fireworks on his chest again raising 
the question of how much is too much 
shock art can appear in mild forms such as that practiced by joe 
davis who has shouted out his poetry while aides poured water on 
his head it can be as severe as chris burdens being nailed to a 
volkswagen or having someone shoot him 
the practice of defining new art forms by shocking people set 
off a national debate recently over public funding of an exhibit by 
photographer robert mapplethope which featured homosexual and 
sadomasochistic photographs 
some art might shock and disturb people and thats certainly 
a valid thing for art to do said jeremy alliger executive 
director at bostons dance umbrella which recently featured a 
japanese artist who danced barefoot on glass he is actually 
composing on the glass said alliger 
the limit however is when people are placed without 
knowledge in a position of danger themselves he said whether 
that can be classified as art or not its inappropriate 
joe coleman may have provided the acid test in boston alliger 
said coleman crossed the line by endangering his audience 
coleman who appeared before a small audience at the boston film 
and video foundation bit off the head and front legs of a white 
mouse and hugged one spectator after he poured a bucket of blood 
over himself he also ignited fireworks on his chest and some 
burning shards landed in the audience 
it was definitely a terrifying experience said viveca 
gardiner 23 a financial writer in somerville we werent 
protected and we were definitely in danger 
one of the smoldering pieces flew into the face of robin brown 
who sat near gardiner in the audience she said she brushed it off 
her cheek and it then landed on her skirt and burned a hole the 
size of a dime 
if it had landed on my eye it definitely would have blinded 
me said brown 23 an editor for a market research firm in 
cambridge 
fire oficials said they would press for charges in the case 
lighting fireworks inside is illegal as is setting fires without a 
permit or a fire detail present fire chief howard ferguson said 
wednesday 
we are trying to find out how many things we can charge them 
with said ferguson who admitted authorities had not yet 
determined whom they would charge they also cant find coleman 
who is based in new york ferguson said 
animal rights activists patrons and even some leaders of the 
arts community say coleman went too far 
gus thornton head of the state society for the prevention of 
cruelty to animals said theres a lot of concern about use of 
animals in artistic acts and movies and i think a lot of the 
industry is trying to be responsible 
the head of the boston film and video foundation disavowed any 
connection with coleman anne marie stein said the coleman 
performance was the independent project of a foundation member and 
the act was not funded by the public sources which support regular 
foundation work 
while she said she generally believes in letting people decide 
for themselves what they think is art the foundation would not 
permit acts which could endanger the lives of people or involve 
cruelty to animals 
i think that goes too far she said of colemans performance

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
summoned nicaraguas ambassador on wednesday to lodge a protest 
against president daniel ortegas decision to resume fighting the 
contra guerrillas 
nicaraguas un mission called for a meeting at un 
headquarters next monday and tuesday among representatives of the 
contras nicaragua honduras and un officials involved in trying 
to disband the usbacked contras 
its purpose would be to approve the logistical and technical 
matters involved in repatriating the contras and integrating them 
in the nicaraguan political process the mission said 
perez de cuellar called in ambassador alejandro serrano caldera 
to express dismay over cancellation of the truce 
the secretarygeneral is extremely concerned at the breakdown 
of the ceasefire in nicaragua which had been largely holding 
since early 1988 said his spokesman francois giuliani 
it is his strong wish that maximum restraint be exercised by 
all parties and that the ceasefire can be renewed so that the 
peace process can once again be put on track 
the momentum gained by the process in recent months must not 
be lost the nicaraguan missions statement demanded disbanding 
of the contras by dec 5 as called for the peace accord signed in 
august by the five central american presidents 
it also said nicaragua reaffirms once again that regardless 
of the position assumed by the mercenary forces the electoral 
process culminating with the feb 25 elections will be guaranteed 
along with the security of international observers in their 
nationwide monitoring duties 
ortegas announcement that he would resume active hostilities 
jarred the joint unorganization of american states efforts to 
promote peaceful settlement of guerrilla wars in the region 
under central american accords signed in august in tela 
honduras a joint unoas commission is trying to help the 11000 
contras and their 12000 dependents camped in honduras voluntarily 
disband and resettle 
the us state department has objected to un efforts to 
persuade the contras to disarm as a violation of impartiality 
the security council is about ready to approve a 625member 
peacekeeping force to patrol nicaraguas border with honduras to 
halt raids by the contras or sandinista troops 
the force would also seal the honduran border with el salvador 
so salvadoran leftist rebels cannot receive arms shipments from 
nicaragua or cuba 
civilian un poll watchers are in nicaragua to monitor the 
campaign for the national elections and have pronounced the 
process fair so far 
recent polls show ortega to be trailing the usbacked 
presidential candidate newspaper publisher violeta chamorro

albanians protesting in support of vlasi in pristina the capital 
and 200 more in the nearby town of podujevo the official news 
agency tanjug reported

liberal republics of slovenia and croatia respectively had 
expressed support for stopping the trial

activities for allegedly plotting kosovos secession from 
yugoslavia and of inciting riots by ethnic albanians in february

control over kosovo an autonomous province within the republic 
prompting riots by ethnic albanians that cost 24 lives

ancient serbian heartland that borders albania serbians in kosovo 
claim they are harassed by ethnic albanians who make up 85 percent 
of the 19 million people

but was suspended immediately by a defense demand that the 
prosecutor and presiding judge be excluded on grounds of bias 
vlasis lawyers also claim no court in serbia could be 
considered impartial no date has been set for the trial to resume

jessica mcclure the object of the nations 
attention for 58 hours as rescuers struggled to pull her from an 
abandoned well came to the white house wednesday and stole not 
only the scene but president bushs glasses and handkerchief 
whos that mama the 3yearold from midland texas asked 
as bush entered the roosevelt room to present the first midland 
community spirit award to sioux city iowa for its response to 
this summers crash of a united airlines jumbo jet 
bush once a midland oilman had his glasses stolen while 
holding jessica as midland mayor carroll thomas presented the award 
the wriggling little girl dressed in a red corduroy smock with 
winnie the pooh on the front grabbed bushs glasses off his face 
and faced the clicking cameras with them balanced on her nose 
returning his glasses to bushs breast pocket jessica 
discovered the presidents white handkerchief 
this may make that what do you call it the blooper of the 
week said the president after jessica tried to drape the 
handkerchief over his head and dabbed his nose 
im sorry about that you can go to your mother he said 
laughing and handing the girl to her mother 20yearold reba 
mcclure 
after paying tribute to sioux city as a shining example of his 
thousand points of lights volunteerism bush said thank you 
all and as for you jessica wheres my handerkerchief 
as the audience howled he asked how old are you now

the president and the 3yearold with her parents trailing 
behind then headed to the oval office 
mrs mcclure said the rescue of her daughter who was 18 months 
old at the time was similar to the rescue of passengers trapped 
inside flight 232 
everybody pulled together to save the people she said 
there were people trapped in that plane and couldnt get out 
mothers and fathers and children and they couldnt find them and 
thats exactly how i felt i was running through the back yard 
looking for my child and i couldnt find her 
mayor thomas said the midland community spirit award would be 
given annually to recognize the community that best exemplifies 
volunteerism and compassion and concern for their fellow citizens 
there were 85 entries for the award a bronze reproduction of a 
plaque at midlands civic center that shows rescuers bringing 
jessica out of the well 
sioux city major loren callendar said the response to the crash 
would not have been possible without the help of surrounding 
communities in nebraska iowa and south dakota 
the colleges opened their doors the community as a whole 
lined up a long way to provide blood they did laundry the 
hospitals did a wonderful job the ambulances came from all over 
the small communities to transport these people callendar said

the white house on wednesday denounced

president bush lashing out at ortega said the man is so out 
of step with the other democratic countries in this hemisphere and 
so wildly insensitive to the feelings of others that we shouldnt 
have been surprised by his action 
on the other hand i dont think he has unleashed a fullscale 
offensive at this moment bush said in a radio interview with abc 
news hes hedging his bets now 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the administration said bush was consulting with leaders in 
central america to bring diplomatic pressure on ortega to reverse 
course 
it is obvious that hes afraid of the ballot box white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said referring to 
presidential elections set for feb 25 in nicaragua 
congressional leaders also reacted angrily to ortegas move but 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said i cant conceive of 
the house moving now toward providing military assistance thats 
not in the direction of the peace process 
costa rican president oscar arias who won the nobel peace prize 
in 1987 for spearheading efforts for a regional peace accord said 
in an interview on the cable news network its indeed very sad 
to go back to the military fight 
ortega at a news conference in managua suspended the 
19monthold ceasefire with the contras citing continued rebels 
attacks and hinted he might cancel the elections he accused bush 
of supporting terrorism in nicaragua 
he added now it will depend on the yankee congress and the 
yankee president that these elections take place on feb 25 
later alejandro bendana secretary general of the foreign 
ministry said nicaragua has no plans to cancel the elections 
meanwhile administration and congressional sources said that 
between 1000 to 1500 antisandinista rebels have returned to 
nicaragua from base camps in honduras over the past month bringing 
the guerrillas troop strength to about 4000 
under a central american peace plan the rebels are supposed to 
be disarmed and demobilized by dec 5 sources said many contras 
decided to return to nicaragua because it would be far easier for 
them to escape demobilization if they were wandering undetected 
inside nicaraguan territory 
contra leaders have told us officials they plan to continue 
abiding by the ceasefire despite ortegas decision to end the 
truce officials said 
responding quickly to ortega fitzwater said his announcement 
underscores the sandinista regimes lack of commitment to the 
peace process and democratization in nicaragua his deplorable 
action is an affront to the hemisphere and the democratic 
traditions we hold so important 
asked about prospects for renewing military aid for the rebels 
which would require approval by congress fitzwater said we 
dont want to go that route we want to get free elections 
fitzwater added concerning ortega we certainly dont want to 
give him any excuse to cancel the elections 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the united 
states wants the contras too to honor the ceasefire and will cut 
off us humanitarian assistance to rebel forces that engage in 
offensive operations 
however he said ortegas sandinista army has violated the 
ceasefire from the day it was imposed it has conducted regular 
offensive sweeps against the resistance resulting in over 100 
killed in the last five months 
boucher added in recent days weve seen the 
sandinistasponsored thugs attack peaceful political rallies by the 
democratic opposition 
a senior administration official said that while the united 
states wants the contras to continue honoring the truce 
obviously you cannot tell people not to defend themselves we are 
hoping the sandinistas will reconsider 
the official insisting on anonymity said ortega might not 
resume the fighting 
he may have felt he boxed himself in publicly and didnt know 
how to walk away from it the question is not what they say but 
what they do the official added 
acknowledging that the contras have been involved in military 
action fitzwater said there have been skirmishes and killing on 
both sides but in no case has there been any action to justify his 
ortegas abandoning the peace process or the election process 
reversing the course followed for eight years by the reagan 
administration bush set a strategy of seeking a diplomatic 
solution rather than a military victory in nicaragua he was pushed 
in that direction by congress which had not approved any military 
funding for the contras since october 1986 
in a compromise with the white house congress earlier this year 
approved 49 million in nonlethal aid for the contras

iran on wednesday approved a law giving 
it the power to arrest americans anywhere and put them on trial 
and one newspaper suggested that the first target be the former 
commander of the uss vincennes 
the action came amid growing antius passion being whipped up 
to mark the 10th anniversary of the storming of the us embassy in 
tehran protesters plan to burn 160 american flags outside the 
compound now a school on saturday 
the official islamic republic news agency said the majlis or 
parliament unanimously approved a final version of the bill that 
earlier had been passed by the 12member council of guardians a 
constitutional watchdog body the council acted after the 270seat 
majlis approved a first draft of the measure on tuesday 
the law will remain on the books as long as the us president 
is authorized to commit inhuman practices against the lives and 
interests of iranian citizens the agency reported in a dispatch 
monitored in cyprus 
the iranian move was in response to the justice departments 
authorization of the fbi to arrest suspected terrorists abroad and 
bring them to trial in the united states without the permission of 
the countries where they were located 
the us move did not specify iran but it is one of several 
nations accused of supporting and encouraging terrorism including 
the kidnapping of americans and other westerners in lebanon 
assassinations and hijackings 
iranian radicals clearly saw the justice departments action as 
aimed at the islamic republic 
you who scream about human rights and talk about terrorism 
are yourselves innately terrorists and criminals who have taken 
security away from the people of the world said parliament 
speaker mehdi karrubi a leading radical 
several iranianbacked shiite militants in lebanon are wanted by 
the united states for hijacking a twa airliner in 1985 and killing 
a us navy diver aboard the jet 
in 1987 fbi agents lured a lebanese shiite fawaz younis 
wanted for the 1985 beirut hijacking of a jordanian airliner 
carrying us citizens to a yacht in international waters off the 
mediterranean island of cyprus and arrested him 
a us court recently sentenced him to 30 years in prison 
the new iranian law allows the tehran government to arrest 
americans deemed to have acted against iranian interests anywhere 
in the world and bring them to the islamic republic for trial by 
nojury islamic courts 
us citizens and their agents and countries which 
collaborate with the united states in kidnapping or endangering 
iranian citizens or the interests of the islamic republic will be 
tried by iranian courts according to islamic justice the bill 
declared 
we have to empower the president and officials of the islamic 
republic to take reprisal measures to protect iranians karrubi 
said 
tehrans radical daily abrar said capt will rogers iii 
commander of the missile cruiser vincennes when it mistakenly shot 
down an iranian airliner last year should be the first person 
brought to trial under the new law 
the vincennes shot down the jetliner during fighting in the 
persian gulf in july 1988 killing all 290 people on board the 
navy said the crew mistook the plane for an attacking iranian f14 
fighter jet 
iranian radicals have been stirring antiamerican passions 
around saturdays anniversary of the nov 4 1979 embassy seizure 
militant iranian students backed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
held 52 americans hostage for 444 days helping to consolidate the 
antiwestern islamic revolution 
as part of the celebrations protesters will burn 160 american 
flags outside the embassy compound now a school for irans 
revolutionary guards corps in downtown tehran to commemorate 16 
shiites executed in september by saudi arabia for bombings in the 
holy city of mecca 
ayatollah ali khamenei who succeeded khomeini when the 
revolutionary leader died june 3 vowed to confront all aspects 
of global arrogance throughout the world 
global arrogance is a favorite iranian name for the united 
states 
khamenei called the takeover of the embassy a historic event 
with the capture of the american nest of spies the 
gigantic empire of cruelty and oppression in the contemporary world 
was at once overcome and the dust of this humiliation will forever 
remain on the faces of the arrogant leaders of america tehran 
radio quoted him as saying

the government of nicaragua which has been so intensely 
committed to the cause of peace cannot but condemn before the 
national and international public opinion the infiltration of 
mercenary forces into the fifth and sixth region from their bases 
in honduras over the last 20 days 
over the past three weeks more than 1100 mercenaries have 
penetrated our national territory taking advantage of the 
nicaraguan governments unilaterally declared ceasefire and 
utilizing the so called humanitarian aid approved by the us 
congress in order to carry out their criminal activities 
as the result of these infiltrations there has been a dramatic 
escalation over the last few weeks of attacks against civilian 
economic and military targets with the ensuing loss of civilian 
life among the nicaraguan population 
these actions are meant both to sabotage the tela central 
american presidential agreement of aug 7 1989 to demobilize the 
mercenary forces and also to put obstacles in the path of the 
electoral process 
in the face of these facts 
1 at this time the government of nicaragua is carrying out 
emergency efforts with different governments political 
personalities institutions and international organisms with the 
aim of strengthening the peace process currently upset by the 
steppedup aggressive behavior of the counterrevolutionary bands 
2 the government of nicaragua exhorts the united states 
government to support this international peace effort and 
contribute to the positive unfolding of the electoral process that 
is to culminate with elections on feb 25 1990 
3 so as to strengthen the diverse steps which the international 
verification and support commission ciav has taken in order to 
carry out the tela accords the nicaraguan government is convening 
a meeting at un headquarters on nov 6 and 7 among the 
governments of nicaragua and honduras the ciav and a 
representation of the counterrevolutionaries the objective is to 
approve the logistical and technical matters that can promote 
repatriation and the integration into the political process of all 
those persons linked to counterrevolutionary activities or their 
resettlement in third countries as stipulated in the tela accords 
4 the nicaraguan government hopes that the international 
initiative will immediately achieve the end of the bloodshed 
provoked by the counterrevolutionary activities thereby 
facilitating the carrying out of the contra demobilization accord 
by dec 5 
5 the government of nicaragua reaffirms once again that 
regardless of the position assumed by the mercenary forces the 
electoral process culminating with the feb 25 elections will be 
guaranteed along with the security of the international observers 
in their nationwide monitoring duties 
6 to the extent that the initiatives listed above begin showing

following are excerpts from president daniel ortegas news 
conference after his annoucement that the truce would not be 
renewed 
q why this sudden and unexpected change and what is your 
message to the american congress 
ortega north american congressmen with all the respect due 
some of them are electioneering they tell me i dont agree 
with this but i have to think of my voters and if my voters have 
other viewpoints then i have to express myself as my voters think 
and not how i think 
when we announce that we are not going to renew the 
ceasefire the yankee congress hits the roof because it knows that 
since they are meddling in nicaraguas politics they will have to 
take up again the subject of nicaragua and they dont want to take 
up the subject of nicaragua 
there will even be a hotheaded congressman who will arrive 
and propose military aid for the contras thats a problem of 
congress if they want to discuss military aid 
we simply point out that according to how the yankee congress 
acts it will facilitate that we carry out the elections or its 
going to hinder the electoral process 
now it will depend on the yankee congress the yankee president 
whether these elections take place or not on feb 25 
we have the will to do it but it will depend on them 
whether or not these elections will take place feb 25 
q has the government of nicaragua thought of what quantity 
what numbers were talking about if 20 percent 10 percent 50 
percent of the contras would have to demobilize in order to renew 
the ceasefire 
ortega the important thing is that the plan start to be 
implemented the number of contras that would begin to be 
demobilized that would be according to what will be discussed at 
the united nations in other words how many contras can be 
demobilized immediately how many to nicaragua how many to third 
countries then according to how that develops then we would 
be in the disposition to reestablish the ceasefire 
q president are you taking steps with the latin american 
governments could you tell us something about the communications 
that you have had with these nations about the demobilization of 
the contras the efforts that they can make 
ortega well until now the communications ive had have been 
with president carlos andres perez of venezuela when i was in 
costa rica on saturday oct the 28th 
he committed himself to the international arrangements with 
president oscar arias of costa rica 
also with president carlos menem of argentina who was here 
in nicaragua then last night i read a wire service dispatch that 
brings the information that president vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala is willing to mediate in this conflict between the 
united states and nicaragua 
because its clear this is a conflict between the united states 
and nicaragua its not an internal conflict here in nicaragua 
and the communication i had with the rev jesse jackson 
so far this is the action on the international arena

house members on wednesday urged the removal 
of judge walter l nixon of mississippi from the federal bench for 
lying under oath as the senate began floor action in its second 
impeachment trial in two weeks 
judge nixon has broken the law tainted the federal judiciary 
and brought disrepute on the courts said rep don edwards 
dcalif in calling for removal of the judge who was convicted of 
perjury 
if convicted by the senate nixon would be the seventh federal 
official ever removed through impeachment and the third judge to be 
ousted from the bench in the last three years 
nixon took the senate floor and declared that i have been 
wrongfully convicted he said witnesses against lied and 
prosecutors held him to an unreasonably high standard of accuracy 
in sworn statements 
i had nothing to hide nixon said i had done nothing 
wrong i had not committed any corrupt act why would i lie 
about something that i hadnt done 
the senate began floor action in the case just 12 days after it 
removed alcee l hastings as a district court judge in miami on 
charges of plotting to obtain a bribe and lying about it to a jury 
which acquitted him of that charge 
hastings was the first federal official ever removed on 
impeachment charges of which he had been acquitted in a criminal 
trial 
nixon in contrast last year began serving a perjury sentence 
for telling a grand jury he never discussed a marijuana smuggling 
case with a local prosecutor who was an old friend 
drug charges against drew fairchild son of a wealthy 
contractor were made inactive after nixon discussed the case with 
forrest county district attorney paul holmes an old friend 
according to the articles of impeachment 
despite serving a sentence at eglin air force base in flrida 
nixon has continued to collect his 89500 judicial salary and says 
he will go back on the bench and preside over court cases if the 
senate acquits him 
the house on may 10 approved 4170 three articles of 
impeachment 
the articles say nixon lied by telling the grand jury holmes 
never discussed the fairchild case with him and by saying he never 
had anything to do with the case 
the third count says that by concealing conversations with 
various figures in the case after entering into a lucarative oil 
and case investment with contractor wiley fairchild nixon raised 
substantial doubt as to his judicial integrity undermined 
confidence in the integrity of the judiciary betrayed the trust of 
the people of the united states 
after hearing arguments in the case on wednesday the senate 
planned to debate it in closed session on thursday and most likely 
vote on friday 
conviction by a twothirds vote of senators present and voting 
on any of the three articles of impeachment would mean removal of 
nixon as a judge and halt payment of his salary 
taking the senate floor nixon told lawmakers he had always 
acted fairly in his courtroom in accord with advice from my good 
friend former sen john c stennis 
stennis long a fixture in the congressional establishment 
retired in 1988 after representing mississippi in the senate for 40 
years 
i have served honestly and faithfully as a federal judge for 
21 years nixon said i have always been mindful that i was 
appointed not annointed 
defense attorney david stewart admitted that he nixon made 
errors in his testimony but saidd they represented honest mistakes 
he didnt think of it stewart said he messed up his 
testimony wasnt perfect 
rep james sensenbrenner rwis another house manager of the 
case scoffed at the notion that misstatements by nixon in his fbi 
interview and grand jury testimony were merely blunders and not 
lies 
are they deceits or just a series of mistakes sensenbrenner 
asked the senate in an incredulous voice fourteen mistakes

a major earthquake rocked northeastern japan early 
thursday and more than 6000 coastal residents were evacuated as a 
precaution against seismiccaused tidal waves officials reported 
no casualties or major damage were reported and the evacuation 
order was lifted after 3 hours as the danger of such waves called 
tsunami subsided 
the quake centered 18 miles below the seabed and about 80 miles 
off japans main honshu island struck at 326 am 126 pm 
wednesday est with a magnitude estimated here at 71 on the 
richter scale that was the same magnitude as the oct 17 quake 
that devastated the san francisco bay area 
the us geological survey in colorado reckoned the magnitude at 
73 
toshihara kon a fire department official in iwate prefecture 
about 300 miles northeast of tokyo said 6165 people from six 
coastal towns and villages were evacuated to town halls and school 
gymnasiums after the quake 
kon said the evacuation order was lifted at 7 am all tsunami 
warnings were lifted by 740 am the central meteorological 
agency said but it cautioned about slight rises in sea level 
after the quake officials closed the main expressway through 
the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were 
stopped to check the condition of the rails 
a small landslide briefly blocked traffic on a local road but 
dirt and rocks were cleared away and traffic returned to normal at 
6 am he said 
about 400 boats mostly fishing craft put out to sea from 
hachinohe to avoid being caught in the harbor by tsunami they 
later returned 
toshio akiyama head of the meteorological agencys earthquake 
and tsunami observation division said the quakes impact was 
blunted by its distance from shore 
akiyama said authorities remained cautious because a series of 
quakes had occurred in the area in recent months 
on sunday a quake centered about 95 miles off the coast and 
registering 65 on the richter scale hit the area but no 
casualties or damage were reported 
akiyama said another quake measuring with a magnitude of 57 
struck at 457 am in tottori prefecture about 300 miles 
southwest of tokyo he said there were no casualties or damage and 
the thursday quakes were not related 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in 
populated areas and a quake of 7 is capable of widespread heavy 
damage 
like california japan sits atop a major fault and is frequently 
shaken by earthquakes although few cause casualties 
in washington don finley a spokesman for the us geological 
survey said the main earthquake off honshu was the strongest in 
the region since a 77 earthquake struck march 9 1931

leftist rebels fired two 
antitank weapons wednesday at the headquarters of the 1st army 
brigade killing one civilian and wounding another in the latest in 
an escalating cycle of violence 
the attack came one day after the bombing of a labor 
federations headquarters in which 10 people were killed and 29 
wounded 
guerrillas aboard a red pickup truck stopped two blocks from the 
entrance of the army headquarters in the citys northern sector 
witnesses and soldiers said the rebels fired two antitank 
weapons both of which struck a car that pulled out from a side 
street into the line of fire 
the cars driver identified by rescue workers as hermogenes 
martinez was mortally wounded by the rockets which demolished his 
car a spokeswoman at the downtown rosales hospital said martinez 
59 died in the emergency room 
a street vendor was wounded in the attack the rescue workers 
reported 
on tuesday terrorists bombed the leftist national federation of 
salvadoran workers hall in downtown san salvador 
a strike call by the workers federation popularly known as 
fenastras remained largely unheeded wednesday with public 
transportation running normally and plants banks and shops doing 
business as usual 
farabundo marti national front guerrillas blamed the rightist 
government of president alfredo cristiani for tuesdays bombing and 
vowed to avenge the slain unionists no one claimed responsibility 
the moment for combat has arrived the moment for setting fire 
to the fascists has arrived the guerrillas said in a broadcast 
on their clandestine radio venceremos 
leftist leaders often refer to members of the governing 
republican nationalist alliance party as fascists 
the fascists are mistaken if they think they can terrorize the 
people like this the times when the people would run and hide are 
past if it is war they want then war they will get as the 
answer to these crimes the broadcast said 
the violence has threatened future talks between the guerrillas 
and cristianis government to end the decadelong civil war 
four people were wounded including an american citizen when 
another bomb went off earlier tuesday at the office of an 
organization of relatives of missing persons and political 
prisoners 
leftist organizations blamed the military for the attacks 
tuesday saying they were in retaliation for a guerrilla mortar 
attack on the defense ministry compound monday that killed one 
civilian and wounded 15 others 
military spokesmen rejected the leftists accusation and 
promised to investigate and punish those responsible 
the guerrilla broadcast further warned the attacks committed 
by the high command endanger a third meeting with government 
representatives scheduled for nov 20 in caracas venezuela to 
try negotiate a ceasefire in the war that has killed more than 
70000 people 
from now on all workers are at war with defense minister 
gen humberto larios the high command and the arena government 
the national union of salvadoran workers the largest labor 
federation said in a communique 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher 
condemned the bombings but declined to assess blame for them he 
criticized extremists of both the left and the right for the 
continuing violence 
the extreme left and right in el salvador bring neither 
liberation nor order they bring suffering terror and death he 
said we condemn these acts of violence

from spraypainted swastikas to physical 
violence incidents of bigotry are increasing on college campuses 
and universities face a moral obligation to confront them school 
officials said wednesday 
its a question of morality and colleges and universities are 
unwilling to speak about morality too frequently richard 
breslin president of drexel university told delegates to a 
special conference of the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
the jewish service organization 
we need to have a willingness to confront things he said 
the incidents range from swastikas painted on campus bulletin 
boards to violence against members of minority groups the adl 
said and they are increasing 
the adls annual audit of antisemitic incidents on college 
campuses showed a sharp rise from six cases in 1984 to 38 last 
year the group counted 12 in 1985 19 in 1986 and only 14 in 1987 
figures for 1989 wont be available until january a spokesman said 
the national institute against prejudice and violence said 
incidents motivated by prejudice occurred on 174 college campuses 
from september 1986 to december 1988 
the adl listed a few of the cases from the past two years 
last month two jewish students leaving a party at the hillel 
house at brooklyn college were severely beaten by a group of youths 
shouting antijewish slurs 
a group of youths marched on the sigma alpha mu fraternity 
house at the university of illinois campus in champaignurbana last 
month shouting antisemitic slogans students inside called police 
for help 
campus sidewalks at the university of delaware were defaced 
with slogans such as stay in the closet fag in october 1988 
an american indian student serving as the macalester colleges 
community council president in st paul minn received hate mail 
during the fall of 1988 including a letter that read in part 
custer should have finished off your entire degenerate race 
lesbian students in a dorm lounge at boston university were 
accosted by a man who threw one against a glass wall and threatened 
to kill another student who tried to intervene 
the first black fraternity house on the campus of the 
university of mississippi was burned down in august 1988 before the 
members moved in arson was suspected 
the hillel foundation building at rutgers university was 
defaced with swastikas and antisemitic slogans such as die jew 
in january 1988 and august of this year 
adl director abraham h foxman said his group has been unable to 
determine why bigotry has increased 
if we knew why we could have done something to prevent it 
he said the fact that it is happening is serious enough to focus 
as much attention on it 
one way of dealing with it is exposing it were dealing with 
prejudice its a disease an illness we cant afford to sit 
back we have to do everything we can to limit its virulence 
some of the university administrators at the conference 
suggested codes of conduct against bigotry but foxman was 
uncertain of their effectiveness 
i would rather see a stigma attached to acts of bigotry on a 
college campus than to have to legislate against them but that 
depends on whether or not college officials speak out quickly 
clearly and unequivocally he said 
temple university president peter j liacouras keynote speaker 
for the conference called on universities to go beyond condemning 
bias to eliminating it from their policies for hiring and student 
admissions 
young people on campuses will look at our message to them and 
at our actions said liacouras 
about 200 college administrators and other delegates attended 
the conference which was held in conjunction with the adls 
fourday executive committee meeting in philadelphia 
the adl sponsored similar conferences in may at augsburg college 
in minneapolis and in january 1988 at wellsley college in wellsley 
mass it plans similar gatherings early next year at ohio state and 
george washington universities

a contra military commander said 
wednesday that after 21 months without us military aid his 
rebels will defend themselves as best they can from attacks by 
nicaraguas sandinista army but we wont respond to sandinista 
fire because we cant 
the commander enrique bermudez asked the united states to 
resume military aid a communique from his general staff said 
sandinista soldiers backed by sovietmade helicopter gunships 
attacked two rebel positions in zelaya province wednesday 
the communique gave no details or casualties 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua said wednesday he was 
ending a 19month truce because of increased contra attacks 
including one last week that killed 18 people and another monday 
that killed four 
bermudez called ortegas allegation a lie and said the 
sandinistas had political motives 
he said the sandinista army began largescale mobilizations in 
three provinces on tuesday the day before ortegas announcement 
the sandinistas are looking for excuses not to have elections 
to impose a state of siege in nicaragua and to impede citizens from 
exercising their suffrage in the feb 25 1990 elections he 
said in an interview with the associated press 
bermudez said ortega left the united state with one choice 
renewing the military aid that ended in february 1988 he said 
congress should not leave us defenseless 
we know that the reigning political reality in the united 
states does not favor sending a lot of arms to our fighters but 
this is the only option bermudez said 
about 12000 rebel fighters retreated to base camps in honduras 
last year after seven years of military aid ended and the 
ceasefire began 
bermudez said 6000 contras have returned to nicaragua since the 
five central american presidents agreed on aug 7 that the contras 
would be disbanded and relocated in exchange for moves toward 
democratization in nicaragua 
congressional and administration sources in washington put the 
rebel troop strength inside nicaragua at about 4000 
these troops will only carry out evasive actions in the face 
of a sandinista army that has received 1 billion worth of arms 
from the soviet union in the last few years bermudez said 
it is a pity that our troops havent received even a single 
cartridge from the united states in almost two years faced with 
this reality we cant do anything except save our own lives and 
defend ourselves as best we can 
in managua the capital of nicaragua former contra leader 
alfredo cesar accused the sandinistas of preferring war to the 
political process which might hand it an electoral defeat 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo of managua called on the contras 
the sandinistas and the superpowers to demonstrate maturity and 
avoid a bloodbath 
president jose azcona of honduras said in a statement that 
ortegas decision jeopardizes the agreement to disband the contras 
based in honduras 
costa ricas president oscar arias condemned the move saying 
it endangers the peace process that was begun in nicaragua 
the san jose newspaper prensa libre said arias and foreign 
minister rodrigo madrigal tried to talk ortega out of calling off 
the ceasefire

gunmen assassinated a saudi arabian 
foreign service employee wednesday and a proiranian group that 
holds at least two american hostages claimed responsibility 
islamic jihad said it killed mohammed ali marzouqi personnel 
officer at the saudi embassy in damascus syria to avenge the 
beheading of 16 convicted terrorists in saudi arabia on sept 21 
a typed statement in arabic was delivered to a western news 
agency accompanied by a picture of american hostage terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
to prove its authenticity 
the revolutionary justice organization a shiite group that 
holds two other us hostages vowed to kill 10 americans for any 
revolutionary threatened by a recent us justice department 
ruling allowing american authorities to pursue and apprehend 
terrorists abroad 
police said marzouqi 68 was climbing into his gray embassy 
limousine in west beiruts tallet khayyat district when three men 
raked his car with fire from submachine guns equipped with 
silencers they said his syrian driver was wounded in the right 
hand 
marzouqi was a frequent visitor to beirut he handled paychecks 
for lebanese employees who act as custodians of the deserted 
embassy 
saudi diplomats and personnel were evacuated in 1985 after 
proiranian shiite zealots ransacked the embassy 
iran and saudi arabia which is predominantly sunni moslem are 
at odds over who speaks for the worlds nearly 1 billion moslems 
saudi arabia broke relations with iran in april 1988 accusing it 
of subversion and terrorism 
islamic jihad said in the statement wednesday several weeks 
ago the rulers of saudi arabia the servants of the devil 
committed a massacre against 16 moslem pilgrims from kuwait 
they thought they had escaped the consequences of their act 
but we will kill them wherever we find them 
it claimed marzouqi was one of the most senior saudi security 
officers in lebanon his activities were not hidden from the eyes 
of our mujahedeen or holy warriors 
revolutionary justice did not mention marzouqi its threat to 
americans was made in a handwritten statement in arabic delivered 
to the independent beirut newspaper annahar with a photocopy of an 
old picture of american hostage edward austin tracy who was 
kidnapped oct 21 1986 
it was reacting to a justice department decision empowering fbi 
agents to arrest terrorists abroad and a draft law before the 
congress making terrorist attacks against americans punishable by 
death 
irans parliament approved a law wednesday authorizing the 
arrest anywhere in the world of americans who acted against iran 
in its statement revolutionary justice said it would kill 10 
americans for threatening the freedom or life of a single 
revolutionary 
saudis have been a target of worldwide terrorism in recent 
months and proiranian factions have claimed responsibility in 
statements from beirut 
on oct 16 an embassy employee in ankara turkey lost both 
legs in a car bomb explosion 
a saudi serving as a moslem prayer leader in was killed in 
march and an egyptian driver for the saudi embassy there was 
murdered in june the third secretary at the saudi embassy in 
thailand was killed in bangkok in january 
the picture of anderson accompanying the islamic jihad statement 
showed him with a mustache cutting a birthday cake wearing a pale 
tshirt and glasses 
anderson was kidnapped march 16 1985 and has been held longest 
of the 18 hostages in lebanon he was 42 on oct 27 
it was unclear whether the picture was new or one of a series 
of similar pictures released in the past year the cake in front of 
him looked different and appeared to have a single tier rather 
than two as in the previous photos 
islamic jihad also holds thomas sutherland 58 who was acting 
dean of agriculture at american university of beirut when he was 
kidnapped june 9 1985 
revolutionary justice holds tracy and joseph james cicippio 59 
of valley forge pa kidnapped sept 12 1986 its statement did 
not include a direct threat to them

us secretary of state james a baker iii told 
foreign minister moshe arens by telephone wednesday that he has 
revised his middle east peace offer following objections from 
israel an israeli offical said 
israel radio said the new draft delivered to arens wednesday 
night by us ambassador william brown gave israel assurances that 
known plo members will be banned from talks but left the door open 
to indirect plo participation 
the radio said prime minister yitzhak shamir finance minister 
shimon peres defense minister yitzhak rabin and arens the four 
top leaders will meet friday to discuss the modifications 
israel radio also said wednesday the army plans to begin 
deploying a reserve unit of jewish settlers in the west bank 
breaking a ban against assigning settler units to the occupied 
territory 
the move immediately brought protests from leftwing legislators 
who complained use of settler companies could increase the violence 
in the 22monthold palestinian uprising 
later wednesday israeli tv quoting defense sources said 
settler reserve units would not be deployed in the west bank 
despite the previous reports 
an israeli official confirmed baker spoke to arens on wednesday 
the official who spoke on condition he not be identified refused 
to provide details of the plan 
the reported changes in bakers proposal calling for a 
preliminary meeting on israels election plan with a palestinian 
delegation came a week after arens wrote the american official 
asking for key changes in the us proposal 
arens insisted that israel have the right to veto members of a 
palestinian delegation if they are tied to the palestine liberation 
organization and that israelipalestinian talks be limited to the 
israeli offer for elections in the occupied territories 
in the new draft baker said the palestinian delegation may 
discuss the elections plan and the process of negotiations but not 
the content of negotiations reports on israel and army radio said 
the reports said baker also agreed to scrap the idea of a 
meeting among us israeli and egyptian officials in washington to 
discuss the makeup of the palestinian delegation 
baker declined to give israel a veto of individual members of 
the delegation but said israel can refuse to attend the meeting if 
the palestinian delegation is not acceptable the reports said 
the use of the word acceptable was not a change from bakers 
earlier plan and the reported revised draft also seemed to fall 
short of arens request that the plo be banned from even indirect 
participation in the talks 
since the start of the uprising in the occupied lands in 
december 1987 607 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers and jewish settlers forty israelis also have died in the 
violence 
in the occupied territories wednesday soldiers shot a masked 
protester in a demonstration and masked palestinians beat and 
critically injured a 60yearold gas station attendant on suspicion 
of cooperating with israel 
palestinians have killed 138 of their fellow arabs on suspicion 
of cooperating with israel

the superintendent of the state prison at 
camp hill was suspended wednesday pending an investigation by an 
independent panel into a twoday riot that left 123 people injured 
last week 
in a threeparagraph statement corrections commission david 
owens jr said robert m freeman superintendent of the riottorn 
prison was suspended based on information he received on wednesday 
the statement said owens would not give a reason for the 
suspension in order to preserve superintendent freemans due 
process rights and to maintain the integrity of the ongoing 
investigation 
two hours before the suspension was announced the associated 
press reported that prison guards said inmates were able to go on a 
second rampage at the prison because officials did not fix broken 
control boxes after the first night of riots

earlier this week to look into the uprising the commission headed 
by former federal judge arlin adams is expected to release its 
report on or before dec 1 
casey spokesman vince carocci said the governor concurred with 
the decision to suspend freeman 
freeman has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached 
for comment at the prison 
corrections spokesman kenneth robinson said a decision on 
whether freeman will be suspended with or without pay has not yet 
been determined 
erskind deramus deputy commissioner for programs will serve as 
acting superintendent robinson said 
in the associated press interviews several guards said they 
alerted prison officials about the control box problem 
more than 15 correctional officers said the prison 
administration ignored the problem and said officials lied about 
what time they secured the prison after last wednesdays riot a 
prison spokeswoman stressed that the prison was under control when 
officials said it was at 10 pm 
robinson would not say whether the information revealed in 
wednesdays associated press story had any bearing on freemans 
suspension 
the two nights of rioting left 123 people injured and destroyed 
more than a dozen buildings prison officials said they expect to 
transfer about 1500 inmates to state and federal prisons 
prison officials would not comment wednesday on the guards

was carrying out a special initiated action aimed at detaining 
masked activists who patrol gaza armed with axes clubs and iron 
bars to enforce uprising rules and kill collaborators 
the army showed reporters five youths who were arrested while 
wearring masks and patrolling a street in the jabaliya refugee camp 
army regulations order soldiers to detain any masked activist 
and to fire if the masked man refuses orders to stop 
an official said hamas has become increasingly brutal in recent 
months with four nurses killed by activists one nurse was killed 
with an ax while at work in a hospital ward 
at least 8500 palestinians are in military prisons

hundreds of east germans seized 
the chance to go west on wednesday entering the west german 
embassy hours after east germany lifted shortlived restrictions on 
travel to czechoslovakia 
east german refugees said the number of east germans in the 
embassy in the czechoslovak capital had risen to more than 500 by 
late wednesday afternoon about 80 people had been waiting there 
before the east german ban on visiting czechoslovakia was lifted at 
midnight tuesday 
the ban went into effect after more than 15000 east germans 
jammed the same embassy last month and east berlin was pressured to 
allow them to travel west in special trains 
the exodus of tens of thousands of east germans to the west 
through east bloc neighbors czechoslovakia hungary and poland in 
recent weeks helped to hasten the fall of east german leader erich 
honecker 
since egon krenz succeeded honecker as communist party chief 
oct 23 authorities in east berlin have agreed to issue travel 
documents for at least 150 east germans who have turned up at the 
west german embassy in prague a similar arrangement is under 
operation at the west german mission in warsaw 
the number of east germans flocking to the bonn mission in 
prague seemed likely to rise with the lifting of travel 
restrictions analysts said 
it was not immediately known how the prague government would 
react this time after previously allowing thousands of refugees to 
leave czechoslovakia for the west via east germany 
the flood of new arrivals and a continuing flow of hundreds of 
east germans going west via hungary and austria each day suggests 
that at least some of his countrymen are skeptical about promises 
of reform made by krenz 
krenz rescinded the travel ban imposed under honecker and also 
hinted that a new law giving east germans greater travel freedom to 
the west would be studied 
austrian officials said wednesday 402 east germans crossed to 
austria via hungary en route to west germany since tuesday 
bringing to more than 48000 the number of east german citizens who 
have crossed to the west since budapest opened the border to them

president daniel ortega ended a 
19month truce with contra guerrillas on wednesday blaming the 
united states for renewed rebel attacks and accusing president bush 
of promoting death assassination crime and terrorism in 
nicaragua 
ortega said the truce was being canceled because of increased 
contra attacks including one last week he said killed 18 people 
and another monday that killed four 
the white house denounced ortegas decision to end the truce but 
brushed off talk about renewing military aid for the contras we 
dont want to give him any excuse to cancel elections scheduled 
for next february said presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
ortega read a communique in which he said nicaragua reaffirms 
once again that regardless of the position assumed by the 
mercenary forces the electoral process culminating with the feb 
25 elections will be guaranteed 
but he said replying heatedly to a reporters question on us 
aid to the contras now it will depend on the yankee congress and 
the yankee president whether these elections take place or not on 
feb 25 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral at the foreign ministry 
emphasized later that nicaragua had no plans to cancel the 
elections commenting on possible renewed us military aid to the 
contras bendana added obviously if they let a bomb fall here 
we cant have elections 
ortega said us aid to the contras should be used only to 
demobilize and resettle the army that has been trying to overthrow 
his leftist sandinista government 
fitzwater said in washington no request for renewed military aid 
was contemplated 
the administration said bush was consulting with leaders in 
central america to bring diplomatic pressure on oretega to reverse 
course 
this has little to do with the military situation and much to 
do with the electoral situation said virgilio godoy vice 
presidential candidate of the national opposition union a 14party 
coalition that is the sandinistas main election rival 
ortega declared in a live nationwide radio broadcast we have 
the responsibility for defending the lives of nicaraguans 
therefore we cant allow assassinations to be committed 
the defense ministry later wednesday reported three recent 
attacks by contra forces that left eight people dead and 14 
wounded three of the dead were civilians who were kidnapped and 
subsequently killed a ministry communique said 
it said the attacks occurred sunday monday and tuesday in the 
northern provinces of matagalpa and jinotega 
his announcement was a blow to the central american peace 
process and the aug 7 agreements that called for disbanding the 
contras in exchange for moves toward democratization in nicaragua 
the sandinistas are looking for excuses not to hold 
elections contra commander enrique bermudez told the associated 
press in tegucigalpa honduras 
the contras were not a party to the peace accords and contra 
field commanders have said they will not abide by them 
bermudez said the contras would continue to observe the 
ceasefire except to defend themselves he said he recognized that 
renewed us military aid was unlikely but called it the only 
option 
at un headquarters in new york secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar summoned nicaraguan ambassador alejandro serrano caldera 
to strongly protest ortegas decision 
we do not agree with ortegas decision because it 
jeopardizes the peace process that nicaragua was following said 
president oscar arias of costa rica who won the 1987 nobel peace 
prize for spearheading efforts for peace 
arias press secretary jorge urbina later said the 
government of costa rica is profoundly disappointed by this 
decision 
ortega said more than 1100 contra fighters had infiltrated 
nicaragua from honduras the past three weeks and rebel attacks had 
increased dramatically he asked for a nov 67 meeting at 
united nations headquarters to approve the logistical and 
technical matters to decomission the contras 
ortega said his government had made every effort to promote 
democracy in the region and in nicaragua and to have elections 
and what has been the response of the north american 
government to this effort in the first place with the north 
american government having the chance to contribute to peace it 
hasnt done so 
president bush is not contributing to peace president bush is 
promoting war hes promoting death assassination crime 
terrorism in nicaragua 
the us congress recently approved 9 million for the 
opposition coalition ortega said the electoral opposition and the 
contras represent the same counterrevolutionary current both 
are mercenary forces at the service of the north american policy 
ortega contends the contras have routinely violated the truce 
since it was signed in march 1988 a month after congress suspended 
military aid to the rebels he said that in 19 months contra 
attacks in nicaragua killed more than 730 people and wounded more 
than 1000 mostly civilians 
the ceasefire was never formalized and the sandinistas extended 
it on a monthly basis contra leaders said they viewed the truce as 
indefinite most contra troops moved into camps in honduras and 
fighting dipped sharply inside nicaragua although it never ceased 
completely 
the united states has continued to supply nonlethal aid 
including boots and uniforms and other military items but us 
officials say they have urged the contras not to launch attacks 
inside nicaragua 
us officials said they wanted the contras to remain a force in 
being to pressure the sandinistas to keep the feb 25 elections 
fair but did not want them to move out of the camps

ballots were cast after a closed fivehour debate between 
negotiators and members of the beverly hills education association 
gathered at the beverly hilton hotel 
afterwards it was clear many disapproved of the terms in the 
agreement 
theres no question in my mind they left negotiations 
yesterday feeling it was the best they could do said economics 
teacher stuart horowitz who voted no i simply feel they were 
beaten at the negotiation process 
this is very depressing and frustrating said teacher 
sachiko morrey 
during tuesdays 5hour bargaining session that produced the 
contract about 200 striking teachers marched outside district 
headquarters in a show of solidarity some carried signs reading 
gucci mentality pic n save salaries 
it was an unusual strike with teachers on the picket line 
eating food catered from spago a wellknown restaurant 
concerned parents volunteered more than 500000 to fulfill 
teacher salary demands in the city where the ultrarich rub elbows 
with movie stars and shop at expensive stores on rodeo drive 
on monday more than 100 angry parents and students some 
threatening to launch a recall against school board members joined 
picketing teachers to lobby for an end to the strike 
about 300 of the school districts 315 teachers counselors and 
nurses walked off the job oct 16 seeking better pay top pay for 
teachers in beverly hills is 46270 and averages 42659 
one of the issues in the strike was starting pay of teachers 
which is 21604 annually nearly 6000 less than in neighboring

the south african army is on alert 
because of a reported guerrilla incursion into namibia and next 
weeks preindependence elections could be delayed foreign 
minister rf botha said wednesday 
botha told a news conference un military observers monitoring 
namibias transition from south african rule to independence 
reported the incursions from angola in radio messages to each other 
and were too frightened to intervene the un force denied it 
leaders of the southwest africa peoples organization which 
fought a 23year bush war for independence said none of their 
guerrillas were crossing the border swapo is expected to get the 
most votes in a fiveday election starting tuesday for seats in an 
assembly that will draft a constitution 
a statement from the un transition assistance group released 
at un headquarters in new york and in windhoek namibia said 
it has been established that the messages do not emanate from any 
untag source 
it continues to be the case that untag is unable to confirm 
allegations that swapo plan combatants are present in southern 
angola 
plan refers to the swapo fighting force the peoples liberation 
army of namibia 
chief un spokesman francois giuliani told reporters in new 
york that botha telephoned secretarygeneeral javier perez de 
cuellar to inform the secretarygeneral of his allegations 
botha said in pretoria that members of his staff intercepted 
messages from un observers mentioning the infiltration of vehicle 
convoys and more than 600 guerrillas from oct 23 through tuesday 
unless this is resolved within days the south african 
government is reserving the right to take whatever steps would be 
required to ensure that all parties comply with their 
obligations he told the news conference the south african 
security forces have been put on alert 
andimba toivo ja toivo secretarygeneral of swapo said bothas 
assertion was another concoction by the south african government 
in a bid to sabotage the election 
it is well known that the south african government sends its 
own troops dressed in other armies clothing when it wishes to 
fabricate an offensive maneuver by an army that has laid down its 
arms he said 
botha said the intercepted messages made it clear that swapo 
warned the untag patrols they they shouldnt interfere or they 
would be shot the tendency of untag is that they are wishing to 
evacuate to run 
he said untag is certainly not doing its job it is frightened 
to do it properly where swapo is involved 
if this threat cannot be removed and if these activities 
continue then there cannot be a free and fair election the 
foreign minister declared we decided to reveal this in an 
attempt to stop this and to save the process to save the 
elections 
the guerrillas had bases in angola during the long guerrilla 
war but are not supposed to have armed personnel in namibia or 
near the border during the transition south africa also withdrew 
its troops from the territory 
on april 1 the official start of the transitional period south 
africa said hundreds of guerrillas had crossed the border south 
africa received un permission to deploy its troops and about 280 
guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were killed 
south africa captured namibia from germany in world war i and 
governed it under a league of nations mandate the united nations 
ended the mandate in 1966 but south africa refused to leave 
in december it signed agreements with angola and cuba under 
which the un independence plan would be accompanied by withdrawal 
of the 50000 cuban soldiers stationed in angola

president carlos salinas de gortari who 
helped reverse decades of confrontation with the united states 
called for even better relations on wednesday saying they are of 
special significance to mexico 
relations with such a powerful neighbor with the most complex 
common border in the world and a history burdened by acts of 
extreme aggression will never be easy salinas told a joint 
session of congress in his first state of the union speech 
nevertheless there is no reason our relations should always 
be bad or tense 
relations over three previous administrations were marred by 
disagreements and mutual accusations on a wide range of issues 
from alleged mistreatment of mexican illegal aliens to us trade 
barriers corruption and drug trafficking 
salinas said he has been making special effort to improve 
relations since taking office dec 1 in a positive respectful 
atmosphere that does not stem from a change in our principles 
but from a change in circumstances 
we reject confrontation as being senseless and submission as 
being offensive to our firmest convictions we view the future with 
assurance without ignoring a difficult past he added 
salinas said usmexican trade has been growing since mexico 
joined the 103nation general agreement on tariffs and trade in 
1986 and lifted many of its trade barriers 
mexico now is seeking to broaden its exports of iron steel and 
textiles to the united states he said 
he also said that increased cooperation in combating drug 
trafficking has brought positive results 
salinas indicated however that mexico will pursue its 
traditional policy of nonintervention opposing any outside 
interference with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government or in 
panama 
the situation in central america remains delicate salinas 
said 
he expressed support for a regional peace plan aimed at 
negotiating an end to the war between nicaraguas government and 
the ussupported rebels and to leftist guerrilla insurrections in 
el salvador and guatemala 
he said mexico defends the rights of the panamanian people to 
selfdetermination 
but he took a swipe at gen manuel antonio noriega panamas 
defense forces chief saying we made a distinction between 
defending such principles and protecting those who have hindered 
the progress of a nation 
noriega was indicted on us drug trafficking charges in 
february 1988 and the united states has been trying to get him 
ousted 
salinas also said mexico is seeking to increase economic and 
cultural relations with president fidel castros communist regime 
in cuba and in the field of finance we agreed to respond 
sensitively and responsibly to conditions in both countries 
he did not elaborate 
salinas said mexico will press for closer relations with the 
rest of latin america and seek trade opportunities with japan 
china and other far east countries 
one of the concerns of my administration is to extend mexicos 
presence in the pacific basin the most dynamic zone of economic 
growth and technological innovation he said we are therefore 
reorienting diplomatic and consular actions in the region

two legislators said the chinese government 
expelled them from a committee negotiating hong kongs future 
constitution to punish residents for criticizing the chinese 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
the national peoples congress standing committee ruled tuesday 
that sezto wah and martin lee could no longer serve on the hong 
kongchina basic law committee 
the committee is drafting the constitution for the territory 
when it reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
the two members of hong kongs legislative council told 
reporters the chinese action was also an attempt to make them 
apologize for their criticism of beijings military crackdown on 
the prodemocracy movement in june 
lee appealed to the chinese government not to penalize people in 
this british colony for their criticism and said he hoped the 
punishment would stop with their expulsion 
the two legislators are also members of a hong kong alliance in 
support of the patriotic democratic movement in china 
beijings official xinhua news agency reported tuesday that the 
decision to expel the two men were based on a report by ji pengfei 
chairman of the basic law committee and head of the hong kong and 
macao affairs office in the chinese government 
it said the national peoples congress noted sezto and lee said 
they would not participate in drafting law with the current chinese 
government and had called for reexamination of the 1940 
chinesebritish agreement on the return of the territory to chinese 
rule in 1997 
china has pledged to retain hong kongs capitalistic and legal 
system for 50 years after 1997 but the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement has raised fears about chinese interference 
in hong kongs affairs

children were raped sodomized and forced to 
take part in nude sex games and satanic rituals at the mcmartin 
preschool a prosecutor said during closing arguments wednesday in 
the longest criminal trial in us history 
deputy district attorney lael rubin urged a superior court jury 
not to be taken in by what she called the loving facade 
presented by defendants raymond buckey and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey 
buckey 31 and his mother 62 are charged with 64 counts of 
child molestation and one count of conspiracy the charges are 
linked to the alleged molestations of 11 children at the 
nowdefunct mcmartin preschool in suburban manhattan beach 
it is a mistake it is unfair and it is unconscionable to 
simply discount the childrens testimony because certain statements 
seem unbelievable ms rubin said 
when you assess it all you will see loud and clear there were 
some pretty awful things that went on at that preschool at the 
hands of raymond and peggy buckey 
buckey and his mother were among seven people arrested in 1983 
charges were dropped against the other five for lack of evidence 
jurors were to begin deliberations in the 2year trial after 
receiving instructions from judge william pounders on thursday 
during his earlier closing arguments defense attorney danny 
davis said medical evidence presented at trial was faulty and the 
children were coached in their testimony 
he maintained that the prosecutions case was built on 
insinuations excuses and lame rationale 
the trial is the longest and most expensive criminal proceeding 
in us history with a price tag estimated at 15 million 
a jury of 12 and six alternates began the trial in april 1987 
during the years job problems and illness plagued the jury 
leaving the bare dozen panelists needed to deliberate and avoid a 
mistrial

israeli theater is free of censors for the 
first time after parliament suspended the blue pencils for a 
twoyear trial period 
liberal lawmakers are now trying to end censorship of movies and 
ease military censorship of the media but they are almost certain 
to be defeated in both efforts few plays were actually banned but 
playwrights had constant battles with censors over scenes lines 
and even words several complained this produced artistic 
hesitation and selfcensorship 
the move to free plays of control was hailed on all sides as 
long overdue for a country that values its democratic tradition 
in a democracy there is nothing more loathesome than 
censorship said mordechai vershuvski a citizens rights movement 
lawmaker who led a successful nineyear effort against censorship 
miriam kainy head of the 50member playwrights association 
said ending censorship would mature israeli playwrights who have 
held back and felt a reluctance to go all the way with their 
work and ideas 
the existence of the censor is an example of our 
conservativeness our wanting to have a father to tell us what to 
do she said the fact that you dont have to send a text to a 
censor will mature us 
yehoshua justman head of the 27member theater and movie 
censorship board appointed by the interior ministry which is 
controlled by an ultraorthodox religious party said the panel had 
been very liberal in approving scripts and denied it had an 
antileft bias 
in the past decade he said the board had banned outright only 
three or four arab productions and one israeli play ephraim 
returns to the army 
ephraim returns is the story of a wellintentioned but 
morally weak west bank commander who allows a group of rightwing 
israelis to escape punishment for shooting an arab demonstrator 
the board which reviewed 50 to 60 scripts a year ruled the 
play impuned the honor of the army and incited israeli arabs to 
violence by comparing israeli rule in the occupied territories to 
that of the nazi germans in europe the supreme court overturned 
the decision in 1987 curtailing the power of the board and 
clearing the way for parliaments move in august to suspend 
censorship altogether 
yitzhak laor author of ephraim returns said he believed 
the play was banned in part because of his own activism against the 
lebanon war and his refusal to serve as a soldier in the west bank 
the israeli establishment has traditionally feared the 
theater it uses security considerations to cloak the political 
considerations laor said in an interview 
despite the lifting of formal censorship pressure could still 
be exerted through how theaters are financed israeli theaters rely 
on grants from city hall and the education ministry as well as 
managements that in times of economic recession are more 
interested in popular plays 
tom levy a director and head of tel aviv universitys theater 
department said the suspension of theater censorship was easy for 
parliament because plays were increasingly nonpolitical 
the israeli public doesnt want to hear about the palestinian 
issue he said adding the recent success of imported productions 
such as les miserables and cabaret was proof of theater 
being used as an emotional sleeping pill 
in movies justman indicated the board which reviews about 250 
films a year would not slacken its censorship of extreme violence 
and sex but he said only about four movies a year were prohibited 
and we never ban a film for politics 
in the most recent case the board banned martin scorseses 
the last temptation of christ citing a law that prohibits 
practices offensive to religious beliefs the supreme court 
overturned the decision saying the film was unlikely to offend or 
arouse those who chose to see it 
vershuvski said many lawmakers who voted to end theater 
censorship would not agree to lift film censorship because movies 
reached a much larger audience and had a big impact on youth 
he urges the use of a rating system which justman said would be 
inadequate and new legislation that would require extremely 
violent or pornographic films to be shown in special movie houses 
trying to ban such movies is pointless he said since most are 
available on video cassettes 
parliament also set up a subcommittee to examine the role of the 
military censor who is supposed to oversee newspapers books and 
broadcast media for leaks that endanger state security 
yossi sarid a liberal member of parliament said reform was 
needed because censorship had been inappropriately used by the 
government for nonsecurity reasons and sidestepped by foreign 
journalists who did not submit stories for advanced review 
censorship is one of those things we cant live with or 
without he said on the one hand it harms principles that are 
dear to us but on the other hand our security situation requires 
it this is the thin rope we have to walk on

prison is a mean and ugly place life is 
defined by roll call and steel bars and as singer james taylor 
put it time is measured by a clock with no hands 
but for baptist preacher gary sims the ohio director for prison 
fellowship ministries the states nine juvenile and 21 adult 
prisons are fertile ground 
if you look for bad you find bad said sims 35 who 
prefers the title chaplain to reverend i think mother teresa was 
asked mother teresa why are you still in the streets and 
she said when i see people on the street i see christ 
when i look sims said i see christ in those people 
regardless if that persons in for rape murder whatever the 
situation may be i think that there is a seed in every person that 
demonstrates the love of god and that person has the potential of 
being changed im not saying that he will change that he will 
choose to change but there is always that possibility 
sims an intense and quiet man is no naive dogooder he knows 
that three of every four inmates he sees likely will do time again 
that drugs poverty poor education and despair create a vicious 
cycle that few can break 
its unrealistic to think that the ratio of your having an 
effect would be 85 percent maybe 2 or 3 percent and sometimes 
you may not see a person make any positive change in maybe three 
years but youre planting seeds and someone will come along and 
water that seed he said 
sims came to ohios prisons in a roundabout manner after 
obtaining a masters degree in education and special education from 
duquesne university in pittsburgh and spending several years 
teaching school his call to the ministry took him to the 
pittsburgh theological seminary and later back to duquesne he 
planned to become a hospital chaplain 
he put in a years internship in clinical pastoral education but 
couldnt find a hospital job that opened this door here to be a 
chaplain at the orient ohio correctional institution he said 
after a year as a statepaid chaplain at orient and 2 years at 
the ohio correctional reception center sims on july 31 was named 
to head the ohio office of the privately financed prison fellowship 
ministries the interdenominational program was founded by 
watergate figure charles w colson in 1976 and is now active in 550 
federal and state institutions 
for lack of a better term one has to be bilingual sims 
said i say bilingual in the sense that it is a different 
culture it is a different world it is just like going into an 
area of missionary work people go into different countries south 
america the middle east africa yet theres missionary work 
right here in america 
the work with its 14hour days sob stories that must be taken 
with a grain of salt and burden of bearing additional bad news to 
people whose lives are bounded by bars is hard 
sims said that to the best of his knowledge no state or federal 
money is spent on his program which has a 1990 budget of 120000 
and is financed largely through private donations he plans to open 
a cleveland regional office then regional offices for each corner 
of the state and in columbus 
sims said he had never been imprisoned but he is not a stranger 
to the personal effects of crime his home has been burglarized 
his truck stolen and someone tried to break into his car he said 
you definitely feel violated you feel angry and i think as a 
parent you think more of your familys safety than anything he 
said 
but he is not interested in seeing the culprits imprisoned 
simply for the sake of punishment 
i think that the principle of prison fellowship is restorative 
justice not that the person go to jail and the state gets paid 
but as a victim i get paid he said 
let that person do some community work so that the person 
can understand hey youve offended someone youve violated 
someone and the reason why youre doing this type of work is to 
pay a debt to society in a meaningful way 
sims described his job as attacking the vicious circle of 
prison parole and back to prison in a manner consistent with what 
he believes god planned 
whatever he chooses for me to do i will do it sims said 
gary didnt want to be in prison ministry i wanted to be a 
hospital chaplain but god said no thats not where i want you 
now this is where ive called you to be

john wrote three plays she said his wife gena rowlands 
did one jon voight did one peter and i did one it was a serious 
play about a marriage it wasnt like whos afraid of virginia 
woolf peter wasnt meek in this the character was pretty 
obnoxious she wanted to be a singer or dancer or something at the 
end the stage goes black and you dont know if she committed 
suicide or he killed her when the curtain came up i was a lump on 
the floor 
there is no recognition between them in columbo of course

drunk peter kept asking you sure you werent drunk i said it

me and changed the part now she has a line in the pilot id 
shoot him with a stun gun and strap him to the hood of my car

can quickly reach staggering heights often the outlays cant be 
predicted or planned for the way something like a childs college 
tuition can 
a patchwork of government and private health insurance programs 
provides a cushion for some parts of the population while leaving 
others largely unprotected 
meanwhile the cost the united states is paying as a society for 
health care keeps climbing consuming a greater and greater share 
of its means to pay 
all this adds up to a prescription for change quite possibly 
drastic change in the 1990s say the analysts who make up the 
health care group in the research department of painewebber inc 
the large wall street firm 
in fact they contend in the next few years americans could 
well find themselves moving toward a national health program along 
the lines of those operated in britain and canada 
the two primary factors driving this change will be the need 
to rein in the systems cost on the one hand and the need to 
broaden its access on the other says david lothson leader of 
the painewebber group 
these two objectives are obviously in conflict unless radical 
changes are made in the health care system as we now know it 
as he presented his argument to a gathering of investment 
managers early this week lothson conceded that a national health 
system would be a tough idea to sell politically opposed by 
powerful interest groups and mistrusted by a significant part of 
the general public 
its a hot potato no one wants to hold he said 
but before too many years have passed he says it is likely to 
gain more and more attention as an answer to cost and equity 
problems that will keep getting worse as long as they are left 
unresolved 
what form might such a setup take the basics lothson suggests 
would include standard physician and hospital services available to 
all other likely candidates would be prescription drugs for the 
elderly and treatments such as kidney dialysis 
depending on what the nation wants and what congress finds 
politically possible other possibilities could include longterm 
care dental and ophthalmic work psychiatric hospital services and 
drugs prescribed for patients under the age of 65 
the whole idea would seem to fly in the face of recent trends in 
this country toward increased reliance on the private sector and 
less emphasis on government programs 
certainly creation of a vast new government apparatus faces 
formidable obstacles at a time of chronic budget deficits the 
cost one might fear could be horrendous 
lothson concedes the validity or at least the emotional force 
of most of these objections however he says we are already 
spending oceans of money on health care 12 percent of the 
economys gross output now headed up to as much as 19 percent by 
the year 2000 
a fundamental problem with the us health care system is that 
it is in effect not a system at all he observes 
the evidence from other countries that have tried it he adds 
strongly testifies that health care systems dominated by 
government payers cost less 
whatever the merits and drawbacks of a national plan he adds 
doing nothing to change the current system is not an appealing 
alternative 
if growth of spending is not brought under control he says 
it will lower the nations world competitive position and its 
standard of living in the next decade

carl hofmann has lost house work wife and 
son 
when a person gets down low its hard to get your feet back 
above water said hofmann 49 who suffers from depression and 
stays in a catholic social services residence for people who are 
homeless and mentally ill 
then he met social security field representative james keeler 
who helped him apply for federal disability benefits 
he took a lot of time with me i really appreciated that 
hofmann and others like him are benefiting from a renewed effort 
by the social security administration to reach the homeless the 
orders came in april thencommissioner dorcas r hardy fighting 
to keep her job directed employees to work more closely with 
community and religious groups serving the homeless 
gwendolyn s king sworn in aug 1 as hardys successor has 
said she wants to expand programs to find homeless and needy people 
who may not realize they are entitled to social security or 
supplemental security income benefits 
advocates for the homeless say the initiative is sorely needed 
but contend that at the same time social security has turned its 
back on a program that could bring more homeless people into the 
system 
part of the problem is that homeless people have no permanent 
addresses and may have physical or mental problems that hinder 
dealings with bureaucracy 
a lot of the homeless people do not trust social service 
agencies and in particular the federal government said gary 
van scoy assistant executive director for catholic social services 
in scranton even though it might provide them a permanent source 
of income it takes a lot of convincing 
many social security offices around the country have heeded 
hardys call 
in baltimore a field representative roams streets to persuade 
homeless people to apply for benefits even taking applications on 
park benches 
in omaha neb social security and the eastern nebraska agency 
on aging set up a seminar to help community organizations identify 
eligible people 
in chula vista calif social security joined with other 
social service providers to help people cope with the closing of 
mobilehome parks due to land development those people were 
really faced with homelessness said pamela b smith district 
manager they had nowhere to go and no one to help them 
homeless coordinators have been appointed in all 151 field 
offices in pennsylvania maryland delaware virginia west 
virginia and the district of columbia said dennis r conroy 
external affairs officer in philadelphia 
at a recent help the homeless seminar in scranton about 60 
social workers housing officials and others learned about social 
security programs as well as training mental health drug abuse 
and housing programs available under the stewart b mckinney 
homeless assistance act 
the majority of homeless people especially in cities tend to 
be men in their 20s to 30s conroy said social security mostly 
gets involved with those who are disabled although it also can 
help the elderly who become homeless because they dont have 
enough money to stay in a home 
supplemental security income is a federal program run by social 
security for the needy aged blind and disabled but paid from 
income taxes the basic ssi payment is 368 a month for an 
individual or 553 for a couple 
all states but arkansas georgia kansas mississippi 
tennessee texas and west virginia provide an optional supplement 
ssi eligibility also makes a person eligible for medical assistance 
in all but connecticut hawaii illinois indiana ohio oklahoma 
minnesota missouri nebraska new hampshire north carolina north 
dakota and virginia 
that to me is more valuable than the money said marion 
christmas 53 a homeless philadelphia man on ssi disability who 
has gotten payments since he was set afire nov 10 1985 while 
asleep at a church construction site in columbia sc he was 
severely burned and lost his left forearm 
hofmann in scranton expects to hear within three to six months 
whether he will get disability benefits this is my fight to get 
back on top i really believe im going to get it 
disability decisions average 78 days on initial claims conroy 
said the first level of appeal takes an average 60 more days the 
next stage a decision by a social security administrative law 
judge takes an additional 210 days 
i dont know anybody who got it the first time around said 
sister josephine mcgrory of mercy hospice a philadelphia 
residential program for mentally ill homeless women social 
security needs people who can come on short notice to the homeless 
to do medical or psychological exams she said 
it is a big problem getting doctors to respond to requests 
said dolores jefferson an advocate in philadelphia for the 
pennsylvania department of public welfares disability advocacy 
program 
were talking about some rather bad areas said mary 
coleman a supervisor in the advocacy program we may be talking 
about doctors having to do the interview on the street most 
doctors arent willing to do it 
social security also has had 17000 employees dropped over the 
past five years homeless advocates say greater reliance on 
telephoned claims limit the facetoface contact that might make or 
break their eligibility determination 
it sounds nice to write a memo exhorting social security to 
make a special effort for the homeless but it doesnt necessarily 
result in any action said maria foscarinis director of the 
washingtonbased national law center on homelessness and poverty 
in fact hardys april memo followed one in march 1988 urging 
repeal of a program to help the homeless department of health and 
human services staffers warned in other memos against pushing for 
repeal during an election year the law center obtained the memos 
under the freedom of information act 
the program which has not been implemented was authorized by 
congress in 1987 to help state and local governments set up teams 
to identify homeless people potentially eligible for social 
security benefits 
since obtaining the memos in august the center has gotten 
only a pro forma response which says the social security 
administration has no intention of enforcing the program but that 
theyre undertaking a whole series of other initiatives for the 
homeless ms foscarinis said 
complicating the picture is debate on whether drug addiction or 
alcoholism should be grounds for disability ssa has contended it 
could only be grounds in combination with another factor such as 
organ damage 
but the 3rd us circuit court ruled in 1983 and again in 1985 
that alcoholism alone could be a compensable injury us district 
court judge john b hannum ruled in august that social security 
systematically continuously willfully and almost scornfully 
ignored the earlier rulings 
hannum ordered health and human services secretary louis w 
sullivan to reopen all disability claims denied since 1983 in 
pennsylvania new jersey delaware and the virgin islands and to 
reevaluate them on the basis that alcoholism alone could be a 
compensable injury ssa has appealed 
meanwhile education efforts like the program in scranton will 
continue conroy said social security offices are compiling a 
directory of agencies that provide services to the homeless and are 
preparing audio tapes that can be used in shelters and residences 
to explain available services the agency also has tried to 
streamline its application process and improved computer systems 
nonetheless he said i dont see this as a shortterm type of 
thing

sixtynineyearold jeannie sits in a corner of 
a public restroom where she spends her days perched on a garbage 
bag of belongings 
today her concern is her towel i wasted two hours this 
morning looking for that towel i looked through that bag 10 
times 
did you look on the side sometimes things fall on the side 
and you cant see it said patricia betch kneeling on the cement 
floor 
betch a social security field representative has been trying 
since spring to persuade the thin woman with fluffy white hair to 
apply for benefits 
jeannie digresses worried about the dead bird she found while 
sleeping in the doorway of broadway market in the historic fells 
point district 
i think people leave their windows open a little bit i think 
they fly into some peoples windows at night to sleep jeannie 
said 
thats what youd like to do isnt it jeannie asked kathy 
lorenzo a psychiatric outreach worker for health care for the 
homeless and betchs partner why dont you let me find you a 
room 
jeannie refuses politely 
lorenzo and betch leave and jeannie shouts a thank you for the 
gifts she had avowed no need for peanut butterandjelly 
sandwiches shirts a jacket 
you have to work so hard with these people to win their trust 
jeannie is afraid shes signing admission papers for a mental 
hospital betch said 
the social security administration has hit the streets in 
baltimore seeking homeless people in alleys restrooms and parks 
under a new directive to reach out to the homeless its the only 
ssa office with such a program 
lorenzo called betch last spring to ask her to take an 
application from a homeless person who wouldnt go into a building 
the two became a team making their rounds each wednesday 
distributing sandwiches clothing and friendship 
i decided to go out there because the need was so great 
something had to be done here betch said noting that 46 percent 
of marylands 4220 homeless live in baltimore statewide 2200 
shelter and transitional housing beds are available leaving half 
without a roof over their head at night 
theyre really afraid to go into any building theyve been 
out on the street so long that thats more relaxing to them 
betch set up an advisory board of officials from 18 agencies 
including shelters soup kitchens legal aid and the mayors 
office office hours are at the baltimore rescue mission on 
wednesday evenings so people can find her 
mayor kurt schmoke wants a state worker to accompany lorenzo and 
betch many people who arent eligible for social security will 
qualify for welfare 
if lorenzo can persuade the homeless to visit her clinic and a 
psychiatrist judges them unable to hold a job for at least a year 
they qualify for 368 in supplemental security income plus free 
medical care conditions that qualify include alcoholism mental 
illness drug addiction and physical disabilities 
its hard to prove a disability if you have no medical 
records betch said im not a medical professional but i can 
tell theyre sick 
many are old enough to get social security retirement benefits 
requiring only proof of age and an address but many refuse to 
apply 
since april betch has persuaded nine people to apply for 
benefits a figure she considers good theyll take a sandwich 
from you theyll bid you good day but until they know you 
they have to want to file 
six were denied and must reapply she said 
walter is one of those betch is trying to convince a gentle man 
with bright brown eyes at 62 he qualifies for retirement benefits 
but he wont leave a squareblock area that includes the baltimore 
rescue mission and the park square where he and about 10 other men 
spend the day on benches 
since they began making their rounds in april betch said some 
shelters and soup kitchens have agreed to be mailing addresses 
many agencies dont want to attract hoodlums and drug addicts who 
prey on social security recipients and wont allow checks to be 
mailed to them but with an address a homeless person can receive 
the check and open a direct deposit account at a bank 
as they part for the day lorenzo is plotting where she can find 
a room for jeannie for the winter betch says a congressional aide 
has jeannies power of attorney maybe the aide can sign the 
application form 
id hate to find her frozen to death lorenzo said when 
youre out on the street thats your last bid you either go up 
or you die

peacemaker is the role archbishop john l may of 
st louis envisioned for himself three years ago when he became 
president of the national conference of catholic bishops 
no wonder in the fall of 1986 his predecessor bishop james 
malone of youngstown ohio was warning of a growing and 
dangerous disaffection of american catholics from the holy see 
and the bishops were in uproar over action taken against seattles 
liberal archbishop raymond hunthausen 
as may prepares to leave office next week he says he wants to 
be remembered for helping develop a very strong understanding 
between the 53 millionmember roman catholic church in the united 
states and the vatican 
there is a real growing understanding of american culture 
american ways american experiences may said in an interview 
that helps us greatly that we dont waste our time in this 
perceived difference perceived dissension 
the lowkey leadership exerted by the 67yearold may is 
credited in part for the new period of good will hunthausen who 
was stripped of some of his powers for opening churches to 
homosexual worshipers and dispensing general absolution of sin to 
large groups has regained control of his archdiocese and the 
vatican has been generous in its praise of us seminaries and 
religious orders 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati vice president of 
the bishops conference said may is unflappable always 
proceeding along and getting it done 
the rev thomas j reese of woodstock theological center at 
georgetown university in washington dc said mays 
nonthreatening style was particularly helpful in vatican 
relations 
hes a quiet selfeffacing kind of a guy that kind of a 
personality was very useful in dealing with rome said reese 
author of archbishop inside the power structure of the american 
catholic church 
may credits much of the reduced tension to a series of meetings 
between us church leaders and vatican officials and pope john 
paul iis visit to the united states in 1987 
what particularly impressed the pope on his us visit may 
said was the growing hispanic presence in the church and the 
religious vitality displayed at an ecumenical meeting with 
fundamentalists evangelicals and other protestant religious 
leaders in columbia sc 
the experience there eclipsed anything hes ever had in 
ecumenical meetings may said he couldnt believe it 
may began his priesthood in 1947 as an assistant pastor of a 
chicago parish he became auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of 
chicago in 1967 and was appointed bishop of the diocese of mobile 
ala in 1969 he was installed as archbishop of the archdiocese of 
st louis in 1980 
along with helping improve relations with the vatican the 
moderate may also won praise for his ability to work with liberal 
and conservative camps in the bishops conference 
he was someone who didnt have kind of a platform didnt have 
his own agenda he wanted to push reese said he was as much a 
follower as a leader 
malone said may works with a quiet confidence 
i think he has been able to bring during his time a sure 
leadership i think he stood at the center with an opening to the 
left malone said 
when a statement on aids from the bishops administrative board 
came under fire for giving conditional approval to condom education 
in public schools may agreed to have another committee of bishops 
develop a second statement that statement which goes before the 
conference at its fall meeting next week makes no mention of 
condoms but may insists the aids position we took previously is 
still intact and has not been withdrawn 
when the rev george a stallings jr formed a separate 
congregation for black catholics in washington earlier this year 
may acknowledged elements of racism in the church and told the 
nations estimated 2 million black catholics we need to 
recognize more black leadership our liturgies need more of the 
vibrancy and our policies more of the insight of african 
americans 
as the abortion debate has heated up the catholic church has 
come under renewed criticism for its teachings but may said the 
bishops had no intention of backing down on their stance that an 
unborn child cannot be killed for any purpose 
first of all we believe that is our right as citizens of this 
country and to be teachers of the gospel to enter into these 
discussions may said 
the right to participate in public debate without imposing 
morality on others is the american concept he said

religious leaders attending a recent seminar on 
health issues were urged to focus attention on the social problems 
that keep blacks hispanics and other minorities from seeking 
health care 
in this country we find a pronounced and stubborn disparity 
between the health status of minority americans and the rest of 
us said dr james mason assistant secretary of the department 
of health and human services that disparity stands today as an 
affront to american ideals 
former us surgeon general c everett koop said churches must 
work harder at their spiritual mission to be a compassionate buffer 
between society and the sick but unwanted compassion for aids 
victims tops the list he said 
the american people may not be inclined to be compassionate 
he said we have to break down barriers until we do that

the audience rose to its feet as 
passionate russian voices belted out god bless america the 
cold war seemed to thaw in the warmth of the accompanying 
balalaikas 
the red army has invaded the united states this year but the 
weapons are song and dance for the first time since it was formed 
61 years ago the red army song and dance ensemble is performing 
for us audiences 
it took us too long to reach your country a great country 
said ballet dancer nikita tarasov who recently performed with 
other members of her group at the memorial coliseum our show 
will show your people that our two countries can cooperate not 
just the soviet people but the soviet army we can show your 
people that we are peaceful to say to americans that nobody needs 
war 
the 200member ensemble known as the red army chorus includes 
red army members former army members and some civilians 
the groups performance began with the 90member male chorus 
dressed in military uniforms singing the national anthems of both 
countries the orchestra included balalaikas and other traditional 
folk instruments 
what followed was a succession of folk songs russian classical 
music and colorful energetic dance numbers in cossacks cavalry 
dance the performers waved sabers above their heads as they 
danced across the small stage later they performed the spirited 
high leg kicks spins and other gravitydefying moves associated 
with russian folk dance 
near the end soloist barseg tumanyan sang ive got plenty of 
nothin from porgy and bess 
in some of the more enthusiastic songs a member of the chorus 
or the band broke out in a frenzied whistle that brought cheers 
from the audience 
the language of music and ballet is universal the 
ensembles director col anatoly maltzev said through an 
interpreter in an interview 
the people the audiences have been very warm said 
tumanyan who was a member of the ensemble in 198485 and is 
performing on the us tour as a guest the last concert in 
spokane wash was fantastic you could feel it immediately 
tumanyan who has performed with several us opera companies 
said talented singers dancers and musicians can perform in the 
ensemble instead of joining the regular army in the soviet union 
all men must serve two years in the armed forces 
of course this is the best place for them to serve he said 
i dont know how to shoot a gun so i served here it was 
wonderful 
although the ensemble has performed in 40 countries political 
realities and international conflicts have prevented it from coming 
to the united states 
we were going to come to the united states in 1939 maltzev 
said the ensemble was already in london on the way to the united 
states but the world war broke out 
after that the tense relations between the two countries 
prevented a rescheduling of the visit this is the first time a 
military band from the soviet union has come to the united states 
the last year or two the relations between our countries have 
improved and thats probably one of the reasons were here 
maltzev said i would like to stress that its not only relations 
between the two governments but it is also at the military level 
we played with a us military band in seattle and spokane 
that speaks for itself 
tarasov who describes himself as just a soldier had never 
been to the united states before but he speaks fluent english 
he has no doubt why the tour is finally taking place 
its because of perestroika because of the home and foreign 
policy of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev tarasov said its 
a great thing 
portland was the 15th stop on a 31city north american tour 
most of the previous shows have been in canada although the 
ensemble performed in new york chicago milwaukee and minneapolis 
before coming to the northwest 
most of the grueling journey is being made by bus the group 
performed on a tuesday in seattle then traveled 280 miles across 
washington for a show in spokane on wednesday night and 350 miles 
to portland for a thursday night performance 
we are tired all of us tarasov said its too hard 
from portland the group headed across the rockies to colorado 
from there they go to arizona and california before returning to 
the east for performances nov 1619 at the wang center in boston 
and nov 2026 at the kennedy center for performing arts in 
washington 
critics have called the show oldfashioned some have said the 
dancers are far below the level of other soviet performers such as 
the kirov ballet and bolshoi ballet but american audiences have 
loved what theyve seen giving the group standing ovations at 
every show 
the ensemble members say their trip to the united states is more 
than just another tour 
we think that its important not just for our two countries 
but for the whole world maltzev said

they are among lifes extras parks and 
flowers the beach or golf course on a summer afternoon but in one 
county such luxuries could end up casualties of the drug war 
fighting cocaine and other drug abuse is gobbling up more and 
more local dollars nationwide delaying purchases in some 
communities shifting funds in others and threatening everything 
from governmentsupported leisure spots to pothole patching in 
places such as milwaukee county 
the impacts of cocaine are so devastating that theyre ripping 
apart our entire county government said milwaukee county 
executive david schulz 
more must be spent now for social workers jail space and staff 
he said and that is forcing him to propose higher taxes fewer 
amenities and costlier services in the 1990 budget 
of the 9135 million proposal more than 100 million is for 
continuing and new programs for drug and alcohol abuse which 
schulz calls the single most driving force in his budget 
it permeates the entire fabric of the community said sylvan 
leabman county fiscal and budget administrator 
if the budget is adopted on nov 14 it will take longer for 
the county to complete highway maintenance he said the grass 
wont be mowed as often the flowers wont be as nice services 
wont be as extensive things will cost more the waiting lines 
will be longer 
if you spend 1 million more at our prison thats 1 million 
you dont have to spend on quality of life services leabman 
added its a tradeoff in this particular budget the tradeoff 
appears to be very stark 
schulz has proposed three pools be closed six bus routes a law 
library and lifeguards at two lake michigan beaches be eliminated 
golf marina stadium parking and other fees be raised staff cuts 
be made at the parks museum and zoo and some people be charged for 
paramedic services 
its very difficult said brigid sullivan head of the 
parks recreation and culture department there are personal as 
well as communitywide impacts 
the proposal has come under attack with residents criticizing 
schulz at two public hearings and some elected officials arguing 
that the plan demands too much of the county in fighting drugs 
indeed competition for dollars is more intense here than elsewhere 
because the county runs services such as the museum and zoo often 
operated by cities 
but schulz said every city in the country faces the same 
basic dilemma 
this is not unlike a guns and butter issue said james 
fyfe justice professor at american university in washington dc 
the old political credo is you cant have both if youre going 
to fight a domestic war you have to give up a lot of programs and 
services people are accustomed to you cant put cops out to direct 
traffic when three blocks down the road people are selling crack 
many communities face competing pressures for example 
in alexandria va mayor james moran said the drug problem 
affects your ability to respond to other community needs it 
hampers us severely id like to improve our education curriculum 
purchase more open space build a library improve our public 
transportation 
and yet our foremost emphasis almost to the distraction of 
everything else had been dealing with drugs he said noting the 
police budget has moved from the fifth to secondhighest 
expenditure in three years only education is higher 
in hennepin county minn home of minneapolis child welfare 
placement costs largely tied to parents cocaine and crack abuse 
rose from 21 million in 1987 to a projected 30 million in 1990 
a 45 percent increase officials say 
theres no question were going to have to cut less acute 
programs said county board chairman jeff spartz day care and 
mental health programs could be scaled back because he said 
strict levy limitations bind the county 
in california state attorney general john van de kamp has 
proposed in his gubernatorial campaign platform an antidrug 
superfund to be approved in a referendum that would distribute 
17 billion over eight years 
in jackson county mo which includes part of kansas city 
voters will be asked tuesday to approve a sales tax of a quarter of 
1 percent to be used strictly to fight drugs through enforcement 
rehabilitation and prevention 
it gives us an opportunity to fight back to do something 
aggressive said prosecutor albert riederer who said the tax 
would be collected for seven years generating about 14 million 
annually 
milwaukee county officials are seeking a 159 percent increase 
in the property tax rate and a 05 percent sales tax expected to 
raise about 49 million about a quarter o that is directly due to 
drugs or alcohol schulz said 
substance abuse causes us problems in corrections causes us 
to spend money in courts law enforcement and in child 
abuse child neglect and cocaine babies schulz said its 
really the indirect effects 
milwaukees murder rate topped 100 by the end of october 
surpassing 1987s yearlong record of 95 in 1988 51 percent of 
murder victims tested positive for cocaine 
and the house of corrections population those imprisoned for a 
year or less jumped from 850 to more than 1300 in two years 
schulz says up to twothirds are substance abusers 
schulz wants to build a dormitory for that increasing 
population ground also is being broken for a new jail to hold 
inmates awaiting trial and he is seeking to add more than 100 
workers in corrections and social services 
child abuse and neglect referrals have tripled in the last 5 
years officials say again drugs play a big role 
despite the serious situation county board supervisor thomas 
meaux said its totally unrealistic to expect the means of 
county government to solve the drug problem he accused schulz of 
using it as a convenient excuse to justify his budget 
traditionally the viewpoint is were the government of last 
resort meaux said this is one time we cant afford to accept 
that posture we ought not to be stripping quality of life 
programs 
officials hope for help from federal antidrug allocations but 
no one knows yet how much may reach milwaukee county were doing 
all our homework so we can utilize that money to the best of our 
ability said pat mueller an aide to schulz 
meanwhile said schulz its a balancing act 
the county must not cut so much that it sacrifices investment 
in our future 
but he added youve got to feed the people in the house of 
corrections youve got to run the courts you dont have to 
operate the parks the museum and the zoo and subsidize the 
performing arts 
no ones happy about it said leabman the budget 
administrator its a very very tough price

are neon lights windows to the soul can 
billboards evoke the renaissance 
imagine shampoo ads hanging in the louvre newspaper headlines 
in the national gallery television sets at the metropolitan museum 
of art 
advertising and art soup cans and the mona lisa billboards and 
michelangelo cable and cubists 
visual images magazines television film have forced 
artists to acknowledge the enormous volume of information 
transmitted each day and incorporate it in their work 
from nov 9 through feb 18 the whitney museum of american art 
will present image world art and media culture a wideranging 
exhibit of art and artifacts from the past 30 years including 
posters magazine montages and a stamp machine 
in a world where everything even art is for sale image 
world shows how commerce can be turned into art so get ready to 
appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the fiveday forecast gaze at 
lovingly drawn portraits of surveillance cameras and analyze 
electronic transfers of elvis 
theres no way walking through the streets of new york one can 
avoid this visual culture of these popular images said john g 
hanhardt the whitney curator who organized the show you cant 
even avoid television if you dont watch it it influences the way 
people dress what they buy how they talk 
in the last 300 years has anyone made a greater impact on art 
than volney b palmer who why the founder of the first 
advertising agency of course back in 1841 what about william 
henry fox talbot who that same year patented the calotype a paper 
negative capable of producing multiple copies 
and dont forget earnest elmo colkins who in 1890 promoted the 
concept of art direction in advertisements or walter dill scott 
author of the 1908 book the psychology of advertising which 
urged the incorporation of emotional and motivational techniques 
into the selling of products 
starting in the late 1950s nam june paik andy warhol james 
rosenquist roy lichtenstein and other artists attacked the 
onslaught of product and imagery taking recognizable objects and 
placing them within the structure of the art world that meant 
glossy portraits of cigarette ads a television set coated in 
cement or a lifesize porcelain sculpture of michael jackson and his 
chimpanzee 
the show kind of tracks that response said guest curator 
marvin heiferman you get a warhol and wonder if its critical or 
celebratory you have a picture of an electric chair or elvis 
presley is he the king or some tragic heroic figure theres an 
enthusiasm and brashness which you didnt see before 
media began creeping into art around 1912 when braque and 
picasso used newspaper bits in their cubist collages a few years 
later marcel duchamp began appropriating actual consumer objects 
such as a paint advertisement into his art 
the works of berlin dadaists john heartfield and raoul hausmann 
consisted entirely of images cut from newspapers and magazines 
surrealist salvador dali directed segments of hollywood movies 
appeared in commercial advertisements and created dalis dream 
house specially for the 1939 worlds fair 
also in 1939 hollywoods most artistic and productive year ever 
headlined by gone with the wind an essay by art critic clement 
greenberg avantgarde and kitsch warned that synthetic art 
had become an integral part of our productive system in a way in 
which true culture could never be and that its enormous 
profits are a source of temptation to the avantgarde itself 
with the proliferation of television after world war ii cereal 
and toothpaste were being beamed into millions of homes every day 
philip morris cigarettes were smoked on i love lucy quality 
theater was presented by general electric and john cameron swayze 
was host for the camel news caravan 
pop art was the response an attempt to inject truth in 
advertising it was created ironically by artists who had once 
worked in the advertising world warhol designed shoe posters 
rosenquist painted billboards in times square 
i was struck by the numbness i felt by painting images like 
huge noses and huge eyes rosenquist recalled 
eyes three feet wide noses 10 feet long very large imagery 
i couldnt focus on the image although i was mixing the color 
accurately i made paintings where i placed objects in the picture 
plane in different scales and where the largest and closest image 
would be the most difficult to identify 
movies were big when paik was growing up in korea and shirley 
temple was the most famous person in his country in 1937 he saw 
television for the first time in the early 1950s and was working on 
electronic music a decade later in cologne west germany when the 
idiot box inspired a stroke of genius 
i was at an impasse a dead end the artist recalled so i 
thought i would rather create electronic pictures than electronic 
music there were electronic music composers but no electronic 
picture composers 
i bought 13 old tv sets in germany and changed the insides of 
them then i showed them in german galleries and got a very big 
reception 
technology its everywhere and pop artists consumed it thanks 
to the portable movie camera one didnt have to be a hollywood 
director to make movies thanks to the silkscreen a picture could 
be lifted off a newspaper and duplicated on canvas 
anything can now be turned into art manhole covers toilets 
subway signs at the image world exhibit even the ticket booth 
cant be trusted dennis adams best known for his designs of bus 
shelters has put together a special construction 
its the idea of a ticket booth using images of homelessness 
instead he said there are photographic images that create the 
walls of the ticket booth large photographic images and youll 
be paying through the slot in the photograph 
i love those structures they bring capitalism to its most 
basic level a small window with money being exchanged 
with originals by warhol and rosenquist now worth millions of 
dollars adams sees his work as returning to the very idea of pop 
making art accessible to the public using everyday objects and 
presenting them in a different way 
very simply my work deals with the idea of taking a 
functional structure that everyone recognizes and using that as a 
kind of instrument for getting to another agenda adams said 
the functional element is just a kind of decoy a way of making a 
viewer feel comfortable 
in an age of jumbotrons space shuttles and photo opportunities 
the possibilities for art are limitless rosenquist talked of 
projects involving electronic nymphs in space and particles of 
nuclear ashes 
it may all seem literally a million miles away from the 
sistine chapel but rosenquist insists art and communication have 
always been linked 
you go back to the gossip of the renaissance paintings he 
said later on printing started and handinhand with art 
communication changed

judith krantz whose five bestselling novels 
became miniseries says the essential element for success is 
creating strong female characters 
till we meet again which will be telecast in two parts on 
cbs sunday and tuesday has three strong women who come through 
heroically 
krantz emphasizes the women in her books are female heroes 
not heroines 
the term heroine it seems to me implies something 
victorian she said it brings up an image of a woman who 
faints in the heros arms 
she emphasizes that her books are peopled with strong men as 
well 
i cant forget the men because without the men the women 
wouldnt lead interesting lives krantz said but the women are 
the focus of my books i feel i understand men and can write about 
them the essential element that is the heart of my books is strong 
women who succeed at an enterprise i couldnt possibly write a 
book without strong women 
till we meet again stars courtney cox mia sara and lucy 
gutteridge as the women of resilience and fortitude it also stars 
michael york bruce boxleitner barry bostwick hugh grant charles 
shaughnessy maxwell caulfield john vickery denis arndt and 
juliet mills 
the family saga spans the period from before world war i to 
after world war ii and is set in france england and the united 
states 
eve lucy gutteridge becomes a star of the paris music halls 
entertains troops at the front and marries a diplomat who is heir 
to one of frances great champagne dynasties 
daughter delphine mia sara becomes a major international movie 
star daughter freddy courtney cox becomes a hollywood stunt 
pilot and in world war ii ferries planes to the royal air force 
krantzs first book was scruples which cbs telecast in 
1980 it inspired a sequel movie on abc the next year that was a 
series pilot it was followed by princess daisy mistrals 
daughter and ill take manhattan 
krantz who was born in new york was a magazine writer and 
fashion editor before her husband encouraged her to write 
scruples in her books she has used that background plus her 
years living in paris to conjure up worlds of glamour and 
excitement 
she wrote her first four books on a battered electric portable 
typewriter till we meet again was the first book she wrote on 
a word processor she is careful to back up her work on memory 
disks and also make a printout of everything regularly now she 
says she could never work on a typewriter again 
i work at home in old clothes she said i get very 
comfortable and i pile on sweaters when things are going well i 
can do five pages a day writing is a lot like being an athlete 
you have winning streaks you have slumps and every day you start 
anew 
i havent had a losing streak but ive had slumps in the 
course of writing a book ill have periods of pulling my hair over 
how to write a scene then suddenly ill see it and write it in 
two days i can always tell when im writing well i start warming 
up and have to peel off my sweaters 
krantz acknowledging some superstition said she doesnt like 
to analyze why shes had five hits in a row 
i feel im like a typical reader and i write to please 
myself she said i never allow anyone except my husband to see 
a book until its completely finished 
the authors husband steve krantz produced the till we meet 
again miniseries which was adapted by andrew peter marin and 
directed by charles jarrott 
her husband is a motion picture and television producer whos 
written two novels on his own 
a miniseries is a collaborative effort she said with a 
book its just me nobody tells me what to write or how to write i 
submit an outline to my publisher but then i may change it because 
new things occur to you as you write when its adapted as a 
miniseries i read the script very carefully if theres anything i 
dont think is right i let them know 
i also have a hand in the casting an actor may be cast who 
gives a character a different look an actor always personalizes a 
role and makes it his own that can change the way i visualized a 
character my husband makes an enormous effort to stay true to the 
spirit of my books

some owners of a popular water cleaning

added a harmful chemical to drinking water the federal trade 
commission said 
the agency said tuesday that consumers who bought the norelco 
clean water machine and replacement filters for them are eligible 
for a full refund under a recent settlement agreement reached with 
the manufacturer 
the commission last year charged norelco with false advertising 
in its claims that the clean water machine removed harmful 
chemicals from drinking water because the unit actually added 
methylene chloride a potentially hazardous chemical into water 
passing through the machine 
the commission said methylene chloride a volatile organic 
industrial solvent was used to glue together filters for the 
machines that were marketed from 1982 to 1986 as water passed 
through the machines the methylene chloride leached into the water 
the agency said

shearson lehman hutton inc is calling for 
increasing the amount of borrowed money needed to buy stockindex 
futures in an effort to curb computerized program trading which is 
being blamed for market turmoil 
shearson the nations secondlargest retail brokerage called 
for the reform tuesday after joining an exodus of big wall street 
firms by abandoning index arbitrage trading for clients 
it has become increasingly clear since the afternoon of oct 
13 that volatility is damaging the fianancial markets and the 
ability of corporate america to raise capital efficiently 
shearson said in a statement 
the dow jones industrial average plunged more than 190 points in 
a few hours on oct 13 many market professionals blamed the 
rapidity of the decline on computerized program trading strategies 
meanwhile tuesday john j phelan jr the chairman of the new 
york stock exchange said the exchange plans to reexamine its 
rules on trading halts during wild price swings in the market 
phelan said the trading halts called circuit breakers may not 
be adequate he told the new york times that the exchange may 
consider circuit breakers that would halt trading in the futures 
markets in chicago as well as at the big board in new york the 
exchanges board is scheduled to meet thursday 
in an interview with the washington post phelan warned that the 
market could be ruined if it does not check the price swings 
if it keeps up long enough it is going to destroy the markets 
as a capitalraising mechanism much less as a place where people 
can invest intelligently phelan said 
a lot of people think it is a a new york stock exchange 
issue he told the post it is a national issue liquidity in 
all markets and volatility in all markets it affects individual 
investors because they get frightened to death of this volatility 
that is there and we dont blame them 
six other wall street firms have said in the last week they 
would abandon program trading for some or all of their accounts 
shearson stopped index arbitrage trading for its own account in 
january 1988 
shearson called for consistent margins on stocks and 
stockindex futures in an attempt to reduce the rapid trading of 
futures believed to spur trading in stocks 
federal regulations limit the amount of borrowed money used to 
buy stocks to 50 percent while investors may play stock index 
futures with only a 10 percent deposit 
index abitrage involves sophisticated computer programs that 
seek to capitalize on brief and minute differences in the prices of 
stocks and stockindex futures by simultaneously buying or selling 
stocks with opposite trades in the futures 
stockindex futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of 
stocks based on particular indexes such as the standard amp poors 
500 index 
critics of program trading maintain that index arbitrage can 
speed declines in stocks by flooding the market with sell orders 
encouraging waves of panic selling the strategy was blamed for 
worsening the october 1987 market crash 
many firms backed away from program trading after the crash but 
returned gradually as the market stabilized 
like other firms sheason indicated it does not believe program 
trading alone is responsible for recent rapid market movements 
saying that economic fundamentals will ultimately determine the 
direction of stock prices over the long term 
but shearson said it supported a series of changes aimed at 
helping to minimize sudden destructive moves in the market 
shearson a subsidiary of american express accounted for just 
22 percent of all index arbitrage on the new york stock exchange 
in september trading a total of 115 million shares via computer 
program strategies 
the firm also said it supported restricting or eliminating 
electronic access to the nyse for program traders during volatile 
periods and consolidating all stocks and derivative products under 
a single regulatory body 
merrill lynch amp co the largest retail brokerage said monday 
it would halt socalled index arbitrage for clients until the stock 
market calms down paine webber group inc took a similar step last 
week 
kidder peabody amp co said monday it would execute index 
arbitrage trades only for clients not for its own account morgan 
stanley amp co inc bear stearns amp co and oppenheimer amp co made 
similar announcements last week

mitsubishi estate co which is buying a 
controlling stake in the company that owns rockefeller center says 
it wants to be a good corporate citizen and will do nothing to add 
to frictions over the purchase 
americans might feel as if they were being invaded by 
japanese especially because they have special feelings toward 
rockefeller center which has been a landmark in new york 
acknowledged kiyoaki hara mitsubishis managing director 
the japanese company is paying 846 million to buy a 51 percent 
stake in rockefeller group inc rockefeller groups most famous 
asset is the 22acre manhattan development with its skating rink 
annual christmas tree radio city music hall and office towers 
the purchase announced monday comes a few weeks after sony 
corp agreed to buy columbia pictures entertainment inc for 34 
billion another deal that stirred concerns over rising japanese 
investment in the united states 
indeed sen joseph lieberman dconn waxed political about 
the deal on the senate floor tuesday in washington 
this year when they turn on the lights to that christmas tree 
in rockefeller center we americans are going to have to come to 
grips with the reality that that great national celebration is 
actually occurring on japanese property lieberman said 
the older 12building art deco portion of rockefeller center 
including radio city music hall most likely will not be controlled 
by mitsubishi past the year 2000 that property is under a 13 
billion convertible mortgage the mortgage owners a real estate 
investment trust have the right to convert their holding into a 
715 percent ownership of of the property after 2000 
after the expected conversion rockefeller group would own only 
285 percent with mitsubishi owning 51 percent of that or about 
14 percent 
for mitsubishi the more valuable assets are the timelife 
building and a 50 percent interest in the mcgrawhill building 
which are in the newer portion of rockefeller center as well as 
rockefeller groups nationwide cushman amp wakefield commercial real 
estate brokerage and prime real estate parcels in new york and new 
jersey 
mitsubishi estate one of the related mitsubishi companies 
involved in everything from cars and banking to shipbuilding and 
home electronics said in a statement it did not plan to send 
executives to join in rockefeller group management which will 
continue to manage rockefeller center 
mitsubishi estate which was established in the 1890s is 
japans secondlargest real estate company with sales of 19 
billion in fiscal 1988 the largest mitsui real estate development 
co had sales of 59 billion in the last fiscal year 
hara said the deal would enable mitsubishi trailing in overseas 
real estate business to catch up with its rivals sumitomo and 
mitsui which also have made major inroads into us commercial 
real estate 
rockefeller group has been controlled by a family whose name 
stands for american capitalism the trusts that manage the familys 
interests said they sold their majority stake in the company to 
diversify its holdings 
richard voell president and chief executive officer of 
rockefeller group issued a statement saying the purchase by 
mitsubishi would enhance the financial strength of rgi it 
ensures the companys ability to continue to invest in rockefeller 
center to enhance its stature as the most modern and prestigious 
commercial complex 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told reporters that 
buyouts become controversial only when japanese are involved 
when british dutch and other european countries have been 
engaged in similar acts no particular attention was given to that 
people have to look over these differences of nationality and 
cultural background to see if it is truly an acceptable transaction 
in accordance with normal standards of economic transactions 
watanabe said

democrats on a joint congressional committee 
have criticized the bush administration for scheduling further 
conferences on job training rather than proposing specific 
legislation 
its ridiculous that we have to reinvent the wheel like this 
every year rep james h scheuer of new york told assistant 
secretary of labor roberts jones 
scheuer said tuesday the problem has been so well studied that 
all jones would have to do is sit down with previous administration 
officials for an hour over lunch 
such a meeting could produce a good program and you wont 
have to wait until next spring said scheuer why cant you hit 
the deck running he asked 
jones was the administrations witness at a hearing of the joint 
economic committee headed by sen albert gore jr dtenn which 
met to explore the growing gap between work skills and the needs of 
employers 
gore chided the administration for a lack of precision in 
connection with what needs to be done to make sure that workers 
have the mental skills for jobs in a more complex service economy 
jones the top department official for employment and training 
told the committee that the department next spring will convene a 
national conference of employers unions educators and training 
professionals 
jones cited in his testimony the need for programs emphasizing 
the the transition from school to work including young people who 
go directly from high school to jobs 
he said the spring conference has many of the officials 
mentioned by gore and scheuer and added i dont think the 
solutions come in any instant legislative package its going to 
happen with a fundamental change in the education system 
he said those changes have to originate with the setting of 
educational norms at the state and local level 
gore and scheuer pressed jones to make a commitment to full 
financing for the head start preschool training program which the 
two said has proven its effectiveness beyond a doubt 
but jones said it would be irresponsible to make a 
commitment its got to be balanced in the context of other 
programs

us manufacturing companies believe the 
country will enjoy moderate economic growth and no recession for at 
least a year according to a survey by an industry trade group 
the national association of manufacturers said tuesday that its 
survey of 53 chief executives at us companies found that 61 
percent of them believe the next recession will not start until 
1991 or later 
while some economists are concerned about recent signs of 
weakness in the manufacturing sector nam president jerry 
jasinowski said those fears were not evident in the associations 
latest survey of its board of directors 
it is significant that manufacturers who know first hand the 
magnitude of the competitive challenges are fundamentally 
optimistic about the future jasinowski told reporters at a 
briefing 
jasinowski predicted that economic growth would be supported 
next year by increases of around 4 percent in business investment 
spending and a further modest improvement in the us trade deficit 
of around 10 billion to 15 billion 
the merchandise trade deficit has been running at an annual rate 
of 110 billion so far this year down from a 120 billion deficit 
in 1988 
jasinowski said the main fear among the executives about the 
economys future centered in the automotive sector where sales 
have been lackluster so far in the new model year 
a dramatic drop in sales of autos and other bigticket 
products because the consumer bailed out is about the only way i 
see a recession occuring next year he said 
jasinowski said he did not look for this to occur predicting 
instead that consumer spending would advance modestly in 1990 
nam which has 13500 members represents companies accounting 
for 85 percent of the nations manufacturing jobs

it now has 20 daily flights from the airport 
azima told the kansas city times he had discussed the prospect 
of buying braniff or part of it with several kansas city 
businessmen however azima said other investors would not be 
essential 
azimas effort is separate from that of john latshaw a longtime 
kansas city securities executive who has discussed pooling money 
from area investors to buy braniff 
azima said he owns a kansas city aircraft leasing company 
aviation leasing group that also operates in the caribbean and 
europe azima also has a small airline called buffalo airways based 
in waco texas that hauls cargo 
he said he had retained shearson lehman hutton inc to place a 
value on braniff or at least part of it 
azima was president of global international airways a kansas 
city company that became one of the countrys biggest air cargo and 
passenger charter carriers before running into financial trouble 
global international sought to reorganize under chapter 11 of 
the bankruptcy laws in 1983 but later was forced to liquidate 
in 1986 the federal aviation administrations records showed 
that a plane owned by azima was linked to an arms shipment to iran 
an attorney for global international responded at that time that 
azima had leased the plane to another company and had no knowledge 
of how the plane had been used no charges against azima resulted

reebok international plans to pump 15 million 
into advertising its new inflatable basketball shoe that the 
sneaker maker hopes will make the company a bigger force on the 
court as well as off it 
reebok executives said the eightmonth ad blitz for their new 
shoe called the pump makes it the largest product introduction 
ever in the footwear industry 
but reeboks main competitor nike inc said it already is 
shipping similar shoes called nike air pressure to retailers 
without creating a splashy and expensive ad campaign 
nike spokeswoman elizabeth dolan said the beaverton orebased 
company has always had a reputation for technological innovation 
and sniffed we dont have to stake the whole farm on one shoe 
no matter what else they are these shoes are expensive 
reeboks cost 170 a pair and nikes go for 175 
securities analysts said reebok may be looking for a 
highprofile way to let people know it is going after people more 
interested in performance than fashion the company has had more of 
a reputation as a trend innovator than as a maker of serious 
athletic shoes 
the actual percentage of the market that would need a shoe 
like this is fairly small said elizabeth armstrong who follows 
sneaker makers for the investment firm prescott ball amp turben 
she said reebok based in canton mass may be hoping the 
attention it gets for this topend basketball shoe will help 
sales of the shoes below it 
nike is the leader in basketball shoes selling 414 million 
worth last year according to the nike spokeswoman 
frank oconnell president of reebok north america said 
basketball shoes accounted for 300 million of reeboks 13 
billion in domestic sales last year 
atlanta hawks basketball star dominique wilkins was on hand 
tuesday for the introduction of the pump at a news conference on 
the basketball court at hunter college in manhattan 
wilkins and nba players byron scott danny ainge dennis johnson 
and doc rivers and coaches pat riley of the los angeles lakers and 
digger phelps of notre dame appear in ads debuting later this 
month in which they describe in unrehearsed and often humorous 
style how the shoes work 
some people like bmws i like gym shoes rivers said in one 
ad 
the hightop shoes have an orange button on the tongue that can 
be pressed to pump air into a speciallydesigned plastic bladder 
forming a readilyadjusted cushion around the ankle heel and 
instep to support the foot and protect it against the damaging 
effects of jarring sudden moves 
air is released by depressing a separate valve on the collar of 
the shoe 
wilkins told the news conference the inflatable shoes give him 
support and let him skip taping his ankles as he must with other 
shoes before playing 
the nike air pressure shoes use a different technology to create 
an air collar around the ankle of the shoe and are inflated with a 
small plastic hand pump 
ms dolan said that while a separate pump may not be convenient 
nikes tests showed an internal pump system could not withstand the 
beating shoes take in tournamentstyle play 
but nike may be turning the separate pump to its advantage it 
sells the shoes and the pump in a special carrying case that could 
connote status 
ms dolan said the case emphasizes that the shoes are made for 
serious basketball players they wear their regular shoes to the 
court and change to their basketball shoes she said

us interior secretary manuel lujan has 
asked independent oil producers to help develop a national energy 
plan and said that the oil industry must consider the environment 
to move forward 
over the next few months i want to invite you to give us your 
comments and suggestions on how america can move towards a brighter 
energy future lujan said tuesday i challenge you to bring 
creative innovative suggestions 
lujan speaking to the independent petroleum association of 
america said the department of the interior is working with the 
energy department on a national energy strategy that will include a 
mix of oil natural gas coal nuclear power renewable energy and 
energy conservation 
while developing a domestic energy policy lujan said the 
united states and energy industry face the challenge of securing 
a healthy and safe environmental future for our children and future 
generations of america 
in a news conference afterward lujan said you have to be 
more environmentally sensitive if youre going to move the industry 
along 
as for his own agency lujan said the department of the 
interior now has more of an environmental tilt than in past 
administrations 
lujan said he doesnt believe oil imports will decrease any time 
soon and are approaching 60 percent of the us oil supply 
he also said that opposition to oil well drilling on the outer 
continental shelf particularly off the florida and california 
coasts will preclude much future exploration and development there 
its going to be very difficult for us to offer those 
resources

recommendations to president bush in early 1990 on drilling on the 
outer continental shelf

jaguar plcs shares soared on londons stock 
exchange after the government said it was prepared to waive its 
right under a special jaguar share it owns to block a takeover of 
the british luxury automaker 
the governments announcement tuesday which surprised jaguar 
makes it possible for general motors corp or ford motor co both 
of which own jaguar stakes or any other suitor to take proposals 
to jaguars shareholders 
industry analysts in the united states said the decision by the 
government of prime minister margaret thatcher benefits ford more 
than gm gm has said it would like a minority stake in jaguar 
while ford has said it might mount a full takeover bid 
it makes the game a little more fair right now said analyst 
kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc in new 
york as of yesterday it looked like gm was the favorite now 
it looks like its anybodys game 
it suggests to me that the government is more proshareholder 
than anything else said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley 
and co of new york once again the thatcher philosophy of 
nonintervention could prevail here 
both ford and gm could use the prestige of a jaguar nameplate in 
their model lineup and jaguars manufacturing and technical 
facilities in england there have been reports that gm and jaguar 
were working on a proposal for a jointly produced vehicle but 
neither company has commented on it 
jaguars shares were trading at the equivalent of 1397 in 
london at midday wednesday up 24 cents from tuesdays close they 
rose 193 in tuesdays session 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said in the house of commons 
that if jaguars shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to 
lift a 15 percent restriction on holdings in jaguar the government 
would drop its special or golden share that it could use to 
block any takeover 
the golden share and the 15 percent limit had been due to expire 
at the end of 1990 the restrictions were established in 1984 when 
the government sold the former stateowned car maker 
ridley said the governments remaining role would be to assess 
the impact a takeover might have on competition in the british auto 
industry 
jaguar which has suffered from a slump in us sales on which 
it depends heavily is looking for a partner to give it financial 
and technological support but it wants to remain independent 
but jaguars shareholders are unlikely to agree to proposals 
that fall short of a full bid analysts have said 
the luxury carmaker could fetch up to 1580 a share or 28 
billion if gm and ford engage in a bidding war for jaguar 
analysts have estimated 
gm has been holding friendly talks with jaguar in recent weeks 
in an effort to reach a cooperation agreement with the company 
which is expected to be announced by midnovember 
the agreement is expected to call for gm to take a minority 
stake of perhaps 30 percent in jaguar and run several joint 
ventures including the manufacture of a new cheaper jaguar 
ford has said it has a 132 percent interest in jaguar through 
market stock purchases ford has said that it is prepared to mount 
a full bid for jaguar once the takeover restrictions are dropped 
both us auto makers have obtained us regulatory approval to 
buy up to 15 percent of jaguar 
ford spokesman rex greenslade in detroit said tuesday that his 
company had no comment on anything to do with jaguar 
gm spokesman jack harned read a company statement saying the 
automaker would study the action by the british government he 
declined to answer any questions 
jaguar which has been holding talks with numerous companies in 
the past 18 months said it hadnt been consulted in advance about 
ridleys move we were surprised at the action taken the 
company said in a statement 
jaguar emphasized that its articles of association still prevent 
any individual or company from owning more than 15 percent of 
jaguar without a special resolution at an extraordinary shareholder 
meeting 
an extraordinary meeting can be called by the board or by a 
shareholder who has a jaguar holding of at least 10 percent said 
jaguar spokesman arnold bolton

a unisys corp stockholder has filed a class 
action suit accusing the companys board of using misleading and 
false information to receive a 1988 shareholders vote supporting 
the board 
henry l housman of the philadelphia metropolitan area names 
13 board members in tuesdays suit which alleges that the 
companys 1988 proxy statement failed to disclose facts concerning 
fraud in connection with government defense contracts an internal 
investigation of defense contracting units and a continuing 
coverup of wrongdoings 
unisys a leading producer of electronicsbased information 
systems with more than 92500 employees designs and manufactures 
main frame computers software and systems engineering support 
services for use in various technology defense projects 
the precise number of plaintiffs are not known but consist of 
anyone who held unysis common stock on march 22 1988 when the 
proxy statement was issued according to the suit there are over 
158 million shares of unisys common stock outstanding held by over 
42000 holders of record 
the 1988 proxy statement requested shareholders to approve an 
indemnification agreement which would have protected board 
directors against lawsuits by reason of the fact that the 
director is or was serving one or more capacities as a director or 
officer of the company 
the suit alleges that unisys directors have artificially 
inflated labor and cost data entered into sham consulting 
agreements made illegal contributions padded expense accounts 
inflated invoices submitted by subcontractors and permitted some 
individuals to benefit personally by funneling money through hollow 
fund companies 
unisys has been the subject of several federal law enforcement 
and grand jury investigations including the ongoing operation 
ill wind dealing with defense contractors and the suit alleges 
could thereby be subject to potential fines from 30 million to 60 
million 
james r malone jr the attorney representing the 
shareholders said he knew of two similar cases against unisys in 
eastern pennsylvania and another in delaware he declined to 
comment on the other cases which are still in litigation 
the suit seeks to have the board members removed and to have the 
actions taken as a result of the proxy declared null and void in 
addition to unspecified damages

the us economys manufacturing sector remained weak in 
october as the brisk growth of export orders slowed significantly 
the nations corporate purchasing managers said today 
new orders overall however posted an increase after four 
months of decline suggesting that the future rate of manufacturing 
decline is easing said the survey by the national association of 
purchasing management 
the purchasing managers index a widely watched barometer of 
the economys direction rose to 476 percent from 46 percent in 
september and 452 percent in august 
the survey showed the sixth straight month of decline in the 
nations manufacturing sector but the second consecutive month in 
which the rate of decline was less than the previous month 
a reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of 
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent 
indicates growth according to the association 
continued declines in vendor deliveries and price indexes 
indicate that supply is considerably greater than demand said 
robert j bretz chairman of the purchasing management association 
but the sharp turnaround in new orders growth hints of a 
possible continued easing in the overall future rate of decline in 
the manufacturing economy he said the new orders index rose to 
514 percent up from 454 percent in september 
although new export orders continued to grow they were down 
sharply from september the export index fell to 555 percent from 
605 percent 
vendor deliveries production prices inventories and 
employment all declined according to the survey 
the monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives 
in more than 250 industrial companies the index is a composite of 
six separate indicators including new orders production vendor 
deliveries inventories prices and employment

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed in early trading today on the chicago board of trade with 
market activity limited by the all saints day holiday in much of 
europe and south america 
the corn market weakened slightly amid rumors that the soviet 
union may delay taking delivery on some of the us corn it 
recently bought 
recordhigh soviet corn purchases announced last month have 
stirred concerns that the us grain transportation system may be 
strained in trying to deliver all the corn quickly 
were asking the transportation system to run full tilt and

georgiapacific corps offer to buy 
great northern nekoosa corp for 313 billion may attract bids 
from other corporations interested in acquiring the paper products 
company analysts say 
great northerns stock surged 2012 a share to close at 
6287 tuesday on the new york stock exchange a jump of nearly 50 
percent that exceeded georgiapacifics offering price of 58 a 
share that indicates investors believe a higher offer may emerge 
georgiapacifics stock dropped 250 a share to close at 
5087 
analysts said bids may come from such forest and paper products 
companies as jefferson smurfit corp champion international co 
international paper corp weyerhaeuser co and abitibiprice inc 
great northern based in norwalk also could pursue a merger 
with champion or boise cascade corp said mark kurland an analyst 
with nabon nugent amp co in new york 
industry spokesmen said the offer was the first unsolicited 
takeover bid in the us paper industry and confirmed market 
rumors of the past few days that georgiapacific would try to take 
over great northern which makes paper products lumber and plywood 
the company which has 35 million acres of timberland and 
20000 employees reported sales of 36 billion last year 
georgiapacific which is based in atlanta had 95 billion in 
sales making paper other forest products and building materials 
it owns 65 million acres of timberland and 380 plants and mills 
employing 44000 workers 
great northern chairman william r laidig said in a statement 
that georgiapacifics offer was uninvited but would be considered 
in due course by the companys board of directors company 
officials declined further comment 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr stressed the offer 
was a friendly one that he and laidig discussed monday night on the 
telephone 
i indicated that all terms are negotiable he said tuesday 
in new york bill is a personal friend i hold him and the 
management of great northern in the highest regard 
nevertheless georgiapacific filed a complaint tuesday in us 
district court in portland maine challenging that states 
yearold antitakeover statute the law requires a hostile raider 
to wait five years before completing a merger unless the deal wins 
prior approval from directors of the target company 
great northern is incorporated in maine and is the states 
largest landowner in a related suit georgiapacific asked the 
court to throw out several antitakeover provisions in great 
northerns bylaws 
a top georgiapacific executive on tuesday briefed maine gov 
john r mckernan and other top state officials in augusta about the 
buyout proposal 
what we are stressing to the leaders of the state is that this 
is a cash offer by an operating company this is not an lbo 
leveraged buyout we are not breakup artists said ad 
pete correll executive vice president in charge of pulp and 
paper 
hahn said the merged company would be more competitive globally 
and would offer more job stability to georgiapacific and great 
northern employees 
this is not like so many transactions you see today were 
operators not liquidators we see this as an opportunity time 
he said 
under the tender offer georgiapacific would buy about 54 
million outstanding common shares for 58 a share a deal that 
values the company at 313 billion the acquisition would total 
45 billion including refinancing costs fees and expenses 
georgiapacific said its bid represented a 50 percent premium 
over the market price of great northern before takeover speculation 
drove up the stocks price starting thursday 
the company said the deal was conditioned on among other 
things acquiring at least 75 percent of great northerns 
outstanding shares by nov 29 and the dismantling by great northern 
of some of its takeover defenses 
the bid comes at the end of a period of strong expansion in the 
paper industry that was sparked by the decline of the dollar and 
healthy economic growth 
lately paper industry profits have slumped as the dollar has 
rebounded making imports cheaper and exports more expensive and 
economic growth has slowed

a homebuying opportunity seems to be shaping up 
for some of those people who were priced and rated out of the 
market over the past couple of years 
median prices in most of the country have stabilized and are 
likely to remain so with winter coming on and mortgage rates have 
fallen over the past month mortgage money is plentiful too and 
many sellers are eager 
this latter factor is often overlooked by buyers accustomed to 
feeling like beggars but many sellers are reportedly anxious to 
move their properties after enduring months of waiting and missing 
out on the august school market 
for obvious reasons families with schoolage children often 
plan their change of address before the beginning of a new school 
year making the late summer weeks among the very best for real 
estate transactions 
partly reflecting this phenomenon median home prices actually 
declined in september from august in the four geographical regions 
northeast midwest south and west measured by the national 
association of realtors 
the national median price for existing singlefamily homes in 
september was 93400 down 1400 from august although higher by 
55 percent than a year earlier big price increases arent 
expected in most markets 
meanwhile improvements in the mortgage market have made rates 
more attractive compared to a year ago or in fact to a few weeks 
ago 
hsh associates which monitors rates of 2000 lenders 
nationwide reports fixedrate 30year mortgages in single digits 
again and adjustablerate mortgages far down into the 8 percent to 
9 percent range 
its survey for the week ended oct 20 showed the national 
average for 30year fixed rates fell to 998 percent compared with 
1003 percent a week earlier and more than a full percentage point 
lower than a year ago 
many of the indexes for adjustablerate mortgages also have 
fallen in recent weeks the sixmonth treasury bill fell to 742 
percent on oct 20 from 764 percent a month earlier the constant 
maturity 3year treasury fell to 794 percent from 819 percent 
and the 5year to 792 percent from 812 percent 
federal home loan mortgage corp reports also show rates 
declining its latest report for september listed 30year 
fixedrate mortgages at 1016 percent compared with 1119 percent 
as recently as six months ago amid indications of a further 
decline in october and perhaps november too 
hsh says its data base shows well over 550 lenders offering 
30year fixedrate loans at under 10 percent with many as low as 
925 percent a figure that even experienced mortgage people had 
recently thought was a thing of the past 
the news already has affected markets suggesting that buyers 
are extremely sensitive to rates september sales of existing 
singlefamily houses were at an annual rate of 363 million units 
43 percent higher than in august 
ira gribin realtor president believes that rateconsciousness 
accounts for much of the increase many people who were forced to 
put off trading up or entering the market earlier this year are 
making their move now he says 
realtor economist john tuccillo believes that compared with 
higherpriced houses moderatepriced units tend to do well in the 
fall reflecting a market shift to smaller families whose decisions 
arent based on the school year 
paul havemann hsh vice president thinks higherpriced units 
will share in the improved market lower rates will spur all 
buyers he says especially in higherpriced areas where sellers 
are relucatant to lower their prices 
however problems still remain for firsttime buyers while 
price increases are not as common as they were a year ago incomes 
lag median prices in the northeast and west remain close to 
145000 while the september median in the midwest was 71800 
and in the south 84200 
medians can deceive however and discourage too leading many 
real estate people to point out that communities with high medians 
might also have many sound houses priced well within the range of 
firsttimers

sam kusumoto the head of minolta camera cos 
us operations says he doesnt envy his counterparts at american 
corporations 
i feel sorry for american ceos they have to be creative and 
always coming out with new ideas he said 
and for an executive like him a guy over 60 that can be 
pretty stressful said kusumoto president and chief executive 
officer of ramsey njbased minolta corp 
american executives are under a lot of pressure said kusumoto 
while its true they are highly paid they also face high risks if 
their ideas dont work or if they make the wrong choice theyre 
out of there he said 
kusumoto 61 who first came to the united states in 1954 has 
been president of minolta since 1969 making him one of the 
longestserving japanese executives in america and giving him a 
unique perspective on how a country left in ruins by war could turn 
into one of the worlds strongest economic powers 
in 1987 he was elected secretary of the japanese chamber of 
commerce of new york ep dutton is publishing his autobiography 
my bridge to america this month 
in washington recently to attend a white house luncheon 
kusumoto who now lives in fort lee nj discussed the japanese 
way of management the japanese and us educational systems and 
japans image in america 
while american corporations are run from the top down by 
highpowered executives making astronomical salaries japanese are 
run from the middle out said kusumoto middle managers closer in 
age to 35 than 65 tend to come up with the ideas and innovations 
top management tends to keep a lower profile 
if an idea is a success the company shares the credit if it 
goes awry theres no fingerpointing or dismissals everyone shares 
the blame japanese workers see their company as a second family 
and usually stay for the entire career 
that stability says kusumoto is one of the main reasons 
japanese corporations have been so successful since world war ii 
at japanese companies the difference between the top and the 
bottom is not that great he said 
we dont have anybody making a million dollars said 
kusumoto arguing that because there isnt a vast salary gap 
between executives and workers there are fewer labor problems in 
japan 
in fact at most of japans largest companies the top 
executives salaries are only about seven times greater than a new 
employee right out of college he said 
to compensate for that japanese executives get lots of fringe 
benefits a company car maybe even a chauffeured limousine and 
an unlimited expense account in return they have the peace of 
mind that goes with stable possibly lifetime employment 
but that management style can run into problems when the 
japanese company operates in the united states where success is 
measured by salary and title 
fasttrack american executives who dont get the raise or the 
promotion they want move on said kusumoto upsetting the harmony 
that japanese concerns strive for 
to counter that minolta has come up with a simple plan pay the 
americans more 
kusumoto noted that he has three japanese vice presidents and 
four american vice presidents and a few of the americans make 
more money than i do 
while none of the japanese executives are making as much as the 
americans they dont care said kusumoto because they know it 
is important to the company which has earned their loyalty 
as part of this drive to seek harmony kusumotos staff which 
he takes to japan once a year the americans as well as the 
japanese make their decisions by consensus in fact there are so 
many meetings theyve had to add several new conference rooms to 
the new jersey headquarters 
the japanese system in my opinion is better kusumoto said 
sam kusumotos given name is actually sadahei he was born to 
japanese parents in what is now seoul south korea where his 
father was a successful ford distributor 
at the end of world war ii the family returned to japan where 
kusumoto then 18 years old enrolled in tokyos keio university 
majoring in economics shortly after completing his studies in 
1953 kusumoto joined minolta 
within a year he was sent to the united states as minoltas 
sole representative he returned to company headquarters in osaka 
in 1959 rising to head the international sales division 
since 1969 when he was named head of minoltas us marketing 
subsidiary for all its photographic and office automation products 
he has lived in this country with his family his two daughters 
went to american colleges 
while trade deficits import barriers and currency fluctuations 
take their toll on usjapanese relations kusumoto thinks there 
is something else irritating american people deep in their 
heart what they perceive as the ingratitude of the japanese 
one of the biggest problems in japanese education is they 
dont teach anything about what happened after world war ii he 
said 
consequently young japanese dont know what americans did for 
japan after the war and americans cant understand why japan 
isnt more grateful for the assistance they rendered warshattered 
japan 
if the japanese were more modest if they said thank you 
america then i think this japan bashing would go kusumoto 
said

jaguar plc the luxury automaker with the leaping 
cat logo may have a tough time staying out of the cage of general 
motors corp or ford motor co 
many analysts expect the worlds no 1 and 2 automakers to stage 
a multibilliondollar bidding war for jaguar which is suffering 
the latest in several reversals of fortune that date back to its 
founding 67 years ago 
the us rivals are believed to want to pitch jaguars against 
new japanese luxury models 
its looking increasingly likely it is very much squaring up 
for a fight between these two said stephen reitman an auto 
analyst with the london investment firm ubs phillips and drew 
both of them will fight very hard for it which suggests a 
bareknuckle fight 
the british government on tuesday opened the way for competing 
bids by announcing that it would waive its golden share which 
gave it the power to block any takeover 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said that if jaguars 
shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to lift a 15 percent 
limit on the size of a single investors jaguar holdings the 
government would drop its veto power 
the veto rights were imposed when the government sold off the 
former stateowned car maker in 1984 they were to expire at the 
end of 1990 
no 2 ford has said it is prepared to make a full bid for jaguar 
when takeover restrictions are lifted ford had bought 132 percent 
by early this past week 
jaguar calls fords move unwelcome and is negotiating a friendly 
cooperation agreement with general motors in which gm would take a 
minority stake of perhaps ultimately 30 percent in the british 
company gm has obtained us regulatory approval to buy up to 15 
percent 
jaguar chairman sir john egan has said he hoped to announce an 
agreement with gm by midnovember such a deal might include plans 
to jointly manufacture a less expensive executive model egan said 
jaguars cheapest car costs 39700 
we believe that preserving jaguars independence is in the 
best interest of everyone associated with the company egan said 
at a british car show our desire has always been to keep our 
destiny firmly in our own hands 
but jaguars shareholders arent likely to approve a limited 
tieup with gm because they would like to see a full bid said 
john lawson an automotive analyst with nomura securities in london 
this could prompt both companies to make full takeover offers 
and the winner could end up paying more than 3 billion the 
analysts said takeover speculation has more than doubled jaguars 
share price since before ford signaled its interest 
jaguar has fallen on hard times again because the weak dollar 
and a luxury car sales slump have hurt its crucial us sales its 
looking for a linkup that would give it the technology and 
financial resources to expand its line of cars to become more 
competitive 
jaguar is vulnerable because it has a small product range it 
produces 50000 xj6 and series iii sedans xjs sports cars and 
limousines a year and it needs to invest heavily to modernize 
we have talked to large number of companies over the past 18 
months said jaguar spokesman arnold bolton 
what makes jaguar attractive is that it is one of the last 
independent luxury marks available hollywood stars such as the 
late clark gable and modern royalty including prince charles have 
owned jaguars which are loaded with luxurious touches such as 
leather upholstery and walnut paneling 
a major auto maker risks hurting jaguars cachet if it takes 
over the british company entirely said lawson the analyst but it 
also risks making a poor return on its investment if it doesnt 
and only takes a stake he said 
there is a danger that you destroy the thing that sells the 
cars if you try and make this part of an international group 
lawson said 
a lot of jaguar sales are based on it being a traditional 
sporting gentlemans car and being english this is a fashion 
industry jaguar is the burberry of the car industry 
the best strategy lawson said is to expand jaguar into 
bmwtype territory but that would require a huge investment in 
plant and equipment he said 
jaguar was launched in 1922 as the swallow sidecar co in 
blackpool swallow introduced its first car in 1927 and a year 
later moved to coventry the center of the british car industry 95 
miles northwest of london 
it produced a line of ss cars in the 1930s and changed its name 
to jaguar cars ltd at the end of world war ii in 1968 it became 
a part of the state automaker british leyland 
jaguar fared badly under state stewardship it suffered an 
aftertax loss of 84 million in 1980 and developed a poor 
reputation for quality control 
egan who took over nine years ago is largely credited with 
turning jaguar around by cutting costs more than tripling 
production per worker and expanding sales in europe and the far 
east 
jaguar was being hailed as a prime example of a successful 
privatization along with british airways plc and british steel plc 
but jaguar remained overly dependent on the extremely 
competitive us market where it still sells 40 percent of its 
cars and it was clobbered when the dollar and us luxury car 
sales slumped 
jaguars aftertax profit peaked at 141 million in 1985 it 
sank to 99 million in 1987 and then to 46 million in 1988 on 
revenue of 107 billion analysts are expecting jaguar to lose 
money in 1989

the house today overwhelmingly approved 
legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to 425 by april 1991 
and establish a lower training wage for some teenagers new to the 
job market 
the 38237 vote came just a day after the white house and 
democratic congressional leaders reached agreement on the plan 
which would provide the first increase in the 335 minimum wage 
since 1981 
president bush vetoed an earlier bill to raise the minimum wage 
to 455 an hour and the democraticcontrolled house sustained the 
veto 
senate leaders have promised to vote on the compromise soon in 
hopes of getting it to the white house for bushs signature before 
thanksgiving 
many lawmakers from both parties found fault with the 
compromise with democrats saying the increase was not big enough 
and some republicans saying there should be no boost but most said 
the deal was the best political compromise possible 
no one got exactly what they wanted said rep william 
goodling of pennsylvania ranking republican on the house education 
and labor committee i think we got the best that we could 
rep alan wheat dmo said the increase should have been 
bigger but passage of the compromise represents this bodys 
commitment to an honest days pay for an honest days work 
before the debate house speaker thomas foley said final passage 
of the proposal would mark one of the major achievements of the 
101st congress 
a year or two ago it seemed as though no compromise was in 
sight said rep austin murphy dpa 
foley attributed president bushs decision to drop his refusal 
to compromise on the issue to the fact that democrats were close to 
getting a vetoproof majority on a bill of their own he said 
republicans found it embarrassing for bush not to give in on 
the minimum wage while demanding a capital gains tax cut for the 
wealthy 
the measure would create a new subminimum wage for 
teenagers with little job experience allowing them to be paid 85 
percent of the minimum wage for their first three months in the 
work force the lower rate could be extended for another three 
months if an employer showed that the youths were receiving 
specific skills training 
this package offers the promise of better wages for the 
working men and women of this country and gives incentives to 
create new jobs for our young people bush said in a written 
statement that commended organized labor and congressional leaders 
both sides made significant concessions in an effort to avoid a 
repeat of bushs veto of minimum wage legislation earlier this 
year which was sustained by the house 
democrats acknowledged giving ground but said it was necessary 
to guarantee a boost in the minimum wage which has been frozen at 
335 an hour since january 1981 in a stalemate that lasted 
throughout the reagan administration democrats promised to 
reconsider the issue before the 1992 presidential and congressional 
elections 
aflcio president lane kirkland said organized labor would 
welcome the long overdue agreement on the minimum wage and 
urged congress to pass it swiftly 
the compromise would boost the minimum wage to 380 on april 1 
and provide the final 45cent increase to 425 on april 1 1991 
the subminimum wage for workers age 16 to 19 in their first jobs 
would be 85 percent of the prevailing minimum wage except for in 
the first year of the increase for which lawmakers added a 
provision barring it from being below the current 335 an hour 
minimum the subminimum would be 361 when the minimum wage rose 
to 425 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
committee said the minimum wage would already be 479 an hour if 
adjusted to account for inflation since 1981 
that is the measure of how far we have failed the test of 
fairness to the working poor kennedy said our only answer to 
them is that this is the best compromise we can get from an 
administration that wanted to give them even less 
the subminimum wage could be paid to any worker age 16 to 19 
with less than three months total job experience once that 
threshold was met the subminimum could be paid for up to an 
additional three months only when the employer had a training 
program subject to labor department approval 
no worker over age 20 or with six months work experience could 
be paid the subminimum wage and the lower wage would expire in 
april 1993 unless reauthorized by congress 
democrats and labor long have considered such a training 
wage unacceptable however it became clear that some such 
provision would be necessary to strike a deal with the white house 
or to achieve a vetoproof majority in the house 
for his part bush gave up nine months from his offer to 
increase the minimum wage to 425 in january 1992 and he also 
conceded ground on the training wage he had demanded a sixmonth 
provision for all workers regardless of their age and prior work 
experience

dont let the rounded edges on the 1990 lincoln town car 
disappoint you over the shrinking of true unabashed american 
luxury cars the town car is still a monster 
indeed this years model is an inch longer and has a third of 
an inch more wheelbase than the 1989 model the rounded 
aerodynamic styling borrowed from the ford taurus and lincoln 
continental just makes the new town car look slightly smaller 
once youre inside however youll get the familiar 
allamerican picture wide pillowsoft seats legroom ample for 
even the jolly green giant and builtin comfort at every turn the 
carmaker boasts that the trunk at 22 cubic feet is the biggest in 
the industry 
the truth is the redesigned 1990 town car which had its last 
major overhaul in 1979 isnt much of a departure from the previous 
model save for some smoothing of body panels and some finetuning 
of handling features 
for example the test vehicle a cartier fourdoor model 
handled well despite its length of more than 18 feet 4 inches the 
vehicle tackled winding mountain roads with remarkable ease with 
far less sway than might be expected thanks to the addition of 
rear airspring load leveling and speedsensitive variableassist 
power steering 
inside the ride was cushioned as always road bumps were 
nearly imperceptible the most i noticed were a couple of slight 
jostlings on particularly rigorous roads and a bucking sensation a 
couple of times 
the 5liter v8 engine teamed with fourspeed automatic 
transmission with automatic overdrive delivered good acceleration 
even though it had to power more than 4000 pounds of car thats 
about equal to the weight of two hyundai excel subcompacts 
fuel economy was rated at 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the 
highway but in hard driving in the city and on the highway the 
test car averaged 157 mpg 
safety items included standard driver and frontpassenger 
airbags optional tractionlok axle 101 that protects against 
spinouts by keeping both tires rotating at the same speed even if 
one loses traction on ice or sand and optional antilock brakes 
these brakes by the way were excellent in panic stops bringing 
this huge car to a steady controlled halt but that option costs 
936 
a less expensive option will save coldweather drivers from 
straddling the front of the car to scrape ice off the big 
windshield ford offers instaclear a windshield that clears ice 
with the touch of a dashboard button it does this without the 
windshield wires common to rear window defrosters the only sign of 
instaclear is the windows pinkish tinge from the addition of 
special heatconductive material the cost is 253 
ford added other nice touches a label and an arrow under the 
dashboard fuel gauge indicating the side of the car with the gas 
cap so you know how to pull up to the pumps a button to open the 
gas tank located on the dashboard rather than under or beside the 
drivers seat big handles on all four doors and on the backs of 
the front seats to help entry and exit and stereo speakers above 
the frontdoor armrests that are so integrated into the design you 
dont notice them 
the town car also had the most powerful lumbar support of any 
car ive tested i was able to pressurize the system to the point i 
felt i had a huge rock in the middle of my back 
the major drawback to the town car is price it starts at 
27986 this model year up 95 percent from the 25562 starting 
price in the 1989 model year according to company spokesmen the 
upscale test car had a base price of 32809 with options and 
destination charge it came to nearly 35000 
but the hefty price has not deterred more than 100000 buyers in 
recent years more than 84000 have been sold so far this year 
ford motor co expects the new styling to help boost sales from 
121674 in 1988 to 135000 total in 1990 
the new rounded look may help lure slightly younger buyers 
spokesman jim trainor says previous town car buyers had an average 
age of 598 years and household income of 58800 annually 
seventyfour percent of buyers have been men and 86 percent are 
married he says 
main competitors for the town car include the cadillac fleetwood 
brougham which starts at 27400 and the cadillac sedan deville 
which starts at 27540 
consumer reports magazine ranked 198286 model town cars as 
average or above average in its trouble index according to owner 
reports 
the 1987 town car dropped to worse than average in the trouble 
index a ranking that trainor says baffles the company because the 
magazines list of specific trouble spots such as air conditioning 
fuel system and brakes ranked average across the board

after two mistrials the stock manipulation case 
against gaf corp and a top executive opened wednesday for a third 
time 
the new jury was not told that us district judge mary johnson 
lowe had declared mistrials on jan 10 and march 22 in the case 
against the wayne njbased chemicals and building materials 
manufacturer and its vice chairman james t sherwin 
arthur l liman lead attorney for gaf addressed the 12member 
panel in federal court in manhattan after an hourlong opening 
statement by assistant us attorney carl loewenson jr 
loewenson told the jury that sherwin persuaded a los angeles 
brokerage firm to illegally drive up union carbide corps stock 
price in october 1986 so that gaf which had accumulated 10 
million shares in a failed takeover bid could unload it at a 
better price 
liman denied gaf was desperate to get rid of the stock he said 
gaf chairman and chief executive samuel j heyman was very 
bullish very optimistic about the future of union carbide 
liman said the governments case depends on the testimony of an 
admitted felon los angeles stockbroker boyd l jefferies who has 
been testifying as part of a plea arrangement 
jefferies has testified twice that sherwin induced him to 
manipulate the stock and to hide the transaction 
you have the power to keep boyd jefferies from pulling the 
wool over your eyes and from perpetrating any misjustice liman 
said 
the lawyer claimed jefferies has rehearsed his testimony at 
least 25 times with government lawyers the only thing they 
didnt do is have him practice in front of a mirror he said 
loewenson conceded there will be inconsistencies in the 
testimony of jefferies and his chief trader james melton if their 
recollections matched perfectly he told the jury youd know 
that they cooked up a story together 
gaf two subsidiaries and sherwin were indicted in july 1988 on 
charges of securities fraud wire fraud and conspiracy 
the companies would face maximum fines totaling 12 million or 
500000 on each of eight counts against each of the three sherwin 
would face 40 years in prison and a fine of up to 2 million 
the gaf case was the first criminal trial stemming from the 
insider trading scandals of the mid1980s and were considered a 
critical test of information supplied by jailed stock speculator 
ivan f boesky 
jefferies was implicated in the scandal by boesky and pleaded 
guilty to two securities fraud felonies earlier this year 
jefferies was sentenced to probation and fined 250000

the los angeles herald examiner once the 
nations largest afternoon newspaper but recently just a scrappy 
shell of its former self said wednesday it would cease publication 
thursday 
robert danzig vice president and general manager of herald 
newspapers made the announcement at an emotional meeting in the 
newsroom wednesday afternoon 
the herald examiner founded by william randolph hearst in 1903 
as the los angeles examiner was put up for sale by hearst corp 
earlier this summer 
hearst cited intense pressure from the los angeles times 
the citys dominant daily with five times the heralds daily 
circulation 
the herald which in recent years had switched to morning 
publication also had to wrestle with increasingly successful 
suburban papers like the orange county register based in santa 
ana and the los angeles daily news based in the san fernando 
valley 
in its dying days the herald covered local politics 
aggressively breaking a number of stories on embattled mayor tom 
bradley that occasionally embarrassed the times 
while the herald provided little staffproduced coverage of 
washington or international affairs the papers entertainment 
coverage sports columnists and local reporting were highly 
regarded 
the times claims a daily circulation of 1119840 while the 
herald which had a circulation of 729000 in 1967 slumped to 
238392 daily according to figures compiled by the audit bureau of 
circulations

about 730 products whose 
importation was barred to protect domestic industry now may enter 
argentina in a move the government hopes will spur competition and 
keep a lid on inflation 
the products include dishes plates and other glass and pottery 
products leather suitcases rugs tapestries wools linen and 
other textiles books watches shoes motorcycles watches 
some of the products though no longer banned will still face 
tariffs 
about 70 products remain barred from importation including 
automobiles sugar and pharmaceuticals computer and electronic 
products remain protected by high tariffs 
the lifting of import prohibitions was part of an agreement with 
the world bank and the international monetary fund by which they 
will loan argentina money 
the political and economic conditions that existed when 
administrative restrictions were put on the importation of the 
products have changed economy minister nestor rapanelli said 
tuesday 
the prohibition of importation is an instrument of protection 
that should be used only when strictly necessary he said 
the opening shows president carlos menems determination to spur 
growth in an economy beset by recession unemployment inflation 
and inefficiency 
the reintroduction of foreign goods in a national market that 
had excluded them was expected to pressure domestic industries to 
match them in terms of price and quality 
producers however said they feared they cannot compete and 
win and foreign goods will swamp local production leading to 
plant closings and layoffs 
the policy of severely restricting imports dates to the 
presidencies of juan domingo peron in the late 1940s and early 
1950s

the house voted overwhelmingly wednesday to 
raise the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 425 by april 1991 and 
create a new lower wage for teenagers with less than six months 
work experience 
the 38237 vote on the compromise struck between president bush 
and congressional democrats sends the measure to the senate where 
leaders have promised to pass it before thanksgiving 
bushs signature then would trigger the first increase in the 
minimum wage since january 1981 and end an eightyear political 
stalemate between the majority democrats in congress and two 
successive republican administrations 
that stalemate has kept the minimum wage at 335 an hour since 
january 1981 the compromise provides a 45cent increase to 380 
next april 1 and another 45cent jump a year later 
it also creates for the first time a subminimum training 
wage that would allow employers to pay workers from 1619 years 
old 85 percent of the prevailing minimum wage for their three 
months in the work force the subminimum could be paid for an 
additional three months provided the youths were in certified 
training programs 
beneficiaries of the compromise will be the roughly 4 million 
americans who according to government figures work at the minimum 
wage congressional researchers say twothirds of them are women 
and between 25 percent and 33 percent of them are heads of 
households eleven states have laws mandating minimum wages higher 
than the current federal floor a few of them already are at the 
425 level 
the agreement on the subminimum an anathema to organized labor 
that was demanded by bush cleared the way for the compromise and 
was the focus of most of the house debate 
that debate was short and subdued with lawmakers from both 
parties finding fault with the compromise most democrats said the 
increase was too small while conservative republicans said there 
should no boost and for that matter no minimum wage 
but gone was the acrimony and political posturing that 
characterized the fight just months ago over a bill bush ultimately 
vetoed and the bitter debates on the subject during each of the 
eight years of the reagan administration 
this will have to be our best our pitiful best said rep 
joseph m gaydos dpa were not really being fair to those 8 
million americans who work at the minimum wage this is indeed 
a bitter pill to swallow 
the republican floor manager of the bill pennsylvania rep 
william goodling said no one got exactly what they wanted i 
think we got the best that we could 
voting in favor of the compromise were 247 democrats and 135 
republicans two democrats carl perkins of kentucky and george 
miller of calfornia both vocal opponents of the new subminimum 
wage voted against the plan as did 35 republicans the rest of 
the lawmakers did not vote 
perkins who supported the bill bush vetoed in june said he 
couldnt vote for the compromise because of the subminimum wage 
which covers 16 to 19yearolds with fewer than six months work 
experience 
bush insisted on such a training wage although the 
compromise falls well short of what bush initially demanded 
perkins called the measure a sellout to the president of the 
united states who has indeed got his victory 
what we are talking about today is a step backwards for the 
american worker and all those who believe that work should be 
rewarded perkins said 
most speakers toned down their rhetoric praising lawmakers for 
their persistent work on the compromise 
the political debate is over said rep thomas ridge rpa 
who was among the moderate republicans urging the white house to 
compromise 
you cant buy more bread or put another pair of shoes on the 
young ones with good intentions ridge told democrats who wanted 
a larger increase 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash attributed bushs sudden 
willingness to compromise to pressure from republican lawmakers 
uncomfortable with the minimumwage stalemate while bush is pushing 
a capital gains tax cut for the wealthy 
to be very difficult and parsimonious with the least wellpaid 
americans while generous to a fault underline to a fault with 
the highest income people in the country was one that was 
embarrassing republicans foley told reporters 
to strike the deal democrats agreed to push back the effective 
dates of the increases from january to april accept the subminimum 
wage and drop their insistence on a commission to make annual 
recommendations on the wage level a mechanism republicans said 
would have been used to seek annual increases 
bush agreed to reaching the 425 level nine months earlier than 
he had proposed and a far more restrictive subminimum wage than he 
sought in what until friday the administration had insisted was the 
presidents first best and final offer 
bush had proposed a sixmonth subminimum that could be paid to 
all workers regardless of age every time they changed jobs

a trust established by manville corp to handle 
legal liabilities arising from its abestos products says it was 
considering several options to avoid a cash shortfall next year 
in a filing tuesday with the securities and exchange commission 
the manville personal injury trust fund said a portion of manville 
stock holdings could be sold or manville recapitalized among other 
things 
trust officials announced last week that the trust was facing a 
cash crunch that could delay payments to thousands of asbestos 
victims by as much as 25 years 
the trust was established last year to assume all legal 
liabilities arising from asbestos produced by manville and to 
enable the company to emerge from federal bankruptcy protection 
its initial funding consisted of 530 million from manvilles 
insurance companies and 155 million from manville 
currently the trust owns 50 percent of manvilles common stock 
it also has the option of converting a block of manville preferred 
stock into common stock which would give the trust ownership of 80 
percent of manvilles common stock 
manville has offered to repurchase 500 million of the preferred 
stock if the trust would agree to relax certain financial and 
operational constraints on the company 
manville filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 
11 of federal bankruptcy laws in 1982 after facing a flood of 
personal injury lawsuits arising from its former status as the 
nations largest asbestos producer it now produces building 
products and packaging materials

natural gas has gone from being almost exotic to 
an abundant cheap source of clean fuel that plays an important 
part in the nations energy policy energy secretary james d 
watkins said wednesday 
it was wrong for us to write off natural gas in the 1970s 
watkins told the american gas association in its annual meeting 
it would be equally wrong for us to look at natural gas or any 
fuel as more than a component of our comprehensive energy 
strategy 
association members have lauded natural gas as an answer to 
problems surrounding oil mainly foreign imports and environmental 
worries 
much attention has been paid to various programs using natural 
gas especially as a replacement for gasoline in powering vehicles 
and for cogeneration of electricity areas watkins highlighted 
wednesday in an industry he said was really on a roll 
twelve years ago in does formative years natural gas was 
viewed as a scarce and dwindling resource watkins said today 
we know natural gas can be a cleanburning domestically abundant 
fuel 
he said the department estimates that the nation has a 35year 
supply at prices of 3 per thousand cubic feet

georgiapacific corp moved wednesday to 
muster support for its 313 billion takeover offer for great 
northern nekoosa co suggesting it could improve productivity and 
stem the decline of great northerns maine paper mills 
separately great northerns board of directors held its 
regularly scheduled meeting wednesday at company headquarters in 
norwalk conn but took no action on the tender offer said 
stephen hill director of investor relations 
georgiapacific representatives fanned out across maine to 
promote the 58 a share proposal that if successful would create a 
paper company owning more than 26 million acres 
our record of growth in the industry is a very clear record 
we are a very efficient lowcost producer of what are very clearly 
commodity products said ct kip howlett jr 
georgiapacific vice president for governmental affairs 
noting recent layoffs at great northerns mills in millinocket 
and east millinocket howlett said there was a lot of potential 
for improvement howlett didnt mention specifics but suggested 
his company would introduce a more varied product mix adding 
fiberboard and structural wood paneling to the current output of 
newsprint and groundwood papers 
great northern stock which soared 2012 on news of the buyout 
offer tuesday dipped 137 to 6150 a share in heavy new york 
stock exchange trading wednesday 
great northerns board of directors said tuesday it would study 
the unsolicited offer in due course before deciding on a 
response 
workers in the millinocketarea mills and across great 
northerns 21 million acres of maine timberlands received letters 
from their employer saying it was moving ahead with business as 
usual 
the company which has a pulp and paper mill in the millinocket 
area 80 miles north of bangor in northern maine has 2800 maine 
employees 
although it has stressed that it regarded the buyout offer as 
friendly georgia pacific has filed a us district court complaint 
in portland challenging maines antitakeover law 
great northern is incorporated in maine state law requires an 
acquirer to wait five years before completing a merger unless the 
deal wins prior approval from directors of the target company 
atlantabased georgiapacific also asked the court to throw out 
several antitakeover provisions in great northerns bylaws 
in augusta the takeover bid dominated a state house news 
briefing that followed a meeting between gov john r mckernan and 
leaders of the paperworkers union 
at this point we dont know enough about the implications 
to know what is in our best interests said mckernan 
mckernan had arranged the meeting which was scheduled before 
the takeover bid was made public to discuss great northerns 
tentative plan to build a new 484 million paper mill in a joint 
venture with a west german papermaker 
edward gorham of the maine aflcio who attended the meeting 
said great northern had been reluctant to discuss whether displaced 
union workers would be given the first shot at jobs in the new mill 
he said labor leaders were waiting to see how a takeover would 
affect that project although he said theres not much cause for 
optimism and that past georgiapacific takeovers have led to 
mills being shut down 
mckernan said he had talked with officials from both companies 
but got little information from either because everything is sort 
of up in the air 
great northern has said theyre continuing business as usual 
until their board of directors tells them to do otherwise which 
means they will continue to move forward in their plans for the 
expansion he said 
the people at georgiapacific have said obviously they 
havent had a chance to look at the company in enough detail so 
that if they were successful in their tender offer that they would 
be able to make any commitments 
mckernan said he stressed to both sides that he considered 
construction of the new mill essential regardless of who owned or 
operated it

philip morris cos inc whose cigarette unit 
has championed smokers rights on wednesday launched a 
corporateimage advertising campaign pegged to the 200th 
anniversary of the bill of rights 
the campaign includes ads that put the philip morris name back 
on television for the first time since it quit advertising its 
namesake cigarette brand on tv in the 1950s 
broadcast advertising of cigarettes has been banned since 1971 
the new commercials make no mention of cigarettes or smoking 
and philip morris executives said they never will the ads simply 
list at the close the companys name and those of its three 
operating subsidiaries which include the philip morris usa 
cigarette concern its kraft general foods packaged goods company 
and its miller brewing co 
but antismoking campaigners criticized the new ads anyway 
its just another attempt by the tobacco companies to 
associate themselves with wholesome innocent images like youth 
athletics and the arts said steve dickinson a spokesman for the 
american cancer society 
the ads which were launched in print and on television 
wednesday morning invite people to call a tollfree telephone 
number if they want a free copy of the bill of rights the first 
10 amendments to the constitution 
guy l smith iv vice president for corporate affairs at philip 
morris said there were 5000 calls in the first hour after the 
commercial appeared on the morning news shows wednesday 
philip morris is expected to spend 30 million a year on the 
twoyear campaign including costs of placing the ads on television 
and in newspapers and magazines as well as mailing the requested 
documents to callers 
smith said philip morris decided to launch its first corporate 
campaign partly to show people that the company has grown 
considerably in the past few years particularly with its 
acquisitions of general foods and kraft 
it now owns the nations largest food company the largest 
tobacco company and the second largest beer company 
its products include marlboro cigarettes miller beer jello 
desserts kraft cheese and salad dressings and maxwell house 
coffee the philip morris cigarette brand has been renamed and is 
called commander 
the ads are tied in with the national archives observance of 
the 200th anniversary of the bill of rights 
jill brett an archives spokeswoman said philip morris is 
handling distribution of requested copies of the bill of rights and 
other materials the archives has prepared and may underwrite a 
national tour connected to the anniversary 
she said the archives wanted to reach as many people as it could 
with an educational campaign about the bill of rights and felt 
philip morris had a track record for supporting cultural 
institutions and the arts 
we look at it as an opportunity to reach millions of amricans 
we could not reach otherwise without corporate support she said 
marketing consultant al ries of trout amp ries in greenwich 
conn said philip morris must have been mindful of increasing 
threats of more regulation of the tobacco industry when it decided 
to tout the bill of rights in ads 
they are hoping that people will look at their ads and say to 
themselves maybe smokers should have rights too ries said 
michael pertschuk the former head of the federal trade 
commission who was involved as a senate staffer in the efforts to 
ban broadcast advertising of tobacco products in 1971 said the 
philip morris ads are an attempt to legitimize itself as an 
institution by associating the company with those things that 
are american and holy 
that would be fine for a company that sold a product that is 
wholesome and decent but its not fine for a company that still 
spends billions of dollars to promote and aggressively market a 
product that kills hundreds of thousands of people he said

sony corp and warner communications inc 
have reached a tentative agreement allowing hollywoods hottest 
producers peter guber and jon peters to jump to sonys columbia 
pictures a source close to the negotiations said wednesday 
theres still a number of ts to be crossed but it looks like 
a done deal said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity its going to cost sony some 
the settlement would allow guber and peters producers of such 
hit films as batman and rain man to break their fiveyear 
contract with warner bros to head columbia pictures entertainment 
in a key part of the proposed settlement warner would receive 
columbias 35 percent share in the burbank studios the 150acre 
lot they jointly own in exchange for the old mgm lot in culver 
city which warner acquired in its merger with lorimar telepictures 
this year 
warner bros records also would get a share of sonys lucrative 
cbs record club which sony acquired as part of its buyout of cbs 
records 
warner is nations leading record company in the country 
followed by cbs but warner has no record club of its own and has 
contracted with the cbs club and the old rca club now owned by 
germanys bertelsmann music group to provide records to members of 
those clubs 
warner also would retain rights to the projects guber and peters 
have under way or in development at warner those include two 
sequels to batman which already has grossed nearly 250 
million at us theaters 
warner a unit of time warner inc says it already has invested 
or committed 13 million in 50 projects under development by guber 
and peters 
warner and sony spokesmen declined comment 
the loss of guber and peters would have scrambled sonys 
management plans for columbia to which it has made a 5 billion 
commitment in addition to buying columbia for 34 billion sony 
is paying 200 million for guberpeters entertainment and will 
assume payments on 15 billion in columbia debt 
warner on the other hand stood to gain little by forcing guber 
and peters to stay on if in doing so it only angered its star 
producers 
both sides agreed tuesday to postpone a court hearing thursday 
on warners request for an injunction barring guber and peters from 
leaving saying they needed time to allow the parties to have 
further discussions 
the two producers contended warner had an oral agreement to let 
them out of their contract if they got the chance to run a major 
studio but warner bros president terry semel denied that 
i do not make oral agreements to terminate written agreements 
especially when they involve key talent and millions of dollars 
semel said in one of a series of affidavits filed in preparation 
for the scheduled court hearing thursday

nl industries inc renewed its courtship of 
georgia gulf corp on wednesday disclosing it had made an 
unsolicited 11 billion offer for the 901 percent stake in the 
company it does not already own 
georgia gulf said its board reviewed the nl industries proposal 
as well as unspecified indications of interest from other third 
parties about possible business combinations and would continue 
to review its alternatives 
no decision has been made to eliminate any alternatives from 
consideration georgia gulf said in a statement 
it added that there can be no assurance that any transaction 
will be recommended authorized or completed 
discussions are being held with interested parties and work is 
also continuing on other various transactions the statement said 
in trading on the new york stock exchange georgia gulf stock 
climbed 175 a share to 5125 
the offer nl industries marked the first concrete proposal from 
the company controlled by a texas billionaire harold c simmons 
but followed several overtures over the past few months 
simmons already owns about 99 percent of the chemical companys 
256 million outstanding shares 
john garcia an analyst with wertheim schroder amp co in new 
york said he viewed the offer as an attempt to drive up the price 
of georgia gulfs stock 
he saw some value and he wants to get a piece of it hes a 
moneymaker garcia said 
nl president j landis martin could not be reached for comment 
wednesday he was out of his houston office and did not return 
messages left with his secretary 
simmons through nl has been buying and selling georgia gulf 
stock since early summer 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission in 
august he said his then nearly 10 percent stake in georgia gulf 
was no longer held simply for investment purposes in september he 
reduced his stake in georgia gulf to below 9 percent and said he 
was temporarily dropping a bid to oust the companys board of 
directors later that month he again increased his holdings in the 
company to 99 percent 
the latest offer for the atlanta company comes about six weeks 
after georgia gulf officials met with nls martin to discuss a 
possible merger 
no agreement was reached and georgia gulf then asked its 
financial advisers to explore the feasibility of what it called a 
variety of alternative transactions including a deal with nl 
georgia gulf a chemical company created in 1985 by 
georgiapacific corp had 1988 sales of 106 billion analysts 
have said previously that a takeover would be difficult without the 
consent of georgia gulf management which owns a substantial 
portion of the company

the electronic financial information company telerate inc that it 
does not already own 
it was the second extension in the 18ashare offer in the past

acceptable deal

until 5 pm est next monday and the latest action extends it 
another three days the tender offer originally was to expire this 
friday 
in a filing wednesday with the securities and exchange 
commission dow jones said it was extending its offer because 
telerate had provided dow jones with a new forecast of financial 
performance and dow wants to review it

said telerate discussed the new forecast with dow jones at a 
meeting tuesday and said he expects the two sides to meet again

investor saul steinberg who in recent months had 
cut his stake in ual corp filed wednesday for federal approval to 
purchase more than 15 percent of the parent of united airlines 
ual announced that the filing was imminent but refused to 
comment further 
a spokesman for new yorkbased reliance group holdings inc 
which steinberg chairs confirmed that the company filed for 
clearance with the federal trade commission and the justice 
department as required by federal antitrust law but the spokesman 
refused to comment further 
steinberg sold nearly 500000 shares of ual stock when it 
rocketed to the 280290pershare range following a buyout offer 
by california billionaire marvin davis and the ual boards 
acceptance of a proposed 675 billion pilotmanagement bid 
ual stock plummeted more than 100 after the pilotmanagement 
group failed to get financing for the deal that announcement 
helped to trigger an oct 13 stock market plunge 
ual stock closed 1 higher at 177 wednesday 
both davis and the pilots have said they are exploring the 
possibility of making a new bid 
kathie hardin a spokeswoman for the air line pilots 
association would not comment on the reliance filing and refused 
to say whether alpa had been contacted by reliance 
spokesmen for the international association of machinists who 
rebuffed davis latest advances could not be reached for comment 
the machinists refused to join the pilotmanagement buyout plan 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission oct 3 
reliance said it had sold 499000 shares of ual common stock since 
sept 5 for a total of 1428 million no reason for the sale was 
given in the filing 
the sale cut steinbergs holding in ual to 102 million shares 
or 47 percent previously he had held 699 percent of uals shares 
an airline industry analyst said it was more likely that 
steinberg is looking to make a profit than maneuvering for a 
takeover attempt 
so far hes made a real lot of money said stephen dexter 
of kemper financial services inc in chicago 
considering this fiasco weve just seen saul steinberg may be 
speculating that the board and ual chairman steve wolf are under 
pressure to do something to reward shareholders such as a 
special dividend or a stock repurchase dexter said

two months after announcing a worldwide 
restructuring campbell soup co said wednesday that r gordon 
mcgovern president and chief executive officer plans to take an 
early retirement 
mcgovern decided to step down for personal reasons robert j 
vlasic chairman of campbell said in a statement mcgovern had 
been expected to retire in october 1991 
in trading on the new york stock exchange campbell climbed 
337 a share to 4712 
but john m mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said he was not surprised by the resignation to 
put it in baseball terms the team wasnt winning mcmillin said 
in september campbell reported fiscal 1989 earnings of 13 
million down sharply from the previous year because of a 343 
million corporate restructuring charge the restructuring included 
the closing of manufacturing plants in new jersey maryland and 
tennessee with a loss of 2800 jobs 
the restructuring of the nations largest soup maker came four 
months after the death of john t dorrance jr the son of the 
inventor of condensed soup who hesitated to lay off workers or 
close plants 
it shows the powerful changes that are taking place within 
campbell soups said mcmillin 
the board had clearly been unhappy with campbells performance 
in recent years and last november vlasic was tapped for the 
chairman slot over mcgovern 
the new shareholders as well as the old were somewhat 
dissatisified said mcmillin whether he was fired or resigned 
is a question of semantics 
the retirement is effective nov 15 two days before the 
companys annual shareholders meeting analysts say shareholders 
will move quickly to find sucessor for mcgovern who joined 
campbells pepperidge farm subsidiary in 1956 as a management 
trainee in downington pa 
i think the board would feel comfortable in accepting the 
resignation paving the road for new leadership said marvin b 
roffman an analyst with the brokerage firm of janney montgomery 
scott inc in philadelphia 
dorrances heirs have attempted to squelch rumors that the 
company may be up for sale but analysts said the possibility 
remains 
i dont necessarily think a sale of the company is imminent 
but clearly the next alternative if the new management cant get 
this company up and running might be the sale of the company 
mcmillin said 
mcgovern who became president and ceo in 1980 has withdrawn 
his name as a candidate for reelection at the meeting the company 
said a replacement nominee will not be designated the company 
said 
i leave with pride in our accomplishments and in the 
management team now in place and with confidence in the companys 
strategies for the future the 63yearold mcgovern said in a 
statement released by the company the ceo succession process is 
well along and ive decided for personal reasons to take early 
retirement 
campbell also announced the appointment wednesday of herbert m 
baum 53 and edwin harper 47 as executive vice presidents baum 
is president of campbell usa and harper is a senior vice 
president and chief financial officer 
harper and baum will assume the daytoday operation of the 
company on an interim basis the company said both are also 
candidates to succeed mcgovern 
campbell spokesman james moran said the board of directors 
formed a management succession committee about a year ago in 
anticipation of mcgoverns retirement he said a successor will not 
be named at the shareholders meeting 
mcgovern was getting up there in years moran said they 
had begun a search for a successor for him knowing he would 
retire one day 
under mcgovern campbells worldwide sales rose from 28 
billion to 57 billion and net earnings climbed from 130 million 
to 274 million the company said campbells sells about five 
billion cans of soup a year garnering about 65 percent of the 22 
billion retail soup market

upjohn co announced an early retirement 
plan wednesday it expected would trim as many as 350 workers from 
the companys us payroll of 12000 to 13000 employees 
upjohn spokesman bob larue said there was no estimate of how 
much money the program would save the pharmaceutical company 
because that depends on how many workers take the retirement offer 
he said about 1100 employees are eligible and that 50 percent 
to 60 percent of them would take part in the program about half 
the anticipated vacancies created by the retirement program might 
be filled with new workers larue said 
no part of the companys us business was exempt from the 
program 
over the past two years we have followed a strategy in which 
we exercised budget constraints and implemented an effective 
headcount control program upjohn chairman theodore cooper said 
in a statement by offering attractive terms to employees who are 
on the retirement threshold we can further our strategic 
objectives by accelerating our corporate restructuring 
employees aged 55 or older whose combined age and experience 
with the company add up to 75 are eligible a formula based on 
seniority and other matters could boost retirement pay 10 percent 
to 20 percent per employee

the chicago mercantile exchange on wednesday 
announced plans for tougher price limits on stockindex futures 
that would further restrict certain types of program trading during 
a stockmarket collapse 
the biggest proposed change in the socalled circuit 
breakers is a 40 percent tighter restriction in how far the price 
of standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures can fall before the 
merc halts selling for the rest of a days session 
the proposals which require approval by the federal commodity 
futures trading commission also would add a fourth circuit breaker 
to the three that have been in effect for more than a year 
the merc proposals come amid a barrage of criticism of certain 
computerized or program trading strategies involving stockindex 
futures that some experts blame for recent wild price swings in the 
stock market 
the merc is the worlds biggest market for the most popular 
stockindex futures those based on the standard amp poors index of 
500 stocks traded on the new york stock exchange 
an sampp 500 future is a contract to buy or sell all 500 of those 
stocks at a specified price by a specified date 
in a program trading technique called index arbitrage traders 
use computers to rapidly buy and sell huge blocks of stocks in new 
york and the underlying stockindex futures in chicago in an 
attempt to profit from minute differences in prices on the two 
markets 
chicago merc officials said their proposed modifications stemmed 
from studies of the sharp market drops on oct 13 and 24 when some 
of the circuit breakers were triggered 
under the proposals 
sampp 500 futures would be allowed to fall no more than 5 points 
the equivalent of 40 points in the dow jones industrial average 
during the first 10 minutes of trading currently the 5pointdrop 
restriction lapses if the sampp contract rebounds from that lower 
level within the 10minute period 
the current limit of a 12point drop in the sampp contract 
roughly equal to 100 dow points would remain in effect halting 
selling below that level for 30 minutes 
under a new rule if the futures market falls 20 sampp points 
which is roughly equivalent to 150 dow points trading below that 
level would be halted for one hour if the 20point limit is

ralston purina co a pet food baker and 
battery maker reported wednesday a 46 percent drop in earnings for 
its fiscal fourth quarter due mainly to a onetime charge to close 
two plants and eliminate some jobs 
its profit for the fiscal year which ended sept 30 increased 
8 percent compared with last year while sales were up 13 percent 
for the quarter its profit totaled 452 million or 65 cents a 
share down from 849 million or 124 a share for the same 
period a year ago 
sales for the quarter were 176 billion up slightly from 155 
billion in the same quarter last year 
the profit decline came in part because of a 314 million 
pretax charge the company took to close a battery plant in 
greenville sc and a bakery in cincinnati said ralston 
spokesman patrick farrell 
he said the company also made staff cuts at its computer 
operations center in st louis that figured into the charge 
even without the charges however its profit would have slipped 
by nearly 10 percent farrell said 
he said the company the largest seller of dry dog food and 
moist and dry cat food had higher advertising and promotion costs 
sold less pet food and incurred higher costs for pet food 
ingredients in the quarter 
the companys continental baking subsidiary had slightly higher 
profits in the quarter but its eveready battery business suffered 
a decrease primarily because of the plant closing and economic 
problems in south america 
the company does not provide specific financial data about its 
various subsidiaries 
for the fiscal year net earnings were 4225 million up from 
last years 3878 million sales were 665 billion compared with 
587 billion in 1988

the los angeles herald examiner once the 
nations largest afternoon newspaper announced wednesday it would 
publish its last edition on thursday 
the announcement was made in a tearful 1 pm meeting called in 
the newsroom by robert danzig hearst corp vice president and 
general manager of hearst newspapers who spoke from atop the copy 
desk 
the closure was attributed to heavy losses and a lack of 
suitable buyers since the paper was formally placed for sale this 
past summer herald officials and analysts said the underlying 
causes were a bitter strike that began in 1967 combined with 
competitive problems shared by all afternoon papers 
danzig said hearst had tried everything it could to revive the 
paper after the 10year strike 
we committed ourself to firstrate editorial leadership fine 
marketing professionals and i think quite good promotion programs 
and aggressive marketing he said at an afternoon news conference 
but the net result was that the pattern of those prior 10 
years seemed to have been concretized and we were unable to change 
the economics 
the papers 831 employees were told they would receive 60 days 
severance pay and help looking for work with longtime staffers 
getting additional benefits 
employees greeted the news with emotional embraces as editor 
maxwell mccrohon urged them to put out a hell of a last edition 
the newspaper had considered going to a tabloid format for seven 
years and probably a dozen prototypes were produced but it 
remained a fullsized newspaper to the end 
founded by william randolph hearst in 1903 as the los angeles 
examiner the herald was put up for sale by the hearst corp the 
company cited intense pressure from the los angeles times the 
citys dominant daily with five times the heralds daily 
circulation 
the herald which switched to morning publication in 1981 also 
had to wrestle with increasingly successful suburban papers like 
the orange county register based in santa ana and the los angeles 
daily news based in the san fernando valley 
in its dying days the newspaper covered local politics 
aggressively breaking a number of stories on embattled mayor tom 
bradley that embarrassed the times while it provided little 
staffproduced coverage of washington or international affairs its 
entertainment coverage sports columnists and local reporting were 
highly regarded 
the herald which reached its highest circulation of 729000 in 
1967 had an average circulation of 238392 daily and 183122 
sunday for the six months ended march 31 compared with the times 
1119840 daily and 1423310 sunday according to figures compiled 
to audit bureau of circulations 
its building built in 1912 is a spanishstyle los angeles 
landmark with colorful domes and tile roof outside and baroque 
touches inside it was designed by julia morgan the architect 
responsible for the hearst castle near san luis obispo 
those who had expressed interest in buying the paper included 
billionaires kirk kerkorian marvin davis and rupert murdoch and 
the company that owns the toronto sun an employee buyout plan also 
fizzled 
an investor who had examined the heralds books who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the paper was losing 15 million per 
month 
despite inquiries from around the world and extensive 
discussion with numerous parties we were unable to find a 
purchaser that could provide the financial capacity to sustain the 
business said danzig the hearst vice president 
although operating at a financial deficit for more than two 
decades there was never a deficit in the quality and the vigor of 
its editorial commitment to the people of los angeles it has been 
a losing business but a winning newspaper 
by the time the herald converted to morning publication the 
game was over said john morton a newspaper analyst at the 
lynch jones amp ryan brokerage firm 
the herald examiner is a classic example of a newspaper that 
suffered for many years by being in the afternoon position he 
said 
like other hearst newspapers the herald was oriented toward 
the bluecollar market and that market left for television in 
droves back in the 1950s and 1960s morton said 
mccrohon the editor also attributed the papers fall to a 
long bitter strike on dec 15 1967 members of the los angeles 
newspaper guild launched the sometimes violent 10year strike 
which was never technically settled

boeing cos discussions with three japanese 
aerospace companies about helping develop boeings new 767x 
jetliner are a logical outgrowth of the companys decadelong 
relationship with the firms a boeing spokesman said wednesday 
while boeing may want help in bearing the risk of developing a 
multibilliondollar new plane the japanese companies see a 
partnership as a way to learn the commercial aircraft business 
some experts on international trade are worried what might 
happen if the japanese learn too well 
in tokyo a spokesman for kawasaki heavy industries ltd said 
wednesday that chairman kenko hasegawa and the chairmen of 
mitsubishi heavy industries ltd and fuji heavy industries ltd 
received official invitations from boeing to join in the design 
production and sale of the 767x 
it will allow us to learn both the hard and soft aspects of 
the airplane industry from a toplevel firm said a mitsubishi 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the three companies have long worked with boeing as 
subcontractors and were partners with the seattle aerospace company 
on a smaller jet that was never built 
the widebody 767x would be boeings entry in the 300passenger 
jetliner class now dominated by the european consortium airbus 
industrie and mcdonnell douglas corp 
no decision has been made to build the plane boeing spokesman 
dick schleh said the 767x has been under consideration for more 
than a year and discussions with fuji kawasaki and mitsubishi have 
been proceeding for three months or more 
the three have worked with boeing since the mid1970s and 
along with italys aeritalia have been risksharing partners 
on the 767 which began development 11 years ago such partners 
boeing says share in financial risks and rewards of an aircraft 
program rather than just being paid for components 
the japanese companies make fuselage panels for the twinengine 
widebody 767 they and other japanese firms also are 
subcontractors for boeing 737s 747s and 757s making such parts as 
gearboxes altimeters wing ribs and lavatories 
the extendedrange 767300er can carry 210 passengers in three 
classes 7200 miles and holds up to 290 passengers in an 
alltouristclass configuration boeings nextlargest plane is the 
747 which can haul 412 passengers more than 8000 miles 
what boeing lacks is a plane to compete with airbus a300 a330 
and a340 models which can hold 250 to 335 passengers and 
mcdonnell douglas md11 which holds about 320 
other than to say the 767x is envisioned as falling between the 
767 and 747 schleh and boeing spokesman craig martin wouldnt 
discuss what the plane might look like among possibilities 
mentioned by industry observers is a doubledecker widebody 
fuji kawasaki and mitsubishi were to have a 25 percent share in 
the development of boeings 7j7 a 150passenger plane that was to 
be powered by newtechnology unducted fan engines that 
project announced in 1985 was put on hold when no buyers 
materialized 
when the question of japanese involvement came up then boeing 
commercial airplanes president dean thornton said the japanese 
were going to become involved in a commercial jet program one way 
or another we sure as hell didnt want them to get involved with 
airbus industrie 
japanese involvement with the 767x could range from a supplier 
relationship to a partnership martin said 
the japan economic journal this week estimated the 767xs total 
development cost at 4 billion and said the three japanese firms 
are expected to bear about 20 percent of that 
since world war ii japan has produced just one type of civilian 
airliner a 60passenger turboprop it also makes military planes 
mostly under license from us manufacturers 
it has agreed with the united states on joint development of 
japans next generation jet fighter the fsx that program was 
approved after a hard fight in congress where critics said the 6 
billion project amounted to a giveaway of us technology that 
japan could use to become competitive in the civilian aircraft 
market 
clyde v prestowitz jr a senior associate at the carnegie 
endowment and a former commerce department trade negotiator was 
wary of a boeingjapan deal though he stressed he did not know 
specifics 
he said aerospace has been identified as one of the most 
important industries for japan in the 21st century there is the 
potential for substantial technology transfer to japanese companies 
without getting much back he said

eleventhhour negotiations averted a shutdown of 
chicago missouri and western railway co and put the bankrupt 
companys sale back on track cmampws trustee said wednesday 
under an agreement given tentative approval tuesday by us 
bankruptcy judge john schwartz rio grande industries inc parent 
of southern pacific railroad will purchase cmampws northsouth 
line for 215 million said daniel murray courtappointed trustee 
for the failed railroad company 
schwartz was expected to give the deal final approval next 
tuesday murray said 
without the agreement cmampws cash collateral would have been 
forfeited to creditors and the railroad would have been shut down 
at midnight wednesday the trustee said 
rio grande also will pay 1 million in startup expenses and 
assume responsibility for 11 million in loans the state of 
illinois made last year to keep struggling cmampw afloat 
the state meanwhile has agreed to reduce interest rates on the 
existing loans and extend their payoff periods as well as to 
forgive another 25 million loan by changing it to a grant 
officials said 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan said the state also 
would lend southern pacific 36 million to install continuous 
welded rails along the entire northsouth route 
the route runs 632 miles from joliet to the kansas city area it 
is mainly used for freight but amtrak also uses it to make daily 
roundtrip passenger runs between chicago and st louis 
a shutdown of the line would have left more than 100 businesses 
in illinois and missouri without rail service an estimated 300000 
people travel the route annually 
hartigan representatives of illinois gov james thompson and 
other state officials entered into negotiations last weekend with 
cmampw and its creditors who sought liquidation of the railroads 
assets to pay back debts totaling more than 100 million 
citicorp north america inc and heller financial inc had asked 
the court to cancel the cmampw contract with amtrak because they said 
the railroad is continuing to lose money on the passenger service 
and has no reasonable prospects of successful reorganization 
pat yoxall a spokeswoman for citicorp said the creditors had 
met with state and cmampw officials but declined to specify what 
agreements had been reached 
all of those groups are part of the discussion yoxall said 
wednesday in a telephone interview we gave the judge 
confirmation that negotiations are ongoing 
negotiations continued with wertheim schroder amp co which seeks 
to purchase the cmampws eastwest lines which run between st louis 
and kansas city and are used for freight 
murray said the wertheim cash proposal will go before schwartz 
on dec 4 
schwartz is considering a proposal submitted tuesday to have 
santa fe railway operate the lines until then the trustee said 
cmampw was created in 1986 as an independent regional railroad 
in april 1988 the railroad filed for protection from creditors 
and reorganization under federal bankruptcy law

company and union met for a third day 
the negotiations concluded wednesday evening with plans to 
resume thursday the 30th day of the walkout in the office of 
federal mediator doug hammond 
meanwhile the states chief economist chang mook sohn said 
wednesday he doubted the strike would have much effect on the 
states robust economy unless it runs at least three more months 
the other factors in the economy are very strong and so far 
are offsetting any impact the strike has had he said 
hammond has said he hoped to keep the two sides meeting until a 
settlement is reached

district lodge 751 international association of machinists and

raises of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent and bonuses of 8 
percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second 
also included were costofliving increases to virtually cover 
inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hours 
per quarter and higher benefits 
boeing officials have said the total dollars in the rejected 
offer would not be increased union leaders have said there can be 
no settlement without more money

eastern airlines added 75 flights wednesday 
pushing the carriers schedule to 775 daily departures 
meanwhile a spokesman for easterns parent texas air corp 
called a vote by the us house to bar airline buyouts by people 
who have taken more than one airline into bankruptcy blatantly 
unconstitutional 
the amendment offered by rep doug bosco dcalif and approved 
283132 tuesday was designed to apply soley to texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo who took continental airlines into bankruptcy in 
1983 and returned to bankruptcy court with eastern earlier this 
year 
i would think the us congress has better things to do than 
to take up its time with an obviously unioninspired amendment 
said spokesman art kent 
eastern resumed service to five caribbean destinations and added 
nonstop flights from miami to los angeles san francisco toronto 
chicago and newark nj among other cities eastern added 29 
daily departures from its miami home giving it 65 flights 
obviously it puts us that much closer to our goal of 800 
announced earlier company spokesman robin matell said were 
not only on target but were ahead of schedule 
eastern announced in april more than a month after being hit 
with a crippling strike by its three unions that it would rebuild 
with a goal of 800 flights by year end company executives recently 
said theyre shooting for 1000 daily flights by early next year 
compared with nearly 1100 before the strike that started march 4 
matell said eastern plans to have 835 daily flights by dec 2 
it returned wednesday to montego bay jamaica st martin grand 
cayman antigua and nassau bahamas 
the latest schedule boost came as easterns creditors were 
studying the companys revised reorganization plan for coming out 
of chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the creditors committee will 
meet in new york next tuesday to vote on easterns plan 
union officials have said easterns schedule increases rely on 
planes and pilots from texas air corp sister continental airlines 
and wont generate enough revenue to make eastern viable the 
unions say 10 percent to 15 percent of eastern flights are flown by 
leased continental planes and crews meaning houstonbased 
continental is draining cash from eastern 
matell said only 16 continental planes and crews were being 
used accounting for about 5 percent of easterns schedule 
meanwhile a poll published wednesday indicated more floridians 
think the striking eastern unions are in the right than support 
managements position 
however the largest group of respondents in the florida 
international universityflorida poll said they were unfamiliar 
with the strike 
the poll conducted for the miami herald indicated that 31 
percent of floridians think the unions are in the right and 21 
percent think management is right some 33 percent said they were 
unfamiliar with the issues while 15 percent said they werent sure 
who was right or had no response 
in south florida 33 percent said the unions were right and 27 
percent thought management was right 
the poll was based on telephone interviews with 1232 randomly 
selected florida adults from aug 28 through sept 21 the margin 
of error for the statewide sample was plus or minus three points 
hank weber a spokesman for the striking pilots said the poll 
reinforces what weve known all along of people familiar with 
the situation 50 percent more think we are correct than think we 
are incorrect 
the pilots union won a legal victory tuesday when a federal 
arbitrator ruled that eastern must pay pilots an estimated 60 
million to 100 million in back pay 
the grievance filed three years ago stemmed from a 1986 
agreement before texas air bought eastern the pilots agreed to 20 
percent pay cuts but said they were promised any increases for 
other workers groups would be matched 
easterns new owners claimed the agreement was invalid and 
rejected the pilots request for an 8 percent increase to match one 
given subsequently to members of the machinists union 
matell said the airline might appeal 
needless to say we are very disappointed by the ruling since 
it would involve a potential financial obligation by the company if 
the decision is sustained an obligation that is totally 
unwarranted matell said 
arbitrator j ralph beaird of athens ga ruled tuesday in the 
pilots favor under his ruling the pilots would also receive 8 
percent more in all future paychecks pilots attorney james linsey 
said the pilots in a separate case are seeking 20 percent increases 
to match hikes given eastern management and maintenance supervisors 
the backpay award could be stayed by a federal bankruptcy judge 
while eastern reorganizes
