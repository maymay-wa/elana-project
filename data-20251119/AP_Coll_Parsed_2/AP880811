burmese troops killed at least 15 more people thursday a crowd 
of thousands had soldiers surrounded in a rangoon suburb and the 
government gave its first hint that an end to the protests might 
bring concessions 
coupled with the offer to consider the peoples legitimate 
requests however was a stern declaration by the armed forces 
commander that burma is threatened by the anarchy of the 
violencemakers 
rangoon radio said protesters who demand that president sein 
lwin be ousted were preparing firebombs and planning to 
escalate violence but western diplomats in the burmese capital 
reported no large demonstrations thursday tens of thousands had 
been in the streets the previous two days 
a senior western diplomat in rangoon said all gasoline stations 
were closed thursday apparently as a precaution against arson and 
the manufacture of firebombs 
broadcasts monitored in bangkok thailand said 15 people were 
killed and 81 wounded in the third day of street confrontations in 
which security forces have opened fire repeatedly to disperse 
crowds according to official figures 95 people have been killed 
and 240 wounded in burma since violence began tuesday 
the radio said thursday that 10000 people surrounded an army 
unit the day before in the rangoon suburb of north okkalapa 
shooting had occurred and reinforcements were sent in it said 
three aircraft dropped leaflets warning that security forces would 
shoot unless the crowds dispersed 
diplomats reported clashes in the area thursday the radio said 
without giving details that the only large demonstration in the 
country involved 1000 people in north okkalapa 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
there were reports of continued demonstrations in the suburbs of 
rangoon and in the major northern city of mandalay 
we understand central rangoon appears to be quiet with a heavy 
troop presence in that part of the city she said 
students have circulated a list of demands to diplomats the new 
york times reported in its friday editions among the demands were 
holding a multiparty referendum freedom for jailed government 
opponents an end to martial law and a reduction in the cost of 
living the newspaper reported it said it was unclear whether the 
demands had been presented to the government 
premier tun tin promised on rangoon radio thursday night that 
authorities will seriously consider legitimate requests of the 
people in accordance with the law 
he said planned economic reforms will be implemently urgently to 
improve living conditions but only if the violence ends diplomats 
say economic crisis and rampant inflation are among the reasons for 
the uprising that began after sein lwin a former general assumed 
power two weeks ago in the nation of 38 million people 
sau maung the armed forces commander said in the same 
broadcast the army would continue its tough response he said 
soldiers were restrained at first but that changed when 
dishonest elements took over the protests the people are now 
facing anarchy of the violencemakers he said 
diplomats said security forces in north okkalapa where the 
soldiers were surrounded were attacked wednesday by residents 
armed with weapons either captured or provided by defectors from 
the military 
they cited unconfirmed reports that at least two truckloads of 
soldiers joined the protesters 
earlier radio reports said mobs beheaded three policemen 
wednesday in north okkalapa and south okkalapa 
the senior western diplomat said protesters initially tried to 
avoid clashes but became enraged after unprovoked killings tuesday 
on wednesday he said protesters began confronting soldiers and 
in effect defying them to shoot 
he said protesters began piling bricks trees and stones on 
streets wednesday night to block military vehicles he said some 
firearms may have been captured but most weapons werek such 
makeshift items as spears made of stripped umbrellas 
these were unarmed peaceful demonstrators and they still are 
mostly but now theyve gotten more violent he said 
protesters were said to have taken over pegu about 45 miles 
northeast of rangoon with no response from the army the diplomat 
said 
travelers from rangoon said the city of 35 million was at a 
virtual standstill with most shops offices and markets closed 
they said buildings were pocked by bullets and bloodstains marked 
the locations of street fights 
martial law was imposed on the capital after a student march 
aug 3 and an 8 pm4 am curfew took effect tuesday 
mrs oakley said in washington that a new advisory was issued 
for americans warning them not to travel to burma britain france 
and japan have issued such warnings and france advised french 
tourists in burma to leave 
britain denied on thursday earlier reports that burmese troops 
clubbed the british military attache with rifle butts during 
protest violence in rangoon the foreign office said col michael 
bremridge was held for about two hours in an identity card mixup 
but was treated perfectly reasonably and sensibly 
the protests are by far the largest since a coup by ne win ended 
democracy in burma in 1962 sein lwin became the nations president 
and head of the government party when ne win resigned after 26 
years in power 
protesters accuse sein lwin of ruthlessly suppressing student 
riots in march and june when he was an army general and earlier 
harsh measures against dissenters

senate republican leader bob dole discarding 
normal senate courtesies ignored another gop senators 
longstanding objections thursday night and permitted confirmation 
of a backlog of 45 presidential nominees 
the action filled diplomatic vacancies many of them months old 
at us embassies in nations around the world including el 
salvador lebanon syria bolivia and colombia 
dole said the senate logjam had been caused by sen gordon 
humphrey rnh who had used senate tradition to place a hold 
on president reagans nomination of veteran foreign service officer 
christopher w s ross to be the new us ambassador to algeria 
humphrey apparently had no objections to ross personally but was 
using his senate privileges to gain leverage on an unrelated issue 
he sought to pressure the state department to name a special 
us envoy to resistance forces in afghanistan to coordinate us 
policy during the withdrawal of soviet occupying forces from that 
country 
dole said he had just received a handwritten note from deputy 
secretary of state john whitehead reading in part to solve sen 
humphreys problem we will appoint a special envoy for 
afghanistan 
but the republican leader said he could not find humphrey who 
was away from the senate floor 
nor could he locate any member of humphreys staff 
the senate was about to adjourn until sept 7 on its annual 
labor day recess 
dole said he was reluctant to have the nominations delayed so 
long 
there are 45 nominations being tied up here dole said 
he said he then called whitehead who confirmed the state 
department will appoint a special envoy for afghanistan 
he said he cannot go as far as senator humphrey wants on the 
powers such an envoy will have but he is going to make the 
appointment dole reported 
dole said he was handling the ross nomination separately from 
the others to create a separate record so senator humphrey 
understands we did not do this lightly 
under the circumstances dole said i feel justified in 
waiving senator humphreys hold on the nominee 
the senate then moved by voice votes to confirm the other 
delayed nominees 
at a news conference earlier this week humphrey urged certain 
gop presidential nominee george bush to select a conservative 
running mate 
he replied affirmatively when asked if he would strike dole from 
the list 
dole made no mention of humphreys statement as he acted to end 
the delay on the nominations caused by the new hampshire senators 
objections 
those confirmed included ross and edward p djerejian to be 
ambassador to syria john t mccarthy to be ambassador to lebanon 
thomas e mcnamara to be ambassador to colombia robert s gelbard 
to be ambassador to bolivia john f kordek to be ambassador to 
botswana carl c cundiff to be ambassador to niger john a 
burroughs jr to be ambassador to uganda robert l pugh to be 
ambassador to chad and william h twaddell to be ambassador to 
mauritania 
other confirmed nominations included those of william h fite to 
be an assistant director of the arms control and disarmament 
agency martin h newlin to represent the united states at the 
international atomic energy agency and don e newquist to be a 
member of the us international trade commission

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca says he 
holds no grudges against henry ford ii for firing him a decade ago 
preferring to remember the times when they went hunting went to 
parties or caroused europe together 
my difficulty with henry ford was over long before he died 
last year the 63yearold iacocca wrote in aug 29s fortune 
magazine which was made available wednesday 
the grandson of fords founder died last september after more 
than 40 years at the helm of the nations secondlargest automaker 
iacocca who rose to stardom in the auto industry after creating 
the superpopular mustang was fired after more than 20 years at 
ford motor co in 1978 he has been at chrysler since then and is 
credited with putting the oncetroubled company back on its feet 
with the help of 12 billion in governmentguaranteed loans 
a lot of people told me henry ford ii did me a favor 10 years 
ago by firing me iacocca wrote they said that if i had stayed 
at ford i would have been in a comfortable ivory tower by 
getting canned in 1978 i got thrown into a situation where i became 
a leader 
iacocca had few kind words to say about henry ford ii in his 
first book iacocca an autobiography but in the fortune 
article he recalled how he and ford hunted together we went to 
parties together we caroused europe together 
i remember the 16 good years and not the two bad ones in 1977 
and 1978

ivrysurseine france ap a stones throw from the seine 
river the bit of a drill under a towering white derrick bores a 
hole under suburban paris in search of oil that might one day be 
dubbed paris crude 
normally i do the north sea drilling superviser lars 
froybu said wednesday during a tour of the site this is quite 
different 
there you are in the sea and live on a rig for 24 hours a 
day here 10 minutes away you can find lots of good restaurants 
youre drilling in civilization 
societe nationale elf aquitaine a stateowned oil company 
started sinking the exploratory well at ivry on the southern edge 
of paris tuesday it is the first of several such wells planned 
under the parisile de france permit which covers paris and its 
northern eastern and southern suburbs 
the permit was awarded in december 1985 to elf total compagnie 
francaises des petroles and british petroleum after competition 
reached a pinnacle in the search for oil in the paris basin 50000 
square miles stretching east from paris to the west german border 
for years there have been rumblings that the city of light 
itself might be sitting on crude a theory that provoked smiles 
cute headlines and gags about industrializing the eiffel tower 
oil companies are less fanciful the elftotalbp association 
already has spent 116 million on its permit most of it for 
seismic tests according to the chief of elfs french operations 
bruno weymuller 
the paris basin contains 40 million tons of known oil reserves 
48 operating wells and about 600 exploratory wells 
with a discovery rate of 1 in 12 wells compared to the 1 in 20 
average the basin is increasingly drawing foreign oil companies 
although oil executives concede it will never be houston 
but no one dared go into this area before louis prudhomme 
elfs assistant director of french operations said of the region 
about 10 million people live in the 587 square miles covered by 
the permit and elf is making a special effort to be discreet at 
least as discreet as one can be with a 165foot oil derrick 
operating roundtheclock 
motors powering the drill are kept in sheds beside the derrick 
a wall to cut noise was erected to help shield residents of an 
apartment block across the street a special phone line was 
installed to receive complaints 
weve tried to protect the environment to a maximum said 
prudhomme 
ivry on the left bank of the seine is one of several sites 
considered promising on the basis of seismic tests 
the objective of the ivry drilling is in fact about a halfmile 
from the derrick on the right bank of the seine that means the 
bit grinding its way 2000 yards into the earth must follow a 
deviated course complicating drilling officials said 
by wednesday morning a hole 2067 foot deep had been bored the 
drilling superviser said 
the operation is to be completed in about three weeks a 
positive find would mean boring appreciation wells nearby to 
determine the size of the oil deposit according to elf officials 
total has said it plans to start drilling before the end of the 
year 
limited seismic tests of the capital made two years ago 
revealed that the center of paris was not a geological 
priority elf officials said 
is there oil under paris we will only know when weve 
drilled that is the moment of truth prudhomme said weve 
already staked out forage sites if one day we have to work in 
paris 
a derrick could be erected at a stadium or in an unused train 
station or abandoned apartment buildings according to officials 
who do not rule out rigging a derrick on a boat on the seine 
no one in france stands to get rich overnight by owning land on 
a drilling site the property owner receives a modest rent from 
the oil company but the state controls mineral rights 
parisians easily moved to protest remain placid in the face of 
the ivry drilling 
if they put a gas pump on my route and lower the price thats 
all i care about said jeanlouis ribolla a waiter near the 
champs elysees 
finding oil in the place de la concorde would be quite 
refined he added winking

the navy has canceled a bathing suit 
fashion show intended to give a parting charge to the crew of 
the uss enterprise before the aircraft carrier takes off for two 
weeks of training at sea 
capt robert spane commander of the nuclearpowered aircraft 
carrier said he canceled the show after reading news reports that 
the show could be construed as sexually oriented entertainment 
forbidden under naval regulations 
more than 3000 men were scheduled to crowd the decks for a 
halfhour show at the alameda naval air station base the show was 
to feature models in bathing suits and aerobic wear bouncing 
rhythmically to pop music 
the boys are going to be charged up before they go out for two 
weeks ivan cutler a spokesman for the swimwear and aerobics 
clothing manufacturer that was to put on the show said tuesday 
before the cancellation he called the scheduled show a morale 
booster 
however navy regulations ban sexually oriented entertainment at 
base clubs stating that entertainment that could conceivably 
result in embarrassment to the navy shall be avoided because it 
could cause abusive behavior toward women who serve aboard navy 
ships 
the san franciscobased feminist bookstore news which publishes 
a monthly magazine for womens bookstores called the dance show 
idea outrageous 
it looks like the enterprise brass still havent discerned the 
difference between sex and war said publisher carol seajay 
using women and sexual innuendo to gear men up for war games 
perpetuates that confusion 
on wednesday cutler said he was disappointed the event had been 
canceled 
it was an opportunity to entertain within bounds of 
propriety sailors who respond to a variety of stimulus he

the nottingham playhouse did big business last 
year with agatha christies everpopular and then there were 
none hardly the gritty social realism that made its reputation 
in the 1960s 
the royal shakespeare company better known for its hamlet 
and king lear has had to brush up its shakespeare with cole 
porters musical kiss me kate 
such forays into lowerbrow fare may horrify the purists but 
britains governmentfunded theaters say they have little choice 
given rising production costs and the hostility of prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative government toward subsidizing the 
arts 
the new mood was set last year by arts minister richard luce 
when he declared its time the arts world got rid of its 
welfarestate mentality 
the notion of taxpayers money funding the arts has been 
sacrosanct since world war ii this year the state is giving 690 
million to the arts about onethird of it to theaters through the 
quasigovernmental arts council 
but some critics suggest the erosion of subsidy means an erosion 
of quality they point to the rscs embarrassment over carrie 
its 7 million musical that flopped on broadway after a short run 
at stratford in february 
some argue that the theater handsomely repays the governments 
investment peter hall artistic director of the national theater 
said last year it is simply daft economics let alone daft 
culture to apply a dogmatic view that subsidy is sick and bad 
i dont believe the arts cost britain a penny he said it 
has not occurred to the current government that the arts is one of 
the few absolute success stories of britain since the war 
the policy studies institute a nonprofit research group 
published a recent study showing that the arts are a 17 
billionayear sector of the british economy and that onefourth 
of tourist income is spent on cultural activity 
it said the arts account for 25 percent of all spending on 
goods and services in britain and directly employ 496000 people 
or 21 percent of the work force 
but theater insiders concede that the subsidies battle is lost 
and greater concessions to commercialism are inevitable 
some even find it desirable it behooves us to go out and make 
our money from time to time and to have that commercial hard 
knack terry hands artistic director of the rsc and director of 
carrie said recently in an interview with the guardian 
newspaper 
the rsc faced a 189 million deficit last year and briefly 
considered closing its stratford base it was rescued largely by a 
255 million grant from the royal insurance company and by the 
commercial success of les miserables the tony awardwinning 
musical based on victor hugos 1862 novel 
les miserables a hit here and on broadway is bringing the 
company up to 17 million a year in worldwide royalties 
in london christopher hamptons longrunning les liaisons 
dangereuses has been netting the rsc 260000 a year since it 
began an openended commercial run in october 1986 
with profits of up to 500000 from kiss me kate and a 
344000 fee for the illfated carrie even its less 
commercially successful ventures have brought the rsc some cash 
still the rsc is not alone in its new bout with commercialism 
the national theater the countrys other major subsidized 
company has been playing safe with such broadway plays as neil 
simons brighton beach memoirs and brian clarks the 
petition and undemanding revivals such as arthur wing pineros 
the magistrate and george abbott and john cecil holms three 
men on a horse 
the national says 52 percent of its annual turnover is now 
selfearned since 1985 it says its subsidy of over 12 million 
has fallen by over 35 million in real terms 
the nottingham playhouse which began in 1963 producing such 
offbeat plays as frank wedekinds lulu and peter barnes the 
ruling class now leans heavily toward agatha christie and 
farces such as fur coat and no knickers to keep costs down 
and audiences up 
some theaters have come up with novel ways to make ends meet 
the crucible theater in sheffield rented out its auditorium for 
a billiards championship so it could go on financing rarely seen 
classics and daring new material 
its the weird situation of buildings built on one philosophy 
having to survive in a society operating on another philosophy 
said clare venables the crucibles artistic director in an 
interview 
the crucible is one of many playhouses built in provincial 
cities in the 1960s when the prevailing social philosophy held that 
the state had a duty to foster the arts 
the aspirations of the 60s look sick today wrote paul 
allen in the new statesman the arts he said are regarded with 
something surprisingly akin to hatred in the new sourer 
political climate 
the nationals hall agreed theres a feeling now in the 
subsidized sector and i speak not for myself but for my 
colleagues that we are simply not wanted 
they wish we would just go away so they could turn the whole 
thing into the american model that would be a disaster 
commercial sponsorship is relatively new in britain and viewed 
with some suspicion but theaters are learning to live with it 
the rscs press releases say sponsored by royal insurance 
recent theater programs at the national emblazoned the logos of 
citicorpcitibank and ladbroke group plc over such classics as 
the threepenny opera and antony and cleopatra 
but sponsorship has its limitations earlier this year the 
national lost an unnamed backer for a revival of john fords 1633 
tis pity shes a whore because the firm balked at the title 
and ended up financing the production from its own funds 
what were talking about is creative life depending on 
sponsorship rather than being something that sprang from a 
community activity says patsy silburn chairwoman of the east 
midlands branch of the arts council 
there are fewer and fewer places where one could say with any 
conviction theres a vibrant and dynamic theater

traffic across this 
rickety bridge has swelled as thousands of arabs stream into jordan 
for what many fear could be a final visit now that jordan has 
severed ties with the west bank 
the action by king hussein of jordan has caused widespread 
concern among palestinians that jordan will close the bridge their 
primary link to relatives in the arab world and the west banks 
major export avenue 
we have serious concerns about our future said salwa abu 
kaf of jerusalem as she left for amman with her five small children 
this week 
i am going to spend two weeks with my parents king hussein 
might decide to close the bridges and if he does it will be my 
last visit said mrs abu kaf 27 who wore a traditional 
anklelength moslem dress and scarf 
israeli officials say movement across the allenby and damiya 
bridges into jordan has increased by more than 30 percent since 
husseins july 31 announcement that he was cutting ties with arabs 
in the occupied lands 
the king scrapped a 13 billion development plan for the 
territories laid off 21200 jordanian employees in the west bank 
and gaza strip and shut a ministry for territorial affairs in his 
government jordan had maintained administrative ties even though 
israel captured the territories in 1967 
despite a pledge to keep the bridges open and honor all 
jordanian passports husseins steps raised fears among west bank 
palestinians they may no longer be allowed to travel to jordan or 
settle there as jordanian citizens 
most of the west banks 850000 palestinians and some of the 
650000 arabs who live in gaza hold jordanian passports 
twothirds of jordans 35 million people are palestinians with 
jordanian passports many with relatives in the occupied lands 
everyone carrying a jordanian passport is running scared with 
this said moussa assad a palestinian migrant farm worker in 
saudi arabia who said he crosses the bridge seven times a year to 
visit his family in gaza city 
if the king closes the bridge and takes away our passports it 
is the end for me i wont be able to travel to work to make 
money for my family many of us have no other way to survive 
said assad 41 fingering a string of flourescent green worry beads 
mohammed faiz danah of hebron said he would leave his nursing 
job in saudi arabia if the bridges were closed 
palestine is my country i have my own land my business my 
mother my sons here i am a foreigner in saudi arabia danah 
said 
some palestinians said they planned to seek residence in jordan 
so their families would not be separated 
if tomorrow they close the bridges what are we going to do 
my husband is dead i have nothing here said 63yearold hamdah 
masherehdah who said she planned to move in with her sister and 
son in amman 
pop music blared through loudspeakers tuesday as hundreds of 
palestinians streamed into the allenbys vast modern passenger 
terminal set among sand dunes just yards from the wooden plank 
bridge 
because of the increased volume israeli officials say they are 
keeping the bridges open an extra three hours each day and have 
waived the requirement that palestinians pay their taxes before 
being allowed to cross into jordan 
in the last days there has been more pressure on people to 
cross to take care of their affairs we are trying to make the 
passage easier said west bank military government spokesman 
olivier rafowicz 
some west bank businessmen expressed concern husseins measures 
may hurt palestinian exporters who rely on the bridges 
im afraid for the future if theres no way to export ill 
have to close my factory fire my 13 workers and ill be ruined 
said ahmed soubeh who owns a stonecutting firm in bethlehem that 
exports stone through jordan 
the jordanian decisions are being taken very quickly without 
prior notice this is the scary part who knows what tomorrow will 
hold we are pawns in the whole picture soubeh said 
a hebron building contractor abdulghar dufesh said west bank 
builders are owed 20 million for projects contracted by jordan 
will we be paid and when all we contractors are worried and 
wringing our hands

summer rains in mexicos northwest have 
eased severe drought conditions in the vital agricultural and 
cattle ranching region but farm leaders say the crisis isnt over 
weve been blessed by rains it doesnt solve the problem but 
it does raise our spirits said hector roman president of the 
sonora state confederation of agriculture organizations 
a yearlong drought in mexicos northwestern grainbelt sapped 
water supplies forcing major reductions in crop plantings last 
fall and this spring in northwestern sonora and sinaloa states 
northern baja california chihuahua and coahuila states still 
are suffering effects of the drought that parched crops and turned 
pastures into barren fields 
in some areas of sonora and chihuahua the spring planting season 
was scrapped altogether as dam levels fell to less than 10 percent 
of capacity 
most affected are sorghum soybeans corn rice and wheat 
at least 660000 head of cattle have died mostly in the 
northwest because of a lack of water and feed caused by the 
drought according to an agriculture department report 
beef packers have been importing us cattle in the northwestern 
state of chihauhua for several weeks in monterrey capital of 
northeastern nuevo leon state such imports began in july under a 
governmentapproved plan to ensure supplies and keep prices down 
the damage has been done said jose antonio mendoza manager 
of the confederation of agriculture associations in sinaloa state 
he said 82 percent of more than 900000 acres normally planted with 
soybeans sorghum and rice were idled by the drought 
mendoza said the federation estimates sinaloa farmers have lost 
about 330 million in direct income 
for the first time in about 15 years sinaloa states gross 
product wont increase in fact itll fall by about 4 percent he 
said in an interview from the state capital of culiacan 
mendoza estimated about 70 percent of sinaloas productive 
sector relies on agriculture 
roman said farmers in sonoras mayo valley are scrambling to get 
government credits to buy corn seed now that rains have helped 
recoup water levels 
he said 37000 acres of corn could be planted in the coming 
weeks if the credits are approved but thats still down from the 
150000 acres normally planted in the cycle roman said 
we could be planting corn and now theres no credit said 
roman 
maria luisa elizondo an agricultural economist at the national 
bank of mexico in mexico city said rain in the northwest means 
mexico wont have to import as much wheat corn and soybean as 
feared 
but mexico still is looking at spending 300 million to 500 
million more on imported grains this year than in 1987 she said 
well have to pay more because the products will cost more 
because of the drought in the united states she said 
mendoza said it will have to rain throughout august to assure a 
good water supply for the fall planting season which begins in 
october 
were a lot more optimistic than we were a few weeks ago but 
the level of the dams still isnt sufficient to cover the 
fallwinter season he said 
what we need is a cyclone those always fill up the dams

jewish opinion has been split by a library fund to 
mark the 100th birthday of poet ts eliot who critics say was 
notoriously antisemitic three distinguished jews are among the 
funds supporters 
ts eliots writings were undoubtedly antisemitic and jews 
will not be alone in having qualms about supporting a fund to mark 
his centenary said hayim pinner secretarygeneral of the board 
of deputies of british jews 
eliot was born in st louis in 1888 became a british subject 
and died in britain in 1965 he won the nobel prize for literature 
and britains coveted order of merit 
he was chairman of the privately run london library which has 
appealed for 170000 to establish a trust fund in his name and is 
inviting american donations the funds purpose is to pay the 
subscriptions of students and scholars who otherwise could not 
afford to use the library 
jews associated with the appeal include lewis golden the 
librarys honorary treasurer and a member of the appeal committee 
and patrons sir isaiah berlin the oxford university philosopher 
and lord goodman a leading london lawyer and arts enthusiast 
the london library would have done better to honor one of any 
number of great british writers and poets untainted by race hatred 
at its ugliest pinner said 
david nathan deputy editor of the weekly jewish chronicle 
raised the issue originally he said he believes eliots writings 
helped block the escape of some jews from nazi germany 
i think eliot was responsible in part for creating a climate 
of opinion in the 1930s in which american and british politicians 
and bureaucrats closed the doors to many people who could have been 
rescued from the gas ovens nathan said in an interview 
golden granted that at least one eliot work contained 
objectionable phrases but said the poet ultimately believed 
our culture is based on the legacy of greece rome and israel 
nathan said golden had responded to his complaints by saying 
he wasnt aware of eliots antisemitism 
i have the most enormous admiration for eliot as a poet 
nathan said if i thought he was second rate i wouldnt have 
bothered 
in its appeal the library says eliot is one of the greatest 
figures of 20th century literature his influence is worldwide 
critics say eliots antisemitism is blatant including the 
writing of jew without a capital j to emphasize inferiority 
in the 1927 poem burbank with a baedeker bleistein with a 
cigar eliot wrote the rats are underneath the piles the jew 
is underneath the lot 
eliot said in a lecture in january 1933 as adolf hitler was 
about to take power in germany reasons of race or religion 
combine to make any large number of freethinking jews undesirable 
and a spirit of excessive tolerance is to be deprecated 
nathan said eliot dehumanized jews and that allows racism of 
all kinds 
golden commented although one cannot excuse it the 
objectionable poem by eliot has to be read in the context of the 
attitude prevalent in the 1920s and expressed in some quarters in 
america and elsewhere long before the dreadful consequences of the 
nazis frenzied use of antisemitism as a political weapon burst 
upon the world 
what could be more indicative of eliots ultimate feelings is 
contained in his book notes towards a definition of culture 
published in 1948 where he more than once mentions that our 
culture is based on the legacy of greece rome and israel 
michael hastings who explored eliots strained first marriage 
in a 1985 play called tom and viv said even after he got 
the nobel prize eliot continued to write dozens of racial 
limericks to his friends referring to kikes and niggers i dont 
think its excusable for a nobel laureate to behave in that way 
peter forbes editor of britains leading poetry magazine 
poetry review said i think the antisemitism detracts from 
eliots status as a major culural figure 
many people feel uneasy with his status as a cultural guru 
because of his antisemitism but nobody ever suspected eliot of 
being a progressive he was a famous reactionary 
thomas stearns eliot poet sometime bank clerk playwright and 
publisher was born in st louis on sept 26 1888 and became a 
british subject in 1927 his most famous poem was the waste 
land 
the centenary will be an international event including 
conferences lectures exhibitions and poetry readings in britain 
the united states france spain and japan

at the beginning of the summer the 16 
high school computer jocks were in awe of the 1 million 
supercomputer like the one eta systems inc will award to one of 
their schools friday 
but as their sixweek competition doing research projects on the 
eta10p winds up some of the students admit they have become a 
little blase 
when we first got here the supercomputer looked sooo big 
sooo wonderful and it really is dont get me wrong said 
15yearold doreen pettus who will be a junior this fall at north 
florida christian high school in tallahassee 
but the closer you get to it i mean its just crazy because 
the kids back home think its sooo awesome and were here and 
we got used to it miss pettus said 
the teenage competitors who worked on individual projects but 
are being judged in teams representing four high schools now share 
professionals complaints about the computers slowness in 
making calculations she said the supercomputer has a capacity of 
375 million operations per second according to eta systems 
you get a different perspective of things when youve been 
here miss pettus said 
the contest was the brainchild of etas president carl 
ledbetter who said he hopes it will encourage americans to focus 
more attention on math and science education 
entry forms were mailed to all public and private high schools 
in the country although company officials expected no more than 50 
schools to apply they were amazed when 1475 schools did he said 
the educational testing service helped the company winnow the 
applications to 99 semifinalists and then the final four high 
schools ledbetter said 
in addition to north florida christian the finalists are 
montgomery blair high school in silver spring md thomas 
jefferson high school for science and technology in alexandria 
va and james logan high school in union city calif 
the superquest contest is being judged by an independent 
panel of five scientists headed by kenneth wilson who received the 
1982 nobel prize for his work on computational physics the winning 
school will be announced friday night at a formal dinner with the 
contestants parents in attendance 
besides the supercomputer the top school will get two years of 
operating costs which are worth 7000 to 10000 a month and a 
company employee to advise them on the machines use 
the other schools wont go home emptyhanded though each will 
receive a 50000 control data corp cyber 910 graphics work 
station and each student is getting 3000 for participating eta 
systems is control datas supercomputer division 
this years contestants have been a serious group theres a 
little game playing but not a lot ive actually brought games in 
to try and relieve the tension said neil lincoln the companys 
supercomputer architect 
miss pettus decorated her corner of an eta systems workroom in 
typical schoolgirl fashion with a high school pennant and a poster 
but her description of her project belied her 15 years 
i think the correct title is a life cycle factor simulation 
of the southern bald eagle she said 
she explained that she had obtained data about eagles in florida 
for the last 15 years her model was created to try to mimic that 
data and produce the same results so she could project what will 
happen to the eagles 
around the corner 17yearold daniel mall a senior at 
montgomery blair talked with equal seriousness abut his project 
basically the purpose of my program is to design some type of 
material surface structure to apply to boat hulls he said the 
objective is to reduce drag 
nearby his 16yearold teammate sven hiralal khatri also a 
senior was intent on his computational program evaluating the 
growth of urban regions from washington dc to boston with 
respect to time 
ledbetter acknowledges that the contest in addition to focusing 
attention on science and math education also is powerful 
advertising for the 5yearold company 
it also happened to be coincidental with the fact that for the 
first time in the history of the computer industry its possible 
to put a supercomputer in a high school he said 
for the first time at eta we have developed a supercomputer 
thats aircooled its a little tiny thing you think of them as 
being big behemoths he said 
ledbetter said he hopes eta systems can hire some of this years 
contestants the only problem he said is having to wait until 
theyve earned their college degrees

environmentalists say a new government 
proposal to reduce dangerous lead in drinking water supplies is a 
step in the right direction but one that doesnt go far enough 
the environmental protection agency announced wednesday that it 
plans to issue rules requiring half the nations water plants 
about 53000 to treat water so that it contains less lead the 
metal causes a variety of harmful physical and mental effects 
epa administrator lee a thomas said the plan will have far 
more effect on the drinking water system than any rule we have ever 
put up 
it also could cost some consumers those served by small water 
treatment plants up to 367 a year most consumers could expect 
much smaller increases of between 10 and 30 annually 
while environmentalists said they support any step that will 
reduce lead in drinking supplies they said epas proposal does not 
address the problem of lead contamination from the pipes that carry 
water from the plant to the consumers tap 
marion sills of the environmental defense fund a lobbying 
group said epas proposals were a good first tier but they 
dont provide enough protection if epas solutions fail to 
eliminate the lead at the consumers tap there is little than can 
be done she said 
the proposal constitutes an abdication of epas responsibility 
for ensuring that americans can turn on their faucets and receive 
drinking water free from harmful levels of lead said stephanie 
pollack of the bostonbased conservation law foundation of new 
england 
concentrations of lead in the blood have been associated with a 
variety of health problems lead can impair mental ability in 
children cause premature births and delay physical and mental 
development of babies in adults it can interfere with hearing and 
increase blood pressure and at high levels cause kidney damage 
and anemia 
under epas plan 
water plant operators would be required to begin a corrosion 
control program by treating water with chemicals if water at the 
consumers tap has lead levels greater than 10 parts per billion 
the program also would be required for acidic water 
lead often enters water particularly acidic or corrosive water 
after it leaves the treatment plant acidity is an indicator of 
corrosive water which causes pipes to leach lead before it reaches 
the tap thomas said there is a dramatic reduction in lead if 
the acidity of the water is reduced 
if the average lead levels are greater than 10 parts per 
billion water suppliers must conduct a public education program 
which would include helping consumers have their water tested 
some consumers might have to pay to have lead pipes which the 
us banned two years ago replaced in their homes they also may 
have to allow water to run from the tap for a time before drinking 
water treatment plants would have to reduce lead to a maximum 
contaminant level of 5 parts per billion lead in source water 
supplies is less of a problem than lead collected in pipes 
environmentalists had hoped to see stiffer maximum contaminant 
levels on water at the consumers tap currently the law says the 
levels must be no higher than 50 parts per billion 
but thomas and other epa officials said regulating contaminant 
levels was too complicated so the new proposals if they become 
law will supersede the contaminant level requirement 
before the epa puts the regulations into effect officials must 
advertise them and solicit comment 
congress has given the government a deadline of june 1989 to do 
something about lead levels in 1986 congress amended the safe 
drinking water act to deal with lead

a new law authorizing reparations for 
japaneseamericans interned during world war ii helps lift an 
unjust burden of shame borne by 120000 loyal citizens for four 
decades says a congressman who was among those incarcerated 
today is a moment of great emotion for me a day when hopes 
and dreams have become reality said rep norman mineta 
dcalif as president reagan signed the bill wednesday 
the bill authorizes taxfree payments of 20000 to each of the 
approximately 60000 surviving veterans of wartime camps many of 
whom spent three years in internment 
the japaneseamericans were rounded up and sent to the camps 
under an order issued by president franklin d roosevelt after the 
japanese attack on pearl harbor hawaii on dec 7 1941 plunged 
the united states into world war ii many japaneseamericans 
lobbied for the legislation for years it finally cleared congress 
by a 257156 vote in the house on aug 4 
reagan originally objected to some features of the bill saying 
it would be too costly but he backed the final version which calls 
for a fund of 12 billion with appropriations in any one year 
limited to 500 million legislation providing the actual money 
must still be enacted 
in signing the bill reagan said what is most important in 
this bill has less to do with property than with honor for here we 
admit a wrong here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal 
justice under the law 
mineta who as a child of 10 was taken to an internment camp in 
wyoming said today the unjust burden of shame which 120000 
loyal americans have carried for 46 painful years has at long last 
been lifted 
many of the 250 japaneseamericans who attended the signing 
ceremony said it is the principle of the bill not the money that 
matters 
among them were six members of one family now scattered in 
california georgia and oregon who were taken from a farm near 
stockton calif to an internment camp at rohr ark 
dr walter emori now 47 and an arthritis specialist in medford 
ore was 3 when the family was interned 
we see this as a healing process which says the country 
recognizes that a wrong was being done and in one small way perhaps 
is trying to make amends for this emori said 
in general the japaneseamerican people who went to camp 
recognize that it was an awful hysterical grim time in american 
history and although we all feel badly that we had to go and that 
we were rounded up and not only had our personal belongings but our 
civil liberties taken away from us its kind of understandable as 
to why this should happen he said 
emori noted that his family has prospered since the war as have 
many other japaneseamericans 
we as a family would like to take this gesture the next step 
further and say wed like to give this back to the country for the 
good that came out of the awful he said 
he said the family plans to use its total payments of 120000 
for such a gesture possibly to an endowed professorship at loma 
linda university in california where his parents worked for years 
and where all four of the children went to school both of emoris 
sisters have masters degrees in nursing and his brother is in 
business in california his parents live near him in medford 
katherine nunotani 70 of san francisco who was sent to a camp 
in jerome ark along with her elderly parents when she was 24 
agreed that the money was not important 
i hope nothing like this ever happens to people in the united 
states she said the people who deserve to get it the money 
like my old parents theyre gone 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president always 
endorsed the purpose of the bill even though he balked at the 
price tag 
when asked whether the large number of japaneseamerican voters 
in california a crucial state in the coming presidential election 
influenced reagans decision to sign the measure fitzwater said 
no that was not a factor

an estimated 1000 contra rebels and 
nicaraguan civilians arrived at the nicaraguanhonduran border this 
week many suffering from hunger and disease according to us 
diplomats and rebel leaders 
state department cables said us diplomats who visited the 
honduran side of the border monday reported that the new arrivals 
were in appalling condition 
the documents were made available to the associated press as 
congress considers proposals for providing additional aid to the 
rebels 
the senate on a 4947 vote wednesday evening approved a 
democratic plan to provide 27 million in humanitarian aid to the 
contras who are opposed to nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government senate republicans who had sought military as well as 
humanitarian assistance voted against the proposal as a bloc 
according to the state department cables many of the newly 
arriving refugees were barefoot because their boots had fallen 
apart during the long trek through mountainous country in 
nicaragua and the clothing of some was in tatters 
enrique bermudez a member of the rebel directorate said in a 
telephone interview wednesday from honduras that of the 1000 
nicaraguans 250 were rebel fighters and 750 were civilians 
the cables said the us agency for international development 
which is responsible for managing the humanitarian aid program 
undertook an emergency airlift program to the border area this week 
to assist the new arrivals 
diplomats attached to the us embassy in honduras said in the 
cables that a human crisis of major proportions may be under 
way along the coco river which separates the two countries 
congress approved 177 million in humanitarian aid to the 
contras in late march but because of congressional restrictions 
and restraints written into a ceasefire agreement signed by the 
contras and the sandinistas last march the bulk of that assistance 
has been sent to camps on the honduran side of the border rather 
than into nicaragua itself thousands of rebels have retreated to 
the border area in recent months 
us diplomats dispatched to the scene tell of famished people 
tearing into crates of emergency foodstuff one cable said 
however the cables gave no indication of how many of those who 
arrived at the border were suffering from hunger or disease 
contra sources reported numerous cases of mountain leprosy 
malaria and parasitic infection among the latest arrivals they 
said at least 10 members of the group died en route 
an additional 2000 nicaraguans were reported en route to the 
border area and may be in an even more appalling condition than 
those who arrived this week according to one cable 
another cable said us assistance facilities may be overwhelmed 
if the additional nicaraguans arrive soon 
alfredo cesar a member of the contra political directorate 
said wednesday that there are about 9000 rebels in the border area 
and about 2500 deep inside nicaragua 
in the telephone interview bermudez declined to provide figures 
but said that 65 percent of the rebels are along the border and 35 
percent in nicaragua

carol wilkerson scandalized her mother by 
renting her house for 2500 during the week of the gop national 
convention 
she said republicans youre renting your house to 
republicans 
my mothers a dyedinthewool democrat from new york said 
mrs wilkerson 
actually the house is being rented by a small washington dc 
communications company for two couples and two single women who 
will install and maintain phone lines in the superdome during the 
convention there mrs wilkerson said 
the company she couldnt recall its name is one of many 
renting houses or apartments during the convention aug 1518 
most apartments are being rented to the news media leasing 
specialists say 
the cbs and nbc television networks have rented about 30 
apartments for their staffs in luxury complexes converted from 
warehouses within walking distance of the superdome said brenda 
boettner leasing director at downtown locators 
although the apartments are leased for a month the networks are 
paying three months rent 3240 for one bedroom and 4590 for 
two because the company wont accept shorter corporate rentals 
she said 
downtown locators has to rent furniture buy sheets and dishes 
and otherwise make the apartment ready to live in immediately she 
noted 
the biggest task is gathering individual pieces flower 
pieces pots and pans corelle dishes said carol rockhold 
representative for corporate apartments at tonti management corp 
she said her recent 80hour weeks often have included 12 hours a 
day spent driving to various discount houses to find all of the 
little things that go into furnishing a corporate apartment 
she wouldnt say who was renting from tonti other than that 
most were electronic support people for the news media or what 
they were paying 
but she did say she had rented more than 200 apartments in 
suburban metairie for the convention most of the tenants came 
after the democratic national convention in atlanta ended july 22 
she said 
mrs wilkersons tenants are coming friday 
she said she used their rent check to get some renovation done 
before they arrived 
we had the whole house repainted replastered and were 
getting new drapes she said its great the house is 100 
years old and theres always work to do but the economy has been 
bad in new orleans and wed been putting the work off 
she said several of her friends also are renting their houses

the air force is unhappy with its attempts to 
fix problems on the b1b bomber and the service is trying to find 
a new method to improve the planes capability to avoid enemy 
defenses 
the admission came wednesday as the service replied to the 
latest criticism from rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee and one of congress leading critics of 
the bomber 
the problem concerns the b1bs electronic countermeasures 
which is the complex computerdriven system designed to help the 
longrange atomic bomber outwit soviet air defenses 
by june the air force said the service determined that work 
was behind schedule and the solutions being pursued would not 
provide for the full ecm system maturity the air force desired 
while some ecm problems have been fixed progress has not been 
satisfactory and the management of the ecm system has not met our 
expectations we are currently working out the most appropriate 
action in the face of those facts the air force said in a 
statement 
aspin renewed his criticism this time in a letter to defense 
secretary frank c carlucci and a speech he planned to deliver 
today on the house floor 
there are major questions about the b1bs future he said 
is it really worth it to spend any more money on the b1b 
we have a very serious problem on our hands said aspin 
if a case cannot be made for the b1b i do not see how we can 
spend any more money on it 
the rockwellbuilt bomber was killed by president carter in 
1977 but president reagan reversed that decision four years later 
and approved the purchase of 100 of the planes for 273 billion 
all 100 planes have been built 
reagan said the b1 was needed to replace the aging b52s in the 
nations longrange bomber arsenal until the stealth bomber 
becomes available that plane named after its intended capability 
to evade enemy radar will be rolled out publicly for the first 
time in november 
in the past two years the b1 has run into a series of highly 
publicized problems the air force said many of those problems were 
the sort normally found in new planes 
but solving the ecm problem is not so easy the service admitted 
aspin asked carlucci to tell congress how much it will cost to 
improve the b1b whether the additional money will provide 
additional capability and how the planes mission can be changed 
if the money isnt spent 
unless the questions are answered said aspin we may well be 
faced with the prospect of parking the b1b 
he suggested that perhaps the money which would be used for the 
plane could be used better for other longrange atomic weapons 
such as landbased nuclear missiles 
from now until 2004 the united states will spend a projected 
total of 425 billion for strategic weapons and 242 billion of 
that total or 57 percent will go for bombers he said 
we need to ask ourselves if this money would not be better 
spent on systems that do not have as many uncertainties as the b1b 
program he said

powell as a vice presidential prospect said colin powell is a 
great american and would be an outstanding candidate for any 
position i hope hes listening to this 
fitzwaters daily briefings are piped into the offices of top 
white house aides 
later as reagan bade farewell to visiting icelandic prime 
minister thorsteinn palsson in the white house east room the 
question came up again 
secretary of defense frank c carlucci responding to a 
reporters query nodded toward powell and said with a grin hes 
my candidate 
powell just grinned and shook his head but said nothing 
before he went to the pentagon carlucci had powells job and 
powell was his deputy 
the most recent thing powell has said about his future was in a 
speech to the world affairs council of los angeles on july 19 
as for myself he said i expect to go back to a nice 
quiet foxhole where i can serve my country in a more comfortable 
and perhaps less exposed position 
powell is an army officer and before becoming carluccis deputy 
in january 1987 was commanding general of v corps in frankfurt 
west germany 
the questions about his future were spurred by a column in 
wednesdays washington post by william raspberry suggesting that it 
would be a brilliant idea for bush to pick powell as his 
running mate 
despite the jesting tone of the questions and answers its not 
just a joke 
rep jack kemp rny who is himself a potential vice 
presidential candidate is among those who have mentioned powell as 
a possible bush running mate 
the congressmans press secretary marci robinson said kemp 
believes powell would be an exciting choice with the foreign 
affairs and other experience to be able to serve as president if 
necessary and that politically speaking it would hit the 
democrats at their strength 
powell is the only current white house aide being mentioned as 
even a remote possibility to be bushs running mate although 
former chief of staff howard h baker jr has been reported under 
consideration 
fitzwater was asked jokingly whether he is interested 
im available he replied to laughter i ought to get the 
honesty vote i say it right up front i will be vice president 
just ask i never disparaged the job i thought it was terrific 
when i was on the staff 
fitzwater was bushs press secretary before taking his present 
job

riding the momentum of the political season a 
25 billion child care bill is progressing through congress 
despite unresolved controversies over religion money federal 
regulation and other fundamental issues 
the act for better child care services or abc bill won 
approval on a 1914 vote wednesday in the house education and labor 
committee the vote puts the bill in line for floor action in both 
the house and the senate where a committee approved it last month 
while senators have agreed to at least try to iron out their 
differences before bringing abc to the floor most if not all of 
the controversies aired in the house panels that considered the 
bill are expected to arise again on the house floor 
both versions of the bill authorize 25 billion next year for 
states to improve day care expand it and make it more affordable 
threequarters of the money would be used to help low and 
moderateincome families pay for child care either through vouchers 
or direct payments to providers 
while most of the money would go to the working poor states 
theoretically could give some help to households earning up to 115 
percent of the states median income over 40000 in some places 
committee democrats beat off two attempts to lower the income 
eligibility level citing political reasons among others 
in this congress programs for poor people do not fare nearly 
as well as programs that appear to benefit the middle class said 
rep stephen solarz dny by keeping open the possibility of 
help to the middle class well get the kind of support a fledgling 
program like this needs to survive 
the only significant amendment accepted wednesday lowered the 
age level of eligible children from 15 to 12 attempts to lower it 
to 7 and 10 failed 
rep tom tauke riowa leading the republican onslaught against 
the abc bill claimed it would raise unrealistic expections 
discriminate against families with a parent at home and reduce the 
supply of day care by imposing federal regulations tauke has 
introduced a rival bill revolving around family tax credits and day 
care vouchers 
he and others failed in attempts to eliminate the abc 
requirement for a commission to develop minimum federal health 
safety and training standards the standards would be mandatory for 
those day care homes and centers accepting the federal aid 
churchstate relations are another stumbling block as 
introduced the abc bill would have allowed federal funds to 
churchbased day care centers only if they did not promote 
religion they also would have had to comply with federal bans on 
religious discrimination in hiring and admissions 
the version passed by the house committee says only daycare 
slots paid for by the federal government would have to be available 
to all children regardless of religion the ban on hiring 
discrimination was dropped 
committee chairman augustus hawkins dcalif said in a 
statement after the vote wednesday that while he would prefer 
more precise language ensuring that religious indoctrination will 
not occur i support the current language at this time in order to 
move the bill forward 
he added i want to make clear that as a general proposition 
all persons should have equal access to day care programs supported 
in whole or in part by federal financial assistance 
other republican objections centered on the cost of the bill 
rep dick armey rtexas proposed authorizing 100 billion for abc 
rather than 25 billion to reflect what he called the bills 
real price tag 
were talking about megabucks he said a fiscal time 
bomb he was voted down 
rep jim jeffords rvt was the only republican to vote in 
favor of the bill wednesday two democrats pat williams of montana 
and tim penny of minnesota voted no

a house subcommittee chairman whose panel is 
probing a disastrous carrollton ky school bus crash is accusing 
a federal safety agency of being too passive on improving the 
safety of the vehicles 
rep thomas a luken dohio said the national highway traffic 
safety administration on wednesday is paying a lack of 
attention to school bus safety 
the house energy and commerce committees transportation 
subcommittee which luken heads was examining the may 14 accident 
in which 27 bus occupants were killed when the vehicle was hit 
headon by a pickup truck going in the wrong direction 
all the deaths have been attributed to smoke inhalation caused 
by a fire that engulfed the bus after the collision 
nhtsa has never issued a specific standard for flammability 
for school buses luken said 
instead he said the agency relies on regulations adopted in 
the 1970s 
other safety agencies such as the federal aviation 
administration have issued more stringent flammability 
standards he said 
nhtsa administrator diane k steed told luken that her agency 
has focused on preventing the ejection of passengers from buses in 
accidents the kentucky crash was the first in which school bus 
occupants were killed from a fire she said 
in view of the much higher risk of impact injury compared to 
the risk of fire injury the agency concluded that it was more 
important to preserve the superior impact protection for the 
children as long as materials met basic flammability standards 
she said 
at the same session steed estimated that about onefourth of 
the nations 350000 school buses were built before the government 
issued rules in 1977 stiffening safety standards for the vehicles 
the bus involved in the kentucky crash was built three weeks 
before the federal safety requirements took effect on april 1 
1977 and did not conform with all of the government standards the 
rules covered buses manufactured after april 1 1977 
the requirements covered the use of energyabsorbing materials 
stronger seats roofs and body joints more accessible exits and 
improvements to the impact resistance of fuel systems 
the driver of the pickup truck that smashed into the bus larry 
mahoney of worthville ky has been charged with 27 counts of 
murder and with drunken driving 
james and karolyn nunnallee whose 10yearold daughter patty 
was killed in the crash told the subcommittee the federal 
government has to improve its efforts to control drunken driving 
the federal government has the resources and the capability to 
not only assist the states but to force the states to do something 
about the drunk driving menace karolyn nunnallee said

house and senate leaders would like to put the 
finishing touches on a bill providing emergency infusions of money 
to several federal programs whose coffers are running low 
the senate voted its approval wednesday evening for a 1988 
supplemental spending measure that would disperse 633 million in 
new spending among a handful of agencies including the veterans 
administration and the justice department 
that means that a compromise bill has to be worked out because 
the house approved a 189 million version of the bill on july 27 
that distributed the funds differently 
aides from the two chambers began meeting wednesday even before 
the senate passed the legislation to begin ironing out differences 
between the two bills with congress planning to begin a nearly 
fourweek summer vacation after business ends today lawmakers were 
hoping that a compromise bill could be fashioned and approved 
before going home 
both bills were labeled dire emergency supplemental spending 
measures a legacy of last falls budget summit agreement between 
president reagan and congressional leaders 
in agreeing to that pact the parties agreed that the only extra 
spending that would be sought for fiscal 1988 which ends sept 30 
would be for dire emergencies normally supplemental 
spending bills become laden with pet projects that lawmakers have 
been unable to attach to other measures 
some legislators are hoping a second supplemental spending bill 
which already has cleared the house appropriations committee will 
be enacted later this year 
the biggest difference between the bills passed by the house and 
senate was over spending on veterans programs the senate measure 
contained 530 million in new and transferred funds to help the 
veterans administration pay for higher benefits a growing caseload 
and medical treatment while the house bill had no such money 
the house bill on the other hand had 50 million to keep some 
state unemployment programs running and 24 million to help 
refugees from the soviet union eastern europe africa and 
southeast asia the senate removed money for the refugees 
both bills contain 49 million for workers who have lost their 
jobs because of foreign imports 43 million for some recipients of 
federal black lung benefits and 60 million for the coast guard to 
keep its air and sea patrols operating 
the two measures also include aid for the justice department to 
pay for expenses of last years uprising by cuban detainees in 
prisons in atlanta and oakdale la for the agriculture department 
to pay for some expenses caused by the drought and for the small 
business administration to disburse disaster loans 
the senate bill could have been approved a week ago but it was 
delayed as democrats and republicans tried unsuccessfully to forge 
an agreement on aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
the senate passed its spending bill only after majority 
democrats on a 5739 vote defeated a gop plan to funnel military 
aid to the rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government

republicans dispensed with a bitter 
delegation fight and turned back a request to make the party 
structure more open to minorities as they cruised toward next 
weeks convention with sharpened attacks on the democrats 
when i look up there and dont see a black face i get 
suspicious lugenia gordon a 67yearold black republican from 
new york city told the republican national committee on wednesday 
it seems to me that the republican party looks at us like 
limburger cheese a little bit of us goes a long way said ms 
gordon who was speaking on behalf of an appeal from a group 
calling itself freedom republicans that urged the party to include 
more minorities in the party structure 
the rnc rejected the proposal 
rnc chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr sought to focus the partys 
attacks on the democrats saying they have no right to get upset 
over republican criticism 
fahrenkopf cited george bushs appearance ealier in the week 
before the gop platform committee when the vice president referred 
to democratic nominee michael dukakis as the stealth candidate 
and said the massachusetts governor was invisible on the issues 
dukakis is already crying foul fahrenkopf said in a speech 
to the rnc which was meeting less than a week before the partys 
national convention but how can dukakis call this negative 
campaigning and go unchallenged 
yes the vice presidents remarks were critical but the 
vice president used a memorable rhetorical device to make a point 
grounded in fact that dukakis will not discuss the issues he 
said 
also on wednesday the committee settled a bitter sixmonth 
fight in georgia where two groups wrestled for control of the 
states 48member delegation to the national convention 
in the end a faction that included supporters of television 
evangelist pat robertson along with dissident party members won a 
majority of the states delegation even though all georgia 
delegates are obliged to vote for bush 
on the other side were party regulars who were outraged at a 
settlement imposed on them by the national committees and approved 
by the national campaigns of bush and robertson 
georgia gop chairman john stuckey who was on the losing side 
left for home wednesday saying he would not return to claim his 
seat as a convention delegate next week and would not rule out the 
possibility of resigning his state party post 
asked if the bush campaign had leaned on him to accept an 
agreement stuckey replied no they fell on me 
negotiators included rich bond deputy manager of the bush 
campaign and mark nuttle who had been manager of the robertson 
campaign 
we are striving to get our family together on this and aim our 
fire at michael dukakis and not at each other bond said 
however stuckey said he doubted the settlement would achieve 
party harmony in georgia 
if the object of this exercise is to buy peace it will have 
the same effect as mr neville chamberlain to buy peace 
said stuckey referring to the former british prime ministers 
attempt to negotiate peace with nazi germany before world war ii

attorney melvin belli fighting a 
government tax claim of up to 3 million says he legitimately sold 
his office building to his son who took three years to record the 
transaction 
the famed trial lawyer who also faces heated divorce 
proceedings with his wife lia told reporters wednesday the 
internal revenue service claim against him was a goddamn lie 
belli must prove that his transfer of his law office building to 
his son caesar was a sale and not a gift large gifts are taxed 
against the giver at a higher rate than the capital gains tax on a 
sale of real estate 
the irs calls the sale a sham noting that the 9000 a month 
caesar was to have paid for the building was exactly offset by the 
amount his father was charged to rent his office 
in a related case the irs is seeking more than 300000 in back 
income taxes and penalties against melvin and lia belli

irans un ambassador complained that 
iraqi warplanes have buzzed iranian cities and warned that more 
such flights could jeopardize a truce to end eight years of war 
in tehran on wednesday irans acting commanderinchief hashemi 
rafsanjani said a un inquiry must condemn iraq as the aggressor 
in the persian gulf war or the region will face grave consequences 
ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati met un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar on wednesday to lodge a protest saying 
iraqi planes had broken the sound barrier swooping down on several 
iranian cities 
perez de cuellar who has been trying to negotiate and end to 
the conflict announced monday that both sides have agreed to an 
aug 20 ceasefire date with direct talks to begin five days later 
in geneva 
there have been no reports of fighting since 
after meeting with the un cheif mahallati told reporters that 
iraqi overflights can be a dangerous opening 
if it the overflights would be continued i am afraid that 
it is an obstacle in the way of the secretarygeneral carrying out 
his task he said 
perez de cuellar said of the alleged overflights 
i am persuaded that if something happened it was kind of a 
mistake a technical mistake a misunderstanding 
tehran radio reported the iraqi flights over southwestern iran 
on wednesday iraqi media reported no air force activity and there 
was no independent confirmation of any overflights 
a member of the iraqi mission to the united nations said there 
would be no comment on mahallatis remarks until today he declined 
to give his name 
in tehran rafsanjani also the speaker of parliament said iran 
wants justice and punishment of the aggressor who has violated 
all principles of international law 
he spoke at an international conference organized by iran to 
discuss aggression and defense 
the yearold un ceasefire resolution that iran finally 
accepted last month calls on the secretarygeneral to set up an 
impartial body to judge who started the war 
we have accepted the resolution with the hope that on the 
committee determining the responsibility of the aggressor they 
the united nations are serious rafsanjani said we hope 
events do not take place that make us think they have told us lies 
if we have such a feeling this might have grave consequences 
for the region he did not elaborate 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border skirmishes 
cyrus nasseri head of the iranian un mission in geneva said 
iran wants compensation for aggression in the war but gave no 
details official iranian estimates put war damage at 350 billion 
also on wednesday small groups of un officials arrived in 
tehran and baghdad the iraqi capital to prepare for hundreds of 
military observers who will monitor the ceasefire 
all 350 observers from 25 countries are expected to be in place 
within a week the officials said 
the un security council met wednesday in informal 
consultations to approve the secretarygenerals list of nations 
sending ceasefire monitors 
the nations are argentina australia austria bangladesh 
canada denmark finland ghana hungary indonesia india 
ireland italy kenya malaysia new zealand nigeria norway 
poland senegal sweden turkey yugoslavia and zambia 
earlier in the day the united states called on arab nations and 
japan to donate money to the peacekeeping group 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we 
do intend to urge the persian gulf states who are the chief 
beneficiaries of this settlement to share in the cost through 
voluntary contributions 
well be giving the same message to other countries like japan 
and others who have an interest in the gulf he said japan 
imports nearly all its oil from the gulf region 
meanwhile un spokesman francois giuliani said of the bodys 
financial problems if we continue at this rate the united 
nations will be bankrupt before october 
the general assembly will reconvene in a special session tuesday 
to assess its 159 members for the 74 million that the un 
iraniraq military observer group will cost in its first six months 
the united states expects to be assessed about 23 million of 
that amount said state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley in 
washington 
the united states is the most delinquent contributor to the 
uns regular budget accounting for 467 million of the 602 
million in unpaid assessments

proportions chinese newspapers reported 
the peoples daily and china youth news said the pools would be 
closed to prevent the spread of the disease commonly known as pink 
eye 
both reports said beijings tongren hospital was treating an 
average of 700 cases a day neither report gave a specific number 
of how many people have the ailment 
temperatures in beijing have been in the 80s and public pools 
have been packed

discoverys successful launch pad 
test firing shows its a very good bird the shuttles chief 
says but nasa has two major hurdles to clear before its first 
postchallenger manned space flight 
both could be resolved in the next week and if they are 
shuttle managers are expected to set a firm launch date of late 
september or early october for the crew of five astronauts 
i still think we still have a shot at late september robert 
crippen deputy director of shuttle operations said after 
wednesdays 22second firing of discoverys three main liquid fuel 
engines 
the remaining technical problems are the repair of a small gas 
leak in discoverys steering engine system and the final prelaunch 
test of the redesigned solid fuel rocket booster that caused 
challengers destruction 2 years ago 
wednesdays firing not only tested the engines but other 
orbiter systems countdown procedures and the launch team which 
has added several new faces since challenger and its crew of seven 
were lost in the jan 28 1986 explosion 
we proved it works said crippen a 50yearold navy captain 
who commanded the first space shuttle flight in 1981 and has been 
on more shuttle flights than any other astronaut 
its a clear demonstration that discovery is a very good 
bird added thomas e utsman director of shuttle management 
the flawless firing was a spirit lifter for space workers here 
who have had to overcome one problem after another since discovery 
was moved to the launch pad july 4 
mechanical and other difficulties had delayed the engine firing 
five times and combined with the unresolved gas leak pushed 
discoverys launch date off from early to late september with 
october a distinct possibility 
crippen said that while it would take several days to thoroughly 
analyze test data you cant have a major milestone like that 
come out as clean as it did and not feel good about it 
he said the only question turned up in a preliminary look at 
data was a possible leak of nitrogen gas in an area where fuel 
lines join the external fuel tank he said he did not think it was 
a significant problem 
engineers will begin concentrating on the steering system leak 
early next week when they climb into discoverys cargo bay with a 
plan to cut a hole in the rear bulkhead to gain access to an engine 
compartment 
the leak is in a fitting on a vent line and the plan is to 
clamp a clamshelllike device around it and fill it with a sealing 
compound the repair is expected to take about a week 
the fifth and final fullscale test firing of the shuttles 
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket is set for aug 18 at the 
morton thiokol plant near brigham city utah 
a faulty joint in challengers right booster allowed flame to 
escape and triggered the explosion the joint and other booster 
systems have been thoroughly redesigned 
the rocket in the aug 18 test will be deliberately flawed with 
grooves cuts and debondings introduced in critical areas like 
insulation and oring seals 
it is a significant flaw demonstration test said crippen 
some say there is a risk in it but we have to test the booster 
to withstand these worstcase situations

japaneseamericans who were interned or relocated from the west 
coast during world war ii say they finally feel vindicated after 
their countrys belated apology and promise of reparations 
president reagan saying here we admit a wrong signed a 
bill in washington on wednesday to provide 20000 payments to each 
of the estimated 60000 surviving japaneseamericans who were 
affected by the 1942 internment order 
some said they planned to donate the money to charities or 
memorials to the internees others said they would share the 
taxfree cash with relatives while some wondered whether they 
would ever see the reparations 
many however said the governments apology and their restored 
honor and respect for their country meant more than the money 
president franklin d roosevelts order required all people of 
japanese ancestry living in california oregon and washington and 
some in hawaii to be relocated it affected 120000 people most 
of whom were taken to guarded camps in the south and interior west 
for former internee dorothy shundo the bill means she may no 
longer feel she has to carry her birth certificate in her purse to 
prove shes an american 
i carried it for 45 years i hope no other group of americans 
feel they have to prove their citizenship she said in the little 
tokyo district of los angeles we now know that the constitution 
is working 
ben takeshita said the payments were symbolic but important 
twentythousand dollars could not begin to compensate a person 
for his or her lost freedom for the loss of property for the loss 
of livelihood for the stigma of disloyalty takeshita said at a 
news conference at the japaneseamerican citizens league in san 
francisco 
but the 20000 means that our government is sincere in its 
apology it is a token payment yes but it is a meaningful one 
he said 
william s naito a portland ore businessman and civic 
leader was a 16yearold high school sophomore when his family was 
forced to abandon their portland gift shop and move to salt lake 
city to live with relatives he said the bills apology is 
remuneration enough 
naito recalled how disgraced he felt when he was forced to clean 
out his locker and leave school 
everyone thought i was guilty as a saboteur that i was a 
criminal that sort of thing should not happen in the united 
states of all countries he said 
dr paul hamada of hood river ore said the bill acknowledges 
the country constitutionally erred by rounding up and holding 
people who had committed no crimes 
hamada was 2 when his family was moved from his grandparents 
farm near merced calif to a camp at amache colo where they 
lived for 2 years he said he probably would donate his 
reparations to either try to perpetuate the memory of the camps 
or propagate some form of educational scholarship 
naito is working with other japaneseamericans to establish a 
memorial to the internees in portland 
i would say most of the recipients will do something like that 
with the money because they feel so strongly about it naito said 
shigeko uno 73 was interned with her family in puyallup 
wash and later in idaho the seattle resident said she might 
donate the money to a nursing home and her church but she wont 
believe it until i see it 
some may never see it 
under the bills 10year payout plan the oldest survivors some 
in their 90s will get paid first 
if youre 64 or 65 theres no guarantee youre going to live 
to 75 said 69yearold seichi hayashida president of the nampa 
idaho chapter of the japaneseamerican citizens league 
some also fear the bill will revive antijapanese feelings 
naito and others however say the vindication of the internees is 
worth the risk of further racism 
i think weve got to chance it and let the pieces fall where 
they might he said i think its important because the next 
time it might be italians the irish or whatever

the annual commemoration of elvis presleys death rolled around 
this year her phone would start ringing as fast as you can say 
elvis lives 
the 11th anniversary of presleys death is tuesday and managers 
of graceland the singers former residence in memphis have 
scheduled their regular round of events to mark the occasion 
a brochure outlining the anniversary program listed the phone 
number elvis88 for fans wanting to check the schedule 
that number however is to mrs flahertys home the correct 
elvis number is elvis87 the same as last year the elvis line 
couldnt be pushed up a digit this year because that number already 
was in use 
mrs flaherty said the elvis calls started several weeks ago and 
she estimated the total as in the dozens although the 
frequency has increased during the past few days 
some of them wanted to know what we thought about elvis being 
alive she said wednesday we told them we didnt think he 
was

the soviets have developed a new lightweight jet 
hailed as the missing component of their air fighter force for 
the 1990s janes defense weekly reported 
the authoritative journal said the plane might rival the 
usbuilt f16 
janes in an issue published today said the new mig35 was 
flown by pilots of indias air force in may and is in an advanced 
stage of development 
the indians apparently were told that the mig35 would provide a 
potent combination with the larger soviet mig29 already in 
service with the indian air force janes said in an advance copy 
obtained by the associated press 
janes quoted unidentified soviet officials as indicating india 
would be allowed to export the mig35 but did not estimate a price 
for the new plane 
the magazine said the mig35 features a single engine one 
tailfin and an airintake chute under the fuselage similar to the 
f16 which is made by general dynamics 
some analysts view the mig35 designed for both airtoair and 
airtoground combat as the missing component in the soviet air 
forces fighter force for the 1990s janes said 
though a vital component of the soviet air force the mig29 
is a comparatively heavy and expensive fighter and too 
sophisticated for the groundattack role it said 
the mig29 is a twintailed twinengine interceptor similar to 
the united states fa18 hornet 
janes said the soviets presented the mig35 to india as a 
quality component for any third world air force several 
african countries have already been briefed about the airplane it 
said 
the f16 proved highly successful in airtoground warfare after 
it came into production in the 1970s israel made way for its 1982 
invasion of lebanon by using f16s to wipe out syrian 
surfacetoair missile defenses in the bekaa valley

for karl loose grocery shopping has 
become a humiliating journey through an obstacle course of metal 
barriers which many supermarkets use to keep carts from leaving 
their premises 
i cant get in the store said loose who has used a 
wheelchair for seven years i have to wait to ask someone to get 
the manager to let me in the store to me thats degrading 
loose and others are fighting back 
many states already have building code provisions that require 
stores to have at least a 32inch wide clearance at barriers often 
metal poles spaced wide enough for pedestrians to walk through but 
too narrow for shopping carts 
the problem is that those laws arent always enforced said 
marilyn golden a policy analyst for the disability rights 
education and defense fund in berkeley calif 
its amazing that that type of barrier is tolerated said 
marsha mazz chairwoman of the commission on persons with 
disabilities in prince georges county md its really a 
nightmare problem 
loose 39 who used to shop at a store that had locked cart 
barriers said the devices can be more than an annoyance for 
wheelchair users they can be dangerous 
once youre in the store theyll lock the gate again which 
means if theres an emergency you have to wait to get out loose 
said its a definite safety hazard 
loose of pennsauken president of the pennsauken committee for 
the handicapped which campaigns for easier access to stores with 
barriers says he now does most of his shopping at a store without 
gates 
its a definite statement of exclusion said colleen fraser 
director of the new jersey association of county representatives of 
disabled persons 
you cannot shop there without preapproval its a problem 
generally throughout the state said ms fraser who is also 
director of the union county office on the handicapped 
walt ruball a spokesman for the philadelphiabased acme markets 
inc said the company has replaced most of the locked cart corrals 
with new designs that allow free access to wheelchairs but prevent 
carts which cost about 120 each from being removed 
our policy is not to have cart corrals unless theyre 
absolutely essential ruball said we dont want to 
inconvenience our customers 
the new gates have been installed at most of acmes 294 stores 
ruball said in the past five years at least 20 antiquated gates 
have been removed he said 
in bergen county across the hudson river from new york 
however a disabled advocacy group has filed suit against an acme 
market in lodi where the new design has been installed 
the new design failed to take into account that most people who 
sit in wheelchairs sit on cushions which add three inches to their 
height said steve janick executive director of disabled 
information awareness and living 
the extra height prevents many wheelchair users shoulders from 
passing beneath the wedges atop the metal posts 
indeed most of the chairs cant get through janick said 
under this newest design you either get in or not at all 
theres no alternate entrance way at all 
the cliftonbased nonprofit organization received 13 complaints 
last year about the metal barriers in bergen passaic morris and 
northern essex counties janick said 
the group has pressured several supermarkets and department 
stores to keep their gates open janick said 
but he said there are still many violators 
literally what theyre saying is a disabled customer is not 
worth as much as a shopping cart janick said 
the eastern paralyzed veterans association in flushing ny 
encourages its 2000 members to file complaints if they encounter 
an inaccessible entrance said terry moakley an associate 
executive director 
it inhibits our ability to spend money moakley said our 
dollars are just as green as anybody elses

a woman who made headlines five years ago as 
the nations lowestpaid teacher has returned to reopen the 
oneroom schoolhouse where she taught for 16 years 
janice herbranson 54 left north dakota to teach in texas after 
the mcleod school closed in 1986 only one student remained in the 
district and the school board decided it was not practical to keep 
the building open 
however herbranson said wednesday the mcleod school would 
reopen aug 29 with five pupils 
the whole community feels that something is back to life its 
exciting for all of us said herbranson who was the schools 
lone teacher for 16 years before it closed 
two of the children will be in kindergarten two will be in 
first grade and one will be in sixth grade she said 
the district in this community of 45 residents faced the 
prospect of being dissolved if it did not reopen this year 
herbranson said 
herbranson taught prekindergarten children in progreso texas 
last year and said she enjoyed the experience 
i just thoroughly thought it was a great place to be she 
said i love the mexicanamerican people i miss the kids 
already 
herbranson received national attention in 1983 when the national 
education association identified her as the nations lowestpaid 
teacher her annual salary was 6300 at the time 
herbranson was making 6800 when the mcleod school closed she 
said she and the district have not settled on her pay for the 
coming year but it will likely be more than what she made at the 
school two years ago 
whatever her salary is in mcleod it will be a substantial pay 
cut from her texas job which paid her 25000 annually herbranson 
said 
herbranson said she took the job in texas to experience a 
different culture she was waiting for a teaching job in alaska 
when the progreso school district recruited her through moorhead 
state university in minnesota where she had been taking classes 
she still maintains part ownership in the sand dune saloon in 
this southeastern north dakota town 
herbranson said she believes the mcleod school has a bright 
future with several preschool children in the district the 
enrollment is expected to grow she said 
in addition at least three families from outside the district 
have contacted her about sending their children to mcleod this 
year she said 
herbranson said the schools reopening is a victory of sorts for 
rural oneroom schoolhouses 
its a good type of education theres no doubt in my mind 
she said

congressional conservatives are asking fellow 
lawmakers to void the treaty that shifts ownership of the panama 
canal from the united states to the panamanian government 
under the agreement ratified by the senate in 1979 the united 
states would abandon all rights to the canal zone and it would 
become a part of panama on dec 31 1999 
but a resolution introduced wednesday contends the treaty is 
invalid because the constitution requires both the house and senate 
to approve the transfer of us property 
we did not participate on the house side said rep philip 
crane rill it was a flawed treaty in terms of our 
constitutional obligations 
republican sen steve symms of idaho said congress also never 
ratified changes imposed by panama and was not signed by that 
nations president 
crane said the 39 initial cosponsors include three democrats 
its really not a partisan question he said its an 
american question an issue of american interests and security

combat cancercausing radon pollution in houses and schools 
the legislation which cleared the energy and commerce committee 
by a voice vote wednesday would set a national goal of making the 
air inside buildings as free of radon gas concentrations as the air 
outside buildings 
it would require the environmental protection agency to update 
and revise its citizens guide to radon to include information 
about health risks posed by various indoor levels of the naturally 
occurring gas 
health experts have warned that the epas current listing for

a selfdescribed tv addict charged with 
chopping down a neighbors 83yearold oak tree to improve his 
satellite reception hopes to get the charges erased but his 
neighbor isnt happy about the prospect 
arthur anderson 59 of redding told danbury superior court 
judge howard moraghan on wednesday that he didnt have a criminal 
record and wanted to apply for the accelerated rehabilitation 
program 
under the program firsttime offenders can have charges erased 
from their records after they successfully complete probationary 
periods 
this isnt the crime of the century andersons lawyer 
jeffrey b sienkiewicz told reporters anderson is charged with 
seconddegree criminal mischief and thirddegree criminal trespass 
the tree owner charles marriner 62 will be able to address 
the judge he rules on andersons request 
marriner who is suing anderson for 37000 in damages said he 
plans to give very serious thought to opposing accelerated 
rehabilitation based on the fact that it was the second time he did 
it 
marriner said he has received letters from people as far away as 
seattle urging him to pursue prosecution of anderson 
the common thread of these letters is people are feeling very 
threatened and very upset about the aberration of a persons 
rights marriner said 
in court moraghan asked anderson what he had done 
i cut a tree down anderson said his voice barely audible 
the construction worker told police in june after he cut down 
the tree now i can get the disney channel he also said he and 
his wife are tv addicts 
the judge ordered a sept 7 court date for anderson who could 
receive a maximum sentence of one year in prison for seconddegree 
criminal mischief and six months for thirddegree criminal 
trespassing if he is tried and convicted 
states attorney devin stilson said he believes accelerated 
rehabilitation is appropriate for anderson because the program is 
intended for crimes that are not of a serious nature

for every 200 words olivia damato 
writes about the worlds oldest profession a judge will suspend 
one day of her maximum 30day sentence on a prostitution conviction 
ms damato was quite taken aback when municipal judge 
samuel serata issued the sentence tuesday said her attorney 
howard kupperman 
its unusual innovative and different to you and i and other 
literate people it seems easy but for her its quite a burden 
kupperman said wednesday 
she could conceivably get the whole sentence suspended but it 
will be quite a challenge 
ms damato has definite opinions on her profession he said 
before she was convicted she told the judge that prostitution is 
the worlds oldest profession and that jail sentences would not 
stop it kupperman said she told the judge that legalizing 
prostitution would probably be the best solution he said 
when she left the courtroom ms damato told kupperman her 
first priority would be to get the conviction overturned she was 
charged with soliciting an undercover police officer kuppermans 
defense centered on the fact that ms damato knew the officer and 
would never have solicited him 
like ms damato kupperman and city attorney mark grice who 
prosecuted the case expressed surprise at the sentence 
i think its fair grice said by writing an essay maybe 
she would realize the problems in prostitution he wants to hear 
her standpoint on ways the courts can address prostitution 
he was especially concerned about young girls girls younger 
than 18 on the streets here in atlantic city the prosecutor 
said 
ms damato has been arrested for prostitution elsewhere grice 
said including new york california and washington she has been 
arrested at least three times in atlantic city he said 
she could not be reached for comment wednesday

former ptl leader jim bakker says he 
plans to recapture his television ministry by outbidding a canadian 
company for ptls assets when the bankruptcy sale closes next month 
the canadian company samoth capital corp has offered 113 
million 46 million in cash immediately and the rest over five 
years 
bakker said the canadian offers real value is 77 million after 
discounting such things as interest that could be earned if the 
money were paid to ptl immediately he said he plans to outbid that 
amount 
ptl agreed last week to give samoth capitals president peter 
thomas of vancouver until sept 16 to decide whether he wants to 
go through with the deal until then ptl is free to consider other 
offers 
thomas was scheduled to begin inspecting the property today 
said ptl trustee mc red benton 
also today us bankruptcy court judge rufus reynolds was 
expected to hear arguments in a dispute between the charlotte 
observer and bakkers attorneys 
bakkers attorneys are protesting the sale of bakkers 
deposition transcripts to the newspaper by a court reporter saying 
their premature release is unfair to bakker 
bakker was preparing his defense in ptls 52 million lawsuit 
that charges him with grossly mismanaging the ministry and the 
heritage usa theme park at fort mill sc he founded but left 
last year after acknowledging a sexual encounter with jessica hahn 
using the transcripts as its source the observer published an 
article last week that quoted bakker as saying he believed 
thousands of internal ptl documents had been destroyed since he 
resigned as president in march 1987 ministry officials denied that 
reynolds appeared to agree to with bakker and last week issued 
an order protecting the release of further transcripts the 
observer said it plans to protest the order 
ptl has been in bankruptcy proceedings since june 1987 three 
months after bakker resigned bakker has said he wants to buy ptls 
assets including the heritage usa christian retreat and the ptl 
satellite tv network and return as its leader 
bakkers attorney jim toms wouldnt provide details about 
bakkers bid but promised that what money is paid will be paid 
at closing and it will be a number that will be in excess of what 
we believe the present value of the canadian deal to be 
they werent specific about when the offer would be made saying 
they are still making arrangements with unidentified overseas 
lenders 
asked why anyone would lend bakker so much money when a federal 
grand jury is investigating him for possible criminal wrongdoing 
bakker replied thats not really a problem with these people 
im not expecting to be indicted anyway 
benton said wednesday that before ptl will deal with bakker he 
must deposit a substantial amount of cash or securities to 
guarantee that he has the ability to buy the assets 
the canadian group has deposited 50000 and has pledged 495 
million more as soon as it decides whether to go through with the 
purchase bakkers offer doesnt provide for any advance deposit

former teamsters president roy l 
williams has won a parole from his 10year prison term as a reward 
for testifying for the government in mob trials and because of his 
failing health officials said 
williams who has served three years for his 1982 attempted 
bribery conviction will be paroled jan 13 david dorworth chief 
analyst with the us parole commission in washington dc said 
wednesday 
dorworth said williams release would not depend upon his 
continued testimony for the government in organizedcrime trials 
but is a reward for his cooperation thus far and in consideration 
of his poor health 
f russell millin a kansas city lawyer representing the former 
labor leader said he told williams about the decision wednesday 
and williams heaved the biggest sigh of relief you can imagine 
williams 73 who suffers from emphysema and an enlarged heart 
is confined at the us medical center for federal prisoners in 
springfield 
williams served as international teamsters president from 1981 
until he was forced to resign after his conviction for trying to 
bribe former us sen howard cannon of nevada to influence 
trucking deregulation cannon was not charged in the case 
in an attempt to have his sentence reduced williams a 
longtime kansas city labor leader started cooperating with 
federal authorities investigating the mob 
he testified during one mob trial that he had been under the 
control of nick civella the reputed crime boss in kansas city at 
the time and received payoffs of 1500 a month from civella for 
seven years until he became president of the teamsters he said 
civella who has died played a key role in his election to the 
union presidency 
williams also testified by videotape in the federal court trial 
in new york against mob figures accused of fixing his election as 
teamsters president and that of his successor the late jackie 
presser 
mob boss anthony fat boy salerno and two codefendants were 
acquitted in may of the electionfixing charges but salerno and 
several codefendants were convicted of charges that they conspired 
to rig bids in the construction industry 
wiliams attorneys have been working for the past year to gain 
his release they contended the risk williams incurred by 
testifying should be sufficient to win parole 
millin said he assumed williams would return to his farm near 
leeton upon his release

few black delegates will attend the 
republican national convention in new orleans next week says a 
mississippi businessman among those tapped to encourage black 
voters nationwide to support the gop 
it will be a lilywhite convention in new orleans compared to 
what we saw in atlanta at the democratic convention its 
extremely disappointing said les range who was named this week 
by the george bush presidential campaign to drum up black support 
for the republican 
mississippi has one black among 31 gop delegates and two black 
alternates among the 31 convention alternates by comparison the 
states 47member delegation to the democratic national convention 
included 21 blacks 
bush should have taken a stronger stand to promote better 
representation of minorities as gop delegates said range an 
executive with promark inc 
he missed out on that score he should have made sure there 
was a good balance in the delegations he said

threehour cycles of contraction and expansion 
in the earths crust were detected for months before a major 
earthquake struck the japan sea scientists reported today 
such episodes should be studied for their potential in warning 
of quakes said researcher alan linde 
linde with coworkers at the carnegie institution of washington 
and researchers in japan presents an analysis in the british 
journal nature 
the threehour episodes may reflect a buildup of stress that is 
released during the quake linde said 
about 100 episodes were recorded in the five months before the 
1983 quake but none have appeared since the aftershocks ended 
linde said they may have begun earlier but the instrument that 
recorded them was not in place before that linde said 
the instrument was about 50 miles southeast of the quakes 
epicenter which was off the west coast of japan the quake 
registered 77 on the richter scale

arnulfo arias madrid who was ousted three times as 
president of panama was remembered upon his death at age 86 as a 
symbol of democracy in a country dominated by the military 
arias died of a heart attack here wednesday five days short of 
his 87th birthday he had lived here in selfimposed exile 
the panamanian government decreed monday a day of mourning for 
arias the patriarch of panamanian politics 
the panamanian flag will be flown at half staff for eight days 
starting monday arias birthday and the day he is to be buried in 
panama city 
arias whose presidential terms were ended by military coups 
arrived here in december he feared to return to panama because of 
his opposition to gen manuel antonio noriega the nations de 
facto leader 
if he had gone back the military would have killed him 
said roberto dominguez panamanian consul to the united states and 
who opposes noriega 
although arias reportedly suffered from heart trouble he had 
been in good health recently arias wife mireya was with him 
when he died at his home dominguez said 
relatives said arias body will be flown to panama city on 
friday 
arias was called by opposition leaders a great rebel and 
the indisputable leader of panama for the past 57 years he was 
president in 194041 194951 and for 11 days in 1968 
the last coup led to the long domination of the panamanian 
government by the military first under gen omar torrijos who 
died in a 1981 plane crash then under noriega 
arias head of the authentic panamanian party narrowly lost the 
1984 election to the official partys candidate his supporters and 
others accused the government of fraud many also felt the military 
stole a 1964 electoral victory from him 
he continued to speak out against the military and in 1986 said 
it killed opposition leader dr hugo spadafora who had accused 
noriegas government of involvement with drugs 
noriega was indicted in florida this year for alleged drug 
trafficking 
opposition leaders in panama expressed sorrow over arias death 
ricardo arias calderon president of the christian democratic 
party said the former president represented the figure of a 
great rebel who had a social conscience and was concerned about 
those who have less and for those who suffer more 
guillermo endara undersecretary of the authentic party said 
arias was the indisputable leader of panama for the past 57 
years 
carlos ivan zuniga president of the popular action party said 
there is no doubt that his death is going to constitute a 
tremendous uncertainty leave a vacuum 
born when panama was still part of colombia arias was educated 
in the united states and became active in his new nations politics 
in 1931 when he helped engineer a coup against the president 
he later served as ambassador to france and england and in 
europe became enamored of mussolinis fascism he returned to 
advocate it in panama and was elected president in 1940 
the united states worried about his connections to the axis 
powers on the eve of world war ii encouraged a military coup 
against him but he returned to power with more moderate views in 
1948 and is credited with founding his nations highly regarded 
social security system

two museum security guards have been sentenced to 
prison for illegally detaining and seriously beating a college 
student with a cattle prod an official newspaper reported today 
the peoples daily said the guiyang city intermediate court in 
southern chinas guizhou province sentenced guard chen wei to 2 
years in prison and guard shun li to 1 years for the attack 
the report said the incident occurred on june 18 when a 
temporary worker at the provincial museum tried to stop zou zuen a 
student from guizhou peoples university from entering a room at 
the museum saying he smelled of alcohol 
when zou protested the two security guards dragged him to their 
office handcuffed him to an iron bed and beat him with a cattle 
prod the paper said 
they also forced zou to kneel and confess that he was making 
trouble and beating others after drinking 
the report said zou suffered serious mental and physical 
injuries in the attack 
the chinese government acknowledges that its attempts to 
establish a working body of law and guarantee the rights of 
citizens are still marred by abuse of power by public officials 
and the staterun press occasionally carries reports of police and 
other officials beating and torturing suspects in criminal cases

the police commissioner criticized his 
departments handling of a riot that left more than 50 people hurt 
saying the highest ranking officer there may have left at a crucial 
time to go to the bathroom 
were better than that commissioner benjamin ward said 
wednesday in discussing a preliminary report he delivered to mayor 
edward i koch 
on wednesday night about 500 demonstrators chanting antipolice 
slogans marched on a manhattan precinct house some of them 
painting swastikas on squad cars to protest police actions in 
sundays riot 
the marchers led by new york civil liberties union director 
norman siegel chanted the park belongs to the people as they 
were met by two dozen police officers behind barricades there was 
no violence 
an effort by police to enforce a 1 am curfew at tompkins 
square park last sunday led to a protest that degenerated into a 
clash between hundreds of officers with nightsticks and rock and 
bottlethrowing protesters at least 52 people were injured 
including 14 officers enforcement of the curfew was suspended 
monday 
civilians accused the police of indiscriminately beating 
protesters and bystanders by late wednesday 73 complaints of 
police brutality had been filed 
also wednesday a 29yearold man filed a 50 million lawsuit 
against the city saying police attacked him with stormtrooper 
savagery after he stumbled into the riot while trying to hail a 
cab 
in papers filed in state court kenneth fish said a 
clubswinging officer opened a gash that required 44 stitches 
early today one man was killed and another injured in an 
apparently drugrelated shooting near the park police said the 
curfew which has been lifted had been enforced after neighborhood 
residents complained the park had become a noisy and unsafe 
gathering place for drug dealers and derelicts 
ward said the preliminary report on the riot seems to me to 
show a number of shortcomings and to answer some questions but to 
raise a number of other questions as well 
among the questions he said were whether unnecessary force was 
used whether supervisors lost control of their personnel and 
whether motorists were trapped in cars prompting a premature 
charge by mounted police 
i will require and demand answers to these still unanswered 
questions as to whether or not we acted in our normal operating 
procedures he said 
the report by chief of department robert j johnston jr said 
the temporary police headquarters should not have been set up in 
the park and reserves should have been mobilized outside the area 
ward said officers moved against the protesters as quickly as 
they did after receiving unconfirmed reports of people trapped in 
cars on a street by the park some of them screaming women and some 
getting beaten by demonstrators 
however he added that he did not have the identity of any 
trapped person or any reports on anyone who was aided 
he also said it appeared the ranking officer at the scene left 
to return to the police station 12 blocks away to go to the 
bathroom at a very crucial time at the beginning of this 
demonstration 
while the commander was absent he was not replaced permanently 
at the scene by another highranking officer who could coordinate 
the assignment of the hundreds of police officers who responded to 
backup calls

an outbreak of pneumonia and other illness among 
12 poker players was spread by a cat that gave birth near their 
card table medical researchers reported today 
the players got q fever a bacterial disease that is sometimes 
spread by farm animals said dr joanne m langley and colleagues 
from dalhousie university in halifax nova scotia who pieced 
together the story and published it in todays new england journal 
of medicine 
the eight men and four women met two or three times at week at 
one of their homes in halifax to play poker usually seven of them 
played while three or four others drank beer and waited for a seat 
at the table 
on feb 14 1987 the homeowners cat gave birth to three 
kittens in the poker room during a game 
the cats owner was the first to become ill on march 5 during 
the following two weeks the others got sick all had been present 
the night the cat had her kittens 
one of the card players died but the rest got better on their 
own or after taking antibiotics 
doctors later found that the cat carried coxiella burnetii the 
microbe that causes q fever the bacteria is found in high 
concentrations in the amniotic fluid placentas and fetal membranes 
of infected animals 
in nova scotia the disease is largely confined to rural areas 
the researchers believe the cat caught the germ from a rodent 
if our hypothesis about how the cat became infected is true 
they wrote then it is possible that q fever may become an urban 
disease in nova scotia

have increasingly been joined by buddhist monks workers some 
government civil servants and even children they said 
burmas official radio said 33 people died in street battles 
wednesday in the capital rangoon it said rioters beheaded three 
policemen 
japans kyodo news agency reported today that informed sources 
believed burmese leaders met in an allnight emergency session to 
discuss how to deal with the violence 
the protests demanding an end to the strongarm rule of new 
leader sein lwin prompted the united states to temporarily close 
its embassy in burma on wednesday all official american personnel 
and their dependents 154 people were safe state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
an israeli official indicated his country might take similar 
measures japan and britain urged citizens not to travel in burma 
official media reports from burma said 80 people died in riots 
from monday to wednesday radio rangoon reported about 160 wounded 
and 1500 arrested in the three days

they are by far the largest since a coup by ne win ended 
democracy in burma in 1962 sein lwin became president and head of 
the sole political party last month when ne win resigned 
rangoonbased diplomats say shortages of food and commodities 
stemming from ne wins isolationist economic policies are partly to

worlds poorest nations inflation is soaring and burma has a 4 
billion foreign debt 
since fall there have been antigovernment demonstrations in

the citys 1600 public nurses narrowly 
avoided joining a twoweekold strike by nearly 4000 private 
nurses and support workers when they approved a new oneyear 
contract by a narrow margin 
nurses at san francisco general hospital and other public health 
facilities voted 320307 wednesday for the new pact said donna 
gerber field representative for local 790 of the united public 
employees union 
this is not a mandate for the management of the city said 
gerber the management of this city must get the message that the 
nurses are fed up 
the union mainly sought a staffing ratio of four patients to one 
nurse nurses say they sometimes care for seven to 10 patients at a 
time however a tentative pact reached sunday calls for an 
unspecific modified ratio which gerber said might be a 
sticking point for many of the voting nurses 
theres no question that some of our members see this as too 
little too late she said 
about 2200 private nurses and 1700 support workers went on 
strike aug 2 against eight private hospitals in a wage dispute 
they have since resumed talks with hospital administrators 
the california nurses association wants raises of 11 percent the 
first year of a new contract and 10 percent the second year karen 
henry a spokeswoman for affiliated hospitals a group of private 
area hospitals said the group has offered raises of 18 percent 
over 31 months 
members of local 250 of the hospital health care workers union 
representing the support workers are striking over health benefits

riot police surrounded college 
campuses today to block marches by radical students seeking 
reunification talks with north korea minor clashes erupted in six 
cities and five students were reported injured 
the government enforced strict security measures to block 
preparations for a march to the border monday by students planning 
talks with communist north korean student delegates about 30000 
riot police were deployed nationwide 
about 400 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with 
riot police in the southern port city of pusan as they were blocked 
from marching authorities said five students were injured they 
said 
advance national unification through student talks students 
chanted 
scattered clashes were also reported in the southwestern city of 
kwangju where riot police fired tear gas to break up a march by 
about 300 students twenty students were arrested after minor 
street protests in masan in the south 
bands of students hurled firebombs at a police station in the 
eastern city of wonju and at an office of the government party in 
taegu in the south police said no injuries were reported 
on wednesday radical students attacked 12 police stations and 
government party offices nationwide according to police reports 
students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police after a rally 
at donggok university in seoul when they were blocked from 
marching police drove the students back into the campus with tear 
gas 
peaceful rallies to support the reunification talks were held at 
several other seoul colleges riot police stood guard outside but 
students did not march out and there were no confrontations 
the government has banned the march and reunification talks on 
grounds that it alone has the authority to conduct talks with 
communist north korea a similar march june 10 for reunification 
talks was blocked by riot police 
turnout for rallies and marches to seoul to join the main march 
has been low with no more than a few hundred students 
participating in most cities 
a summer heat wave summer vacation and strong public opposition 
appear to have reduced support for the radicals north korea has 
said it will send student delegates to the talks site but they are 
seen as being under government control 
opposition lawmaker rep park kwangyong said radical students 
were ready to delay talks with north korean delegates if they are 
allowed to stage a march across the nation 
government officials said there was no change in their position 
and no talks would be allowed the government has offered to 
arrange meetings with north korea students under its auspices 
radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try 
to mobilize public support for their antigovernment campaign the 
students a small but powerful minority on college campuses have 
failed to gain support because of their violent tactics and open 
advances to the north 
the students say they are not communists but insist that the 
peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences 
being worked out later most south koreans fear the totalitarian 
north is determined to conquer the south 
the peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of world 
war ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean 
war which ended three years later with an armistice but no 
political settlement

the air strip closure forced outfitters and private rafters to 
fly into an airstrip 10 miles downstream to put in on the middle 
fork of the salmon river

the number of vietnamese boat people asking to 
be sent back home shot up during the past week after talks between 
hong kong and vietnam over largescale repatriation a government 
spokeswoman said today 
at least 90 vietnamese who fled to this british colony by boat 
have volunteered to return home including about 70 who made the 
request after last weeks talks according to the spokeswoman who 
demanded anonymity 
only 21 boat people have been voluntarily repatriated from hong 
kong since 1978 including two in july 
hong kong and vietnam officials met in hanoi to discuss 
repatriating boat people viewed by the british colony not as 
political refugees but as illegal immigrants fleeing a battered 
economy 
no agreement was reached but further talks are expected 
vietnam has said it would repatriate boat people who want to 
return home while hong kong is seeking to send back most 
vietnamese who arrived after midjune 
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 hong kong considered all 
vietnamese arriving by boat to be political refugees eligible for 
resettlement in third countries 
but under a new policy which took effect june 16 to curb the 
surging number of arrivals all incoming vietnamese are considered 
illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove 
they fled communist vietnam because of persecution 
the spokeswoman said some of the 90 volunteers were classified 
as illegal immigrants while others were classified as refugees 
entitled to be resettled overseas she said she had no further 
details 
the repatriation applications will be forwarded to the united 
nations high commissioner for refugees to discuss with hanoi 
about 7000 vietnamese have sailed into hong kong since the new 
policy took effect bringing the number of boat people in the 
colony to about 23000 
united nations officials could not be reached for immediate

scientists from china and canada said today that 
they unearthed a mass grave of sheepsized baby dinosaurs who were 
apparently buried during a sandstorm 75 million years ago 
dr philip currie of the tyrrell museum of paleontology in 
alberta said the joint team excavated the skulls of five baby 
pinacosaurus in the wastelands of southern inner mongolia 
he said they found a sixth baby on the last day of their summer 
expedition and it appears likely there are a number of other 
specimens 
one adult which in life was about the size of an extremely 
heavy bull was also discovered nearby he said 
we feel that the five babies were congregating together behind 
a sand dune in a sandstorm currie said either they were buried 
by sand or killed by the collapsing dune he said 
currie said it was first time the planteating reptile had been 
found to be gregarious or living and moving in groups 
the canadachina dinosaur project working together for the 
second straight summer in the fertile and largely untouched 
dinosaur fields of inner mongolia and xinjiang in chinas far west 
found the remains of about 50 other dinosaurs and their nests and 
40 other mammals turtles and lizards 
the bayan manduhau area of southern inner mongolia where the 
babies were dug up was first explored by american and swedish 
paleontologists in 1928 and 1931 this years find was in a spot 
that was inaccessible at that time because of lack of roads 
hou lianhai of the chinese academy of sciences institute of 
vertebrate paleontology and paleoanthropology said the team in 
xinjiang had excavated a meateating theropod but needed another 
year to dig up a brontosauruslike sauropod 
both beasts were discovered in xinjiang during the first 
expedition last year the sauropod about 160 million years old and 
estimated to have been 100 feet long is one of the largest of its 
kind to have been found in asia hou said 
at a news conference currie and hou also revealed one nearly 
intact oblongshaped egg about eight inches long and several 
broken egg shells of the protoceratops a pigsized horned dinosaur 
currie said the years finds will help understand the histories 
of dinosaurs in asia and north america he said the fossils 
discovered in inner mongolia were the same age as those found in 
alberta another great repository of dinosaurs and that many of 
the same kinds of reptiles were turning up 
he said it was still not clear whether the dinosaurs migrated 
from either the dry dunecoursed asian deserts or the wetter lands 
of north america or whether they may have developed independently 
the dinosaur project is to return to china again next year and 
in the future may carry out further research in either china or 
northern canada noble said there are also plans to stage a world 
tour of dinosaur fossils from around 1991 
the project is coordinated by the exterra foundation and 
supported by the canadian government

an engine fire forced a united airlines 
737 with 107 people aboard to abort its takeoff and at least nine 
passengers were injured evacuating the burning twinengine jet 
authorities said 
the jet which was en route to chicago was traveling at 100 to 
115 mph and had not left the ground when the pilot applied the 
brakes at little rock regional airport on wednesday said united 
spokesman rob doughty 
passengers and flight attendants opened emergency hatches and 
either climbed onto the wings or slid down evacuation chutes 
two passengers were in satisfactory condition today at st 
vincent infirmary medical center nursing supervisors said among 
seven others treated at hospitals and released were two women who 
suffered broken ankles officials said 
joe p carrigan faa assistant air traffic manager said it is 
uncertain if the aircraft would have crashed if it had taken off 
an aircraft can fly on one engine carrigan said there 
are a lot of factors it certainly would have tested his pilotage 
doughty said the cause of the fire was under investigation

this whole community is very very upset about it said 
yadkin county sheriff jack henderson and i can understand why 
henderson said he would investigate no charges were filed

he freely admits to doing it and also admits he made a 
mistake doing it the sheriff said 
julie goodin director of the forsyth county humane society 
questioned coles account and some residents accused him of 
dragging the horse to its death 
it was alive when i saw it go up the road said frieda hall 
it was trotting but even a trot is too fast for an animal in 
this heat 
she said she saw entrails scattered about the road it was 
just everywhere she said it was so much i figured it must

the government is launching a project to develop an 
ultrasonic passenger plane that will be able to fly between new 
york and tokyo in three to five hours officials said today 
the powerful ministry of international trade and industry which 
helped engineer japans success in automobiles and computer chips 
is putting together teams of companies that will conduct research 
on advanced engines and fuselage materials for the plane miti 
officials said 
although the planes top speed has not been decided engineers 
expect it will be able to fly up to five times the speed of sound 
or nearly 4000 mph the officials said a nonstop flight between 
tokyo and new york now takes about 13 hours the worlds fastest 
passenger jet now is the europeanbuilt concorde which can fly 
about twice the speed of sound 
an official in mitis aircraft division said the two research 
projects to begin in 1989 will take seven to eight years to 
complete 
the government plans to allocate about 225 million to 260 
million for engine research and 52 million to 60 million for 
research on fuselage materials he said the allocations still must 
be approved formally by japans finance ministry and parliament 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said miti 
decided to begin the research programs after it was approached in 
1986 by the us boeing co and mcdonnell douglas about possible 
japanese participation in a similar superfast plane project in the 
united states 
last year the us government reportedly began issuing 
contracts for development of portions of the us ultrasonic plane 
dubbed the orient express by president reagan 
after the miti research projects end the japanese companies 
involved will get together with us companies working on superfast 
plane technology and decide on plans for further development of the 
plane possibly with government guidance the official said 
industry analysts say production of such an advanced plane would 
take massive technical and financial resources more than any 
single company or country can provide 
although most of the japanese research program is likely to be 
conducted independently the miti officials said they dont intend 
to compete with the united states 
its a very big project so i dont think we will be 
competitive one official said well need to work together 
japan is advanced in many aspects of aviation and aerospace 
technology but the countrys aircraft industry has had little 
success so far on the international market in recent years miti 
has made the industry a high priority and has supported development 
of key aircraft projects 
japanese companies are involved in manufacturing fuselage 
sections for the boeing 767 airliner but analysts say the industry 
is eager to achieve the status of full partner rather than 
subcontractor in future joint projects 
the miti research projects would give japanese companies a 
chance to catch up with and perhaps surpass us engine and 
fuselage technology 
the official in mitis aircraft division said development of a 
superfast plane would give japan a major opportunity to boost its 
aviation industry 
the engine research to focus on a combination turbojet and 
ramjet design will be led by mitsubishi heavy industries and will 
include ishikawajimaharima heavy industries and kawasaki heavy 
industries the official said 
a group of about 20 companies will conduct the research on new 
fuselage materials that meet the requirement of being able to 
withstand temperatures above 900 degrees he said

the skeleton of a mammoth a forerunner of 
the elephant has been unearthed at the surprisingly high elevation 
of 9000 feet during construction of an irrigation dam scientists 
said 
the discovery at huntington canyon excited paleontologists and 
archaeologists who kneeled around the mammoths skull wednesday 
and scraped away mud that has preserved the skeleton for 10000 to 
15000 years 
the discovery is expected to enhance understanding of the 
mammoth and the environment of central utah after the last ice age 
it essentially has been in a refrigerator for 10000 years 
said david gillette state paleontologist it all adds up to 
wonderful preservation 
the presence of a mammoth at 9000 feet above sea level was 
intriguing gillette said 
mammoths generally foraged in lowerelevation grasslands the 
highaltitude canyons environment has not changed appreciably 
since the postglacial period in which the mammoth apparently 
lived he said 
the discovery was made monday during construction of a dam that 
will provide water for the huntingtoncleveland area 
a construction worker was operating a backhoe near the base of 
the dam when the blade struck a large bone that turned out to be 
the mammoths skull 
the blade cut into the cheekbone and crunched a shoulder blade 
and tusk but did little overall damage to the remains officials 
said

japanese scientists performed chemicalwarfare 
experiments on americans and other prisoners of war and the us 
government used the findings historians said 
us defense officials said there was insufficient evidence to 
support the accusations which were made wednesday during an 
international conference on the history of science in china at the 
university of california at san diego 
osamu imai press secretary in the japanese embassy in 
washington said his government could not confirm or deny that 
biological warfare experiments occurred because all world war ii 
records have been destroyed 
during the forum historians presented research describing in 
chilling detail experiments in which between 2000 and 3000 
soviets chinese and koreans were believed to have died during the 
1930s and 40s 
the japanese biological experiment program began in 1931 in 
harbin in central manchuria under the direction of lt gen shiro 
ishii a surgeon according to keiichi tsuneishi of nagasaki 
university 
the programs goal was to test the effects of organisms and 
toxins responsible for such diseases as tetanus typhoid 
salmonella typhus cholera tuberculosis for future development of 
chemical weapons tsuneishi said 
researchers subjected pows to such experiments as injecting 
experimental toxins or freezing subjects arms to determine the 
best way of thawing flesh he said 
after the war ishii who died several years ago was questioned 
by us occupation authorities but never prosecuted us officials 
said there was insufficient evidence 
john w powell of san francisco former editor of an 
englishlanguage magazine in china accused us officials of 
protecting those involved in return for the results of the japanese 
experiments 
he and tsuneishi also suggested that a virulent strain of 
hemorrhagic fever that occurred during the korean war may have 
accidentally or deliberately been introduced by the united states 
using organisms acquired from the japanese 
lt col arnold williams chief of the pentagon press office 
disputed that allegation army investigators did look at the 
biological warfare research results in 1947 but there is no way 
of determining if it was used he said 
edward drea acting chief of the research division of the army 
center of military history said his agency has been unable to 
confirm or refute the allegation that american pows were used in 
the japanese experiments 
he said there also was no evidence to prove the united states 
made any deals with the japanese in return for the data theres 
a difference between allegations and factual evidence and we just 
couldnt find the factual evidence drea said 
joseph cy chen a physics professor and chinese historian at 
the university of california at san diego presented what he said 
was a copy of a japanese lab report documenting the human 
experimentation 
the report was discovered in a tokyo bookstore in 1984 by 
japanese researcher takao matsumura and reported at that time chen 
said 
since then historians have obtained additional information 
through the us freedom of information act japanese documents and 
interviews with japanese who helped with the experiments he said

the responsibility of paying the salaries gadhafi told the 
radios parisbased arabic service in the interview conducted

done anything for jerusalem the occupied territories or palestine 
in general 
in addition to retiring or laying off the employees hussein 
canceled a proposed 13 billion development plan for the occupied 
lands abolished a government ministry responsible for the area and 
dissolved the lower house of parliament half of whose members were

progress can only be made quietly

residence lambeth palace said no further statement would be

tehran in 1980 after revolutionary guards stormed the building

damage to the british embassy and to the iranian embassy in london 
which was damaged in 1980 during a siege by opponents of ayatollah

china today said it will ship weapons to the 
khmer rouge until vietnam withdraws all its troops from cambodia 
the announcement came several weeks after prince norodom 
sihanouk the leader of the cambodian resistance accused the khmer 
rouge of killing his followers and threatened to unite with 
antikhmer rouge forces to drive them from cambodia 
so long as vietnam doesnt withdraw from cambodia china will 
continue to assist the resistance group including the khmer 
rouge foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said today 
in the past china has said it would respect the wishes of 
the prince today jin said china had no comment on sihanouks 
statements 
jin also told a news conference that a date had yet to be set 
for talks with the soviet union in beijing on cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and forced the khmer rouge 
from power during its fouryear rule the khmer rouge killed 
millions of cambodians while pushing a fanatical brand of agrarian 
communism 
in the early 1980s a threeparty resistance group made up of 
sihanouk son sann a westernleaning politician and the khmer 
rouge was established to fight the vietnamese occupation 
as the resistance group relied more and more on china and the 
capitalist countries of southeast asia vietnam moved closer to the 
soviet union 
vietnam has pledged to withdraw its 120000 troops from cambodia 
by 1991 but wants the khmer rouge to play no future role in the 
cambodian government 
the threeparty resistance group held its first meeting with the 
vietnamesebacked cambodian government in late july in indonesia 
sihanouk went to indonesia and spoke to those attending the 
conference but refused to attend the meeting itself 
upon his return to beijing after the conference sihanouk said 
it had been a success but chances for peace were slim 
in previous weeks he had criticized the khmer rouge and said he 
was willing to unite with antikhmer rouge factions the prince is 
known for his contradictory statements and for his tendency to 
resign as president of the resistance group he most recently quit 
in early july 
jin said those who were calling on china to stop supporting the 
khmer rouge would only help the vietnamese aggressors achieve 
their goal in cambodia 
he said china supports a cambodia that is independent 
peaceful and nonaligned 
the spokesman said china would not support any party 
monopolizing power at the expense of any other party a reference 
to concerns that the khmer rouge will regain power once vietnam 
leaves cambodia 
recent reports have said diplomats from china and the soviet 
union will meet in beijing this month to discuss a cambodian 
settlement 
jin said he had no information on the meeting but a soviet 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting 
would occur after aug 20 but before the end of the month 
he said the soviet union was waiting for results of a meeting 
scheduled aug 15 on the cambodian question between five countries 
indonesia zimbabwe india cuba and vietnam are scheduled to meet 
in harare zimbabwe

windhoek southwest africa ap angolan rebels claimed new 
victories and vowed to continue fighting even as allied south 
african soldiers were reported leaving the country under terms of a 
plan to bring peace to the region 
angola today rejected direct talks with the rebels which it 
called puppets of south africa and said angolan troops had 
killed 71 rebels in several clashes aug 17 
the south african government said about 2000 of its troops 
began leaving angola wednesday in accordance with an agreement 
aimed at ending the war there and granting independence to 
southwest africa 
at the same time unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola said its rebel fighters killed 35 
government troops and 15 cuban soldiers while taking a southwestern 
angolan city and army supply camp 
the rebels said they took control tuesday of chamutete in huila 
province unita said five rebels were killed and 13 injured in 
fighting the claim in a statement issued in lisbon portugal 
could not be confirmed independently 
south africa supports the rebels in their 13year war cuba 
supports angolas marxist government and has about 50000 troops in 
angola 
under terms of an agreement announced monday south africa is to 
have its troops out of angola by sept 1 
cuba is eventually to withdraw its troops from angola and south 
africa is to grant independence to southwest africa also known as 
namibia where a guerrilla group known as the southwest africa 
peoples organization operates 
neither rebel group is party to the agreement 
in lisbon angolas official angop news agency said today that 
unitas exclusion from regional peace talks was logical normal 
and necessary for the establishment of peace 
but it said this did not rule out a program of amnesty to return 
to society hundreds of angolans who were unwittingly used to 
serve foreign interests and personal ambitions 
angop said the angolan army killed 71 unita bandits and took 
nine others as prisoners aug 17 it said rebels in the same 
clashes killed 26 government troops and captured 17 
in harare zimbabwe president robert mugabe said president 
eduardo dos santos of angola told the leaders of blackgoverned 
nations neighboring south africa that a timetable for the 
withdrawal of the cuban troops is still to be worked out it is 
not going to start now it will start much later perhaps after six 
to eight months mugabe said 
officials of angola cuba and south africa are to meet in two 
weeks to negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of the cuban troops 
the citizen and other south african newspapers said south 
african soldiers had begun dismantling a forward base at cuito 
cuanavale in southern angola gathering up battle wreckage and 
preparing longrange g5 guns for the 180mile journey through 
dense bush and sand back to southwest africa 
cuito cuanavale once an angolan government garrison town has 
been a nomans land between dueling artillery for the past eight 
months 
if agreement on cuban withdrawal is reached south africa says 
it will set nov 1 as the starting date for implementing a un 
plan to end its 73year rule over southwest africa 
the plan envisions a 7500man un peacekeeping force to be 
deployed in namibia for seven months while south african troops 
gradually withdraw and elections are held for an assembly to draft 
a postindependence constituion 
estimates of the cost of the un operation have ranged as high 
as 1 billion if the implementation process begins nov 1 
elections could take place as early as june 1

gov rudy perpich will recommend expanding 
minnesotas schoolchoice plan to other states when he becomes the 
chairman of a national education group on saturday and the plan 
already is drawing opposition 
perpichs plan allows parents and students to choose their 
schools regardless of where they live and puts schools in 
competition for those students 
several members of the policy and priorities committee of the 
education commission of the states objected to the proposal 
wednesday at the organizations annual meeting in baltimore 
critics told perpich the plan would sharpen disparities between 
poor and wealthy districts rather than increase opportunities for 
equal education for all 
what youre going to end up with is very very good schools 
and very very mediocre schools i think the charge is to make 
all schools great said colorado state sen regis groff 
perpich is defending the plan which encountered opposition 
before its 1987 adoption in minnesota 
together we must work toward the day when parents and students 
have the freedom to choose a school on the basis of its excellence 
instead of its geographical location perpich said in the text of 
a speech to be given give saturday when he succeeds missouri gov 
john ashcroft as commission chairman 
the failure of our schools to provide equal access to 
educational excellence is creating a situation that if trends 
continue will force businesses to hire more than a million new 
service and production workers every year who cant read write or 
count 
he estimated that it costs business up to 25 billion a year in 
fees and lost productivity to educate those workers

michael dukakis today lauded president reagan 
for reaching arms agreements with the soviet union but said his 
spacebased defense plan should be scrapped in favor of beefing up 
conventional forces 
the democratic presidential nominee in a speech at new york 
university did not mention republican challenger george bush by 
name but made it clear he believed bush would continue defense 
policies that dukakis said had benefitted greedy contractors at the 
expense of national security 
weve got to have a real leader in the white house who will 
insist that when it comes to our national security were going to 
make our decisions based not on whats good for one company or one 
military service or one political party but on whats good for 
america dukakis said in his prepared text 
my friends the test of a successful defense policy isnt how 
much money we spend its how much security we buy dukakis said 
and for the past eight years we havent gotten what weve gone 
into debt for 
dukakis said that if elected he would seek to expand on the arms 
agreements negotiated with the soviets by reagan but promised to 
judge soviet leaders not by what they say but what they do 
dukakis promised to clean up the mess in pentagon 
procurement policies and redirect defense dollars from the 
seemingly endless development of new and more expensive nuclear 
weapons systems a reference to the presidents star wars missile 
defense program to new tanks and other supplies for conventional 
forces and the coast guard 
we have to build strong military forces based on sound 
planning and tough management not wishful thinking and blank 
checks dukakis sad 
he said the choice in november presented the opportunity to 
restore americas leadership in the world or we can settle for 
second best 
the speech came at the beginning of a fivestate campaign swing 
from new york the massachusetts governor was traveling to new 
jersey to tour fort dix 
dukakis also had evening appearances scheduled in two 
connecticut communities before heading to richmond va to spend 
the night at the governors mansion he was to campaign in virginia 
and florida on friday before spending the weekend on cape cod 
the massachusetts governor on wednesday tended to state 
business including a groundbreaking ceremony that was part of a 6 
billion effort to clean up boston harbor the nations filthiest 
dukakis balked at spending money for new sewage treatment plants 
during his first term as governor in the mid1970s but said it was 
revisionist history to blame him for delays in beginning the 
cleanup 
nobody could really tell us what to do to clean up this 
place dukakis said there were very respected people experts 
in the field who disagreed 
but the state now faces a federal court timetable to stop 
polluting the harbor by 1999 with several deadlines relating to 
sewage treatment and sludge dumping spread throughout the next 
decade 
the cleanup is the largest public works project in massachusetts 
history and dukakis as he did last week in california boasted of 
the jobs it would create 
but lee atwater bushs campaign manager took dukakis to task 
on the cleanup 
if it takes the governor of massachusetts 11 years to clean up 
his own harbor americans must question his commitment to the even 
larger environmental questions which face our nation he said 
atwater said the delay will cause the average boston water bill 
to skyrocket over the next eight years 
a gallup survey released tuesday put dukakis support at 49 
percent and bushs at 42 percent in telephone interviews with 1004 
registered voters aug 57 a gallup poll just two weeks ago gave 
dukakis a 17point margin 54 percent to 37 percent each survey 
had a 3 percentage point margin of error 
the race has always been tight dukakis said in shrugging 
off the new numbers this is going to be a very tough 
competitive 90 days 
the only thing that these numbers tell you is that the 
democratic ticket is competitive in every region of the country and 
in every state of the country he said

the last surviving grandaughter 
of jesse james has given away some priceless family heirlooms 
including guns and the pair of handmade boots the outlaw wore when 
he was shot to death in 1882 
the artifacts went on display last week at the jesse james 
museum at the james farm historic site near kearney mo the museum 
and family farm now owned by clay county are about 30 miles 
northeast of kansas city 
ethel rose owens 80 said wednesday that her father jesse 
edward james was 7 years old when his notorious father was killed 
in st joseph mo by robert ford a newcomer to the james gang 
he was in the next room mrs owens said he ran into the 
next room and saw his father lying there all bloody i think my 
father never got over that 
the artifacts which include jesse james winchester rifle a 
shotgun and pistol had been closely guarded by the james family 
for generations to keep the items from becoming part of a 
sideshow mrs owens said 
also included in the donation were jesse james spurs wallet 
and coin purse his horse bridle and a bootpolishing brush 
she said she was persuaded to donate the heirlooms last year 
during a trip to the family farm with her nephew orange county 
superior court judge james ross 
the familys bitterness toward curiosity seekers was 
welldocumented in the years following james death said milton 
perry clay county curator of historic sites 
james widow once told a newspaper she would never sell anything 
that belonged to the outlaw saying you can offer me a 1000 
which was a lot of money at the time perry said by telephone 
from his home in kansas city 
mrs owens and others said they were particularly amused at the 
irony upon learning that the pinkerton security agency volunteered 
to stand guard at the museum friday the first night the james 
artifacts went on display

with summer already spoiled for thousands of beachgoers new 
york and new jersey announced cradletograve accounting of 
infectious medical waste to help curb debris that has washed ashore 
from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico 
we will no longer tolerate the careless unsupervised and 
often just outrageous way these wastes are being handled new 
jersey gov tom kean said wednesday at a crowded shipboard news 
conference in new york harbor 
in north carolina meanwhile 40 marines landed on 26 miles of 
beaches this week for the unheroic task of clearing bags of medical 
and other waste dumped by navy vessels offshore 
officials were investigating whether the dumping was illegal 
cbs news reported wednesday that the ships were outside the 25mile 
legal trashdumping limit medical refuse however is usually held 
for incineration in port said navy spokesman lt john lloyd 
the navy has traced some of the debris to the uss newport and 
uss nassau and is examining deck logs to determine where the ships 
were when the trash went overboard lloyd said 
right now we dont know if there were any violations lloyd 
said we really dont know how it happened we know were 
responsible for it were just trying to find out how it got 
ashore 
bloodstained syringes blood bags bandages vials of drugs and 
other medical debris including dead rodents have closed numerous 
beaches this summer in new york and new jersey and alarmed 
officials in other atlantic coastal states like florida and south 
carolina 
in my 10 years here ive never seen anything like this wash 
up said police chief jack e lilienthal in charleston sc 
close to where a syringe and plunger without a needle and a medical 
glove were found wednesday 
in cleveland hundreds of syringes many bloodstained have 
been found during the past week on public and private beaches along 
lake erie richard l shank director of the ohio environmental 
protection agency called the problem disgusting and heinous 
and said direct dumping in the lake was illegal 
the waste accounting plan launche by new york and new jersey 
which goes into effect immediately was announced following a 
monthlong rash of beach closings in both states due to medical 
waste and raw sewage in the water 
the purpose is to say to people we will watch you with the 
intent of catching and prosecuting you if this waste is not 
disposed of properly said new york gov mario cuomo 
as part of the plan hospitals and other facilities that 
generate medical waste transport it or dispose of it will be 
required to fill out forms at each step of the process 
the hospital will then keep the final form on file for the 
state providing a record of the waste from inception to disposal 
if the hospital does not receive the form within seven days of 
disposal the state must be notified 
we are powerless no longer as needles and bandages wash up on 
our beaches said kean we will be able to punish the people 
who have been turning so many holidays into horror stories 
beach attendance has been down significantly in both states due 
to the pollutions officials have said 
kean and cuomo acknowledged the new manifest system did not 
carry any stricter penalties for illegal dumpers it simply would 
make it easier to catch them 
steven romalewski long island toxics campaign coordinator for 
the new york public interest group criticized the plan as too 
little too late 
if the governor is making a stab at solving the medical waste 
problem this is a pathetic effort said romalewski whose group 
wants more legislative action the people of new york should not 
accept this 
syringes vials of drugs and other medical debris have also 
washed ashore from the gulf of mexico onto beaches in floridas 
panhandle during the past several weeks especially in recent days 
because of tropical storm beryl authorities said wednesday but 
escambia county flas environmental health director richard 
dunlap said there was no cause for alarm from a health standpoint 
its medical waste its not infectious waste he said 
the storm has brought in so much stuff in addition to medical 
debris

just hours after former actor ben jones won the 
democratic nomination for congress the gloves came off in the race 
for the suburban atlanta seat with incumbent pat swindall raising 
the issue of jones past alcoholism 
jones 46 who appeared on the dukes of hazzard tv series 
branded swindalls remarks a ploy to divert attention from the 
republicans admission that he considered accepting laundered drug 
money to finance an expensive home 
hes obviously trying to deflect attention from his own 
problems of the present by dealing with problems of my past 
jones said wednesday 
the race heated up wednesday the day after jones soundly 
defeated two challengers to win the 4th districts democratic 
nomination a second time two years ago jones got 47 percent of 
the vote in losing to swindall 
swindall who was unopposed for the gop nomination sent a 
letter to jones wednesday congratulating him and saying that before 
the two debate several issues regarding your qualifications for 
office must be resolved 
specifically swindall raised the issue of your alcoholism and 
past arrests and asked jones for copies of his arrest and health 
records by friday 
jones in turn suggested swindall meet me at emory hospital on 
friday and that we have a complete physical and mental evaluation 
as well as random drug testing throughout the campaign 
swindall said wednesday night he would not oblige jones jones 
said his arrest records are part of the public record and swindall 
could obtain them himself 
the former actor said that he has not taken a drink since 1977 
and that he has often spoke to church and student groups about his 
alcoholism 
he was arrested several times during his drinking days on 
misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges 
he said his driving record included speeding tickets and driving 
with an expired license but that he has never been arrested for 
drunken driving 
swindall was charged with drunken driving in 1980 but records 
indicate he was not prosecuted because of insufficient evidence 
earlier this year it was learned that swindall was involved in an 
undercover moneylaundering investigation 
a government videotape showed swindall pursuing an 850000 loan 
even after learning it might be financed with drug money until 
he was told by a man later identified as a federal agent that 
swindall would have to accept the proceeds in person and sign a 
receipt 
swindall said later he was embarrassed and ashamed that he 
considered accepting the loan but said he did not violate any law 
because he did not take the money he has asked the house ethics 
committee to investigate his actions

massachusetts supreme court today ruled that a 
measure that could close the states two commercial nuclear plants 
can go on the ballot in november 
by a vote of 32 the court affirmed attorney general james 
shannons view that the question could properly be placed before 
the voters 
the high court had considered whether the ballot question if 
passed constituted an illegal taking of private property 
without compensation 
the measure would prohibit the generation of electricity by 
means which result in the production of nuclear waste after july 
4 1989 
the power plants that could be affected are boston edison cos 
pilgrim plant in plymouth and yankee atomic electric cos plant in 
rowe 
shannon had argued in court papers that the ballot question 
does not either facially or implicitly exercise the power of 
eminent domain or mandate a physical taking or invasion of private 
property 
he noted that proponents assert that the property could be 
converted to another power source used for a lowlevel waste 
repository or used for other commercial purposes

top aides of plo leader yasser 
arafat disagreed over the implications of jordans move to cut ties 
to the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip with one calling 
it a violation of arab trust 
it is regrettable that the move was taken at the start of an 
international political vacuum that prevails from here till after 
the american elections khaled alhassan said in an interview 
published today in the saudi arabian newspaper alsharq alawsat 
jordan was committed by arab summit resolutions to certain 
obligations toward the west bank until the land is liberated 
the legal and administrative disengagement is a violation of those 
commitments he said 
alhassan is member of the central committee of fatah the 
leadership of the main guerrilla group under the plo umbrella 
but in the neighboring united arab emirates arafats righthand 
man in fatah salah khalaf was quoted as saying it is a 
courageous decision and enables the palestine liberation 
organization to shoulder its responsibility and take over new 
political rights 
the statements by khalaf also known as abu iyad were published 
in the newspaper albayan of dubai 
in his first comments on the move made this week to alsharq 
alawsat arafat expressed anger that king hussein of jordan had 
acted without consulting the plo he also criticized the timing of 
the move but would not talk at length so as not to explode 
relations with jordan 
however a rival palestinian group charged today that arafat was 
well aware of the measures before the king announced them 
in damascus a spokesman fatahuprising another faction led by 
col abu mousa said the group has information that contacts took 
place between king hussein and yasser arafat on the eve of 
announcing the jordanian decision contrary to what the plo 
claimed about not having been consulted in advance 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity also said the 
group was staunchly opposed to forming a palestinian 
governmentinexile 
husseins measures which cut jordans political and 
administrative links with 15 million palestinians in the west bank 
and gaza strip left an administrative vacuum in the 
israelioccupied areas 
palestinians in the areas have been rioting against israeli 
military rule for the past eight months nearly 240 palestinians 
and four israelis have been killed since the violence began dec 8 
the plo seeks an independent palestinian state on the west bank 
and gaza strip both seized by israel in june 1967 
alhassan also told alsharq alawsat the plo was not consulted 
before jordan acted this step casts thick shadows on the 
relationship of palestinianjordanian partnership he said 
he said problems would develop when government employees who no 
longer receive salaries from jordan seek other jobs and those who 
used to have jordanian passports seek other travel documents 
the move has political implications that could have grave 
implications for others than the plo he said he did not 
elaborate

senate majority leader robert c byrd said 
today the reagan white house has lost all credibility by brushing 
aside efforts to obtain a broad bipartisan consensus on aid to 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
its all take and no give with this white house byrd still 
fuming after wednesdays contra votes told reporters this morning 
its credibility what little it had must be gone by now it 
left the contras high and dry 
senate republicans say they refused to vote for a democratic 
contra aid plan because it did not represent a truly bipartisan 
approach and could not guarantee aid would reach the rebels inside 
nicaragua 
no republicans joined the majority when the senate voted 4947 
for a democratic proposal to provide the contras with 27 million 
in nonlethal humanitarian aid after oct 1 and to set the 
stage for a second vote on the possible resumption of 163 million 
in stockpiled military aid later in the year 
im sick and tired of a white house that has no steel in its 
guts byrd declared moments after the vote 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the white 
houses handling of the issue saying they were aware of our 
position but the vote is history the bill is out there 
we accept the outcome and go from here fitzwater said 
sen david boren dokla one of the strongest and most 
consistent democratic supporters of contra aid said that after the 
defeat of a rival gop proposal the democratic plan offered the 
only possibility that military aid to the contras ever will be 
resumed by the current congress 
he contended that after the senate voted 5739 to defeat the aid 
amendment offered by senate republican leader bob dole of kansas a 
oneline letter from reagan endorsing the democratic plan would 
have been enough to secure widespread republican support 
doles plan would have made the 163 million in stockpiled arms 
available immediately to the contras who oppose nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government without a second vote in the house 
and senate 
the moment came for the white house to send a signal boren 
said 
and we waited and i called and i knew that letter was going 
to come because i trusted them 
and the letter didnt come 
there is only one word that explains it boren said and 
that one word is politics 
vice president george bush has attempted to exploit the 
different positions taken on the issue by democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas 
dukakis has opposed the provision of lethal aid to the contras 
bentsen has voted for it in the past 
dole told the senate that many of his gop colleagues believe the 
democratic plan was intended as an umbrella a cover for the 
democratic presidential ticket and for democratic candidates who 
have opposed contra aid in the past 
but boren called the collapse of the effort to build bipartisan 
unity on the contra issue a tragically missed opportunity for the 
united states of america 
i predict it will set back the peace process he said i 
predict it will set back the cause of the resistance 
many republican senators criticized the plan offered by byrd as 
an amendment to a military appropriations bill because they said 
they did not trust house speaker jim wright of texas to keep his 
promise to permit a later vote to release the military aid if the 
president requested that action 
boren byrd and others said that wrights pledge made in a 
phone call to republican as well as democratic senators was of 
such high visibility that he could not renege on it 
you can inscribe your name in blood on a shaft of marble and 
they still wont believe you byrd said of his attempts to 
convince republicans that democrats were sincere in pursuing a 
process that could lead to the resumption of arms shipments to the 
contras 
they wont listen to reason he said they are suspicious 
of everybody they are paranoid i cant understand that kind of 
person in the united states senate 
sen william l armstrong rcolo replying to the democratic 
criticism said of byrd the answer why republicans didnt 
support his plan was because we didnt think it was a bipartisan 
plan 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the dole 
proposal would have provided solid support and a reliable 
deliverable system for the aid 
he said the byrd amendment was only minimally acceptable 
fitzwater said the reagan administration now hopes the byrd 
amendment will be changed in a conference with the house

jim thompson need not take time to stop 
and smell the flowers hell be paying someone else upwards of 
20000 to handle that 
thompson who plans to add a pool to his 10acre oakland hills 
tennis club was told by the city planning commission wednesday he 
must have a botanist on duty during the project because of a nearby 
patch of endangered wildflowers 
the patch is only one of three known sites in the world for the 
white and maroon clarkia franciscana 
im very privileged to have it on my land thompson said 
but its more of a nuisance than anything 
the botanist who at 100 an hour thompson figures may cost as 
much as 20000 would have to stay during excavation and concrete 
pouring for the pool which is 20 feet from the wildflowers 
with what its costing said michael dean his attorney i 
told him maybe he should charge admission for people to see it

prime minister yitzhak shamir today rejected a 
proposal by rightwing groups that israel annex the occupied 
territories now that jordan has cut administrative ties to the west 
bank and gaza strip 
shamir said in an interview with israels armed forces radio 
that the status of the territories which are home to 15 million 
palestinians should be subject to peace negotiations with 
palestinians who dont belong to or identify with the plo 
we honor our international obligations and we shall not make 
any unilateral step like imposing israeli rule on the territories 
that are subject to negotiations shamir said 
he was referring to the 1978 usnegotiated camp david accords 
between egypt and israel which call for five years of autonomy for 
palestinians before negotiations on the final status of land 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
palestinians oppose any solution short of an independent state 
and have demanded that any settlement be negotiated with yasser 
arafats palestine liberation organization 
last week king hussein abandoned any jordanian claims to the 
west bank challenging the plo to set up a palestinian state in the 
occupied lands where it has been leading an 8monthold uprising 
hussein also laid off about 21000 employees paid by jordan in the 
west bank and gaza strip 
arafats top aides disagreed over the move with one calling it 
a violation of arab trust 
jordan was committed by arab summit resolutions to certain 
obligations toward the west bank until the land is liberated 
khaled alhassan said in an interview published today in the saudi 
arabian newspaper alsharq alawsat 
alhassan is member of the central committee of fatah the 
leadership of the main guerrilla group under the plo umbrella 
but the albayan newspaper of neighboring dubai quoted arafats 
righthand man in fatah salah khalaf as saying the courageous 
decision allows the plo to shoulder its responsibility and take 
over new political rights 
arafat has expressed anger that hussein did not consult the plo 
before cutting ties but an anonymous spokesman for the rival 
fatahuprising led by col abu mousa said in damascus that 
hussein and arafat conferred the day before the decision was 
announced 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi said his country will pay the 
salaries of former jordanian workers in the occupied lands radio 
monte carlo reported today 
an israeli foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity declined comment except to say it was very 
hypothetical to consider whether israel would allow any other 
arab country to send money into the territories 
shamir ruled out talks with the plo we would not talk to the 
plo because the plo is not interested in peace and has not deviated 
until today from its ideology of destroying israel he said 
we are ready to talk with palestinian arabs who are not plo 
members we are teady to talk with jordan or without jordan i 
mean real palestinian arabs who are not plo members 
shamir has been under pressure from his own likud bloc and 
allied rightwing parties to extend israeli law to the west bank 
and gaza which the right wing considers an integral part of the 
ancient land of israel 
the arab uprising began dec 8 and has claimed the lives of 239 
palestinians and four israelis 
the latest victim was 17yearold ahmed salah darameh of tubas 
on the west bank who died of bullet wounds wednesday night 
a military spokesman said a security man accompanying a military 
truck fired shots after youths threatened the truck by hurling 
rocks at it 
also wednesday an israeli soldier was burned in the face and 
hands by a firebomb thrown at a military jeep in the west bank city 
of ramallah an arab woman also was slightly burned on the leg in 
the attack the army said

the nuclear regulatory commission today 
proposed the largest fine in its history 125 million because 
operators at pennsylvanias peach bottom nuclear plant slept on the 
job 
in addition the nrc said it would fine 33 present or former 
operators at philadelphia electric co the first time the 
commission has ever imposed civil penalties for individual 
operators the fines will range from 500 to 1000 
the operators are being fined for sleeping andor other acts 
of inattention to duty at peach bottom on the susquehanna river 
near the pennsylvaniamaryland line the nrc said 
the nrc called the 125 million a proposed fine because it said 
the company has a chance to protest it in in whole or in part to 
the nrc staff said frank ingram of the commission 
in informing the company of the fine the nrc said all levels 
of plant management at that time either knew or should have known 
of these facts 
the federal agency ordered the york county pa plant closed in 
1987 citing a pattern of control room operators dozing on the job 
since then peco has shuffled its management and tried repeatedly 
to get the commission to approve restart plans 
peco operates two units at peach bottom the utility also 
operates the limerick nuclear plant in montgomery county near 
philadelphia 
the proposed nrc actions are strong medicine for the 
philadelphia electric co and a very clear message to the entire 
nuclear industry peco spokesman william jones said we are 
relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and that 
we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the peach 
bottom restart plan 
peco officials have said they plan to restart the plant with 
the nrcs approval by the end of the year

copenhagen denmark to athens under the name hejab aballa the 
paper said

the fur is flying in nevada county 
over a november ballot proposal to ban the use of steeljaw leg 
traps the first time that voters in california will have a say on 
the issue 
those favoring the ban say the traps whichg and are indiscriminate 
posing a 
hazard to humans their pets and nontarget animals 
advocates including ranchers and government predator control 
experts say the traps are vital in their struggle to protect 
livestock crops and property the traps also help control 
outbreaks of rabies and other animalcarried diseases they say 
sixtysix countries have banned the traps and their use is 
restricted in four states other california communities have 
outlawed them although the november initiative in the rural 
mountainous county northeast of sacramento is the first time voters 
in any of californias 58 counties will decide the issue 
san francisco has had a ban since 1977 and two years ago the 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals in santa cruz 
waged a successful campaign to get the board of supervisors to 
outlaw steeljaw traps in the county santa clara county 
supervisors passed a similar ordinance in april 
steeljaw leg traps are triggered when pressure is applied to a 
pad snapping the ushaped springoperated toothless jaws closed 
the traps are available in a range of sizes for different animals 
the most powerful bear traps were outlawed in california years ago 
because they used to find too many hunters trapped in them 
said art johnston chairman of citizens for a healthful and safe 
environment or chase which favors the ban 
debate has been charged with proponents of the ban trying to 
make their case using photographs of maimed pets mangled animals 
and threelegged survivors who chewed off a paw in their desperate 
escapes those who say the traps are necessary complain they are 
helpless to counter the emotional appeals 
the thing actually has taken on all of the intensity of a 
religious controversy with people rabidly for it and people 
rabidly against it johnston who joined the fray seven months 
ago said recently 
were not saying you cant trap anymore or you cant control 
predators were just saying use a trap that if a kid gets caught 
in it they can get out thats all were saying 
david lester a federal trapper who contracts with nevada county 
to do predator control by request on about 30000 acres says his 
job is misunderstood 
theres responsible people on both sides and then theres 
radicals on both sides its frustrating said lester who 
was born and raised in the county and whose uncle was the county 
trapper before him ive read in the paper where ive been called 
a moron for setting these traps i feel im as much a part of 
nature as that blade of grass or the coyote 
the county traps a maximum of 50 at any time are set off 
trails to protect people he said commercial fur trapping is done 
during the winter when fewer people are outside he said 
trappers are required by law to check their traps daily but 
enforcement is nonexistent and many animals die of starvation or 
exposure critics say 
it just has no place in a civilized society especially 
because there are so many alternatives said judy cassada 
director of education for the santa cruz chapter of the spca 
instead of the steel traps ranchers should use fencing 
shepherding and guard dogs the bans proponents say 
ron tapp is one of the initiatives supporters he couldnt walk 
for two weeks after he stepped in a coyotesized trap while 
backpacking along the feather river he said 
the real problem those who favor the initiative say is that 
authorities see a successful crackdown on the use of steeljaw 
traps as a major erosion of their powers that could trigger further 
victories by animal rights activists who oppose wildlife 
management and recreational hunting trapping and fishing 
they dont want to be regulated because they never have 
been regulated says tanja keogh a cocoordinator of chase 
its the old wild west mentality theyre afraid if we win 
the next step is well be taking away their guns

says you have to be in a car he said it just seemed 
ridiculous i couldnt get the burgers on sale 
in the commercial a pedestrian picks up an order at the 
drivethrough window told that hes not in a car he responds 
thats what they told me at the car wash 
the ad and special sale price are part of a promotion to 
increase sales at the window said frank gallardo wendys district 
manager he said company policy is to serve only people in a 
vehicle because the traffic makes the lane dangerous for 
pedestrians 
although similar incidents have occurred gallardo said this 
was the first time police had to be called

political action committees have boosted their 
contributions to house and senate candidates democrats and 
incumbents in the 198788 election cycle but theyre giving less 
to republicans 
statistics released thursday by the federal election commission 
said democratic candidates experienced the most dramatic jump in 
pac donations collecting 52 million from jan 1 1987 to june 30 
1988 thats 444 percent better than they did last time around 
republicans by contrast collected 28 million from pacs a 
67 percent drop since democrats wrested control of the senate in 
1986 the gop has been in the minority in both chambers 
incumbents received 66 million from pacs a 294 percent 
increase over the last election cycle challengers remained steady 
with pac donations of 7 million candidates for open seats 
received 6 million a 25 percent drop from two years ago 
house candidates experienced a 293 percent rise in pac 
contributions up to 53 million and pacs were not the only rising 
financial indicator for house candidates according to the fec 
analysis 
spending by house candidates rose 11 percent this year to 111 
million and fundraising was up nearly 12 percent to 154 million 
the agency said greater numbers of house incumbents are seeking 
reelection accounting for part of the acrosstheboard jump 
on the senate side spending and fundraising dropped at least 
partly due to the differences between 1986 and 1988 candidates and 
races spending fell 239 percent to 70 million while 
fundraising declined 65 percent to 116 million the fec said 
pac contributions to senate candidates continued to rise 
however from 24 million two years ago to 27 million during the 
current cycle 
overall money raised by house and senate candidates so far in 
this cycle came to 270 million up 3 percent from two years ago 
spending by candidates for the two chambers stood at 181 million 
a 57 percent decline 
the fec said the number of candidates participating in federal 
elections continued to decline a trend that started in 1984 the 
decline this year is confined to democrats the agency said 
particularly challengers and open seat campaigns

sen lowell p weicker jr today agreed to 
drop his call for the republican platform to include a tougher 
antiapartheid stand thereby making a convention floor fight 
unlikely on any minority plank 
his move came as the republican platform committee moved toward 
completion of the draft document that will be presented to the 
partys national convention next tuesday 
steve snider a weicker spokesman said the senator agreed to 
withdraw his platform amendment seeking tough sanctions against 
apartheid after getting support from bush campaign officials for 
another amendment calling for merger of the environmental 
protection agency and the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
nebraska gov kay orr cochairman of the platform committee 
said today at a news conference that with republicans closing ranks 
around their draft platform it is unlikely any minority amendments 
will be offered at next weeks republican national convention 
cochairman robert kasten a senator from wisconsin said 
earlier on nbctv weve built upon a constructive conservative 
platform we had in 1984 and then expanded it were going to deal 
with drugs were going to deal with aids were going to deal with 
education in a more detailed way than in 1984 
on wednesday the 106member committee resisted moderates 
efforts to expand an aids plank and to tone down the drafts stern 
stance against abortion but they endorsed the concept of 
catastrophic health coverage for sick children 
the party is coming together we dont have to have 
minority planks because the platform process itself has worked so 
well said rep jerry lewis of california another cochairman 
orr and other committee leaders acknowledged that the 
catastrophic care plank was vague like the democrats platform 
they criticize relentlessly 
lordy lordy there are so many loopholes in the 
catastrophic plank said marilyn thayer of new orleans it does not 
promise a new government program she said adding under the 
republican party we dont just look toward government to spend 
peoples hardearned tax dollars to do this 
the committee voted 5532 after a heated debate on abortion to 
keep intact a declaration that the unborn child has a fundamental 
individual right to life which cannot be infringed 
cannot be infringed says to me that men and fetuses have a 
right to life at all times but women lost that right when they 
become pregnant said marjorie bell chambers of los alamos nm 
who tried to strike the last four words 
they rejected by voice vote an amendment to allow medicaid 
funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest despite a plea 
from rep nancy johnson of connecticut to recognize that rape is 
awful 
murder under any circumstances is also a terrible crime 
replied antiabortion delegate pat elf of kihei hawaii 
they approved 5330 a weicker plank saying the gop will work 
toward making catasrophic coverage available to our youngest 
citizens 
weicker assured fellow delegates there was no financial 
commitment involved but rather a commitment of spirit by this 
party 
angela bay buchanan former us treasurer from irvine 
calif warned that the republicans who have pilloried the 
democratic platform as deceitful might be headed down the same 
path the gop platform pledges not to raise taxes but we all 
know catastrophic coverage is going to be expensive she said 
they refused by voice vote to expand their plank on the deadly 
aids disease to endorse the recommendations of the presidents 
commission especially its main one calling for antidiscrimination 
legislation vice president george bush has endorsed the entire 
watkins commission report but president reagan has not 
the time has come to clearly put us on record for what needs 
to be done said weicker never before have we asked anybody 
who was hurting how they got hurt 
james summers an apartment builder from bellevue wash said 
aids was the first legalized communicable disease in the history 
of the united states 
summers said the strength of the homosexual lobby had 
prevented the country from taking stronger action to contain the 
epidemic 
the draft platform which will be presented to the republican 
national convention on tuesday calls for a vigorous fight against 
aids compassion and help for victims and steps to protect 
those who do not have the disease 
the committee also rejected after a perfunctory debate a 
proequal rights amendment sought by delawares lynn glaze 
the draft platform holds fast to the partys 1980 and 1984 
pledges not to raise taxes and to seek a constitutional amendment 
outlawing abortion and calls for rapid and certain deployment 
of the strategic defense initiative

a senate national parks subcommittee announced 
today a hearing on what has become known as the third battle of 
manassas the fight by preservationists to prevent construction 
of a shopping mall adjacent to a civil war battlefield in northern 
virginia 
the senate energy and natural resources subcommittee on public 
lands national parks and forests will meet sept 8 to consider 
legislation which the house passed 30798 on wednesday to buy the 
542acre mall site next to the battlefield where the confederacy 
won two major battles in 1861 and 1862 
historians and preservationists say a shopping mall would 
desecrate the union and confederate soldiers who died on the 
battlefield the house bill would add the land to the existing 
battlefield park 
sen john w warner rva said that after testimony is taken 
at the hearing he may offer legislation to buy only a part of the 
developers tract 
my concern continues to be that the federal government could 
spend a significant amount of the taxpayers money for a parcel of 
land which during the debates in 1980 was not regarded as 
historically significant for the park expansion bill said warner 
if congress prevents development on this site and purchases 
the property at considerable expense to the federal taxpayer and 
the mall is moved to a nearby site and built is that expenditure 
of federal funds justified in order to protect property which has 
some historical significance he asked 
warner said he believes the tracts stuarts hill where 
confederate gen robert e lee had headquaters during the second 
battle of manassas in 1862 should be considered for inclusion in 
the manassas national battlefield park 
the reagan administration opposes the measure because of its 
cost estimated to range from 15 million to 100 million office 
of management and budget and interior department officials have 
said they would recommend that president reagan veto the measure if 
congress enacts it in its current form 
one of the major floor debates was the cost versus the 
preservation of american heritage 
rep stan parris rva said important pieces of property 
representing americas heritage must be preserved 
our country and our culture are built upon our heritage he 
said our past is an important part of our present and our 
future 
however when the matter came to a vote parris voted 
present because the developer john t hazel has been a close 
friend and campaign contributor to him for many years 
rep bill frenzel rminn called the measure a squandering 
of the taxpayers money this should have a low priority or no 
priority 
rep barney frank dmass also opposed the measure saying 
this is an extraordinary expenditure when we deny the needy 
but rep bruce v vento dminn floor manager for the bill 
said this is about history about our cultural history that must 
be preserved 
its a matter of whether we preserve our history or turn it 
into a dollar he said 
hazel purchased the land two years ago for under 10 million it 
is now assessed at 136 million he wants to build 12 million 
square feet of retail space 17 million square feet of office 
space and 560 homes next to the site of the two major civil war 
battles 
historians and preservationists complain that the development 
site includes a bluff from which confederate gen robert e lee 
commanded southern troops in the second battle of manassas 
the tract also was the site of two field hospitals they say 
most historians believe that the remains of union and confederate 
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site 
the first battle of manassas fought in july 1861 was the first 
significant land battle of the civil war a surprising confederate 
victory there convinced union authorities that the war would be a 
protracted affair 
more than 20000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the 
second battle of manassas which lasted over three days in august 
1862 most historians agree that lees triumph in that battle 
represented the confederacys greatest victory in the war

shock waves reverberating through world 
financial markets in recent days reflect fears that the federal 
reserve may have set off spiraling interestrate increases that 
will circulate around the globe 
until there is a clearcut signal that the economies of the 
world are growing at a slower pace the bias is going to be toward 
higher interest rates says david resler chief economist at 
nomura securities international inc but he doesnt expect an 
allout rate war 
in the long term higher interest rates can work to stabilize 
stock and bond prices by calming inflation worries but in the 
immediate aftermath of the feds increase in its key lending rate 
tuesday many traders remained skittish 
as expected us banks reacted to the feds rate increase today 
by raising their prime lending rate a half a percentage point to 10

in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share index

on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 
4499 points wednesday to close at 203414 after losing more than 
28 points the previous day government bond prices dropped while 
their yields soared to rates not seen since december 
at midday today the dow was off about 3 points at the 2031 
level but analysts said prices were becoming low enough to attract 
some bargainhunters 
the markets began reeling tuesday after the fed unexpectedly 
announced a halfpercentagepoint increase in the discount rate 
that put the fee the fed charges member banks for shortterm loans 
at 65 percent its highest level in more than two years 
some said markets overseas were caught by surprise and 
overreacted many investors around the world had assumed the fed 
would refrain from taking any interestrate action until after 
novembers presidential election 
but with the feds decisive antiinflation move theres 
worry on a worldwide basis that everybody is competing with 
interest rates as their weapon said hugh johnson senior vice 
president at first albany corp 
many of the nations major trading partners have taken action 
recently to push up shortterm interest rates albeit for different 
reasons west germany is concerned that its currency has been 
losing value while britain is working to hold down inflation 
rate hikes for whatever reason make markets fairly nervous 
even though cooperation among the major western trading nations 
hasnt broken down johnson said theres nervousness that it 
could break down 
interest rate coordination typically is uncertain its an 
uneasy alliance said ronald solberg a vice president and senior 
international economist at security pacific national bank in los 
angeles 
the coordinated moves over the last two years were more the 
result of individual vested interest rather than a gracious 
contribution toward coordination he said 
if interest rates become a drawing card for us securities 
some of the money siphoned out of japans stock market could find 
its way into american markets 
theres no doubt that japanese portfolio managers have an 
ongoing appetite for usdollar assets and this increased rate 
differential makes them attractive solberg said 
the japanese governments longterm bond is yielding about 54 
percent compared with a yield of more than 93 percent wednesday 
on the us treasurys bellwether 30year issue 
central banks are unlikely to increase interest rates solely to 
prevent money from flowing into us markets 
nomuras resler said interest rates are rising not because 
monetary authorities are trying to attract capital but because the 
prospects are for faster inflation a condition that favors higher 
rates

socialist president rodrigo borja sworn 
in for a fouryear term accused his archconservative predecessor 
of dragging ecuador into economic disaster and promised an 
emergency plan to end the crisis 
borja 53 received the yellow blue and red presidential sash 
from wilfrido lucero president of the national legislature during 
wednesday nights inauguration 
the outgoing president leon febres cordero refused to 
personally hand over the sash to borja in 1984 borja lost a 
bitter runoff to febres cordero who was the reagan 
administrations closest ally in south america 
attending the ceremony were seven foreign leaders including 
cubas fidel castro the united states was represented by secretary 
of state george p shultz who was booed by some people in the 
crowd 
borja today met president daniel ortega of nicaragua who could 
not come to the inauguration because the outgoing president refused 
to let him into the country febres cordero broke diplomatic ties 
with nicaragua in 1985 and ortega and borja planned to restore 
relations later today 
borja head of ecuadors democratic left party has promised a 
nonaligned policy and said that one of his first official acts 
will be to restore ties with nicaragua 
we have received a country in moral and economic bankrupcy 
borja said during his 2hour inaugural speech the leftist law 
professor said the freemarket economic system febres cordero 
encouraged has fueled inflation and impoverished the nation of 10 
million 
you dont have to be an economist to know that borja said 
it is enough to go to the market walk along the country roads or 
visit shantytowns to feel the daily drama of poor people 
he promised an emergency plan to solve the problem but gave no 
details 
borja won the presidency in may defeating populist candidate 
abdala bucaram febres cordero who served one term was not 
eligible for reelection 
in a farewell speech earlier febres cordero defended his 
governments efforts to deal with what he called ecuadors worst 
economic crisis he noted that oil prices which provide 60 percent 
of the nations hard currency earnings had recently plunged to 13 
a barrel from 27 a barrel in 1984 
in addition he said the economy was severely affected by 
earthquakes that crippled the oil industry for six months last year 
ecuadors economy burdened by a 92 billion debt shrank by 
35 percent in 1987 less than half the work force has fulltime 
jobs and inflation is running at an annual rate of 55 percent 
in an apparent reference to the new presidents stated plans to 
drop the freemarket economy shultz told reporters after meeting 
with borja i think that one of the things that is crystal clear 
in the world today is that method of running an economy by central 
control as advocated by the left simply doesnt work 
the most recent sample right here in this neighborhood is the 
example of nicaragua he said 
borja said ecuador cannot pay its foreign debt under the present 
conditions in the friendliest possible manner i ask from our 
creditors a more understanding attitude as the basis for a lasting 
understanding 
ecuador is more than 1 billion in arrears in the service of its 
debt 
also attending the inauguration were presidents oscar arias of 
costa rica jaime lusinchi of venezuela virgilio barco of 
colombia raul alfonsin of argentina julio sanguinetti of uruguay 
and mario soares of portugal

an expelled armenian activists requests to return 
to the soviet union are not being taken seriously by the 
government a legal official said thursday 
paruyr ayrikyan was stripped of his soviet citizenship and 
expelled from the country to sovietallied ethiopia on july 21 
the 39yearold armenian activist was arrested in march for his 
part in spreading word to western journalists about the armenian 
peoples campaign to have a region of neighboring azerbaijan 
annexed to their republic 
pavel a laptiev an aide with the soviet state 
prosecutorgenerals office appeared at a foreign ministry 
briefing to discuss the handling of ayrikyans case 
laptiev contended ayrikyan had asked during his imprisonment to 
be allowed to emigrate to the united states 
ayrikyan however told reporters in paris last week that after 
his arrest soviet authorities gave him the choice of returning to 
prison or going to the united states he said he was expelled 
because soviet officials feared putting him on trial would lead to 
more interethnic hostility 
the us government declined to issue ayrikyan an immigration 
visa on the grounds that he was leaving the soviet union against 
his will 
in news conferences in paris rome and bonn west germany 
ayrikyan has said he would like to return to armenia he said he 
has applied to the soviet embassy in paris for permission to do so 
soviet officials indicate the appeal will be rejected 
his requests to be reinstated cannot be taken seriously 
laptiev told reporters 
laptiev disputed western news reports that suggested ayrikyan 
was summarily expelled against his wishes but conceded the 
activist was stripped of soviet citizenship in the same action that 
dropped charges against him 
soviet law does not allow emigration if a criminal case is 
pending against the applicant laptiev said to clear that 
obstacle preliminary charges that allowed ayrikyan to be jailed 
for more than four months this year were dropped by an order of the 
presidium of the supreme soviet 
ethnic rioting killed at least 32 people in azerbaijan after 
armenians launched a campaign in february to annex a part of 
azerbaijan to armenia

false claims and attempted tax evasion before us district judge 
norma holloway johnson who scheduled sentencing for oct 11 
the judge reminded burns that he could receive up to 20 years 
imprisonment and be fined up to 500000 upon the convictions 
but under sentencing guidelines implemented last year that take 
into account a defendants past criminal history burns would 
receive a prison term ranging from 2 12 to three years and a 
month according to justice department prosecutor james cole 
both sides may withdraw from the plea agreement if the sentence 
calculated by the probation department is different from the range

since 1982 he submitted false claim forms to arrange for the 
issuance of travel reimbursement checks to a vincent kauffman 
as a financial officer burns could sign the forms to authorize 
issuance of the checks 
the checks were sent to a washington bank account that burns set 
up under kauffmans name cole told johnson that all of the 
deposits into the account were treasury checks burns withdrew 
money by forging checks to himself and signing kauffmans signature 
or using an automatic teller card to get cash

jewels and other personal luxury items for mr burns and his 
family cole said

than 56000 burns also pleaded guilty to a charge that he failed 
to report any of the money he embezzled as income to avoid paying

his desire to make a bad situation better 
urging johnson to allow burns to remain free on 500000 bond 
addis argued burns wont jump bail he has a family he has two 
children he knows he has injured them terribly he is not going to 
do anything to compound that 
the judge allowed burns to remain free on bond pending 
sentencing

government investigators a full accounting of their assets burns 
agreed to make up the difference between the money the government 
collects from selling his property and the amount he stole from the

the earth shook a little less in the first 
half of this year 
the us geological survey reported thursday that there were 26 
significant earthquakes in the first six months of the year three 
fewer than in the same period a year ago 
and only 12 deaths have been attirbuted to quakes around the 
world in the first half of the year 
if that rate continued an annual total of 24 deaths would be 
the lowest ever recorded the survey said the current low record 
is 77 deaths in 1984 the high was 600000 in 1976 
one of this years deaths was in the united states a heart 
attack victim in california on feb 11 
of the 26 significant quakes this year only two affected the 
united states one was the feb 11 event that qualified as 
significant because of the death although it measured only 48 on 
the richter scale of ground motion 
to be considered significant a quake must cause casualties or 
measure at least 65 on the scale 
the second us quake qualified easily scoring a 76 it 
occurred march 6 in the gulf of alaska skaking parts of alaska and 
canada and generating a small tsunami or sea wave 
that was in fact the strongest quake so far this year the 
world has now gone more than 60 months without a great temblor 
measuring 80 or more 
the richter scale is a measure of the force of a quake as 
determined by ground motion an increase of one whole number from 
66 to 76 for example represents a tenfold increase in the 
strength of the quake

democrat michael dukakis said today the nation needs a real 
leader in the white house to make defense policy based on tough 
management not wishful thinking and blank checks as george bush 
reached out for minority votes republicans have not attracted in 
recent years 
the pace of preparations for the republican national convention 
in new orleans picked up as platform writers hoped to finish the 
gop document by the end of the day 
sen lowell p weicker jr rconn today agreed to drop his 
call for the platform to include a tougher stand against apartheid 
and nebraska gov kay orr cochairman of the platform committee 
said that with republicans closing ranks around the draft document 
it is unlikely any minority amendments will be offered at next 
weeks convention 
dukakis kicked off a fivestate campaign trip with a speech on 
leadership at new york university 
without mentioning bush by name the masssachusetts governor 
sought to portray himself as a chief executive who would not 
tolerate waste in the pentagon and would clean up the mess in 
military procurement 
weve got to have a real leader in the white house who will 
insist that when it comes to our national security were going to 
make our decisions based not on whats good for one company or one 
military service or one political party but on whats good for 
america dukakis said 
the test of a successful defense policy isnt how much money 
we spend its how much security we buy the democratic 
presidential nominee said and for the past eight years we 
havent gotten what weve gone into debt forwe have to build 
strong military forces based on sound planning and tough 
management not wishful thinking and blank checks 
bush spent more time in washington today working on his 
acceptance speech to be delivered a week from tonight he and his 
family had lunch with president and nancy reagan at the white house 
for a rare gathering of both couples the white house announced 
today that the reagans and bushes would also cross paths tuesday in 
new orleans as reagan leaves the convention city after his 
farewell and bush arrives for his coronation 
later today the vice president scheduled an announcement 
designed to demonstrate that democrats cannot take black votes for 
granted he was to announce a group known as the national black 
americans for bush campaign aides said it would include about 100 
blacks including officeholders and prominent black republicans 
on wednesday dukakis helped to break ground for a new sewage 
plant to help clean up boston harbor a 6 billion undertaking that 
is also the largest public works undertaking in massachusetts 
history 
in response to republicans who had pummeled him for deciding in 
his first term as governor to delay efforts to end the pollution 
problems there dukakis said nobody could really tell us what to 
do to clean up this place there were very respected people 
experts in the field who disagreed 
bush campaign manager lee atwater nonetheless added another slam 
on wednesday saying if it takes the governor of massachusetts 
11 years to clean up his own harbor americans must question his 
commitment to the even larger environmental questions which face 
our nation 
bush jumped to the defense of his boss on wednesday saying 
reagan has not altered his stance on the issues or made personnel 
decisions to help bush in the fall campaign 
almost everything the president does he gets asked a 
question are you doing this to help george bush or are you 
doing this because of 88 and i guess its just that time of 
year bush said in washington 
reagan recently picked two people close to bush for cabinet jobs 
investment banker nicholas brady for treasury and former 
pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh for attorney general and he 
named a hispanic to head the education department just weeks after 
bush promised to put a hispanic in his cabinet 
bush also lobbied reagan to allow a plantclosing notification 
bill to become law and to veto a 2995 billion defense 
authorization bill 
also in new orleans the full 106member platform committee 
ground through the 30000word draft document sticking to a 
conservative approach but declaring the party is open to minorities 
and women 
the draft echoes the 1984 document including a pledge not to 
raise taxes support for constitutional amendments to ban abortion 
and balance the federal budget and backing for rapid and certain 
deployment of the strategic defense initiative 
the party in trouble with many female voters added women 
to the plank on economic opportunity making the phrasing the gop 
is the natural champion of blacks minorities women and ethnic 
americans 
but the rnc swiftly rejected an appeal from a group calling 
itself freedom republicans to include more minorities on party 
bodies 
it seems to me that the republican party looks at us like 
limburger cheese a little bit of us goes a long way said 
lugenia gordon a 67yearold black woman from new york city

an examination of space shuttle 
discovery a day after its test firing turned up no problems to 
stand in the way of getting the shuttle ready for flight nasa said 
thursday 
this vehicle is the cleanest weve ever had after a 
flightreadiness firing said lisa malone a spokeswoman for 
nasas kennedy space center we havent turned up anything 
unusual 
the successful firing of the three huge engines was a spirit 
lifter for space workers here who have had to overcome one problem 
after another since discovery was transported to the launch pad 
july 4 
miss malone said officials of the national aeronautics and space 
administration will not set a launch date until a repair unrelated 
to the hotfire test of the engines is completed 
that repair which involves cutting a hole in the discoverys 
bulkhead to gain access to pipe connection that is leaking gas is 
scheduled to begin wednesday and will take about six days the leak 
is in the system used to steer discovery in space 
nasa has one other milestone to meet before setting a date for 
the first flight since challenger exploded in january 1986 that is 
a test scheduled for aug 18 of a shuttle booster rocket at the 
manufacturing plant in utah the test is the fifth in a series of 
the booster which was heavily redesigned after challenger 
a faulty joint in challengers right booster allowed flames to 
escape and triggered the destruction of the shuttle the joint and 
other booster systems have been thoroughly redesigned 
the rocket will be deliberately flawed with grooves cuts and 
debondings introduced in critical areas like insulation and oring 
seals 
it is a significant flaw demonstration test said robert 
crippen deputy director of shuttle operations some say there is 
a risk in it but we have to test the booster to withstand these 
worstcase situations

swedes opened their annual crayfish 
season thursday with much singing and slurping but the national 
holiday had to be helped with imports from china and louisiana 
swedens crayfish stocks were decimated by a bacterial plague 
beginning in the 1960s since then this country of 84 million 
people has become one of the worlds biggest importers of the 
shellfish with about 1800 tons a year 
the price of the scarce swedish crayfish hit about 61 for two 
pounds but american imports were readily available at 15 bargains 
us imports of 1000 tons this year ended turkeys previous 
dominanation of the market 
technically thursday is the opening of the fishing season for 
the freshwater crustaceans but traditionally no one eats even the 
imported varieties until aug 11 
the crayfish are boiled in dill and smothered in tradition 
swedes eat them wearing party hats and bibs timehonored rules say 
each claw should be downed with a glass of schnapps 
with an influx of imports from new countries swedish newspapers 
held gourmet tests to evaluate this years crop judges were 
swedish celebrities actors or famous chefs 
svenska dagbladet proclaimed an american west coast variety 
named california sunshine as the best fresh and tasty with 
beautiful coloring the paper judged the chinese jumbo prino 
looked great but tasted disgusting it said

major us banks raised their prime rate a half 
percentage point to 10 percent today two days after the federal 
reserve boosted its own key lending rate to stave off inflation 
the increase brings the closely watched prime rate to its 
highest level since june 18 1985 when it was lowered to 95 
percent from 10 percent 
chase manhattan bank started todays move with citibank 
manufacturers hanover trust chemical bank bankers trust first 
national bank of chicago and continental illinois national bank and 
morgan guaranty quickly matching the rise 
major banks on the west coast such as wells fargo bank and 
security pacific national bank also followed suit 
stock and bond prices were mixed and the dollar moved slightly 
higher after the announcment 
it was the third time this year that banks have raised the 
prime which is used in setting a range of fixed and 
adjustablerate corporate and consumer loans 
with interest rates moving higher youre going to see 
increases in fixed and adjustable rate mortgages and floating 
lines of credit said elizabeth g reiners an economist at dean 
witter reynolds inc 
if you want to go out and get a car loan or an unsecured line 
of credit to buy furniture thats going to cost you more 
economists had expected the move after the fed signaled its 
desire to tighten credit by raising its discount rate to 65 
percent from 6 percent on tuesday largely as a means of holding 
down inflationary pressures 
the discount rate is the interest the fed charges on loans to 
member banks 
interest rates have been rising steadily in recent months in 
reaction to the strength of the economy 
mrs reiners said banks decided to raise the prime after the 
federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between banks 
suged above 8 percent 
usually theres a pretty good correlation between the spread 
of fed funds and the prime rate she said

scientists at a conference organized by the 
environmental group greenpeace urged northern european countries 
thursday to stop polluting the north and baltic seas until they can 
solve the mysterious deaths of thousands of seals 
scientists said it was unclear whether pollution was playing a 
role in the deaths and they called for international research 
greenpeace said it will take direct nonviolent action in all 
countries bordering the north and baltic seas including blocking 
pipelines that discharge toxic chemicals 
the time for words is gone said andy booth greenpeace 
internationals north sea coordinator 
time is running out for these oceans he said at a news 
conference following the meeting of scientists from britain 
denmark norway sweden west germany and the netherlands 
booth said greenpeace will send the meetings conclusions to the 
leaders of all governments bordering the north and baltic seas and 
will urge them to introduce urgent measures to ease pollution 
greenpeace will be peacefully trying to prevent the flow of 
certain peristent manmade chemicals which we regard as too 
dangerous to be discharged into the marine environment he added 
greenpeace did not reveal when or where it would try to block 
pipelines 
conference chairman minnie courtney said about 7000 harbor 
seals have died in the north and baltic seas since april out of a 
population of 15000 to 16000 seals 
in some areas up to half the harbor seals have died and there 
are indications other seal species may become infected she said 
two viruses have been isolated among the dead seals said ms 
courtney senior lecturer in biology at the university of londons 
queen mary college which cosponsored the conference 
she added however that we dont understand why the disease 
should have spread so quickly through the seals and we dont 
understand why they are reacting to it so badly 
there is no doubt that the baltic and the north seas are very 
polluted areas theyre some of the most polluted marine waters in 
the world 
every year an estimateed 260000 tons of liquid industrial 
waste 77 million tons of dredged materials and 5 million tons of 
sewage sludge are discharged into the north sea 
an international research project to study the effect of 
environmental factors including pollutants on the immune system 
of seals should be started immediately ms courtney said 
in the interim every effort should be made to reduce the 
leakage of pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls into the environment 
immediate effective precautionary measures should be taken to 
stop the discharge of other persistent pollutants 
the viruses leave the seals suffering from a variety of 
symptoms including lethargy diarrhea skin lesions and 
spontaneous abortions autopsies show inflamed brains and other 
organs 
the scienists said there have been similar cases of mass seal 
deaths in nonpolluted waters 
sheila anderson of britains sea mammal research unit said 400 
harbor seals died off the new england coast in 197980 and 2000 
crabeater seals died in the antarctic in 1955 in both cases the 
cause of death was thought to be viral pneumonia 
but ms courtney said there is evidence from other animals that 
pcbs dioxins and other toxic chemicals in the north and baltic 
seas can interefere with immune systems 
the seas are contaminated with a very complex mixture of toxic 
chemicals some of which are discharged in millions of tons 
annually she said the individual action and the 
interactions of these are poorly understood and cannot be excluded 
as an additional factor in the seal deaths

illegal traders make about 15 billion a year 
from crocodiles parrots chimpanzees and other endangered 
wildlife and many of the animals suffocate or starve during 
shipment a wildlife enforcement official said thursday 
illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summer 
and christmas holiday seasons because customs officials often are 
overloaded and the shipments slip past them jeanpatrick le duc 
told a news conference 
le duc is an enforcement official for the convention on 
international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora 
which aims to prevent international trade from threatening species 
with extinction 
the convention in force since 1975 has been ratified by 95 
countries including the united states most latin american 
countries except mexico and many asian african and european 
nations 
signatories are supposed to enforce bans on commercial trade in 
an agreed list of endangered species and to regulate trade in 
others that might become endangered 
endangered species on the list include all apes the giant 
panda many south american monkeys the asian elephant all 
rhinoceroses many birds of prey and parrots all sea turtles some 
crocodiles and great whales no permits are issued for 
international trade in these species except under unusual 
circumstances 
le duc said many people think live animals make good christmas 
presents in europe for example parrots and reptiles including 
baby crocodiles are increasingly popular pets 
he said total trade legal and illegal in wildlife amounts to 
5 billion annually he estimated that illegal trade is about 30 
percent of the total 
the hotspots of illicit wildlife trade are southeast asia 
japan latin america and africa although africa is doing more 
than any other developing country to try to control it le duc 
said 
but he said a trader could buy a gray parrot in ghana for about 
10 and resell it for about 600 in north america 
a statement from the conventions headquarters in lausanne 
listed 10 examples of illicit trade that have been thwarted in the 
past 10 weeks 
in one case a notorious convicted animal trader sent crates 
with live animals from equatorial guinea destined for honduras via 
spain it said 
at madrid airport customs agents stopped the shipment in the 
crates they found five chimpanzees two dead 12 crocodiles three 
dead nine mandrill monkeys one dead 11 agama lizards nine 
dead seven tortoises 17 saimiri monkeys two dead and 31 gray 
parrots the statement said the surviving animals were given 
to the madrid zoo 
in two other cases 8000 baby crocodiles were shipped from 
colombia to taiwan it said one shipment of 2000 was discovered 
because of the stench of about 1500 that had died 
the statement said a female asian elephant recently arrived in 
the dutch port of rotterdam from vietnam hidden in a large 
crate her skin had dried up during the onemonth journey and she 
was in a pitiful state it said the elephant survived and is 
at the rotterdam zoo

us sen malcolm wallop says hes not 
worried a democratic resurgence in the west being forecast by some 
pollsters will sweep him from office in november 
wyoming voters he says have too much to lose by a presidential 
victory by massachusetts gov michael dukakis to turn to the 
democrats besides he adds hes done a good job in his two terms 
in the senate 
the three democrats vying in tuesdays primary for the chance to 
run against wallop however point to findings indicating their 
party is the strongest its been in the west since 1964 and they 
say wallop has ignored wyoming concerns and is out of step even 
with his own party for instance his vote against ratification of 
the intermediate nuclear forces treaty 
in a report last week andrew kohut head of the gallup 
organization said polls conducted for the times mirror co show 
that the traditionally conservative outlook of westerners appears 
to have changed 
traditionally antigovernment voters in the rocky mountains 
are now calling for more government action on social issues than is 
the average american voter 
and he said western voters are dissatisfied with the general 
course of the nation and have not found in vice president george 
bush the antiestablishment leader they once saw in ronald reagan 
this is good news for the three democratic hopefuls 
reagan is personally popular in parts of wyoming but his 
policies and the results of those policies are not and people are 
ready for a change said state sen john vinich a 14year 
veteran of the legislature who announced for wallops seat last 
fall people are looking to the democratic party for that change 
and of course wyoming presently has a full congressional 
delegation of the minority party back there 
the states other senator alan simpson has been mentioned as a 
possible running mate for george bush wyomings lone congressman 
is dick cheney 
in the primary vinich faces lynn simons in her third term as 
state schools superintendent and pete maxfield a university of 
wyoming professor trying to repeat the success of democrat gale 
mcgee another professor who served 18 years in the senate 
maxfield who like mcgee 30 years ago is making his first 
venture into politics also believes the reagan administration has 
lost its teflon coating 
i have family members who voted for reagan but would not vote 
for bush because of their concerns about the deficit and the 
increase in the national debt said maxfield a tax law expert 
simons however is not as certain that the presidential race 
will have a strong impact on the senate contest 
i think that it would be an advantage to have a strong 
democratic ticket from the top down in wyoming she said i 
also believe that wyoming voters are very independent voters and 
there may or may not be a coattails effect 
wallop through it all is sticking to his conservative guns 
if dukakis is going to win the west in november hell have to 
change his views said the senator who faces only minimal 
opposition for his partys senate nomination 
dukakis stands for nothing but increased federal control 
decreased multiple use of wildlands and an increase in the 
withdrawal of states rights to control their resources wallop 
said these are all critical wyoming issues 
taking issue with the democrats claims that he ignored state 
concerns while focusing on national and international affairs he 
said my experience is of no use if my performance with that 
experience hasnt been good i say it has been good for jobs 
agriculture education the recreation industry and taxpayers it 
has been good for the state

iraq today accused iran of shelling iraqi 
military positions near the shatt alarab waterway where the 
persian gulf war broke out nearly eight years ago 
the attacks if confirmed would be the first serious fighting 
reported since both nations agreed monday at the united nations to 
begin a ceasefire aug 20 and to open direct talks in geneva five 
days later 
the accusation came in a brief statement from the iraqi mission 
to the united nations it said the attacks occurred wednesday and 
today 
the statement said the iranian armed forces bombarded iraqi 
military positions around basra and the faw peninsula with 
howitzers mortars and small missiles the brief report to the 
united nations did not denounce iran 
the statement also did not say whether iraq suffered casualties 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who had no 
immediate comment on the statement scheduled a meeting with iraqi 
ambassador ismat kittani at the ambassadors request presumably to 
discuss the situation 
when perez de cuellar announced the ceasefire date iran gave 
him a letter pledging it would not launch any attacks prior aug 20 
iraq did not submit a similar letter but the un chief said 
tuesday he had received oral assurances from both nations they 
would exercise restraint 
the main attack on basra involved 214 howitzer shells 205 
mortar rounds and 32 small missiles the iraqi statement said the 
faw bombardment involved 26 howitzer shells 32 mortar rounds and 
16 small missiles it added 
both targets are near shatt alarab the disputed waterway that 
forms the southern border between iran and iraq it is the only sea 
outlet iraq has and it has been blocked by iran since early in the 
war iraq invaded iran in 1980 after border skirmishes in a bid to 
gain complete control of the waterway 
todays iraqi statement also said without elaborating that an 
iranian tank fired two missiles at iraqi positions in the 
northern sector of the border 
on wednesday irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar 
mahallati complained to parez de cuellar that iraqi warplanes had 
buzzed iranian cities and warned that more such flights could 
jeopardize the proposed truce 
in tehran on wednesday irans acting commanderinchief 
hashemi rafsanjani said a un inquiry must condemn iraq as the 
aggressor in the war or the region will face grave consequences 
after meeting with the un chief mahallati told reporters that 
iraqi overflights can be a dangerous opening if it the 
overflights would be continued i am afraid that it is an obstacle 
in the way of the secretarygeneral carrying out his task 
perez de cuellar said of the alleged overflights 
i am persuaded that if something happened it was kind of a 
mistake a technical mistake a misunderstanding

retail sales climbed 05 percent in july the 
third consecutive monthly increase but economists say rising 
interest rates threaten to dampen even this modest growth rate in 
the months ahead 
the commerce department said thursday that sales increased 632 
million last month to a seasonally adjusted 1340 billion the 
rise followed increases of 04 percent in june and 08 percent in 
may 
retail sales were on the soft side in july said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co where there were 
increases they were just moderate however coming after so strong 
a second quarter some pause in growth should not be suprising 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
called the report good news and said the statistics indicate 
a steadily growing economy 
sinai and other economists said sales should continue to 
increase through the third quarter because of strong job growth 
but they warned that consumer spending will soften eventually as 
interest rates creep higher 
several of the nations largest banks raised their prime lending 
rate a half percentage point to 10 percent on thursday just two 
days after the federal reserve boosted its key lending rate 
it was the third increase this year in the prime rate on which 
many consumer loan rates are based and pushed it to its highest 
level in three years 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch said the 
growing popularity of adjustable rate home mortgages and home 
equity loans most of them fluctuating with the prime rate means 
more households are pinched by rising rates than in the past 
a large group of people are about to experience a squeeze on 
their cash flow and as we move into the last part of the year that 
should effect consumer spending steinberg said 
sales last month were led by a 19 percent jump at automotive 
dealers to 301 billion the biggest climb since february when 
auto sales shot up 20 percent automotive sales had climbed a 
modest 04 percent in june 
excluding autos sales were up a scant 01 percent in july 
the strongest category other than autos was clothing stores 
where sales jumped 16 percent after a 06 percent rise in june 
however david levy of levy economic forecasts in chappaqua 
ny noted that the government does not adjust retail sales 
figures for inflation he said strength in autos and clothing at 
least partly reflected higher prices 
the number of autos sold as reported separately by the commerce 
department was the same last month as in june levy said auto 
dealers who generally have had strong sales this year are not 
discounting as heavily as in past years thus after seasonal 
adjustments sales figures rose 
levy said apparel sales also look stronger than they normally 
would because of price increases earlier this year however he 
attributed some of the strength to consumers postponing purchases 
of summer clothing from may when the weather was unseasonably 
cool to june and july 
sales at department and other general merchandise stores helped 
by hot weatherrelated buying were up a slight 02 percent to 
152 billion in july after a strong 14 percent increase a month 
earlier 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years were up 07 percent solely on the strength of 
autos hardware and building supply stores reported a 18 percent 
drop in sales last month while sales at furniture stores were off 
10 percent 
sales of nondurable goods led by specialty clothing stores 
were up 04 percent 
there were gains of 06 percent at food and grocery stores 
caused mostly by price increases rather than an increase in sales 
volume and 02 percent at restaurants and bars 
drug stores reported a 10 percent drop in july sales while 
gasoline stations reported a 02 percent decline 
overall sales for the first seven months of the year were 65 
percent greater than the same period in 1987 about two percentage 
points above the rate of inflation

two congressmen unveiled legislation thursday 
that would establish an independent public advisory panel to 
investigate alleged unethical practices by house members 
reps joseph dioguardi rny and barney frank dmass also 
proposed creating the office of an independent inspector general to 
audit financial matters of the house and its members 
what were trying to deal with here is the perception that 
congressmen are not fulfilling their public trust dioguardi said 
at a news conference 
this is not an issue of individuals this is not an issue of 
parties or politics he added this is basically an issue of 
process 
both congressmen stressed the conflicts inherent in the current 
system under which house members police themselves through the 
committee on standards of official conduct that committee 
composed of an equal number of republicans and democrats enforces 
the code of conduct and recommends to the full house sanctions 
against members who violate it 
is it fair to expect congressmen and congresswomen to change 
their role from one of collegiality to judge and jury dioguardi 
said 
the two congressmen introduced a resolution thursday to create a 
panel of six people three chosen by the house speaker and three by 
the minority leader to investigate alleged wrongdoings 
no member could be a current or past congressman a relative of 
a congressman officer or employee of any government or a lobbyist 
or registered foreign agent 
the board would have full investigative powers including the 
ability to issue subpoenas it would report its findings to the 
ethics committee which would be required to pass them on to the 
full house unchanged 
the ethics committee would have to continue to exist because 
under the constitution only congress can discipline itself 
the inspector general would randomly and periodically audit the 
houses financial operations including payroll and official 
expenses the congressmen said he or she would report any waste 
fraud or abuse to the public review board for action

about 7000 doctors walked off the job at 
israels staterun hospitals thursday to protest a stalemate in 
talks on pay and a government plan to deal with a backlog of 
patients who need operations 
the daylong strike prompted some health officials to demand 
reform of israels public health system which has been crippled in 
recent years by job actions by nurses and emergency medical workers 
as well as the physicians 
israels staterun medical system provides free service to all 
members of health plans all doctors in staterun hospitals 
participated in the strike israel has 9000 physicians 
finance minister moshe nissim condemned the striking doctors and 
said the government had reached the limit on what it could give 
i think there also must be a limit to how much doctors can 
torture their patients he said on israel radio 
rubi steinberg a spokesman for the doctors union said 
physicians were demanding pay increases of up to 30 percent and an 
improvement in a proposed government program to give hospitals 
enough funds to operate on 15000 patients in the next nine months 
the doctors want the program to last longer and encompass about 
45000 patients they estimate are awaiting major operations as well 
as an estimated 60000 people on the waiting list for minor surgery 
and treatment 
currently steinberg said a doctor with a 10year tenure earns 
1000 to 1100 a month not counting night and emergency standby 
duties and a beginners basic salary may be as low as 500 a month 
were protesting against the stalemate in negotiations every 
proposal we raise is rejected he said 
some health officials said israels medical system urgently 
needs to be reformed they cited frequent strikes by hospital 
maintenance staff nurses emergency medical service workers and 
the doctors 
in 1983 doctors walked off their jobs for most of four months 
staged a hunger strike to protest working conditions and 
established temporary private clinics 
the system has not functioned for years and continues to 
deteriorate steinberg said doctors have not gotten proper 
salaries many have decided to change their profession or 
emigrate 
prof charles greenblatt of the hebrew universitys medical 
school blamed poor morale the lack of a financial basis and 
continuous confrontations that are not settled by negotiations 
theres something wrong with the whole system he said it 
is not patientoriented 
greenblatt suggested reforming the system by establishing 
smaller regional hospitals and ending free medical care

snare a fishing contests 105000 prize by placing lead weights in 
a bass instead tipped the scales of justice against him 
david scott lynd 25 received two years probation wednesday in 
an attempted felony theft charge that was filed when lead weights 
were discovered in his prize catch during the kykx big bass classic 
fishing tournament at lake o the pines in may 
state district judge bill porter said the sentence was the 
lightest that could be assessed for the heavy fish texas law 
provides a maximum of two to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 
5000 for attempted felony theft 
lynd denied placing the weights in his bass and also denied 
buying them at a garland store although game wardens found an 
itemized cash register receipt detailing the purchase in lynds 
fishing boat after he was arrested 
lynds attorney jerry biesel told jurors lynd would not have 
placed the weights in the fish because he knew tournament judges 
would cut it open for inspection 
he is no rocket scientist biesel told jurors but he 
isnt crazy 
lynd of garland showed no emotion after the verdict and 
sentence were handed down he later referred all questions to 
biesel 
biesel also declined comment but marion county attorney marion 
hileman said after the twoday trial he was disappointed with the 
sentence 
mike gatons kykx vice president and general manager said he 
was very satisfied with the jury verdict and that it showed the 
radio station which hosts the bass tournament at lake o the pines 
each spring is committed to holding a good and clean 
tournament 
lynds fish weighed 764 pounds leading the 6000plus field of 
contestants before being disallowed by tournament officials a 
743pounder then took the prize

sixty percent of american voters still consider 
the soviet union a serious threat but an even larger majority 
trust the soviets enough to sign a treaty eliminating most nuclear 
weapons within 12 years according to a poll released thursday 
a series of developments including the reagangorbachev summits 
and the troop withdrawal from afghanistan are chipping away at 
americans mistrust of the soviet union pollster daniel 
yankelovich said at a news conference 
the poll was one of several commissioned for americans talk 
security a series of surveys on national defense and security 
issues funded by boston businessman alan f kay 
in telephone interviews with 1000 registered voters 
yankelovichs firm found a majority trusted the soviets enough to 
believe that the united states and the soviet union could 
sign a treaty to eliminate most nuclear weapons by the year 
2000 71 percent 
work together to stop illicit drug trafficking 85 percent 
halt environmental pollution 85 percent fight terrorism 78 
percent resolve conflicts in the mideast and other trouble spots 
72 percent 
expand cultural exchanges 84 percent 
the survey taken in july shortly after the moscow summit noted 
a 7 percent increase in american voters belief that relations with 
the soviets are improving yankelovich said that conviction jumped 
from 61 percent in march to 68 percent four months later 
but yankelovich also noted a persistent strain of mistrust 
toward the soviets with 60 percent describing the soviet union as 
a major threat to the united states down from 76 percent before 
gorbachev took office 
only 36 percent thought the united states should sell 
nonmilitary high technology to the soviets 34 percent would stop 
work on reagans strategic defense initiative as part of a nuclear 
arms agreement 28 percent favored sharing sdi technology with the 
soviets as it is developed 
it may take 10 years or more for this mistrust to dissipate 
it wont go overnight he said 
women without a college education were far more mistrustful of 
the soviets and gorbachev than similarly educated men or 
collegeeducated men and women a finding which democratic pollster 
john martilla said flies somewhat in the face of conventional 
wisdom 
although 37 percent of all voters said they trusted the soviet 
union not at all 43 percent of women took that stand compared 
to only 30 percent of men 
when asked what the soviets could do to increase trust only two 
actions were cited by a majority of voters reducing the power of 
the secret police 60 percent and ceasing attempts to win over 
us allies 53 percent 
the poll has a margin of error of 3 percent

the skipper of the uss dubuque will be 
relieved from command this weekend pending an investigation of 
charges the warship failed to adequately assist a boatload of 
vietnamese refugees who later reportedly resorted to cannibalism to 
survive officials said thursday 
capt alexander g balian 48 has been assigned temporarily 
to the philippinesbased commander naval surface group western 
pacific pending the results of a navy inquiry into the sufficiency 
of the assistance provided by the ship to a vietnamese refugee boat 
on june 9 said dan howard the chief pentagon spokesman 
vice adm george davis commander of the naval surface force 
us pacific fleet ordered the transfer he said 
the navy said balian would be relieved saturday by capt david 
wetherell who left san diego calif on wednesday to fly to the 
persian gulf the dubuque an amphibious landing ship encountered 
the vietnamese refugees in the south china sea while en route to 
the gulf 
howard and navy officials stressed that the captains 
reassignment was considered administrative and not punitive at this 
point 
i think it would certainly be premature to judge this a 
penalty howard said the captain has been temporarily 
reassigned while the investigation is being conducted and the navy 
always has that prerogative 
the navy and the united nations high commission on refugees are 
investigating reports of murder and cannibalism that surfaced 
earlier this week in a philippine newspaper the vietnamese boat 
people eventually were rescued off the philippines and are in a 
refugee camp there 
the newspaper quoted survivors as saying they killed and ate 
some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they 
encountered the dubuque on june 9 two of the victims reportedly 
died of starvation but three others allegedly were murdered 
through drowning and then eaten 
some survivors charged the dubuque refused to take them aboard 
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure 
and starvation instead the ship gave them food and water and left 
them because it was on a dangerous mission the survivors 
claimed 
according to robert cooper the manila representative of the 
un refugee commission 52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 
58 people died during the crossing the refugees began their 
journey on may 22 from the mekong delta town of ben tre aboard a 
35foot wooden boat its engine failed two or three days later 
navy regulations specify that warships may pick up refugees on 
the high seas if the vessel theyre traveling in is judged 
unseaworthy bad weather is approaching or there are other 
special circumstances 
in other words its a judgment call by the captain of the 
vessel howard said 
the navy said earlier this week that when the dubuque chanced 
upon the refugees their boat was judged to be in seaworthy 
condition and was under sail 
the uss dubuque gave the refugees food water and navigational 
charts before resuming transit to the indian ocean the navy said 
balian a native of los angeles won a silver star for heroism 
during the vietnam war while a young lieutenant his navy patrol 
boat was sunk in 1966 in a viet cong night ambush on a river near 
vung tau southeast of saigon one crewman was killed and balian 
and other crewmen were wounded but managed to escape to safety 
aboard a makeshift raft

angolas ambassador to the united nations on 
thursday rejected the idea of national reconcilation talks with 
antimarxist rebels but said the guerrillas will be given jobs and 
houses if they lay down their arms 
ambassador manuel pacavira told reporters that his government 
did not consider the usbacked rebels in the south of angola a 
legitimate force 
in angola there is no opposition there is no civil war 
pacavira said what exists in angola is a military confrontation 
with south africa and its paramilitary forces unita 
the rebels headed by jonas savimbi calls themselves unita for 
the national union for the total independence of angola 
earlier this week chester crocker the assistant secretary of 
state for african affairs said an unresolved civil war in angola 
could hamper and postpone efforts to reach a troop withdrawal 
agreement 
crocker mediated an agreement between angola south africa and 
cuba under which pretoria began withdrawing its troops from angola 
on wednesday the parties will next try to reach agreement on the 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban soldiers from angola 
negotiators however have not tried to resolve angolas civil 
war the united states has supported the concept of national 
reconcilation talks between the luanda government and unita which 
controls large areas of land 
but pacavira said his government has proposed a program of 
national harmonization if unita fighters surrender individual 
guerrillas would be integrated into society he said 
the offer does not extend to savimbi who has good relations 
with the reagan administration i cannot comment on what will 
happen to him pacavira said 
he called savimbi a terrorist and an opportunist who today 
is with god and tomorrow is with the devil 
the ambassador also said the united states should stop its 
support for savimbi though such as act would not necessarily mean 
the angolan government would stop accepting military aid from the 
soviet union 
us assistance to unita cannot be conditioned in any form to 
the soviet assistance to angola he said 
on a related issue pacavira denied that the soviet union has 
pressured angola into signing a ceasefire

a former nazi ss concentration 
camp guard sentenced to death in czechoslovakia wants to return to 
italy which expelled him this week a prosecutor said thursday 
prosecutor klaus schacht also said anton maloth was hospitalized 
near munich delaying interrogation for at least three weeks 
because of a serious illness that schacht refused to specify 
czechoslovakia sentenced maloth 76 to death in absentia in 
1948 for war crimes at the theresienstadt concentration camp and 
it asked italy on tuesday to extradite him 
italian officials put maloth on an airplane from verona to 
munich on wednesday after his arrest last week at his wifes home 
in the northern italian town of merano 
italy and czechoslovakia have no extradition treaty and italian 
law bars extraditing someone facing the death penalty italy does 
not have capital punishment 
foreign ministry spokesman peter rothen said officials 
determined maloth is a west german citizen and cannot be extradited 
under its constitution 
schacht who is leading the inquiry into maloths past said he 
has no plans to bring criminal charges against the former 
concentration camp guard west german officials say maloth is free 
to move about as he pleases 
at a news conference thursday in dortmund schacht said he 
wants to stay temporarily in munich and apply for a west german 
passport then he wants to return to merano legally 
asked whether maloth could face interrogation after that the 
prosecutor said the attending physician has already expressed 
his doubts at this point he is not able to take care of himself 
the director of the national memorial in the town where the nazi 
camp was located told the czechoslovak communist party daily 
newspaper rude pravo that 2400 documents provide evidence of 
maloths crimes

quoted vaclav novak as saying the crimes included grievous bodily 
harms killings and murders 
maloth voluntarily and with pleasure asked to be a member of 
execution squads novak told rude pravo

maloths crimes are still alive 
maloth was arrested at his wifes home in merano in northern 
italy last week viennabased nazi hunter simon wiesenthal said 
maloth had been hiding with his family in italy for 15 years

the senate voted 904 passage thursday of its 
second pentagon budget bill which includes an electionyear 
message to japan and western europe to pay more for allied defense 
and sets new restrictions on defense consultants 
president reagan last week vetoed the democraticcontrolled 
congress first defense bill because he objected to its cuts in his 
proposed star wars budget and restrictions on nuclear arms control 
policy 
the 282 billion defense budget bill was the last major item 
keeping the senate from starting a nearly fourweek recess 
when congress returns after labor day house and senate 
negotiators will meet to iron out differences between the defense 
bills passed separately by each chamber the house version approved 
two months ago contains neither of the major provisions voted 
thursday 
one difference will be the allied burdensharing measure 
endorsed thursday on a voice vote by the senate as part of the 
defense spending bill no similar measure was part of the companion 
bill approved by the house two months ago 
the senate provision orders a major review of us overseas 
commitments a limit on american troop deployments to japan and 
south korea and a ceiling on spending for us military personnel 
stationed overseas the last provision requires the allies to pay 
the difference if deployment costs of us troops rise above 1988 
levels 
the senate rejected 5936 another provision calling for a 10 
percent cut in the total of american dependents living overseas 
with servicemen 
sen phil gramm rtexas opposed the dependents ceiling 
because i cant think of anything more damaging to the morale of 
our troops than to limit dependents 
but sen bennett johnston dla said enough is enough we 
have 413000 dependents worldwide that is far more than any other 
nation in history 
legislators of both parties have been increasingly vocal in 
recent months in their calls for more help from americas allies 
particularly japan and the european members of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization 
we need help and we need to let our allies know that said 
johnston 
later the senate gave voice vote approval to an amendment by 
sen david pryor dark providing strict new reporting 
requirements for private consultants to the pentagon and defense 
contractors 
pryors plan was prompted by the pentagon bribery investigation 
which involves allegations that consultants were involving in 
obtaining inside information from defense department employees 
about details of planned contracts no charges have yet been filed 
the amendment requires consultants to register much as 
lobbyists for foreign nations must now do and detail all their 
clients and contracts 
noting the current investigation pryor asked how bad do we 
want this system to get before we finally pay some attention to it 
we need some mechanism to find out who is working as a 
consultant and how many sides of the street theyre working 
sen ted stevens ralaska suggested that hearings should be 
held by congressional committees before the requirement is 
approved but he agreed that certainly theres an overwhelming 
revulsion in the country against the bribery scandal in the navy 
the measure considered by the senate was an appropriation bill 
which contains money to pay for programs spelled out by separate 
authorization legislation in the twostep congressional budget 
process 
the bill reagan rejected was the authorization measure which 
proposed 2995 billion for the pentagon for the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 
the appropriation bill considered by the senate generally 
reflects the spending figures in the earlier bill although those 
totals may be changed by the housesenate conference committee as 
a negotiating tactic the senate added an amendment to the 
appropriation bill containing the entire text of the senate version 
of the authorization legislation 
for example reagan sought 48 billion for the strategic 
defense initiative as star wars is formally known the program 
receives 39 billion this year 
the bill the president vetoed provided 40 billion for star 
wars which he said was too little the measure considered thursday 
was based on that 40 billion figure but the senate version of 
the authorization bill provided 46 billion 
in addition the appropriations bill contains none of the arms 
control restrictions reagan opposes those had been added to the 
earlier legislation by the house and the conference committee is 
likely to consider the issue again 
voting against the bill were sens kent conrad dnd mark 
hatfield rore claiborne pell dri and william proxmire 
dwis not voting were sens joseph biden ddel thad cochran

president rodrigo borja reestablished 
diplomatic ties with nicaragua in his first full day in office 
thursday but also said he wanted to have good relations with the 
united states 
each country has a right to follow its own political path and 
its own road to economic development said borja in a welcoming 
statement for president daniel ortega of nicaragua who arrived in 
quito on thursday 
borja a moderate leftist took office wednesday night he 
replaced conservative leon febres cordero the reagans 
administration closest ally in south america 
borja won election to a fouryear term may 8 defeating populist 
abdala bucaram febres cordero who was ineligible for reelection 
broke ties with nicaragua in october 1985 
ortega was greeted at the airport by borja who said the 
sandinista leaders presence confirmed the political and 
ideological pluralism that we practice 
ortega condemned what he called the attitudes of imperialists 
that try to subject the people of latin america and the caribbean 
because of the rupture in diplomatic ties ortega was not able 
to attend borjas inauguration president fidel castro of cuba in 
his first trip to south america in 17 years was among seven latin 
american and european presidents at the ceremony 
borja said at a news conference that the reestablishment of 
relations with nicaragua should not be interpreted as a hostile 
move toward the united states 
the united states has supported nicaraguan rebels in their 
7yearold war to topple its leftist sandinista government on 
wednesday the us senate approved another 27 million in 
humanitarian aid for the rebels known as contras 
borja said he told secretary of state george shultz on wednesday 
that within a framework of mutual respect for nonintervention in 
the internal affairs of our countries our relations will be 
cordial and friendly with the united states 
borja noted that the united states is the market for 60 percent 
of ecuadors exports and thus relations with it are important 
i think there can be good cooperation between our government 
and the american government he said 
in an apparent reference to borjas plans to impose controls on 
ecuadors freemarket economy shultz had said directing an economy 
by central planning as advocated by the left simply doesnt 
work 
borja a 53yearold law professor said in his inaugural speech 
that febres corderos freemarket policies had favored the rich 
over the poor fueled inflation and impoverished the population 
you dont have to be an economist to know that it is enough 
to to the market walk along country roads or visit shantytowns to 
feel the drama of poor people he said 
borja also said he was ready to cooperate fully with the us 
government in the fight against international drug trafficking 
but those efforts will not be sufficient in the consumer 
countries do not control the purchase and consumption of drugs 
he said 
in the last two years ecuador has become an increasingly 
important transit point for cocaine being smuggled from colombia to 
the united states and europe

troubleshooter who specializes in putting ships back in shape 
navy officials said thursday in washington that balian 48 was 
being relieved temporarily as commander of the amphibious landing 
ship uss dubuque pending investigation of claims by some of 52 
vietnamese refugees that his ship refused to rescue them june 9 in 
the south china sea 
the refugees were quoted as saying they later were forced to 
kill and eat some of their companions to survive they said the 
boats engine failed two or three days off vietnam and 58 people

home prices and sales during the apriljune 
period portray a booming economy on the west coast some cooling in 
the once redhot northeast resurgence in the midwest and a hint of 
a turnaround in the southwest 
the national association of realtors said thursday that three 
california metropolitan areas anaheimsanta ana los angeles and 
san francisco posted the highest home appreciation rates in the 
country 
a 201 percent rise in prices from the second quarter of 1987 to 
the same period this year made the anaheimsanta ana area the 
costliest housing market in the nation median home prices there 
were 204000 
los angeles where prices rose 191 percent to a median of 
175600 had the second highest appreciation rate followed by san 
francisco with an increase of 155 percent to 196300 
people just keep moving to california consequently prices 
keep going up said mark obrinsky an economist with the us 
league of savings institutions also its a diversified and 
growing economy and there are a lot of middle and upperincome 
jobs 
nationally prices rose 34 percent to a median of 88900 
meaning half of the houses sold for more and half for less 
housing is mirroring the economy virtually all over the 
country said john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist 
where the economy is very very good we find that housing is 
very very good likewise where housing is weak so is the 
economy 
home prices in new york and the larger cities in new england 
remain among the nations highest but they have not been going up 
as fast as in previous years 
the yeartoyear appreciation rate in new york was 49 percent 
to a median price of 191900 in boston 38 percent to 182900 
in hartford 76 percent to 169000 and in providence 89 percent 
to 130400 
appreciation rates were also higher than the national median in 
northern manufacturing cities where prices are among the lowest in 
the united states buffalo ny had the fifth best appreciation 
rate in the country at 144 percent chicago columbus ohio 
detroit and grand rapids mich all reported appreciation rates of 
92 percent 
tuccillo attributed the resurgence in the midwest to the 
comeback in the manufacturing sector which is benefiting from 
strong export sales spurred by the devalued dollar 
the steepest declines in home prices from a year ago were in 
areas dependent on the oil industry the median resale price fell 
127 percent to 56900 in oklahoma city 102 percent to 65200 
in san antonio texas and 6 percent to 64000 in baton rouge la 
the bad news is the oil price drop of a couple years ago is 
still having ramifications in real estate but its not new bad 
news obrinsky said noting what may be early signs of 
improvement 
when compared with the first quarter of this year home prices 
rose 55 percent in houston and a little bit better than even up 
07 percent in oklahoma city 
also the pace of sales in texas improved 8 percent between the 
first and second quarters nearly as good as the national average 
im glad to see that but its not enough yet to say theyve 
made the turn obrinsky said 
nationally the realtors group said the resale pace of 
condominiums and singlefamily homes spurred by 
lowerthanexpected mortgage interest rates picked up in the 
second quarter 
thirtytwo states reported an increase in seasonally adjusted 
sales rates from the first quarter fifteen states and the district 
of columbia reported slackening sales while the pace was unchanged 
in three states 
nationally existing homes sold at an annual rate of 399 
million units in the second quarter 93 percent higher than the 
first quarter but 05 percent lower than the same period a year 
earlier 
i think essentially what we have here is a case of 
interest rates being more moderate than expected along with demand 
being a little bit stronger tuccillo said

a roman catholic parish has applied to 
sell tickets for wisconsins new lottery and the church secretary 
says more churches may take up the idea 
state officials said sts cyril and methodius catholic church 
appears to be the first religious institution in wisconsin to apply 
to sell tickets 
but even if the application is granted the church has been 
ordered to wait until after milwaukee archbishop rembert weakland 
reviews the matter the rev richard fleischman pastor of the 
church said thursday 
fleischman said he did not expect the application to be approved 
because the parish would only sell the tickets at its bingo games 
about once a week 
but i thought what the heck its worth a try its not 
like wed be selling them daily at the rectory the priest said 
janet maurin the churchs secretary predicts other churches 
that operate bingo games also will apply to sell lottery tickets to 
help pay for financially strapped parochial schools 
the lottery receives up to 100 applications a day so more 
churches may be applying said lottery spokesman rick berg he said 
churches would be treated the same as the 3500 commercial 
retailers who also have applied to sell tickets the approval 
process includes background checks of all people listed on the 
application 
many clergy in wisconsin argued gambling was sinful and opposed 
the lottery when the proposal was made the games are scheduled to 
begin in september almost 18 months after voters approved them 
with the catholic church depending on bingo they dont feel 
that way around here maurin said 
fleischman said he wished the church could avoid fundraisers 
that involved gambling but he said they were necessary to meet the 
monthly expenses of the parish and school 
the fact is some people contribute more when theyre having a

a house panel on thursday considered federal 
regulations on deadly looking toy guns that police sometimes 
mistake for the real thing 
an outright ban on the toys among the topics of a house 
hearing is opposed by toy manufacturers whose products often are 
exact replicas of machine guns and assault rifles 
the 300 millionayear industry supports a measure requiring 
them to identify their harmless products with bright orange 
markings 
but ban supporters say that bits of tape or paint arent enough 
to assure police officers that they arent staring down the barrel 
of a real threat 
the hearing by the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
consumer protection was chaired by rep james florio dnj who 
showed what appeared to be an israelimade uzi machine gun is it 
real or is it a toy florio asked the audience 
it was a water pistol but florio also showed an actual uzi and 
the two were all but identical 
florio and police experts showed several examples of actual 
firearms and obvious toy knockoffs including replicas of a mac10 
machine pistol and a 45caliber pistol 
the hearing came four days after an incident in woodbridge 
nj in which a police officer was wounded trying to apprehend a 
man armed with a reallooking toy pistol 
patrolman william mcsweeney was wounded in the leg by another 
policemans gun that discharged in a struggle with a suspect the 
suspects weapon turned out to be a replica of a 45 automatic 
two bills are pending in congress to regulate such 
lookalike guns 
one sponsored by sen bob dole rkan would require tne 
orange markings the other offered by rep mel levine dcalif 
calls for an outright ban on any toy gun resembling a real weapon 
levine said his legislation is meant to make childs play 
safer than it is it is not meant to ban all toy guns just those 
that are highly realistic 
nationally syndicated television consumer advocate david 
horowitz testified that new york city police last year confiscated 
more than 1400 toy guns used in crimes 
horowitz himself was held hostage during a live tv broadcast 
last year by a man holding what later turned out to be a fake gun 
i could see the gun and so could my colleagues on the set 
and there was no doubt in any of our minds that it was the real 
thing he said 
horowitz said toy manufacturers refuse to stop selling 
lookalike guns because they sell better than unrealistic plastic 
weapons 
toy manufacturers supported doles bill calling for the orange 
markings but said the levine measure was too harsh 
they said a ban on toy guns would cost jobs in the toy industry 
although guns represent less than 1 percent of the overall dollar 
value of toy sales

the owners of a castle built for the 
finance minister of king francis ii are selling slate tiles from 
its historic but leaky roof to raise money for badly needed 
renovations 
vicountess annabelle de la panouse a native of waysata minn 
ordered workers to remove 67000 gray slate tiles onebyone and 
save those in the best condition they were installed on the 
chateau of thoiry now a tourist attraction 125 years ago during 
the reign of napoleon iii 
the vicountess said renovation of the 60room chateau was being 
delayed by lack of funds for roof repair which will cost about 1 
million 
some rooms i started but had to stop because it was raining on 
the paint work she said 
as with many other french historical sites maintained by private 
families without government funds the chateaus owners seek ways 
to exploit its picturesque country setting and long history to 
increase revenue 
it has an african animal preserve with more than 1200 animals 
and another generator of revenue is an outdoor concert series on 
the grounds 
roof tiles will be sold in the chateau gift shop with 
certificates of authenticity in addition to helping restore the 
chateau those buying the tiles will have something with practical 
use madame de la panouse said 
you can buy some colored chalk and make your shopping list on 
the slate which comes in all different sizes and shapes she 
said it is certainly more elegant than using a scrap of paper or 
the back of an envelope 
archives and collections exhibited on the ground floor include 
reports of the national treasury letters from louis xiv and the 
pitcher and wash basin in sevres porcelain used by marieantoinette 
while awaiting the guillotine in conciergerie prison 
also on display are one of two waltz scores by frederick chopin 
given to clemence de la panouse a 19th century arts patron 
the chateau was built in 1564 for raoul moreau who served as 
finance minister for francis ii and his successors charles ix and 
henry iii it passed among family members through 14 generations 
and 400 years to madame de la panouses husband paul

the senate today approved 904 a pentagon 
budget bill that includes restrictions on spending for american 
troops overseas as a message to us allies to do more for allied 
defense and new restrictions on pentagon consultants 
it was the second attempt by the senate to approve a defense 
bill president reagan will accept reagan vetoed the first measure 
last week because of cuts in his star wars budget along with arms 
control restrictions he opposed 
the new version retains the same star wars reductions but none 
of the arms control limitations it will now go to a housesenate 
conference committee to resolve differences between the two 
chambers versions 
the vote was the last major item on the senate agenda before a 
summer recess for next weeks republican presidential convention 
voting against the bill were sens kent conrad dnd mark 
hatfield rore claiborne pell dri and william proxmire 
dwis not voting were sens joseph biden ddel thad cochran 
rmiss bob kasten rwis larry pressler rsd lowell 
weicker rconn and james exon dneb 
earlier today the senate gave voice vote approval to a 
burdensharing proposal backed by sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the armed services committee 
the plan orders a major review by the pentagon of us overseas 
commitments a new cap on us troop deployments to japan and south 
korea and a new ceiling on spending for us military personnel 
stationed overseas us allies would have to pay for the american 
troops if the costs rise above the 1988 levels 
but before adopting the amendment the senate voted 5936 to 
eliminate a provision for a 10 percent reduction in the total of 
american dependents stationed overseas with servicemen 
i cant think of anything more damaging to the morale of our 
troops than to limit dependents said sen phil gramm rtexas 
an opponent of the limit 
but sen bennett johnston dla said enough is enough we 
have 413000 dependents worldwide that is far more than any other 
nation in history 
there has been an increasingly loud chorus of electionyear 
congressional calls for more defense help particularly from japan 
and european members of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization 
despite the shift in economic fortunes since world war ii 
the united states bears a disproportionate share of the cost of 
the common defense nunn said wednesday 
someplace sometime we have to draw the line said nunn 
i hope this will stimulate a more equitable burdensharing 
sen ted stevens ralaska agreed theres a limit to the 
pocketbooks of the taxpayers of the united states 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said there have 
been legitimate complaints in the united states that we are bearing 
a disproportionately large burden in nato today 
later the chamber gave voice vote endorsement to an amendment 
by sen david pryor dark which would require defense 
consultants to register and list all their clients 
pryors amendment arises in the wake of the ongoing pentagon 
bribery investigation which involves allegations that consultants 
paid defense department officials for inside information about 
future contracts no charges have yet been filed 
how bad do we want this system to get before we finally pay 
some attention to it pryor asked 
earlier wednesday the senate voted to add a pentagon spending 
plan praised by reagan to its latest defense budget effort 
in addition the chamber with all republicans voting no 
voted 4947 approval of a democraticbacked plan to provide 27 
million in humanitarian aid to nicaraguas contra rebels after oct 
1 the vote could mean a possible second vote in congress this fall 
on releasing 163 million in stockpiled weapons to the contras 
who oppose nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
last week reagan vetoed the bill which authorizes the pentagon 
budget for the fiscal year starting oct 1 he specifically 
objected to cuts in his proposed star wars budget and 
democraticbacked restrictions on arms control policies 
the authorization measure is the first step of the twotrack 
congressional budget process which also includes an appropriation 
bill to pay for the programs authorized in the earlier legislation 
the bill now under consideration is the pentagon appropriation 
bill as it worked on the measure late wednesday the senate voted 
902 approval of an amendment which in essence added the earlier 
senate version of the authorization bill 
when the senate is finished the entire matter will go to a 
housesenate conference committee to work out differences between 
the bill and the companion measure passed two months ago by the 
house 
the senate appropriation bill includes 4 billion for the 
strategic defense initiative as star wars is formally known but 
the senate version of the authorization bill provides 46 billion 
the latter figure is closer to reagans original request of 48 
billion for sdi which receives 39 billion in the current fiscal 
year 
in addition the senate version does not have any of the arms 
control restrictions reagan opposes 
the vote was part of a complicated legislative tactic to work 
out a defense spending compromise that reagan will approve nunn 
told his colleagues 
tonight we begin the process of putting humpty dumpty back 
together again nunn told his colleagues this may be mission 
impossible but im going to try 
reagan vetoed the defense bill despite the advice of defense 
secretary frank c carlucci and national security adviser colin 
powell who both said it should be signed they were involved in 
earlier negotiations with congressional leaders over the 
legislation 
we need to have the executive branch sort out whom the 
congress should work with on national security issues said nunn 
we have to know whos speaking for the administration can we 
deal with the secretary of defense can we deal with the national 
security adviser

a financial planner who managed investments for 
about 50 doctors has skipped town leaving a note of apology and 
25 million of his clients money unaccounted for 
henry gherman 51 handled pension funds personal investments 
and managed medical offices for south florida clients who received 
copies of a handwritten letter of apology in the mail wednesday 
by the time you receive this letter i will be gone the 
letters said i have run away 
gherman fled the miami area monday and sources close to the case 
believe he may have left the country 
fbi spokesman paul miller said gherman and his companies are 
under investigation for possible wire fraud bank fraud 
embezzlement and interstate transportation of stolen property 
i have taken this action because i am unable to face the 
humiliation disgrace and consequences that would follow once his 
company financial amp investment planning inc collapsed the notes 
said he addded that he would try to return the doctors money 
i have been unable to come up with any solution other than 
running he wrote i am truly sorry 
a dade circuit judge on wednesday granted a request by 12 of 
ghermans clients to appoint a receiver to oversee the finances of 
gherman his family and his companies 
all we know is that henry gherman is not here and a large 
amount of money is not here said jay solowsky attorney for the 
doctors 
the doctors also filed a 25 million lawsuit accusing gherman of 
fraudulently shifting clients money to his wife and two children 
solowsky said gherman accepted money from clients to invest in 
certificates of deposit but that banks had no record of cds being 
purchased gherman also accepted money to buy medical malpractice 
insurance for his clients but failed to pay premiums solowsky said 
gherman is neither a lawyer nor an accountant and his companies 
are not registered with the state as an investment adviser 
solowsky said 
gherman the son of a waitress was hailed as a financial whiz 
kid when he sold 1 million worth of insurance in one year for the 
john hancock co and his investment savvy made him a millionaire 
before he was 30 but his financial troubles began in july 1969 
when gherman then 34 filed for personal bankruptcy listing 1

gov mario cuomos wife encouraged new 
yorks health commissioner to award a 113000 research contract to 
a california university that later paid 73000 of that to her 
brother state officials said thursday 
matilda cuomos brother joseph raffa of san diego exchanged 
the research money for a 48000ayear job with a california 
company that he later unsuccessfully recommended be hired by new 
york state to continue the cancer registry research work he had 
begun the newspaper newsday reported 
the contract with the university of california at san 
francisco was designed to study how new york might benefit from a 
computerized and regionalized cancer registry system being 
developed in california said frances tarlton a spokeswoman for 
new york state health commissioner dr david axelrod 
cancer registries are used by researchers to track where cancer 
cases are occurring 
cuomo in a statement issued by his office defended his wife as 
someone who has voluntarily contributed extraordinary amounts of 
her time and energy to improving health care and education in 
new york 
any suggestion that she would do anything for any reason other 
than to help the people of this state would be both inaccurate and 
terribly unfair cuomo said noting that his wife and her brother 
have been active volunteers in the fight against cancer for many 
years 
the 18month study that ended last summer was arranged for raffa 
by axelrod and former new york state thruway executive director 
alexander levine who a state investigation panel has recommended 
face criminal prosecution on an unrelated matter 
raffa contacted thursday morning at his california home by the 
associated press defended the research project and said he did it 
out of a desire to help people not to make money 
im trying to do a good thing for humanity and i get kicked in 
the behind for it raffa said she mrs cuomo never twisted 
anybodys arm first of all shes not dumb enough to do that and 
axelrod is too smart if he didnt believe in the project he 
wouldnt have done it 
axelrod through tarlton said he hadnt been pressured to enter 
into the contract levine refused to be interviewed for the newsday 
story 
the long island newspaper said raffa had no experience in public 
health statistics work but he did have computer expertise before 
taking on the cancer registry research work 
a specialist in cancer registries and head of new mexicos tumor 
registry program dr mary lerchen reviewed raffas work for 
newsday and said the information gathered by the author was 
neither comprehensive nor documented 
axelrod said however he was satisfied with the study and that 
new york learned a great deal about the cancer registry its 
potential its problems 
tarlton said some of raffas recommendations were implemented 
while others were not because of their high cost she said the 
university subcontracted for the research work with raffa and 
thats how he got the 73000 
levine a longtime aide to cuomo resigned his highway post 
last year after it was revealed that he had established a computer 
software business headed by his daughter and other levine 
associates that engineering companies seeking to do business with 
the thruway were encouraged to use the state investigation 
commission has recommended that levine be prosecuted for extortion 
a recommendation federal authorities are considering

us arms control officials said 
thursday that a ussoviet nuclear test experiment next week in 
nevada would be a major step toward finalizing longstalled 
treaties on limiting nuclear explosions 
soviet scientists will for the first time on aug 17 monitor a 
us underground nuclear blast at the nevada test site as part of 
efforts to assess techniques for verifying the treaties signed in 
the mid1970s 
on sept 14 us scientists will observe a nuclear explosion at 
the soviet testing ground near semipalatinsk 
we believe there have been likely violations by the soviet 
union of these treaties in the past the problem is inadequate 
verification said paul robinson chief us negotiator at the 
nuclear testing talks in geneva 
i believe that the confidence building of achieving effective 
verification is going to break the roadblock between us and be 
a very significant step in allowing us to move forward he told 
reporters in a us governmentsponsored satellite broadcast from 
washington to five european cities 
the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 peaceful nuclear 
explosions treaty prohibit nuclear blasts with a yield of more than 
150000 tons of tnt 
neither treaty has been ratified because of problems over 
verification 
during the verification tests the united states will use a 
system known by the acronym corrtex to measure the yields of the 
blasts corrtex which stands for continuous reflectrometry for 
radius versus time experiment determines the yield of a nuclear 
explosion by measuring the shock wave from the blast 
if the soviets will agree to the use of this type of 
measurement we feel confident that these two treaties will be 
effectively verifiable and we will be prepared to submit them to 
the senate for ratification said victor e alessi director of 
the energy departments office of arms control 
we are confident the test will demonstrate the effectiveness 
of corrtex and that there will be no further need for tests 
he said 
alessi said the cost of the project agreed to in december at 
the ussoviet summit in washington was 25 million 
the project he said involves for the first time sending 
large numbers of united states scientists to a distant and remote 
part of the soviet union 
robinson said 45 soviet scientists were at the nevada test site 
and the united states would have a similar number monitoring the 
soviet explosion

michael dukakis countering george bushs 
assertion that a dukakis presidency would weaken the country 
portrayed himself thursday as a toughminded leader who would 
strengthen conventional forces and weed out pentagon waste 
weve got to put our defense dollars where our defense needs 
are greatest dukakis said in a speech at new york university 
before heading to new jersey to tour the army base at fort dix 
weve got to use those dollars to buy weapons that work he 
said and weve got to to manage those dollars to strengthen our 
military forces not to line the pockets of dishonest contractors 
and wheelerdealer consultants 
the democratic nominee on a twoday campaign trip to five 
states spent eight weeks at fort dix in 1955 receiving basic 
training after joining the army from fort dix dukakis was 
traveling to connecticut for several receptions he campaigns in 
virginia and florida on friday 
during his tour of fort dix dukakis fired a rifle on the target 
range it was fun to be out there he told reporters later at 
the base gates 
dukakis also toured a c141 transport plane and a tank training 
area he told reporters he thought it was a mistake that the reagan 
administration is cutting by the number of army tanks it will buy 
in the next five years that deprives our soldiers of the 
equipment we need and drives up the cost of each tank by 30 
percent dukakis said 
asked by reporters for his reaction to the increase in the prime 
lending rate by major us banks dukakis replied i think its 
very regrettable i think its what happens after eight years of 
borrowing and spending borrowing and spending 
in the audience for the nyu speech was new york gov mario 
cuomo mayor ed koch local leaders of jesse jacksons presidential 
campaign and dukakis advisers on defense and foreign policy 
matters including former defense secretary harold brown 
the alwayscontroversial koch yawned throughout dukakis speech 
afterward koch said he supported dukakis but would appreciate some 
encouragement from the dukakis campaign 
i will go where they will ask me to go i wont go where they 
dont want me to go koch said 
cuomo who introduced dukakis said bushs only responsibility 
during the reagan years has been to head the administrations 
antidrug efforts 
and we are losing that war cuomo said this country and 
this world cannot afford secondrate leadership in these critical 
times 
dukakis sounded a similar theme in his speech although he did 
not refer by name to bush who has portrayed the democratic nominee 
as weak on foreign policy and defense issues 
this november we americans face a fundamental choice 
dukakis said we can seize the opportunity to restore americas 
leadership in the world or we can settle for second best 
referring to reagan administration antidrug efforts dukakis 
said he would be a president who believes that we dont need more 
rhetoric or photo opportunities in the war against drugs we need 
results 
dukakis aides had billed the speech as a major address on 
foreign policy and national security but the massachusetts 
governor unveiled no new positions on either front on thursday 
the aides said the speech was a framework of dukakis positions 
that he wanted to give before the republican national convention 
and that the governor would be more specific about his ideas in the 
next few weeks 
dukakis repeated his desire to continue reagans progress on 
nuclear arms reductions with the soviet union but lambasted the 
presidents star wars spacebased missile defense program as 
unnecessary and too expensive 
dukakis promised to beef up conventional forces with new tanks 
equipment and supplies and said the military should be considered 
for use in antidrug and antiterrorism efforts 
he also recalled the words of john f kennedy to emphasize his 
belief that united states international strength depends on a 
strong domestic economy 
he understood that building a fullemployment lowinflation 
economy that creates opportunity for every single citizen in this 
country was essential to our strength at home and abroad dukakis 
said 
above all weve got to have a real leader in the white house 
who will insist that when it comes to our national security were 
going to make decisions based not on whats good for one company or 
one military service or one political party but on whats good for 
the united states of america dukakis said

one of the national rifle associations 
staunchest congressional supporters bitterly criticized the group 
thursday after the organization attacked his support for a 
sevenday waiting period in handgun purchases 
rep f james sensenbrenner jr of wisconsin a conservative 
republican on the house judiciary committee said a critical nra 
letter sent to his constituents was downright erroneous false 
and plays on hysteria in an attempt to get me to change my vote 
sensenbrenner was strongly backed by rep dan lungren rcalif 
a judiciary committee member who has backed past nra positions and 
rep herbert h bateman rva who considers himself a strong 
supporter of the right to own guns 
lungren called the attack on sensenbrenner a pretty desperate 
letter against one of their supporters 
bateman whose constituents received an nra letter against the 
waiting period that did not attack him personally said i am 
shocked and disappointed at the excessive language and tactics used 
by the nra in the letter to my constituents 
this is not the first time in recent months that longtime 
supporters of the nra were sharply critical of the organization 
in may sen j james exon dneb criticized the nra for 
attacking him in his state when he and the progun group differed 
over a version of legislation to ban undetectable plastic guns 
i think their influence has deteriorated some exon said 
then 
the waiting period measure part of omnibus drug legislation 
that the house will vote on in september would require a sevenday 
wait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer 
the dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a sworn 
statement that includes a description of the gun the serial 
number the name address and birth date of the buyer police may 
but are not required to conduct a background check 
purchasers who would be prohibited from buying the handgun would 
be those already ineligible under existing federal law convicted 
felons fugitives from justice illegal aliens drug addicts those 
adjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution 
those dishonorably discharged from the military and people under 
indictment for a felony 
twentytwo states already have enacted a waiting period of 
varying duration 
the emergency letter to nra members in sensenbrenners 
district said the lawmaker along with sponsors of the legislation 
are attempting to scapegoat the drug problem on the backs of 
lawabiding american gun owners to use it as an excuse to impose 
total federal gun control on america 
wayne lapierre executive director of the nra institute for 
legislative action the groups lobbying arm also wrote 
i have in my hand a letter dated july 1988 from the 
sensenbrenner campaign committee for reelection proclaiming his 
fight for gun owners rights ha with support like that you 
might as well have ted kennedy representing you 
kennedy dmass is one of the most liberal senators and is a 
strong supporter of handgun control 
sensenbrenner noting the waiting period is part of the drug 
bill told reporters if the national rifle association wishes to 
defeat congress singular effort this year to put an end to drug 
trafficking thats a record that they will have to live with 
he quoted from an old nra statement saying waiting periods would 
be effective in reducing crimes of passion and in preventing 
people with criminal records and dangerous mental illness from 
acquiring guns 
lapierre in an interview said the nra supported waiting 
periods in the early 1970s but changed its mind a few years later 
when it found they dont stop crime its simply red tape for 
honest people 
lapierre said the group singled out sensenbrenner for special 
criticism despite his past support of the nra because of his 
campaign letter characterizing himself as a strong supporter of gun 
ownership 
sensenbrenner voted for the waiting period in the judiciary 
committee and added thursday he will support the language on the 
house floor 
come on you dont have it both ways lapierre said 
everybody knows this the waiting period is a big gun vote 
youre either for gun owners or against gun owners 
if someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rights 
away were going to fight back thats what sportsmen and gun 
owners expect us to do 
the nra contends the waiting period would amount to a national 
registration of handguns would cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars to enforce and would require a bureaucrats permission 
to buy a gun 
supporters of the legislation deny all those claims

archbishop of canterbury robert runcie who 
conferred with a senior iranian official about british hostages in 
lebanon said thursday that only quiet negotiations can free the 
captives 
the talks raised hopes that church of england envoy terry waite 
and two other britons among 18 foreigners missing and believed 
kidnapped in lebanon may be freed most of the hostages are 
believed held by proiranian extremists 
it does seem there is a turn in the tide of events waites 
cousin john waite said in a tv interview we are very very 
cautious but i think this is a small step along what perhaps is a 
long road toward the release of all the hostages 
in a separate development diplomat david reddaway the first 
british envoy to enter iran in a year left london and said he will 
raise the hostage issue with iranian authorities 
i think it is bound to help reddaway said at heathrow 
airport the main thing i will be able to do is to remind the 
iranian government that we would hope that any government that 
could influence people holding hostages would do so 
neither the iranian embassy nor runcie who left for a 
threeweek vacation in philadelphia would comment on the 
archbishops meeting wednesday night with iranian envoy mohamed 
reza said mohamedi 
waite disappeared in lebanon in january 1987 while trying to 
secure the release of american hostages believed held by 
proiranian extremists nine americans are among the 18 hostages 
mohamedi an official on the european desk of the foreign 
ministry in tehran arrived in london on wednesday via geneva for 
what waites family said were supposed to be secret talks 
it was the first known meeting between the spiritual leader of 
the church of england and an iranian official since waite vanished 
i believe that everyone who is genuinely concerned about the 
improvement of angloiranian relations and about the british 
hostages in lebanon will recognize that there are times when 
progress can only be made quietly runcie said before flying to 
the united states 
meanwhile a british broadcasting corp middle east 
correspondent keith graves reported that control of the hostages 
held in beirut has passed from lebanese shiite moslem 
fundamentalists to a group of hardline iranian revolutionary 
guards 
graves said the hardliners opposed hashemi rafsanjani head of 
irans armed forces because of his agreement to a ceasefire in 
its war with iraq and his willingness to have the western 
hostages released from lebanon 
reddaway planned to spend three weeks assessing whether britain 
should resume a diplomatic presence in tehran 
britain withdrew its diplomats a year ago after one was beaten 
up in an apparent reprisal for the arrest of an iranian envoy in 
northern england on shoplifting charges 
the british embassy was closed and the ambassador withdrawn in 
1980 after a siege by revolutionary guards denouncing britain as a 
us ally 
the remaining diplomats worked out of the swedish embassy one 
iranian envoy remains in britain 
britishiranian relations have improved markedly in the past six 
weeks 
the foreign office which insisted the government was not 
involved in runcies talks said the catalyst for sending a 
diplomat back to tehran was irans agreement july 18 to accept a 
un ceasefire in its war with iraq 
on the instructions of prime minister margaret thatcher british 
officials insist they will not bargain for the release of britons 
in lebanon but britain is now the only western european country 
without diplomats in tehran 
the other britons missing in lebanon are television journalist 
john mccarthy who was kidnapped april 17 1986 and teacher brian 
keenan from northern ireland who has been missing since april 11 
1986 keenan holds dual british and irish nationality 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a 
new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
the longest held foreign hostage in lebanon is american terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press

the operator of pennsylvanias peach bottom 
nuclear power plant was hit thursday with a 125 million fine 
largest in nuclear regulatory commission history because 33 
reactor workers slept or were negligent on the job 
the nrc also announced fines ranging from 500 to 1000 against 
the 33 present and former reactor operators the first such civil 
penalties ever proposed for individual operators 
it said the 33 fines involved sleeping andor other acts of 
inattention to duty at philadelphia electric cos dormant peach 
bottom plant on the susquehanna river in delta pa 
the nrc called the levies proposed fines explaining that 
both philadelphia electric and the operators have 30 days to either 
admit or deny the alleged violations if they admit the 
allegations they still can seek to have the fines reduced or 
withdrawn 
if the allegations are denied the nrc staff will study the 
reasons why before making a decision on whether to uphold the 
penalty we say they violated the regulations and unless they 
demonstrate they did not then the fine will be imposed as 
proposed said commission spokesman frank ingram 
the 125 million fine is the largest since congress gave the 
nrc authority to issue civil penalties in 1969 the previous high 
was a 900000 fine against toledo edison co for an incident in 
which the davisbesse nuclear plant in ohio had a temporary loss of 
cooling water 
peach bottom which sits near the pennsylvaniamaryland border 
and is capable of producing one million kilowatts of electric 
power was ordered shut down by the nrc on march 31 1987 because 
it posed an immediate threat to the public health and safety 
sleeping on the job was so common at the plant that on one 
occasion a shift superintendent and three of the four reactor 
operators all dozed at once according to testimony by an nrc 
official at a commission hearing in april 1987 
philadelphia electric officials said at a news conference in 
holtwood pa that they had not decided whether to appeal the 
record fine 
we have a period of time to evaluate and make that decision 
we have not made it yet we intend to review it very carefully 
before we make that decision company chairman joseph f paquette 
jr said 
philadelphia electric spokesman william jones said the company 
was relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and 
that we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the 
peach bottom restart plan 
in informing the company of the fine the nrc staff said all 
levels of plant management at that time either knew or should have 
known of these facts and either took no action or inadequate action 
to correct this situation 
james taylor the nrcs deputy executive director for regional 
operations said in a letter to philadelphia electric that the 
commission recognized that the utility had made extensive 
personnel changes and had ordered reactor operators retrained 
but taylor said the fines were necessary to emphasize to the 
company and others the significance of the problem and to ensure 
that corrective actions are long lasting 
in addition to the fines the commission barred the utility from 
placing in any operational position three officials who were 
toplevel managers at the plant in 1987 the officials held the 
positions of operations engineer superintendent of operations and 
plant manager 
corbin a mcneill jr executive vice president for nuclear 
operations said the officials were still with the company and 
that they had been assigned to other nonnuclear responsibilities 
philadelphia electric has been trying to get nrc permission to 
restart the plant for almost a year on the first anniversary of 
the commissionordered shutdown last march the company said the 
action had cost shareholders 72 million because of the cost of 
purchasing replacement power 
the company is the subject of a lawsuit filed in july by three 
utilities that claimed they lost money because of inadequate 
administration and maintenance that caused the peach bottom 
shutdown 
public service electric amp gas co atlantic city electric co 
and delmarva power amp light co filed suit seeking unspecified 
damages philadelphia electric responded that the charges were 
unfounded 
atlantic electric owns 75 percent of peach bottom pseampg owns 
4249 percent philadelphia electric owns 4249 percent and 
operates the plant and delmarva owns the balance of the plant

worldwide groups promised food and airlifted 
supplies thursday into the sudan where torrential rains caused 
massive flooding that left 15 million people homeless and at least 
11 dead 
in southern egypt rescue teams pulled 10 bodies out of the nile 
river after a cruiser capsized and sunk during a storm a day 
earlier the middle east news agency reported they were identified 
as six italian tourists and four egyptians 
ten italian nationals and 13 egyptians were missing the 
stateowned news agency said 
electric power was restored to parts of the sudanese capital of 
khartoum but the country still faced the dangers of an overflowing 
nile river and the possible outbreak of diseases 
in its early friday edition the staterun alahram daily said 
33 airplanes carrying food medicine and relief supplies had 
arrived in khartoum including 20 from egypt seven from saudi 
arabia and others from italy britain and jordan 
in rome the world food program announced thursday it was 
supplying more than 6000 tons of emergency food aid to flood 
victims 
the quantities together with bilateral aid provided from 
locally available stocks will be sufficient to feed about 1 
million people for one month the agency said in a statement 
the united states has arranged to airlift more than 850 rolls of 
plastic sheets to serve as tents for some of the homeless it is 
also sending 1200 tons of grain and food and 1 million worth of 
other relief supplies 
the genevabased international red cross said it was sending 
2000 tons of food red cross offices in britain the netherlands 
and denmark are flying in 1000 tents nearly 50000 blankets and 1 
million water purification tablets 
national red cross societies and governments also have pledged 
615000 to purchase flour cooking oil and other supplies 
the world food program said relief workers fear outbreaks of 
cholera dysentery and malaria 
sudanese officials blamed the recent floods on inadequate 
drainage systems last weeks rainfall in khartoum and its 
surrounding areas was 84 inches compared with only 144 inches 
during all of 1987 
khartoum and three other cities in eastern and northern sudan 
have been declared disaster areas and prime minister sadek 
elmahdi has announced a nationwide state of emergency for six 
months 
the blue nile which converges at khartoum with the white nile 
to form the nile river was rising rapidly behind the sennar and 
rosseire dams 
the possibility of the nile overflowing its banks will be 
determined during the last 10 days of august sudans irrigation 
minister mahmoud beshir said thursday 
mena said thursday that the blue nile had covered 150 houses on 
the island of tuti facing khartoum and the government was 
instructing inhabitants to place sand bags along the river bank to 
stop the rising waters 
the nile has surged beyond levels recorded in 1946 when it had 
its worst flood on record khartoums governor gen elfateh 
abdoon was quoted by mena as saying 
in egypt the steamer nubia was sailing from aswan to luxor when 
it capsized and sank near the town of edfu in a storm wednesday it 
was carrying 51 italians and an egyptian crew of 45

the body of one was picked up from the water thursdays recovery 
of the bodies of four egyptians left 13 egyptian crewmen missing

a federal judge thursday halted fall 
elections for state district court family court and court of 
appeal seats saying he found that louisianas election laws 
discriminate against black people 
attorneys for the state said they would appeal as soon as 
possible noting that the 5th us circuit court of appeal last 
week overturned a lower court injunction in a similar case dealing 
with a louisiana supreme court election 
i conceive it to be my duty having found violations to 
enjoin all district court family court and court of appeal 
elections until the governor of louisiana and the legislature have 
had an opportunity to make changes in the judicial elections system 
that will avoid such violations us district judge john parker 
wrote in thursdays order 
he specified that the state laws violate a section of the us 
voting rights act which prohibits any practice that limits voting 
rights on the basis of race 
gov buddy roemer was out of town and could not be reached 
immediately for comment 
blacks filed suit in 1986 contending that the present system 
violates federal law by diluting minority voting strength there 
are only five blacks among the 178 state district judges who 
handle most civil and criminal trials the plaintiffs said during 
recent hearings 
they had asked parker for an injunction barring the elections 
until the merits of the case could be decided their attorneys said 
thursdays order suggests that the judge will ultimately strike 
louisianas election laws dealing with the judiciary 
primary elections for various judicial seats had been scheduled 
oct 1 and runoffs if needed would have been held during the 
november general elections under louisianas open primary system 
candidates from both parties run on the same primary ballot and a 
runoff is held between the two top votegetters if no candidate 
receives a majority 
in most cases judges are elected on an atlarge basis in their 
parish the louisiana equivalent of a county or group of parishes 
rather than from singlemember districts within each parish 
the federal law requires singlemember districts blacks 
contended 
in the very near future there are going to be a significant 
number of black judges elected and the state judiciary is going to 
be significantly integrated robert mcduff lead attorney for the 
plaintiffs said after hearing of parkers injunction 
assistant attorney general ken dejean and attorney robert pugh 
handling the case for the state said they are banking on relief 
from the 5th circuit 
a federal judge in new orleans halted a louisiana supreme court 
election at the request of blacks but the 5th circuit threw out the 
injunction 
the federal appeals panel did not rule on the merits of the 
case but said that halting the election would irreparably harm the 
supreme court candidates who had already spent money on the 
campaigns 
two supreme court justices are elected at large from a 
fourparish new orleansarea district other high court districts 
in the state are singlemember districts 
the plaintiffs want at least one of the judges elected from a 
new orleansonly district where black voters are in the majority

across the parking lot she said surveying a large grassy area 
beneath the improvised rooftop altar 
parishioner david garza an attorney said trying to plan the 
event without knowing how many will attend hasnt been easy 
we are one of the smallest parishes in town we dont have a 
lot of money but people have been very generous he said 
ideas for how to accommodate the crowd were based on his trip 
last september to see pope john paul ii in san antonio garza said 
i started writing in my notebook all the things that i 
remembered from the popes visit medical tents water 
ambulances he said 
st john neumann will have 20 portable toilets two medical 
tents two firstaid stations and drinking water will be 
available he said

theresa werner have claimed to receive messages from the virgin 
mary during monday night rosary service and attendance has swelled 
from a handful to more than 1000

accident six years ago and fought a subsequent addiction to 
painkillers says she has found tranquility and a revitalized 
career 
shortly after the success of the movie private benjamin 
brennan was hit by a car in venice calif on the night of oct 
27 1982 when she was having dinner with costar goldie hawn 
her legs were smashed all the bones on the left side of her 
face were broken her left eye socket was shattered and it seemed 
impossible she would survive but she fought her injuries with rage 
i was no saint she says in septembers ladies home journal 
i was angry and anger is a powerful emotion it increased my 
determination not to go under to get well 
her sons sam and patrick 11 and 10 at the time were her 
greatest help on her road to recovery she says they treated me 
as if i really did have the strength and of course that gave me 
the strength 
but painkillers were also a big part of her recovery and two 
years after the accident brennan 50 entered the betty ford

the food and drug administration on thursday 
proposed new rules for cold medications that would allow 
overthecounter sales of a prescription antihistamine and 
eliminate another compound that has been in use for 50 years 
because evidence shows it is of little value 
the agency also said that as part of a review of all 
nonprescription medications researchers had determined that 
products that treat several symptoms of the common cold at once are 
a convenience to patients who would otherwise have to take 
several products to treat congested and runny noses watery eyes 
headache and coughing 
it proposed that 14 drug combinations should continue to be 
rated as safe and effective most of the major cough and cold 
combination products on the market would continue under this rating 
products treating only single symptoms also would continue to be 
available the agency said 
the fda proposed that promethazine hydrochloride an 
antihistamine now available only by prescription be converted to 
nonprescription use in multiingrediant cold products 
another proposal calls for elimination of drug combinations that 
use theophylline the agency said that although theophylline 
combinations have been used for years to ease labored breathing 
research shows there is no convincing evidence that these 
combinations are of value 
the agency said the combination of theophylline and ephedrine 
has been in use for more than 50 years and the law did not require 
that their effectiveness be tested before they were first marketed 
a 1962 law required such testing and the fda is now reviewing all 
nonprescription ingredients 
if the proposed standard becomes final some major products that 
use drug combinations that include theophylline would have to be 
reformulated or removed from the market among the products 
affected would be primatene tablets bronkotabs and bronkolixir 
the proposed standard will be published in the federal register 
on friday but would not become final until after an indefinite 
period allowed for public comment the fda said

the sister of the late liberace testified 
that she was penniless while an attorney countered she had been 
given more than 100000 so far from a trust left by her 
entertainer brother 
angie liberaces testimony came in an increasingly bitter court 
battle between a beverly hills calif attorney who is executor of 
liberaces estate and five people challenging a will signed by 
liberace 13 days before his death last year 
in her second day of testimony on thursday ms liberace 74 
criticized the trust set up to take care of her she said her 
brother had intended for her to have everything she needed without 
having to be accountable to anyone 
if i didnt have this trust i wouldnt have to answer to you 
people for every piece of food i swallow she testified 
liberace didnt intend for me to have a trust 
the suit in state district court seeks to oust attorney joel 
strote as executor of the estate valued at 18 million and as 
head of the liberace foundation for the performing arts which 
provides scholarships to nearly 30 colleges and universities 
strote was named executor in a will liberace signed jan 22

at least 90 among thousands of vietnamese boat 
people who flooded this colonys shores in recent months have asked 
to be returned home a government spokeswoman said thursday 
most of the refugees seeking a return trip about 70 have 
come forward in the past week since hong kong opened talks with 
hanoi about largescale repatriation said the spokeswoman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity vietnam has said it is ready to 
take back refugees who want to return 
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 hong kong considered all 
vietnamese arriving by boat as political refugees eligible for 
resettlement in third countries 
an estimated 23000 refugees have come to this tiny british 
colony whose 55 million people already are crowded in the 
20squaremile enclave hong kong with its active business 
community is on the southeastern coast of china about 500 miles 
from vietnams northern border 
a new policy took effect in hong kong on june 16 to curb the 
surging number of arrivals it labels all incoming vietnamese as 
illegal immigrants subject to repatriation except those who can 
prove that persecution drove them from communist vietnam 
despite the new rules about 7000 vietnamese boat people have 
sailed into hong kong since midjune and hong kong has been 
packing most of them into temporary detention centers 
the government spokeswoman said some of those who requested 
repatriation were classified as illegal immigrants but she said 
others were classified as refugees entitled to be resettled 
she said she had no further details 
only 21 boat people have been voluntarily repatriated from hong 
kong since 1978 including two in july 
officials of hong kong and vietnam met in hanoi on aug 34 to 
discuss repatriations no agreement was reached but more talks 
were expected 
the repatriation applications of the 90 volunteers will be 
forwarded to the un high commissioner for refugees for discussion 
with hanoi un officials could not be reached immediately for

doctors are becoming more concerned about ethics 
as they face complex health care issues and that concern is 
changing the way decisions are made at the patients bedside 
studies show 
doctors are turning more frequently to ethics committees or 
consultants with medical legal religious and philosophical 
expertise the journal of the american medical association said 
while the advice of such groups is not binding it gives doctors 
another perspective 
the physicians decisions must now be justified to patients 
and their families ones colleagues and the courts wrote dr 
edmund d pellegrino of the kennedy institute of ethics in 
washington in a jama editorial 
as a result every physician must know how to use the 
advice of ethical consultants wisely and well pellegrino wrote 
fridays journal devoted several articles and an editorial to 
the subject of medical ethics studies dealt with an ethics 
consultation service established at the university of chicago 
hospitals and clinics and a doctors office operated by the 
university of virginia medical center 
ethical issues are seen in cases such as that of a 55yearold 
woman who requires a machine to breathe and whose family considers 
discontinuing her treatment and the case of a 27yearold man with 
a history of drug and alochol abuse who seeks a liver transplant 
researchers led by dr julia e connelly of the university of 
virginias division of general medicine studied 280 patients who 
visited a doctors office operated by the school in charlottesville 
from november 1983 to july 1984 all the patients 212 women and 
68 men were at least 17 years old 
the researchers found that 84 of the patients or 30 percent 
presented ethical problems ranging from the issue of refusing 
treatment to issues like confidentiality and the cost of care 
the chicago study by dr john la puma of lutheran general 
hospital in suburban park ridge discussed a formal ethics 
consultation service established at the university of chicagos 
center for clinical medical ethics in 1986 members of the service 
included doctors with expertise in clinical ethics clinical ethics 
fellows and senior medical students a hospital attorney and a 
philosophy professor served as resources 
the study reviewed consultation requests over a year and found 
that 45 doctors requested consultations for 51 patients the most 
common consultation was for assistance on decisions to forego 
lifesustaining treatment la puma said 
in 71 percent of the cases the doctor found the consultation 
very important in patient management in clarifying ethical 
issues or in learning about medical ethics la puma said in 96 
percent of the cases the study found doctors indicated they 
planned to request consultations in the future 
la puma said the emphasis on ethics can help clarify medical 
issues that may have become lost in a maze of technology 
bedside ethics is what doctors and patients want and need

ensured 
iraq on thursday accused iran of shelling iraqi military

southwest iran iraqi media carried no reports on air force 
activity and there was no independent confirmation of such flights

the ceasefire could be jeopardized if iraqi warplanes continued to 
buzz iranian cities he lodged a protest with the secretarygeneral

four highperformance sports cars will be 
deployed by the us border patrol along the arizonamexico border 
in hopes of making highspeed chases shorter safer and less 
frequent officials said 
two pontiac transam formula 350s a camero iroc z28 and a 
special service ford mustang soon will be deployed in the border 
patrols tucson sector which was chosen to test and evaluate the 
highperformance vehicles said robert s coffin the sectors 
chief deputy patrol officer 
the four cars valued at about 60000 were purchased with 
money from the border alliance an interagency group that fights 
drugsmuggling along the mexican border coffin said the cars will 
have border patrol decals sirens and flashing lights he said 
the cars are to be deployed aug 22 according to ronald dowdy 
chief patrol agent for the tucson sector 
dowdy and coffin said the idea is to make highspeed pursuits 
shorter and therefore safer the agency also is publicizing the 
use of the highperformance cars in hopes of discouraging suspects 
from trying to run away the officials said 
one advantage of the highperformance cars is faster 
acceleration dowdy said he said agents often are parked when 
someone speeds past them and catching up can be difficult 
theyre going 65 and were going 0 he said 
nine officers have been chosen to be part of the pilot program 
they are being sent to a special highspeed driving school first 
we want them to learn to handle vehicles at high speeds before we 
put them out there in these vehicles coffin said 
the officers will evaluate the performance of the cars and make 
a recommendation to the border patrol in about six months if the 
cars are found to be effective more could be purchased in the 
future coffin said 
the arizona department of public safety began experimenting with 
highperformance cars in 1986 with the purchase of 10 mustangs the 
department now has 20 to 25 such cars on highway patrol duty and 
another 20 are about to be put on highways said sgt allan 
schmidt a department spokesman 
dowdy said the border patrol which has a fleet of about 200 
cars initially plans to deploy the highperformance vehicles along 
interstates 19 and 10 in southern arizona

savings and loan associations lost capital at 
a slower rate in the second quarter reflecting efforts of federal 
regulators to close or bail out insolvent institutions statistics 
released thursday indicate 
the federal home loan bank board said the industrys capital 
declined by 172 billion in the apriljune period compared with a 
drop of 351 billion in the first quarter and 468 billion in the 
last three months of 1987 
changes in capital which is the difference between an 
institutions loans and other assets and what it owes to depositors 
and other creditors often reflect profits or losses 
however an economist with an industry trade group said sampl 
losses likely are not improving as much as the capital figures 
would indicate that is because the federal home loan bank board is 
closing or rescuing more institutions with negative capital said 
martin regalia chief economist of the national council of savings 
institutions 
looking at these numbers things are apparently not getting 
any worse but i wouldnt want to go out on a limb and say theyve 
gotten a whole lot better regalia said 
but its plus in the sense that regulators are doing the 
right thing this is an indication that the bank board has made 
some moves to get rid of bad institutions and thats heartening 
he said 
federally insured sampls lost a record 381 billion in the fourth 
quarter of 1987 and a nearrecord 378 billion in the first three 
months of this year industrywide profit and loss figures for the 
second quarter will not be available until september 
the bank board also reported that sampl depositors withdrew more 
money from their accounts than they deposited in june for the 
second consecutive month net withdrawal were 29 billion in june 
after withdrawals of 10 billion in may 
james barth chief economist of the bank board attributed the 
deposit shrinkage to normal seasonal factors such as spending on 
vacations also he said as stock prices recover some sampl customers 
are apparently withdrawing money to buy stock 
before may net deposits grew for seven consecutive months as 
investors battered by the october crash sought a safe haven in 
federally insured savings accounts 
for the first six months of the year net deposits were up 122 
billion compared with net withdrawals of 154 billion in the 
first half of 1987 
savings institutions closed 248 billion in mortgages in june 
up from 212 billion in may however for the first six months 
mortgage lending was down 152 percent from the same period last 
year 
barth said that is because mortgage rates were higher during the 
first half of 1988 than a year ago and fewer people are refinancing 
their loans 
regalia said the expected decline in housing activity later this 
year as interest rates increase likely will cut into healthy thrift 
institutions profits

private polls conducted by george bushs 
presidential campaign have shown that former rival sen bob dole 
rkan would give him a larger boost than others being considered 
for the no 2 spot on the ticket but even this lift is a small 
one campaign sources said thursday 
sources familiar with bushs selection process who spoke only 
on the condition of anonymity said a bushdole ticket showed up as 
only marginally stronger than other potential combinations for 
which polling was done 
doles advantage is a little bit but not enough to make much 
of a difference said one source 
a ticket of bush and bob dole ran stronger than a hypothetical 
ticket of bush and doles wife former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole the sources said 
bushs polling by his chief pollster robert teeter is all but 
complete suggesting that the vice president will likely make up 
his mind in the closely guarded process based on criteria other 
than polling the sources said bush has said he will not announce 
his choice until the convention 
the soontobe republican presidential nominee appeared with a 
group of black supporters members of a 100strong group calling 
itself black americans for bush and said he would have a 
broadbased cabinet 
however he declined to say whether he would name a black to 
that cabinet a promise he had previously made only to hispanics 
bush also declined to be drawn into a discussion of whether he 
was considering lt gen colin l powell the first black ever to 
hold the post of national security adviser for the no 2 spot 
he said he had worked closely with colin powell and i have 
great respect for him but he said dont put it into any vice 
presidential equation 
sources said that bush has not done any polling on powell and 
that he is not under active consideration 
those who were contacted earlier by bush and asked to provide 
financial data include both doles rep jack kemp of new york and 
sens alan simpson of wyoming pete domenici of new mexico and dan 
quayle of indiana according to campaign aides 
govs george deukmejian of california jim thompson of illinois 
john sununu of new hampshire carroll campbell of south carolina 
and former governor lamar alexander of tennessee were also among 
those on the original list of those under consideration the aides 
said deukmejian has since withdrawn his name from consideration 
bush sources said that polling data indicated that candidates 
from small states like simpson only helped the ticket 
significantly in those states and would have little impact 
nationally 
simpson a close friend of bush does not expect to be given a 
spot on the ticket a spokesman mary kay hill said on thursday 
i dont think the call will come i think theyll need to play 
electoral college politics she said 
she said simpson and bush talked about 10 days ago and simpson 
told the vice president he did not feel he could help him 
because of some controverisal positions he has taken including 
limits on costofliving increases for social security recipients 
and veterans 
sources also suggested that no polling had been done on 
domenici suggesting that he may no longer be under active 
consideration 
meanwhile kemp said he has no expectations that hell get 
picked and is not sitting by the telephone waiting to be 
asked but the new york congressman said he would naturally jump 
at the job 
if im asked i would be happy if im not im going to be 
equally happy kemp said in an interview taped thursday for the 
syndicated television show mclaughlins one on one 
in another development two tennessee republicans mentioned as 
vice presidential prospects alexander and former sen howard h 
baker jr said they plan only minimal participation in next weeks 
convention 
alexander now president of the university of tennessee will 
fly to new orleans on sunday to address a meeting of the republican 
governors and return to nashville that evening alexander has said 
he would not refuse the no 2 spot but most tennessee republican 
leaders say they do not believe he will be asked 
baker former white house chief of staff said he is among hosts 
for a luncheon monday in new orleans honoring first lady nancy 
reagan and will meet the with tennessees congressional delegation 
he will make a brief trip back to tennessee then return to new 
orleans on thursday for a luncheon in honor of his work as senate 
majority leader and of sen bob doles work as minority leader 
in his meeting with black supporters bush said that while he 
was aware that most black voters traditionally voted democratic 
we have a good shot we have a chance 
he said that in his campaign he would demonstrate my 
commitment in the field of civil rights and in opening the arms of 
this party i will be a fairplay kind of person 
the coalition of blacks supporting bush includes joshua smith 
president of the maxima corp porcia scott editor of the atlanta 
daily world newspaper james cheek president of howard university 
entertainer lionel hampton and larry brown former running back for

prospects for this years grain harvest in the 
soviet union have declined slightly from earlier indications the 
agriculture department said thursday 
officials said the soviet harvest is now expected to be around 
210 million metric tons a decline of 5 million tons from the level 
forecast in recent months yields were said to be smaller than 
expected 
production of springplanted grain has been hit hardest 
including spring wheat oats and barley the usda report said the 
output of spring wheat could be the lowest since 1984 
however this is not expected to result in additional soviet 
wheat imports at this time as smaller supplies of quality wheat 
worldwide have sharply driven up prices the report said 
instead as the soviets are expected to limit any potential 
inventory stock buildup in 198889 and could even draw on stocks 
accumulated in recent years if necessary 
part of the reason for the reduction in usdas estimate was said 
to be a smallerthanexpected planted area as reported by moscow 
as well as deterioration in spring grain yields 
even so at 210 million tons of grain the soviet harvest would 
be one of the largest on record the largest was 2374 million tons 
in 1978

a federal judge thursday dismissed major 
elements of a black fbi agents racial harassment lawsuit against 
the bureau as technically deficient but gave the plaintiff a chance 
to file a new complaint 
us district judge charles r richey noted that donald rochons 
lawsuit contained repugnant and chilling allegations of racial 
harassment by fellow agents 
but the judge found rochons complaint contains defects in 
both pleading and legal theory that constrain the court to dismiss 
many of the plaintiffs claims 
rochon claims he was the victim of a threeyear campaign of 
harassment by fellow agents in omaha neb and later chicago in 
which he received anonymous telephone calls and racist obscene 
letters including one that threatened him with mutilation and 
death and a sexual assault on his white wife 
gary w miller a chicago agent who was kept in the lawsuit by 
richeys order has admitted he sent rochon a death and 
dismemberment insurance policy as retribution miller is now 
the subject of a federal grand jury investigation in chicago 
the suit includes allegations that fellow agents placed 
chocolate in the earpiece of his telephone so that it came off onto 
his ear when he used the instrument 
richey chided some defendants for referring to the incidents in 
their pleadings as pranks noting that the equal employment 
opportunity commission had upheld some of rochons claims 
this utter lack of sensitivity is almost as disturbing as the 
alleged adts themselves richey said warning defendnats that a 
modicum of decency is expected of all those who file pleadings in 
this court 
the judge dismissed altogether claims against three agents with 
whom rochon worked in omaha from 1983 until his transfer to chicago 
in june 1984 ruling the threeyear statute of limitations on these 
allegations had expired 
richey refused to dismiss rochons claim against the justice 
department that as a federal employee he was a victim of 
discrimination and racial harassment in violation of title vii of 
the civil rights act of 1964 
but the judge ruled that the 21 fbi agents named in the lawsuit 
could not be sued individually under this law only the attorney 
general as head of the agency in which rochon works can be sued 
under this statute the judge said 
richey also ruled that because of the way rochons suit was 
worded his complaints of individual harassment by individual 
agents were preempted by his title vii claims and therefore could 
not be brought under other statutes 
from the imprecisely pleaded complaint it is difficult to 
discern the discrete basis of plaintiff donald rochons common law 
tort claims against individual agents richey said 
the other counts of the lawsuit are not based on distinct 
wrongs but are all based upon conduct actionable under title vii 
richey said 
but the judges dismissal of these claims without prejudice 
leaves rochons attorneys the opportunity to draft a new complaint 
to try to get around this legal obstacle 
despite the ruling rochons attorney david kairys of 
philadelphia said he was happy with the judges ruling 
he has upheld our ability to get personal damages against the 
individual wrongdoers kairys said 
kairys said he would be able to satisfy the technical 
requirements for commonlaw claims against the white agents 
although he conceded this would be more difficult against the fbi 
supervisors and managers whom rochon claims ignored his complaints 
rochons title vii claims do not allow him to collect monetary 
damages for the alleged racial harassment to do so rochon must 
sustain the claims that his constitutional rights were violated in 
distinct ways by fellow agents 
but richey found that the complaint as it was worded allowed 
the fbi agents to claim that their actions were not subject to 
legal action because they were acting in their official roles as 
government agents 
this includes allegations that rochons supervisors refused to 
investigate his charges of racial harassment 
the judge noted that the complaint states that all of the 
individual defendants with governmental positions acted within the 
scope of their employment 
given this admission that both the means used and ends sought 
by defendants were within the scope of their employment the court 
is constrained from examining the connection between the alleged 
acts and bounds of defendants official duties richey said 
under the language of the complaint these defendants are 
entitled to absolute immunity from common law tort liability 
arising out of these actions the judge said 
claims by rochons estranged wife susan also were dismissed 
without prejudice because the complaint nowhere alleges or 
even implies that defendants entered into an agreement of any 
kind to violate her civil rights 
the judge refused to dismiss commonlaw damage claims against 
miller thomas dillon and kenneth veach rochon claims that all 
three white agents orchestrated the harassment against him in 
chicago

prime minister brian mulroney said thursday that 
failure to redress the internment of 12000 japanesecanadians 
during world war ii is a blot on the nations honor but he refused 
to follow the us example and promise cash compensation 
under questioning in parliament mulroney said his conservative 
government was prepared to make a formal apology to 
japanesecanadians whose goods and property were seized during the 
war and to set up a community fund to fight racism 
but pressed by opposition liberal and new democratic party 
members to match the bill signed this week by president reagan 
mulroney made no commitments the us legislation gives 60000 
surviving japaneseamerican internees 20000 each 
compensation was not the sticking point mulroney argued 
noting that former prime minister pierre trudeaus liberal 
government refused to even consider redress for japanesecanadians 
interned as wartime security threats 
although their homes fishing boats and belongings were sold 
off the internees were never discovered to have aided japan or 
hurt canada nevertheless successive governments until now 
defended the internment as a necessary wartime precaution 
mulroney termed the incident a tragedy and said discussions 
with japanesecanadians were making progress answering a question 
he said it is a very serious blot on canadas honor 
four successive cabinet ministers in charge of ethnic minorities 
have failed to resolve a compensation claim by the national 
association of japanesecanadians association president art miki 
said the current minister gerry weiner has declined to set a date 
for new talks 
miki a high school principal in winnipeg told the associated 
press that passage of the us bill gave japanesecanadians renewed 
hope 
everyone you meet in our community was very pleased said 
miki 51 who was interned as a child the american precedent 
certainly strengthens our case 
he said the mulroney government has been trying to treat the 
survivors as a group but its individuals who make up the group 
the american government recognizes those individual rights 
japanesecanadians have a stronger case since unlike most of 
their american counterparts they were not allowed to return to 
their homes miki said 
many still live in the prairies where they were interned on 
farms never returning to british columbia where the majority 
worked in the fishing industry 
miki said his group wants 20500 compensation for each of the 
12000 survivors a formal apology and a community project fund of 
41 million instead of the 98 million proposed by the government 
the demands total 287 million a report commissioned by the 
national association said the original 21000 internees incurred 
losses of 363 million in 1986 dollars 
miki said most of the survivors are in their 70s and the 
mortality rate is about 1000 a year 
the globe and mail canadas national newspaper said in an 
editorial this week that the lack of compensation was shameful 
and the government should forget about offering piddling sums 
there was a small step towards reconciliation last week when the 
town of kaslo british columbia one of the internment sites held 
a twoday event to acknowledge the injustice done to 
japanesecanadians 
a plaque unveiled on the occasion said these innocent and 
loyal canadians did not pose a threat to national security but were 
victims of racism and political expediency

a temporary suspension of a 36 billion 
contract with international business machines corp should not 
seriously interfere with the planned modernization of air traffic 
control computers transportation secretary jim burnley said 
thursday 
the general services administrations board of appeals ordered 
the contract suspended wednesday after a competitor for the 
contract hughes aircraft co challenged the awarding of the 
project to ibm 
the appeals board a semijudicial body that resolves government 
contract disputes has scheduled 45 days to resolve the matter 
both ibm and hughes a subsidiary of general motors corp had 
competed for the 36 billion contract to build a new automated 
computer system for the federal aviation administrations air 
traffic control operations the modernization project is to be 
completed in the late 1990s 
the transporation department selected ibm over hughes on july 
25 at a news conference announcing the award officials said ibm 
was selected primarily because it submitted a lower bid 
burnley told reporters he has a lot of confidence that in this 
case everything was run by the numbers as far as the selection 
was concerned 
he suggested that if the matter was resolved after the 45day 
period the project would not be adversely affected if thats 
all that happens i dont think it will hurt us at all 
but burnley acknowledged it would become critical if there 
were longer delays that would threaten the ability of ibm to hold 
together the teams already assembled for the project 
meanwhile burnley said he was surprised at the decision by 
hughes to protest the contract award because he said he had been 
assured by general motors chairman roger smith several days after 
ibm received the contract that no protest would be filed 
hughes aircraft in its challenge asked that the contract with 
ibm be revoked arguing that the faa and transportation department 
had provided ibm unfair advantages 
hughes accused the faa of failing to follow a requirement that 
said technical merits were to be given greater weight than price 
when awarding the contract 
hughes also claimed several irregularities caused its price to 
be inflated for example hughess bid relied on ibm to provide 
computer hardware but according to hughes aircraft ibm charged 
hughes substantially more for the hardware than what ibm quoted the 
faa for the same items in their separate bid

swedes opened their annual crawfish 
season thursday with much singing and slurping but the national 
holiday had to be helped with imports from china and louisiana 
much of swedens crawfish stock was destroyed by a bacterial 
plague beginning in the 1960s since then this country of 84 
million people has become one of the worlds biggest importers of 
the shellfish with about 1800 tons a year 
the price of the scarce swedish crawfish hit about 61 for two 
pounds but american imports were readily available at 15 bargains 
us imports of 1000 tons this year ended turkeys previous 
dominanation of the market 
technically thursday is the opening of the fishing season for 
the freshwater crustaceans but traditionally no one eats even the 
imported varieties until aug 11 
the crawfish are boiled in dill and smothered in tradition 
swedes eat them wearing party hats and bibs timehonored rules say 
each claw should be downed with a glass of schnapps 
with an influx of imports from new countries swedish newspapers 
held gourmet tests to evaluate this years crop judges were 
swedish celebrities actors or famous chefs

inspectors working for the federal aviation 
administration and other transportation department agencies are 
being enlisted for the war against illegal drugs transportation 
secretary jim burnley said thursday 
burnley said the more than 4200 dot inspectors will receive 
drug awareness training so they can serve as a new army of eyes 
in the nations antidrug effort 
these inspectors are involved in monitoring airlines trucking 
companies shipping vessels and the railroads 
burnley acknowledged that the dot inspectors have no police 
power to interfere in drug trafficking if it is discovered but he 
said they will be told to keep their eyes open for signs of 
possible illegal drug activity and notify authorities 
what might make an aviation inspector suspicious 
a few items listed by the transportation department included 
evidence of adhesive tape near registration numbers showing 
possible alteration of the numbers the presence of sophisticated 
navigation instruments on inappropriate aircraft warped or 
misaligned aircraft doors indicating they have been opened in 
flight possibly for air drops or unusual rivet patterns 
indicating that the plane might have been altered to create hiding 
places for drugs or extra fuel tanks

israel should neither annex the occupied 
territories nor include the palestine liberation organization in 
discussions of their future prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
thursday 
plo officials arrived in jordan for meetings about king 
husseins decision last week to give the organization full 
responsibility for the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
where 15 million palestinians live 
there have been reports of disagreement among aides to chairman 
yasser arafat about whether hussein helped or hurt the plo by 
cutting ties to the territories where an uprising began dec 8 
israeli soldiers fired on stronethrowing palestinians in the 
west bank on thursday and violent demonstrations were reported in 
the gaza strip a young palestinian was wounded by gunfire 
shamir said israels enemies were using the rebellion to 
undermine its morale 
they have come to the conclusion they can and will attack 
israels vulnerable points israeli morale israeli motivation and 
israels faith in its righteousness he said at a graduation 
ceremony of the national defense college 
earlier thursday he rejected demands for annexation by 
rightwing groups 
he said the status of the territories could be decided only in 
talks with palestinians not affiliated with the plo which israel 
regards as a terrorist organization 
we honor our international obligations and we shall not make 
any unilateral step like imposing israeli rule on the territories 
that are subject to negotiations shamir said 
his reference was to the usmediated camp david accords 
reached by israel and egypt in 1978 which call for five years of 
autonomy for palestinians before negotiations on the final status 
of land captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
husseins separation from the occupied lands included laying off 
about 21000 civil servants paid by his government 
jordan was committed by arab summit resolutions to certain 
obligations toward the west bank until the land is liberated 
arafat aide khaled hassan was quoted as saying in an interview 
published thursday in the saudi arabian newspaper alsharq alawsat 
in neighboring dubai the newspaper albayan quoted salah 
khalaf anotehr aide to the plo chief as saying husseins 
courageous decision allows the plo to shoulder its 
responsibility and take over new political rights 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi said he would pay the salaries of 
former employees of jordan in the occupied lands monte carlo radio 
reported 
an israeli foreign ministry official said privately it was 
very hypothetical whether israel would allow another arab 
country to send money into the territories 
soldiers in the west bank wounding a 16yearold palestinian in 
the right leg officials at al ittihad hospital in nablus said 
in the gaza strip town of khan yunis palestinians set tires 
ablaze and hurled rocks to protest the death tuesday of a young 
arab burned to death in a suspected arson attack on a shack where 
he was sleeping near tel aviv 
a military court sentenced a palestinian woman munira daoud to 
eight months in prison for throwing a rock in april at a jewish 
settler guarding hiking jewish teenagers in the west bank village 
of beita 
the guard romam aldubi accidentally shot and killed 
15yearold tirza porat during the melee according to an army 
investigation 
the military judge who passed sentence said he took into 
consideration that ms daouds brother was killed in the 
confrontation and the army had demolished her home in reprisal 
israel radio said 
jewish settler pinchas wallerstein was charged thursday with 
manslaughter in the january shooting death of a palestinian 
teenager in beitin a west bank village israel radio said the 
maximum penalty is 20 years in prison

an energy department official and 
privatesector research scientist differed sharply thursday over 
whether the nation should begin taking concrete steps to combat the 
global warming known as the greenhouse effect 
donna fitzpatrick associate undersecretary of energy said more 
research was needed before acting to curb production of the 
atmospheric gases that scientists say are changing the earths 
climate 
significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouse 
effect gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concerns 
raised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportable 
manner she said 
these scientific uncertainties must be reduced before we 
commit the nations economic future to drastic and potentially 
misplaced policy responses fitzpatrick testified 
her statements to the senate energy and natural resources 
committee echoed stands taken previously by reagan administration 
witnesses testifying before congressional hearings on the dangers 
posed to mankind by global warming 
but stephen schneider a climatologist from the national center 
for atmospheric research in boulder colo testified that we 
should not use platitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excuse 
for inaction 
theres a scientific concern that we are assaulting the 
environment much faster than we are understanding it said 
schneider characterizing the administration position as 
political value judgments not scientific opinions 
more research will certainly put policy making on a firmer 
scientific basis but it is my opinion that credible details 
about specific winners and losers will not be available before we 
may have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous large 
atmospheric changes said schneider who works for a consortium 
of universities 
he and government scientists at the hearing repeated warnings 
which have been made more dramatic by this years searing 
temperatures and drought that emissions of gases like carbon 
dioxide and methane are trapping heat in the earths atmosphere 
scientists have not directly linked the summer of 1988 to the 
greenhouse effect but they say the steamy weather and crop losses 
are just some of the problems people can expect in the future 
greenhouse gases come from a variety of sources from the 
burning of fossil fuels like coal production of chemicals like 
clorofluorocarbons the escape of huge amounts of methane from rice 
paddies and the release of carbon dioxide from the destruction of 
forests 
in congressional hearings there has been general scientific 
agreement that continued emissions of such gases will cause a 
destructive rise in temperatures and ocean levels the differences 
occur over when where and how severe the changes will be 
some scientists have warned that even if the world reduced its 
production of greenhouse gases those already in the atmosphere 
already will cause the planet in 30 years to 50 years to have its 
highest temperatures in 10000 years 
officials from the national aeronautics and space 
administration environmental protection agency and national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration told thursdays hearings of 
greenhouse research in their agencies 
they stopped short of seconding fitzpatricks stand that nothing 
should be done to combat greenhouse gas production until more 
scientific certainty is attained 
schneider saying that highleverage actions are long 
overdue called for steps that would combat greenhouse gases 
while attacking other environmental problems such as acid rain 
lowlevel ozone pollution and destruction of the stratospheric 
ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons 
he said his first priority would be greater energy efficiency 
and conservation to reduce emissions from power plants and 
vehicles no step he said should be considered too small because 
slowing down the greenhouse effect makes good sense

a jewish activist said leningrad police detained 
him and four other people thursday after a rally by a russian 
nationalist group that condemns jews and other alien races 
abraham demin 29 telephoned the associated press and said he 
had just been released from a police station to which he was taken 
after arriving at a rally of the pamyat group at the rumyantsevsky 
garden in downtown leningrad 
demin who opposes pamyats activities said he was accused of 
agitating beaten and ordered to return to the station on 
friday for sentencing 
four other people some of them who were clearly passersby at 
the rally also were detained he said 
last week the tabloid moscow news published letters from 
soviets calling pamyat racist and fascist it has chapters in 
moscow and several other large soviet cities and has held rallies 
in leningrad every thursday since the end of june 
one letter quoted a speaker at a rally july 7 as demanding 
immediate deportation of jews and other alien races 
demin said about 200 people attended this weeks rally a 
fiveminute affair that lasted just long enough for pamyat leaders 
to say they were taking a vacation until early september when the 
rallies would resume in a building they did not name 
he said about 50 police watched the scene 
on tuesday police surrounded the leningrad home of a prominent 
dissident 28yearold alexander bogdanov and arrested him for the 
third time this year demin told the ap he said bogdanov he was 
accused of disobeying a policeman and sentenced to 15 days in jail 
bogdanov had tried to put up antipamyat posters at the groups 
rally on aug 4 but police prevented him from doing so and later 
confiscated the posters demin said

police say theyve cracked a tampabased 
child prostitution ring that sold the services of hundreds of boys 
as young as 11 sometimes flying the children to meet clients in 
distant cities 
the network operated in several florida counties and also sent 
boys to atlanta boston chicago denver and indianapolis 
investigators said 
three florida men were arrested in june police disclosed 
wednesday and arrests were expected in other cities 
police said they first became aware of the operation when the 
parents of an 11yearold tampa boy told police they wondered where 
their son was getting large sums of cash 
the man accused of being the ringleader wesley david gonzalez 
26 of daytona beach told authorities the clique used hundreds of 
boys as sex slaves for scores of customers said detective robert 
sheehan 
gonzalez also known as michael david gonzalez was arrested in 
june on charges of capital sexual battery procuring children under 
16 for prostitution and deriving financial support from 
prostitution sheehan said 
gonzalez an unemployed avionics technician was being held 
without bond at the hillsborough county jail 
the other two men arrested in june were identified as larry 
gorman 38 and michael leroy johnson 30 both of tampa police 
said they helped gonzalez find customers johnson was charged with 
performing lewd and lascivious acts with a child gorman was 
charged with performing a sexual act with a child both were 
released on bond 
sheehan said gonzalez understood the psyche of the boys he 
recruited most of them runaways or children from poor or broken 
homes because he was once one of them he used boys to recruit 
others flashing wads of cash as a lure according to the detective 
a lot of the kids despised the sex but the financial 
inducements were too enticing to the youngsters said sheehan 
gonzalez told detectives he turned to prostitution when he was 
12 taking up pimping when he basically became too old sheehan 
said

american and soviet educators are spending 
two weeks coping with stereotypes and social policy in an unusual 
program aimed at teaching them new ways to tell their students 
about each others countries 
maybe first i will try them on my family joked alexander 
mitrofanovich bannov principal of a secondary school in 
novosibirsk about believing exercises and other methods 
outlined at the institute at hampshire college 
the twoweek program which began monday is sponsored by the 
soviet academy of pedagogical sciences and by educators for social 
responsibility a nonprofit organization based in cambridge 
twenty teachers researchers and administrators from each 
country were chosen for the program which is run in english 
bannov who teaches english in the high school he also 
supervises said he was surprised to find his american counterparts 
facing so many of the same problems he faced in trying to reform 
his school 
among those problems he said were the evaluation of teachers 
and students and staff and the improving of education everybody 
says teachers should teach better as if a child was a pan into 
which you could pour information like water 
lawrence dieringer associate director of esr said that for 
teachers in both countries lessons about each others country 
are fraught with problems strong feelings misinformation 
deeply embedded assumptions and resistance to new information all 
related to tensions in ussoviet relations 
thursday the participants did a believing exercise a 
method of getting students to learn how to understand other 
viewpoints by making them defend points of view they disagree with 
the teachers were asked to make statements supporting the 
position that there are some crimes so horrible and so abusive 
that they demand capital punishment 
for many participants it was impossible to suspend doubts about 
the death penalty enough to understand how others could support it 
it is very strange for me to hear about this death penalty 
said one soviet woman i cant imagine this institution 
soviet media occasionally report on executions but do not say 
how often they occur 
just last month soviet government radio reported that the state 
criminal code was being revised to eliminate the death penalty for 
all crimes except premeditated murder the current code also also 
allows death sentences for crimes such as treason and flagrant 
corruption 
earlier in the week participants discussed stereotypes each 
side believed the other held the soviets for example said they 
thought americans saw them as aggressors trying to take over the 
world dieringer said 
we thought that they thought there was a great disparity 
between the rich and poor in our country and that we dont care 
about the poor he said 
in many cases theres some kernel of truth in these 
stereotypes but they are so exaggerated and blown out of 
proportion that they serve to distort and limit our 
understanding of each other he said 
other topics being discussed are the descriptions of each 
others countries in textbooks and education reform efforts 
the idea for the teacher exchange was sparked by the 1986 tour 
of us cities by soviet academicians dieringer said the next 
institute on critical thinking will be held next summer in the 
soviet union

roman catholic bishops urged chiles 
military commanders thursday to avoid a possible deadlock in 
octobers yesorno presidential referendum by choosing a nominee 
acceptable to the opposition 
president augusto pinochet the army commander who has ruled 
chile since a 1973 coup is expected to be chosen at a meeting aug 
30 of the army navy air force and national police commanders the 
nominees name will be the only one on the ballot 
the rev carlos gonzalez president of the episcopal conference 
told a news conference thursday we are probably headed for a 
tie meaning an edge either way of 3 percent of the vote 
opposition leaders oppose continued rule by pinochet 
if the nominee wins a majority he will begin an eightyear term 
in march if not an open election will be held in 1990 and 
pinochet will stay in office until then 
gonzalez released a statement signed by the conferences leaders 
that declared 
chile is becoming polarized and radicalized a considerable 
number of chileans feel uncomfortable about the referendum being 
called because they fear whether a vote of yes or no triumphs 
there exists the danger that the country is headed for a 
confrontation 
many want to see the commanders present a candidate who 
will preside impartially over the transition to democracy the 
candidate should be the fruit of an accord between the government 
and the opposition 
the statement did not refer specifically to pinochets probable 
nomination but made clear the bishops prefer a less controversial 
candidate 
pinochet 72 has rejected previous suggestions that the choice 
of a nominee be negotiated and his government has accused church 
leaders of meddling in politics 
asked for comment on the proposal by bishop gonzalez socialist 
ricardo lagos told reporters the opposition would accept with all 
seriousness an invitation from the government to negotiate lagos 
is a leader of the 16party opposition coalition supporting a 
no vote in the referendum 
propinochet leader eduardo doberti however was quoted by the 
government news agency orbe as saying the idea of a consensus 
candidate has already been exhausted 
no date in october has been announced for the referendum the 
commanders are expected to reveal it along with the the candidates

safety improvements are needed to help prevent 
accidents and protect operators at the department of energys five 
test and research reactors the national academy of sciences said 
thursday 
a report issued by the national research council the academys 
operating arm said doe currently lacks a clear conceptual 
framework for addressing safety issues at the reactors 
it said that because most of the reactors were designed many 
years ago and since have been modified to operate at higher power 
levels prevention and mitigation of some potential accidents 
rely heavily on the proper and timely response of reactor 
operators 
in extreme cases operators might have to act in the presence 
of radiation or steam in order to prevent releases of radioactive 
materials to the environment the report said 
at a minimum it said contractors running the facilities should 
provide the capability to operate critical valves from remote 
consoles outside the reactor confinements 
energy secretary john s herrington said his department welcomed 
the academys safety review which doe had requested in may 1986 
it followed an october 1987 report dealing with safety at the 
departments weapons production reactors 
the nas has again presented doe with a very constructive 
analysis of the issues relating to reactor safety the 
department has made structural longterm changes in response to 
previous nas recommendations and we will continue to do so 
herrington said 
the five doe test and research reactors examined in the nas 
report are the advanced test reactor and the experimental breeder 
reactor ii at the idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho 
falls the fast flux test facility at the hanford federal nuclear 
reservation near richland wash the high flux beam reactor at 
brookhaven national laboratory on long island ny and the high 
flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee 
the report concluded that safety oversight at the doe reactors 
currently is carried out by a fragmented collection of 
contractors operations offices and programmatic divisions in 
headquarters 
the structure tends to disperse responsibility for safety and 
seems to require decisions with safety consequences by 
organizations that are divorced fro daytoday safety 
responsibility it said 
the test and research reactors operate at power levels of 60 
megawatts to 400 megawatts compared with the 1000megawatt levels 
typical for commercial power reactors 
however the report cautioned that even the smallest of the 
test and research reactors contain several million curies of 
volatile radionuclides that must be controlled during an accident

rabbi meir kahane who founded the jewish 
defense league ago and favors deporting all arabs from israel has 
given up us citizenship so he can run for reelection to 
parliament his spokesman said thursday 
kahane born in brooklyn successfully fought a us attempt to 
strip him of citizenship after he was elected to the knesset in 
1985 
spokesman gad servetman said kahane leader of the kach party 
took the action wednesday in a letter addressed to the us embassy 
in tel aviv the purpose was to circumvent israeli legislation 
prohibiting israelis who hold dual citizenship from serving in 
parliament 
servetman said kahane considered the fact that he might have 
trouble reentering the united states when he gave up his 
citizenship 
i know the rabbi was concerned but as far as i understand he 
can still go to the united states servetman said 
kahane who founded the jewish defense league in 1968 fought to 
retain his us passport in 1985 because he believed american 
authorities would not grant him visas to enter the country 
wellknown for his vitriolic tirades kahane advocates expelling 
all arabs from israeliheld territory otherwise he says israel 
will eventually become an arab state because the average arab 
family has more children than the average israeli family

vice president george bush says hes opposed 
to higher interest rates but wont criticize the federal reserve 
for raising a key rate this week 
i think the president has to work closely with the fed even 
though its independent bush said in an interview with abc news 
business week scheduled to be aired sunday a transcript of 
the taped interview was released thursday by the network 
the fed on tuesday claiming it was acting to keep the lid on 
inflation raised its discount rate the rate it charges for 
shortterm loans to its member banks to 65 percent from 60 
percent 
rises in the bellwether rate usually push up other interest 
rates throughout the economy 
i dont want to see interest rates go higher bush said but 
he added that he didnt want to see inflation soar either 
i cant assault them the fed right now for this bush 
said you find a proper mix 
on another subject bush broke with the reagan administration 
and said if elected he would support a central recommendation of a 
presidentially appointed commission on the oct 19 1987 stock 
market crash calling for a single regulatory body preferably the 
fed to oversee financial markets 
the commission was headed by new york investment banker nicholas 
brady a close friend of bushs whom reagan selected last week to 
succeed james a baker iii as treasury secretary 
giving the fed a greater role in regulation i think that 
makes some sense bush said 
bush also said he would not act to curb corporate takeovers 
claiming that big is not bad and he said that under a bush 
administration we are not going to be patsies while were 
excluded from foreign markets

iraq on thursday accused iran of firing 
hundreds of shells and missiles at iraqi military positions near 
the shatt alarab waterway where the persian gulf war broke out 
nearly eight years ago 
a fragile truce had been in place since monday when 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced that iran and 
iraq agreed to observe a ceasefire to begin on aug 20 
the iranian armed forces bombarded iraqi military positions of 
the third armed corps sector around basra with hundreds of 
howitzer and mortar shells and dozens of small missiles wednesday 
and thursday the iraqi mission said in a onepage statement to the 
united nations 
it said iran also bombarded iraqi positions in the seventh armed 
corps sector near the faw peninsula site of some of the wars most 
ferocious offensives 
the brief report to the united nations did not include any 
denunciations of iran broadcast news in iraq late thursday did not 
mention the accusations 
the reported attacks could not be confirmed iran and iraq both 
rarely allow reporters near the war front 
after perez de cuellar announced the aug 20 ceasefire date on 
monday iran gave him a letter pledging it would not launch any 
attacks before that date 
iraq did not submit a similar letter but the secretarygeneral 
said tuesday he received spoken assurances from both iran and iraq 
that they would exercise restraint 
the iraqi missions letter also said an iranian tank fired two 
missiles at iraqi positions in the northern sector 
the main attack on basra involved 214 howitzer projectiles 205 
mortar shells and 32 small missiles the letter said 
the faw bombardment involved 26 howitzer projectiles 32 mortar 
shells and 16 small missiles it said iran also fired three 
howitzer and 11 mortar shells at other iraqi positions in the 
seventh army corps sector it said 
basra and the faw peninsula both are near the shatt alarab the 
southern border between iran and iraq the disputed waterway which 
leads into the persian gulf is iraqs only sea outlet but wrecks 
in the waterway and iranian ships in the gulf have blocked it since 
early in the war 
iraq invaded iran in 1980 after border skirmishes in a bid to 
gain complete control of the waterway 
in recent months iraq recaptured large areas that had been 
taken by iran including the faw peninsula and marshland near 
basra the reverses were seen as one reason iran decided july 18 to 
accept a security council ceasefire resolution that iraq accepted 
shortly after it was passed a year ago 
the un chief met later thursday with iraqi ambassador ismat 
kittani at kittanis request 
asked later if he delivered a note of protest to the 
secretarygeneral kittani replied you assume wrongly i 
think our aim is to register with the un a document of facts 
his tone was a marked contrast to the rancorous exchanges 
between iranian and iraqi envoys that were customary up to last 
month 
irans envoys to the united nations were not available for 
comment they left town for preparatory talks before peace talks 
with iraq due to begin aug 25 in geneva said a receptionist at 
the iranian mission she declined to give her name 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati registered a 
protest wednesday with the secretarygeneral accusing iraqi 
warplanes of breaking the sound barrier over five iranian cities in 
violations of irans airspace 
perez de cuellar said of the alleged overflights i hope it is 
something that doesnt mean that the iraqis intended to break the 
ceasefire i am persuaded that if something happened it was kind 
of a mistake a technical mistake a misunderstanding 
in a letter to the secretarygeneral released thursday 
mahallati said the iraqi planes broke the sound barrier over the 
iran cities of bushehr ramhormoz masjid suleiman and gachsaran 
and invaded iranian airspace over piranshahr 
also thursday the security council approved the choice of 
yugoslavian gen slavko jovic 58 as head of the un iraniraq 
military observer group which is sending 350 officers from 24 
countries to monitor the planned ceasefire 
morocco pledged thursday to donate 2 million to set up the 
force

three national polls thursday said gov michael 
duakis postconvention surge has crested but they differed on the 
level of backing for vice president george bush 
two of the surveys found dukakis retaining a doubledigit lead 
over his republican rival but the third found enough bush support 
to limit dukakis to a bare sixpoint advantage a poll earlier this 
week found a sevenpoint dukakis lead 
dukakis best showing in the new polls was a 14point lead in an 
nbc newswall street journal survey conducted aug 58 that was 
down from the 18point dukakis lead it found the week after the 
democratic convention 
dukakis led by 12 points in a cnnusa today poll also done aug 
58 and his numerical lead was only six points statistically a 
dead heat because of the threepoint margin of error in a 
business week poll done aug 49 
all three of the polls placed support for dukakis in the 50 
percent range it was their measures of backing for bush that 
varied from a low of 36 percent in the nbcjournal poll to a high 
of 45 percent in the business week survey 
a gallup poll released tuesday fell within that range with 49 
percent for dukakis 42 percent for bush two weeks ago it found 
dukakis up by 17 points 
analysts have said dukakis 17 or 18point advantage was a 
product of publicity from the democratic national convention which 
ended july 20 and was sure to fade particularly when the 
republicans stage their own convention next week 
some expressed surprise at the gallup polls suggestion that 
dukakis lost 10 points even before the republicans met 
particularly since there had been no momentous event to cause such 
a decline as recently as july 31aug 3 a cbs newsnew york times 
poll found dukakis maintaining his lead of 17 points 
but the new business week poll found a similar drop after 
putting dukakis ahead by 18 following the convention overall the 
three polls thursday gave a clear indication that dukakis 
postconvention bounce had peaked however they also indicated 
that support for bush was at least for the moment unsettled 
among other continuing problems for bush the nbcjournal poll 
found that the number of respondents rating him unfavorably 
remained stubbornly high while dukakis did far better on the 
favorableunfavorable scale 
dukakis was rated favorably by 54 percent unfavorably by 24 
percent for bush it was an even split 45 percent favorable 43 
percent unfavorable 
headtohead the nbcjournal poll found 50 percent support for 
dukakis to 36 percent for bush the cnnusa today poll put it at 
5240 and the business week poll had the race at 5145 
while dukakis lead in the cnnusa today survey was the largest 
that poll has found cnn and usa today did not poll during the peak 
of the dukakis surge their poll before the democratic convention 
found the race at 47 percent for bush to 44 percent for dukakis a 
dead heat because of the threepoint margin of error the next 
cnnusa today poll conducted during the last two days of the 
convention found dukakis ahead by 10 5040 
the new nbcjournal poll was conducted among 1730 registered 
voters the cnnusa today poll among 1283 registered voters and 
the business week poll among 1401 likely voters all had sampling 
errors of plus or minus three points

democrat michael dukakis went on the attack thursday saying if 
he wins the white house there will be tough management not 
wishful thinking and blank checks for national defense george 
bush said im not gonna tell a soul before next weeks 
republican convention who his running mate will be 
republicans labored in new orleans to construct a staunchly 
conservative platform crafted to bushs specifications complete 
with a prohibition against higher taxes and abortions 
weve built upon a constructive conservative platform we had 
in 1984 and then expanded it by including planks dealing with 
drugs aids and education said sen robert kasten of wisconsin 
cochairman of the drafting committee 
three new polls showed dukakis holding a lead over bush 
although by less than in the days following last months democratic 
national convention the margins ranged from 14 points in an nbc 
newswall street journal survey conducted aug 58 to 12 points in 
a cnnusa today poll conducted aug 58 to six points in a business 
week survey conducted aug 49 the last a statistical dead head 
because of the threepoint plusorminus margin of error 
dukakis led bush by 18 points in an nbc survey completed just 
after the democratic convention but gop strategists are counting 
on their convention beginning next week to give the vice president 
a corresponding boost 
slowly but surely the mammoth superdome was being prepared 
from the 10story blue curtains that formed a telegenic backdrop 
for the podium to the thousands of red white and blue balloons 
being inflated for next weeks celebration of bushs triumph 
in washington as in new orleans bush was letting the suspense 
build about his choice of a running mate 
there wont be any leaks of this one because im not gonna 
tell a soul and i havent so far bush said in a cbstv 
interview he said some stories on the subject are close to 
accurate and some of em are 180 degrees wrong 
bush also said he plays horseshoes and jogs to help relieve the 
pressure of preparing for his acceptance speech at next thursday 
nights convention session im no william jennings bryan and i 
think itll go ok he said in a reference to a renowned orator 
who electrified the democratic national convention with his 
speechmaking at the turn of the century but never won the white 
house 
private polls conducted for the vice president indicate that 
sen bob dole of kansas would give him more of a boost than any 
others in contention for the no 2 spot on the ticket but not 
enough to make much of a difference said one aide 
vendors next door to the superdome hawked lapel buttons pairing 
bush with a variety of running mates from likely contenders such 
as dole and rep jack kemp to the farfarfetched like oliver 
north 
bush and his wife barbara joined the president and first lady 
nancy reagan at the white house for lunch were going to talk 
about how to win the vice president said as he arrived 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said afterward that the 
vice president and president would stage a brief ceremony 
together at the belle chasse naval air station in new orleans next 
tuesday 
reagan had been scheduled to fly to new orleans on sunday speak 
to the convention monday night and then leave tuesday before bushs 
arrival 
the seemingly innocuous presidential and vice presidential 
comings and goings were fraught with political implications 
the bush campaign has relied all year on the vice presidents 
association with the president to bolster his campaign yet the 
vice presidents advisers also hope to use the convention to have 
bush come out of reagans political shadow and emerge as a strong 
leader in his own right 
dukakis campaigning in new york and new jersey to kick off a 
fivestate swing lauded reagan for sealing an arms control 
agreement with the soviet union but criticized the 
administrations military policy and pentagon contract scandals 
he also said wednesdays increase in the prime lending rate 
charged by major banks was regrettable but i think its what 
happens after eight years of borrowing and spending borrowing and 
spending 
my friends the test of a successful defense policy isnt how 
much money we spend its how much security we buy dukakis said 
in a speech at new york university and for the past eight years 
we havent gotten what weve gone into debt for 
we have to build strong military forces based on sound 
planning and tough management not wishful thinking and blank 
checks he said before heading off for ft dix nj where he 
squeezed off a few rifle rounds at a firing range and toured a 
c141 transport plane 
weve got to use those dollars to buy weapons that work he 
said and weve got to to manage those dollars to strengthen our 
military forces not to line the pockets of dishonest contractors 
and wheelerdealer consultants 
gov kay orr of nebraska said there was little prospect of a 
floor fight at the convention over the lengthy platform document 
despite grumbling from sen lowell weicker and other dissenters 
from some of the planks

republicans finished work on major chunks of 
their 1988 platform thursday crafting a document that toes the 
conservative line on major issue 
near the end of the day they recommended that the party support 
reopening a major tax loophole for independent oil and gas 
producers but they defeated a proposal calling for expansion of 
aids testing to bus drivers and other transportation workers 
the convention platform committee completed their version of the 
document save the defense and foreign policy sections matters that 
nebraska gov kay orr the committee chairman said would be 
wrapped up friday morning 
she said it was unlikely any minority planks would be pressed on 
the convention floor next tuesday 
the 106member platform committee after spirited debates late 
wednesday over aids and abortion turned to less controversial 
issues thursday such as urging schools to teach more geography and 
foreign languages 
but late thursday another bitter dispute over aids broke out 
porter davis of oklahoma proposed a plank calling for testing of 
transportation personnel for the deadly disease 
when you travel around new orleans you will take taxis and 
buses he said when you go home you will take planes and rely 
on pilots and mechanics 
this is overkill retorted rep guy molinari of new york 
my god we wont be able to get out of new orleans if we adopted 
this 
fellow delegates lets come to our senses why pick on 
these people said bill graham of north carolina 
the amendment was defeated without a formal vote tally 
earlier the committee added language supporting efforts to 
expand drug testing of transportation workers 
a potential fight over apartheid was averted as sen lowell p 
weicker jr of connecticut left town before the committee took up 
the foreign policy plank weicker who returned to washington to 
attend to senate business shelved plans to press an amendment 
calling upon the gop to back tough economic sanctions against south 
africa 
before leaving weicker got sen robert kasten of wisconsin 
cochairman of the committee to press for adoption of another 
weicker amendment backing a merger of the environmental protection 
agency and the national oceanographic and atmospheric 
administration but not as a cabinetlevel department of the 
enviornment as weicker originally sought 
the amendment was adopted later without dissent 
another approved amendment calls for reopening a major tax break 
for oil and gas producers currently intangible drilling costs 
can greatly reduce an independent producers taxes but the 
socalled alternative minimum tax can wipe out much of that 
benefit by forcing the producers to forego the deduction a 
change made in the 1986 tax law 
the platform plank calls for reversing that provision in effect 
reopening the loophole that was estimated in 1986 to cost the 
treasury up to 1 billion a year 
the change sponsored by rick montoya of new mexico was 
approved by a voice vote 
charles black a bush campaign liaison to the committee told 
reporters that the draft platform shows that george bush is 
running as a conservative running on the policies conservatives 
have promoted through ronald reagan over these eight years 
we have an opponent who is running from issues who has 
stipulated hes not running on issues but on competence or some 
kind of personal characteristics so its very important for george 
bush to have a platform that goes into detail on where we want to 
take the country black said 
the most hotly contested issue was wednesdays 5532 vote not to 
change a line in the antiabortion plank that declares we 
believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life 
which cannot be infringed 
marjorie bell chambers of los alamos nm who tried to strike 
the last four words said thursday she would not seek to gather the 
27 signatures needed to press a minority plank on that issue 
she said she did not want to cause problems for the bush 
campaign with a floor fight even though she said the language 
smacks of some fanaticism 
by voice the delegates on wednesday also rejected an amendment 
to allow medicaid funding of abortion in cases of rape or incest 
and they refused to expand an aids plank to endorse all the 
recommendations of a presidential commission 
black said bush has endorsed the commissions call for 
legislation to protect the rights of aids patients but not the 
entire report president reagan did not support the commissions 
call for new antidiscrimination legislation 
sen robert kasten of wisconsin cochairman of the platform 
committee said gop moderates got a chance to air their arguments 
and made a clear impact on the platform in such areas as 
committing the gop to work toward catastrophic health care for 
children a weicker proposal that passed 5330 wednesday after the 
senator assured delegates there would be no financial 
commitment 
on other issues kasten said they had clear opportunities and 
they were defeated like orr kasten said he does not expect any 
minority planks 
no one felt that their rights were trampled on kasten said 
the delegates approved an amendment urging local school 
districts to recognize the value of kindergarten and 
prekindergarten programs 
that language irked some conservative delegates 
bunny chambers of oklahoma city said we need to keep our 
children in the home with their mothers marylin shannon of 
salem ore said i cant imagine republicans wanting to saddle 
public schools with the day care business

a virus that has killed thousands of harbor 
seals in north sea coastal waters also is affecting gray seals 
swedish researchers said thursday 
an emaciated female gray seal at least 20 years old was found 
dead last sunday at sibbarp south of malmo on swedens southwest 
coast 
swedish experts said an autopsy showed the same lung damage as 
in the harbor seals they said another dead gray seal found later 
near ystad farther south has yet to be examined 
the pneumonia suffered by this animal which i judged had been 
dead about 24 hours is characteristic said dr anders bergman 
the uppsala veterinarian who performed the autopsy we still hold 
a hope however that various individuals of gray seals are more or 
less resistant 
it would seem to be the same type of virus if we get in a 
young one too i am afraid we have a new disaster on our hands 
there is an obvious risk it will also spread to the third species 
in our waters the ringed seal a similar gray seal case was 
found in denmark and researchers said material for comparison was 
being sent to sweden 
gray seals in the baltic sea and bothnian gulf are believed to 
number 10002000 but only a few remain in the south baltic 
because of increasing chemical pollution of the waters

president oscar arias of costa rica said 
thursday that he had spoken with my heart in my hand in asking 
cuban president fidel castro for help in bringing peace to central 
america 
arias winner of the nobel peace prize last year for his efforts 
to halt central americas violence met castro for 1 hours 
wednesday 
they were among seven latin american leaders in quito for the 
inauguration of president rodrigo borja a moderate leftist who 
pledged a nonaligned foreign policy secretary of state george p 
shultz represented the united states 
arias said he urged castro to use his influence with nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista leaders to persuade them to keep their promises 
for more freedom in nicaragua including releasing political 
prisoners and lifting censorship of the news media 
arias told a news conference that to achieve peace in central 
america the support and effort of many people are needed and 
fidel castro is one of them 
he said he told castro that castro had a very important role 
to play if we want to achieve peace in the region 
i have spoken to him with my heart in my hand because i 
believe that there are 27 million human beings in central america 
who desire and deserve to live in peace arias said 
in latin america the phrase heart in hand means to speak 
very sincerely to be very candid regardless of possible 
consequences 
arias said nothing concrete was achieved in the meeting he 
said he regretted not having more time to talk with the leader of 
communist cuba and hoped to be able to meet again with him soon 
except for castro and nicaraguas daniel ortega the visiting 
presidents returned home wednesday night or thursday 
ortega arrived thursday after borja renewed diplomatic ties 
between ecuador and nicaragua that were cut in 1985 by former

attorney general edwin meese on thursday 
criticized two of his former top aides who resigned their 
positions and offered embarassing congressional testimony about the 
outgoing attorney general 
meeses lawyers struck back at arnold i burns and william f 
weld in a 69page statement filed with the senate judiciary 
committee where both men testified july 26 
attorneys nathan lewin and james e rocap iii said their 
statement was issued on behalf of meese whose ethical conduct was 
investigated by independent counsel james mckay 
mckay concluded meese probably broke two tax laws and twice 
violated a federal conflictofinterest statute but he declined 
to prosecute the attorney general 
weld who resigned march 29 as chief of the criminal division 
told the committee that he resigned in protest after telling meese 
he had probably broken the law 
welds conclusion was shocking and wrong the rebuttal 
statement said because it was premised on statements containing 
distortions inaccuracies and material omissions that completely 
undermine his opinion 
and burns ranked second to meese as deputy attorney general 
testified he quit at the same time because of a deep malaise at 
the department he described meese as living in a world of alice 
in wonderland about his problems 
the rebuttal statement mainly addressed welds testimony that if 
meese were an ordinary citizen he probably would have been 
prosecuted for taking gratuities from his longtime friend e robert 
wallach 
the statement said mckay concluded that mr meese was telling 
the truth when he denied that any alleged benefits given to him by 
mr wallach were provided on account of any offiical actions 
mr weld neither heard the testimony nor read the grand jury 
transcript how can he in good faith assert publicly that there had 
been a criminal violation of federal law without considering the 
most direct and compelling evidence of mr meeses state of mind 
his own sworn testimony in answer to the prosecutors questions 
the statement said burns testimony about low department morale 
was fully and convincingly repudiated by the acting 
replacements for burns and weld and a third department official 
the three are harold christensen acting deputy attorney 
general francis a keating ii acting associate attorney general 
and edward sg dennis jr acting chief of the criminal division 
nothing of substance remains of mr burns testimony the 
statement said his alice in wonderland metaphor had a 12hour 
life it was broadcast on the evening and morning network news

a proposed settlement in a classaction lawsuit 
that contended audi 5000 sedans were defective and subject to 
sudden accelerationed was thrown out thursday by a judge 
the proposed settlement offered rebates of 300 to 2000 to 
390000 current or former owners who buy another audi under the 
settlement audi would acknowledge no liability 
it puts people in a position where they have to buy an audi to 
reap any benefit said cook county circuit judge thomas rakowski 
clearly its a settlement that i couldnt live with 
rakowski recommended that both sides try to negotiate another 
settlement and he set another hearing for aug 31 officials said 
rakowskis action vacates an earlier order by another judge who 
gave preliminary approval to the settlement before removing himself 
from the case due to a conflict of interest 
the case stems from a 1987 classaction lawsuit filed by a group 
of audi owners alleging the audi 5000s with automatic transmissions 
were defective because of sudden acceleration problems the 
settlement would have applied to owners of audi 5000s built between 
1978 and 1986 
thursdays ruling was praised by attorney stephen nassau who 
represents the washingtonbased audi victims network a group of 
audi owners who contend their cars had sudden acceleration 
problems the group opposed the settlement 
joseph bennett national spokesman for audi of america inc 
based in troy mich said the automaker was disappointed by 
rakowskis decision 
were disappointed because better than 99 percent of the audi 
owners out there apparently felt that the settlement was quite 
fair said bennett referring to the response to settlement 
notices sent to audi owners 
bennett said audi had not decided whether to seek another 
settlement or let the lawsuit go to trial 
circuit judge harold siegan had given preliminary approval to 
the settlement but removed himself in july because of his 
friendship with an attorney in the case 
siegan said he hadnt taken any evidence and said he thought 
that his order should be vacated by the new judge according to a 
motion filed by nassau 
the center for auto safety contends that at least 1650 
accidents causing 402 injuries and five deaths have been linked 
to acceleration surges when an audi 5000 was shifted from into gear 
from park

an oil barge struck a sunken barge early 
thursday spilling more than 2000 gallons of oil into the water 
off the mississippi coast before the leak was stopped officials 
said 
authorities were watching the movement of a twomile oil slick 
threatening barrier island beaches 
the slick is tending to break up and it may not impact the 
islands or the mississippi coastline said eleana turner of the 
mississippi bureau of pollution control the sun is evaporating a 
lot of the oil so things are looking pretty good 
coast guard petty officer bob morehead said late thursday that 
inspections showed the oil slick to be very light crude 
right now based on the consistency of the oil and the 
resources available things are pretty much under control 
morehead said if things stay the same it looks like its going 
to reach the islands 
cmdr donald stansell of the coast guards mobile ala office 
said an estimated 2000 gallons of oil had spilled during the first 
few hours after the barge was ruptured about 425 am thursday 
equipment was dispatched to remove as much oil as possible from 
the water officials fear the slick could reach the popular beaches 
of cat or ship islands about 10 miles offshore said coast guard 
capt william loefstedt 
we hope to prevent damage if possible he said but things 
change if the wind comes up and the direction of the oil slick 
changes 
the barge was owned by tenntom towing of mobile ala and was 
being towed to a refinery in louisiana said stansell stansell 
said the amount of oil spilled so far classified the accident as 
relatively minor 
the accident occurred when the barge scraped over the top of a 
barge laden with scrap iron that had sunk earlier in the week when 
tropical storm beryl hit loefstedt said the accident occurred 
near the gulfport ship channel between the coast and the barrier 
islands 
the damaged tanks on the oil barge held 8600 barrels of oil or 
more than 270900 gallons 
thursday afternoon turner said the oil barge had been lifted 
off the submerged barge without any significant increase in the 
amount of leaking crude

thousands of demonstrators lugged 
crosses and picket signs to the gates of universal studios on 
thursday to protest the last temptation of christ on the eve of 
the films release 
in washington the conservative religious lobby moral majority 
condemned the martin scorsesedirected film as an utter 
blasphemy and pledged a boycott of universal the movies 
distributor and related companies 
the movie which opens friday in seven us cities and toronto 
stars willem dafoe barbara hershey and harvey keitel based on the 
1955 novel by nikos kazantzakis it differs with the biblical 
account of jesus life 
the fundamentalists fury has focused on scorseses portrayal of 
jesus as an uncertain ambivalent savior in a hallucinatory dream 
sequence while dying on the cross scorseses christ imagines 
abandoning his divinity to live as an ordinary mortal and 
fantasizes about sex with mary magdalene 
scorsese has defended his film saying it is intended as a 
thoughtprovoking work of art derived from a novel that focuses on 
the humanity of jesus and the worldly temptations he faced 
in london a roman catholic official called thursday for viewers 
to boycott the film 
people ought to show a bit of restraint and not give in to 
curiosity said nicholas coote assistant general secretary of 
the catholic bishops of england and wales can we just for once 
not wallow in bad taste 
a spokesman for the church of england john miles said the 
churchs board of social responsibility will want to see the film 
but until it did the church could not comment 
police said a crowd of 25000 joined the hollywood protest 
coordinated by the american family association trinity broadcast 
network and other conservative christians it caused huge traffic 
jams around universal studios 
joyce walker 34 said she came to the demonstration at the 
direction of the ptl television ministry i may go see the 
movie ms walker said im still curious but i dont like the 
sex scenes with jesus 
among participants in the noon demonstration were rev donald 
wildmon director of the american family association of tupelo 
miss and bill bright president of the campus crusade for christ 
in arrowhead springs calif 
we have come to tell this company that although you may not 
respect our religion you will respect us in the marketplace 
wildmon told the crowd 
bright and wildmon have emerged as prominent critics of the 
film bright has offered to raise 10 million to buy and burn the 
film and wildmon has urged a nationwide boycott of mca 
moral majority president jerry c nims said in a statement from 
his washington office that he was calling for a nationwide boycott 
of universal pictures and other subsidiaries of mca inc 
universals parent company 
regardless of what this movie claims to be the last 
temptation of christ appears to be utter blasphemy nims said in 
a letter to mca chairman lew wasserman accusing mca and its 
officials of privately and personally profiting from the 
blaspheming of our saviour 
nims said the boycott also would apply to xerox corp and pepsi 
co because some members of their boards of directors also serve on 
mcas board nims spokesman jake hansen said the moral majority 
leader has not seen the movie 
conservative reps william e dannemeyer rcalif robert k 
dornan rcalif and clyde holloway rla added their 
denunciations late wednesday in congress calling the movie 
scurrilous and blasphemous 
while it has been difficult to assess the economic effect of the 
mca boycott several theater chains have decided against showing 
the film including the huge general cinema theaters based in 
buffalo ny 
the last temptation of christ is scheduled to open to the 
public friday in los angeles chicago washington san francisco

his top priority he promised a vigorous battle against organized 
crime public corruption and whitecollar crime while safeguarding 
civil liberties

1985 it was the third increase in the rate so far this year and 
the second in a month 
because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixedand 
adjustablerate loans the increase is likely to pinch the 
pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise 
in recent months

convention 
thanks to an electionlaw provision that steers some federal 
funding through the political parties bushs campaign wont have 
to bear the main costs of the convention 
its not that bush didnt raise much money he topped his 
rivals all along but he ran into a situation in which he had to 
pinch pennies so he could spend money for his campaign operation at 
the convention without exceeding the 23 million limit for

modern pioneers of bison genetics are 
trying to bring back large numbers of the burly beasts as a source 
of lowcholesterol meat 
using cattle as surrogate mothers a cheyennebased group of 
scientists and ranchers plans to breed bison as the animal of the 
future for an increasingly healthconscious society 
we see there is nowhere near the number of bison for the 
demand said paul butler manager of the group livestock 
research and innovation in order to make any type of dramatic 
increase youve got to use the new techniques 
bison were on the brink of extinction at the end of the last 
century when hidehunters of the great slaughter reduced herds of 
millions to fewer than 300 now bison are multiplying slowly 
numbering 80000 to 100000 according to the denverbased american 
buffalo association 
the animals also are arousing appetites in the meat market 
basically the meats better butler said referring to 
positive results in recent taste tests its got more protein and 
less fat and yet its tender and flavorful 
lri wants to capitalize by getting cattle to give birth to bison 
and nurse the calves until they reach the age of slaughter with 
help from the university of wyoming researchers have been 
artificially inseminating female bisons treated with hormones 
fertilized embryos are flushed out of the bisons and implanted in 
cattle allowing bison cows to produce more embryos without waiting 
to give birth themselves 
so far cows have rejected all implanted bison embryos but the 
confidence of embryo transfer experts and interest expressed by the 
wyoming department of agriculture have fueled optimism 
weve got to perfect the techniques butler said there 
are certain adjustments we have to make when working with bisons 
they are a big strong wild animal theyre not easy to handle 
colorado state university professor george seidel a 
reproductive physiologist who pioneered embryo transfer techniques 
with horses cows sheep and rabbits does not doubt the methods 
will work with bison 
the technique is not too different from the testtube baby 
seidel said i would expect it would work 
similarly university of wyoming animal science professor gary 
moss who is guiding the lri project said he is sure it can be 
done 
butler has been talking with buyers in new zealand and 
australia besides bison he envisions selling frozen bison embryos 
guaranteed to grow for about 10000 each 
not everyone is so enthusiastic 
embryo transfer proponent david mackenzie a lousiana state 
professor of plant pathology cautioned weve got to get smarter 
about how we do this 
and activist jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on 
economic trends warned in an appearance in wyoming that mixing 
breeds in hightechnology projects can lead to an undesirable 
homogenization of species 
nonetheless a university of wyoming marketing study suggested 
further uses of the bison 
with bison you can sell everything from the head to the 
tail researchers wrote bison byproducts include heads 
robes skulls leather goods wood and jewelry made from their 
bones and horns 
bison ranchers are quick to point out the profit potential of an 
enterprise that could dramatically increase the number of the 
species 
theres an incredible market for it said john flocchini 
who manages a herd of about 2500 buffalo on the durham ranch near 
gillette i wish we had about five or six times the number of 
animals that we have 
the durham ranch sells bison meat in california where flocchini 
found theres just way more demand than there is supply 
moreover flocchini and others believe few animals are more 
suitable than bison for wyoming where harsh weather and predators 
pose problems for cattle ranchers 
a recent study sponsored by the canadian wildlife service found 
that bison use nutrients in poor feed grain more efficiently than 
cattle the study concluded that bison ranching could be an 
alternative to cattle in areas of poor forage and severe winters 
despite these bright economic prospects flocchini said he would 
be reluctant to dive into bison genetics 
the way things are right now were happy with the profit 
margin that we are making flocchini said 
i have a hard time messing with mother nature the buffalo is 
an animal thats already been too screwed up by human 
intervention

when knock airport opened three years ago 
in a misty peat bog critics called it an irish joke 
today the airport that was the dream of a roman catholic parish 
priest is making a small profit confounding economists government 
officials and most everyone else who predicted its speedy demise 
success is due mainly to a fledgling independent irish airline 
ryanair which started using the airport in one of the poorest and 
most isolated areas of western ireland when no other carrier was 
interested 
we plan to carry more than 100000 passengers through knock 
this year said louise henahan spokeswoman for the 3yearold 
airline it is definitely not a white elephant 
the airport owes its existence to the late monsignor james 
horan who was administrator of the knock shrine the most 
important catholic shrine in ireland which attracts more than a 
million visitors a year 
horan saw how an airport had benefitted lourdes frances famous 
shrine and believed one would also transform economically 
depressed county mayo where unemployment is nearly 50 percent in 
some areas 
he persuaded the government to give the airport 97 million 
irish pounds 68 million and raised an additional 25 million 
pounds 176 million by traveling the world appealing to irishmen 
abroad and organizing collections at home 
for horan who died in august 1986 the first flight from the 
airport on oct 25 1985 was the second miracle of knock 
the first is in church records a occurring in 1879 when 15 
people reported seeing an apparation of the virgin mary on the 
church of st john the baptist in knock now the centerpiece of the 
shrine 
as horan pressed ahead criticism grew 
irelands communications minister jim mitchell called knock 
airport an illadvised project far distant from any sizable 
town high on a foggy and boggy hill 
economists predicted big losses and irish singer christy moore 
spoofed horans business acumen with a lyric from fatima to 
bethlehem from lourdes to kiltinagh theres never been a miracle 
like the airport up at knock 
the airport 604 feet above sea level on a peat bog plateau 
with an 8100foot runway capable of handling jumbo jets 
officially opened in may 1986 
but nobody wanted to use it and the staff was put on a weekon 
weekoff schedule 
seamus monaghan the airport chairman recalled how horan wasnt 
worried and put his faith in divine intervention 
sure enough 10 days later we had a letter of application from 
ryanair said monaghan 
ryanair started regular flights from knock in december 1986 and 
carried 47000 passengers in 1987 mainly local people who worked 
in britain 
jim ryan the airport companys secretary said ryanair now 
operates 44 to 46 flights weekly mainly from britain and expects 
to carry 110000 to 120000 passengers through knock this year the 
airport will also handle 10000 to 20000 charter flight passengers 
in 1988 he said 
thats still far fewer than the 250000 passengers horan hoped 
the airport would handle in its first year 
but ryan who would not disclose the figures said knock went 
into the black after its first six months of this year 
the big ambition for knock is to get direct flights from the 
united states which now land at shannon airport 
bridget watton 46 an irish computer operator working in 
britain has used the service since it opened to visit her parents 
on achill island off irelands west coast 
its a godsend to the west of ireland ms watton said on 
recent flight from luton airport near london before it took a 
day by boat and train to get to achill now i can get home in six 
hours 
desmond obrien who runs the dunnamara guest house in luna 
point on the west coast said business is brisk with mayo emigrants 
returning more often from england for weddings funeral and 
holidays 
about 40 percent of the passengers at knock airport are 
tourists usually discovering the west of ireland for the first 
time 
although horan didnt live to see knock airport make any 
significant impact the airports new name is a lasting tribute to 
his vision connaught horan international airport

once a sleeping haven for retirees in 
british colonial times bangalore today is indias version of 
silicon valley 
it manufactures about onethird of the total electronics output 
of the country and 80 percent of its professional electronics 
equipment 
r murali who quit a government job 15 years ago to set up a 
successful television component factory said bangalores 
advantages were obvious 
its a lovely city and i like the fact that its dustfree 
for many years after indias independence from britain in 1947 
bangalore was mainly a pensioners paradise known for moderate 
weather and for its lakes parks and britishstyle clubs 
situated in southern india about 200 miles inland from madras on 
the bay of bengal bangalore had one of the countrys largest 
british military populations and was the only territory directly 
ruled by london over the head of the british viceroy in india 
its temperate climate the temperature ranges from 68 to 80 
most of the year makes the city ideal but for makers of high 
technology products 
but a variety of other factors combined to make bangalore an 
upscale metropolis and one of the 10 fastest growing cities in the 
world 
industrialization in bangalore started in the early 1970s 
said vinod vyasulu a professor at bangalores institute of 
management it was brought about by the cheapest electricity 
rates in the country a readymade transport infrastructure and 
cheap skilled labor 
the number of industries in the city has risen from about 600 in 
1975 to about 2000 according to tm shirur a state government 
official at least half of them are connected with hightechnology 
manufacture he said 
labor is perhaps the most important factor for industrialists 
setting up in bangalore the citys work force largely rejected 
labor unions and strikes are rare 
michael lee an urban affairs specialist with the us agency 
for international development said bangalore is indias premier 
science city because of the availability of a pool of brains 
scientific talent is plentiful because bangalore is the home of 
the indian institute of science and the indian institute of 
management both regarded as premier schools for advanced study 
lee said 
us aid is scheduled to put up 12 million to open a center for 
technological development in bangalore it will organize training 
programs for workers and provide support services to industry 
the us company texas instruments has set up a plant and joint 
venture factories with indian firms have been formed by motorola of 
illinois and pacific intelidata of california 
indias government also has set up stateowned factories making 
electronics gear aircraft watches and telecommunication equipment 
lee compared bangalores attractions to those that drew 
electronics manufacturers to silicon valley in califonia areas in 
the us southwest and route 128 around boston 
but bangalores growth also has brought problems the population 
has risen by 76 percent over the past decade and is now estimated 
at 4 million 
residents complain that services have failed to keep pace and 
that water electricity and transport systems fall short of demand 
longtime citizens complain that bangalore is no longer the 
garden city it once was some insist the temperature is higher 
robbing bangalore of one of its attractions 
when i entered bangalore during my college vacations in the 
early 60s i used to pull on a small sweater says vijay padaki 
a teacher now based in the city now i dont use my woolens any 
more 
but a study of bangalores climate shows no appreciable change 
in air temperatures since 1870 the study concedes however that 
urbanization might have changed the microclimate which is not 
reflected in recorded temperatures 
the city looks more westernized than others in india jeans and 
tshirts are in far greater evidence than ethnic wear 
pubs are something new bangalore is the only city in india to 
have draft beer and the pubs are enormously successful india 
today magazine reported recently that city pubs sold about 35000 
mugs of beer on weekdays and double that on weekends and holidays 
the city is also home to one of the largest bookshops in india 
the gangarams book bureau which stocks 400000 english titles and 
notches up sales of 50000 rupees 3850 a day 
we get buyers from all over india said atma ram one of the 
stores two proprietors 
the cosmopolitan nature and tastes of bangalore also make it an 
ideal market to test new products new brands of shampoos soaps 
and tea are now routinely marketed in bangalore before going on 
sale in the rest of india

candice bergen is a glamorous film actress 
married to esteemed french film director louis malle they have a 
young daughter and an elegant lifestyle divided between new york 
and paris 
nevertheless bergen this fall will undertake the relative 
drudgery of starring in a weekly comedy on cbs murphy brown 
bergan plays the title character a harddriving television 
reporter who has gone a few rounds with alcohol and nicotine 
addiction at the betty ford clinic and just been sent back to her 
highstress world as a correspondent on the network newsmagazine 
fyi 
i wasnt quite ready to do a television series but then there 
were whispers about this pilot script bergen told a group of tv 
critics everybody was sort of grabbing it and there were little 
fingernail marks all over it and they said you know theres this 
pilot script thats as if its been written for you 
bergen was skeptical but finally read the script by diane 
english during a boring plane trip 
i got up and it was the first time i ever made a phone call 
from an airplane bergen said i was then so panicstricken 
that i might have lost the script that id waited too long and so 
i called my agent and said what do i have to do 
i hadnt read a feature script that was as good as this in a 
long time and i hadnt read a character that i thought was any 
better for me than this maybe ever i just was so excited at the 
possibility of doing this kind of work and doing comedy work 
the idea of bergen doing comedy will not surprise anyone who saw 
her in starting over or on saturday night live and it 
certainly comes as no surprise to anyone who has seen the pilot of 
murphy brown 
in that episode murphy has just gotten out of the clinic and 
everybody is taking odds as to whether shell be her old 
toughreporter self without the aid of outside stimuli murphy 
herself isnt certain 
her first hurdle is an interview with a young man whose alleged 
affair with a female politician caused a scandal 
murphy also has a home life so to speak her companions are a 
house painterinresidence robert pastorelli who has begun a 
mural on her kitchen ceiling and a collection of motown records to 
which she caterwauls a skill bergen perfected in starting over 
i think its hard to sing badly the first time and then once 
you kind of break the bad singing barrier its like youre 
supersonic bergen said 
costarring with bergen are grant shaud as the new executive 
producer of fyi who looks 14 charles kimbrough plays a 
deadpan fellow correspondent joe regalbuto is a crazed 
investigative reporter and faith ford plays a former beauty queen 
more interested in reliving past triumphs than uncovering new 
stories 
because of the writers strike the premiere will likely not 
reach the air until novermber said english she and her husband 
joel shukovsky are coexecutive producers of the series english 
produced my sister sam and previously foley square two 
critically praised series that failed because of poor time periods 
bergen said she was always sort of a journalism junkie 
right out of college the daughter of ventriloquist edgar bergen 
auditioned for a spot on cbs 60 minutes she didnt get the 
job but years later did fill in as a cohost on nbcs today 
show so murphys world is not completely alien to her 
bergen says comedy seems to be a matter of genetic encoding 
actually i have a shriner aspect of my personality which is 
sort of a whoopee cushion all those things she said i do 
have that side which is probably from my father not to malign 
the shriners you understand they do fine work but its sort of 
a broader more of a vaudevillian sense of humor 
its very true english agreed thats the surprising 
thing about getting to know candice the first thing she said to us 
was ill do anything for a laugh and i believe her

setting a world record 
but he has mixed feelings about the great postcard flood and 
prefers swimming and tennis to collecting them now that his cancer 
is in remission for mario and his family its been the story of a 
good cause waylaid somewhere in the mail 
with some wellwishers from around the world thinking he was 
someone else and others accusing him of a hoax the cards cheered 
mario but pained him too for these and other reasons marios 
entry will be the first and last for the guinness book of records 
in postcard collecting 
i thought i was only going to get 48000 said mario a 
cheerful curlyhaired boy who suffered more than two years of 
grueling treatment for a malignant tumor in the pelvis 
but they kept coming one day i had 60 sacks he said at his 
home near the central england city of birmingham 
his father david morby sorted cards from early afternoon to 1 
or 2 am every day for months and estimates they received 2 
million his mother anna said it took over their lives and 
those of their other two children dassos 17 and elena 8 
the saga began last september when the birmingham childrens 
hospital where mario was treated asked him to take over the 
campaign another boy had started its aim was to set a record and 
raise money for the hospital 
so far the family has raised 1700 pounds 2800 through 
sales at an auction house which has taken most of the cards many 
were picture postcards from around the world purchasers of the 
cards mainly were people who collect postcards as others collect 
stamps 
some of the cards mario received were considered valuable his 
mother said a few dated back to the 18th century but mario has 
kept only three 
postcards are still trickling in but the post office now 
diverts them to a local cancer fundraising group 
worse than the numbers were the distortions small ads placed 
locally by the family were spread by others and the further afield 
the appeals went the more skewed the message became 
they started coming with my dads name says mario they 
thought i was a 7yearold boy named david they were saying god 
bless im sorry to hear youre dying 
sometimes they sent things too but they were all things for 
7yearolds said mario whose mother says her son didnt know 
that cancer could kill him until he read the cards 
if i thought it was going to get out of hand the way it did 
i wouldnt have done it said marios father who quit his job as 
a stonemason to spend time with his son when he became ill and only 
recently found other work cooking chickens for retail sale 
but he got his name in the guinness book and we raised money 
for the hospital which is something i wanted to do they saved his 
life he said 
marios mother said the cards helped occupy mario during the 
long days when he was too ill to attend school 
mario now back at school full time said sometimes when i 
was bored or sick id sort out the postcards 
not all were pleasant said mrs morby some people mixed up 
mario with a fictional 8yearold cancerstricken scottish boy 
buddy who was at the center of a fiveyear hoax 
a mystery hoaxer had circulated appeals in 1982 saying buddys 
last wish was to get a record number of postcards to win a place in 
the guinness book of records and some 10 million people including 
president reagan responded 
because it was a hoax guinness did not count that collection as 
a record 
as a result of that hoax mario received letters accusing him of 
being the perpetrator 
sometimes we had people calling us con men he said 
guinness will list mario as having received 1265000 cards 
which is where it stopped its count said spokeswoman anna 
nicholas however the buddy hoax and other factors led guinness to 
decide to halt the category 
we do feel sometimes it can generate hoaxes and complications 
for families like mario morbys she said for now though the 
whole thing is over so everyone is smiling

they pose as a happy family on vacation but stuff 
their suitcases with marijuana others blithely sail into port with 
a hold full of liquid hashish or dissolve their illicit cargo in 
windshield wiper fluid 
whether the methods are obvious or ingenious most drug 
smugglers in canada are evading detection say law enforcement 
agencies 
only a fraction of the 90 million travelers who entered canada 
last year were checked for narcotics and few drug shipments were 
intercepted said arthur lewis head of enforcement at canada 
customs 
ive seen estimates as low as 5 percent he said were 
not naive enough to think were going to stop it 
vast empty spaces and a 5335mile border with the united states 
make canada an easy touch for drug traffic in both directions 
theyre trying to move further and further north because of 
law enforcement pressure in florida and so little patrol 
capability here said lewis 
authorities rule out a usstyle zero tolerance blitz at 
the border because of concern for constitutional rights 
i dont think our country would tolerate it said detective 
inspector gerry hawke of ontario provincial police 
canadian enforcers did seize 40 tons of illicit drugs last year 
and nab more than 10000 people for drug offenses customs agents 
expect to confiscate drugs worth 330 million this year a tenfold 
increase since 1982 
largevolume traffickers use sealed ship containers and trailer 
trucks knowing that police cannot possibly check them all 
trailers are lined up at all the bridges from the us and we 
know a fair amount of drugs are coming in this way but we cant 
ask them all to unload said hawke 
drugs were also found in a babys diapers jade figurines a 
piano the tubing of a luggage cart scuba tanks sacks of coffee 
in the lining of running shoes car windshield wiper fluid and a 
trucks hydraulic system officers said one hardened cocaine 
solution was disguised as a shipment of ponchos 
a trawler was seized at vancouver in british columbia with eight 
tons of marijuana from thailand and a woman and her son were 
jailed for attempting to import 16 million worth of columbian 
cocaine in 35ounce packages sent registered mail 
swallowers and stuffers concealing drugs on their person are 
the bane of airport security said inspector neil pouliot of the 
royal canadian mounted police a chief method is to swallow condoms 
filled with cocaine 
thorough body searches are increasing there is no moral code 
when youre dealing with narcotics everything is fair game said 
customs inspector michael crichton 
us customs officers at niagara falls found 75 million worth 
of heroin in the false bottom of a suitcase two vietnameseborn 
couriers were taking to new york police in regina in saskatchewan 
discovered a basement lined with aluminum foil where a forest of 
marijuana was growing hydroponically under 5000 watt lightbulbs 
and an automatic watering system 
neither canada customs nor the mounted police even attempt to 
patrol the great lakes an open invitation to drug merchants we 
rely on inside information so we can be there to meet them said 
lewis 
his problem is that customs has just 197 drug officers 
nationwide aided by 32 dog teams sniffing baggage and cargo at 
ports of entry the mounties deploy 1100 drug enforcers including 
27 liaison officers at canadian embassies from thailand to jamaica 
and one each in miami fla new york and los angeles 
the countrys combined antinarcotics force of 1500 
concentrates on suppliers not users even with major busts street 
prices declined last year as the flow continued 
the mounties estimate the drug trade in canada is now worth 83 
billion a year while their budget to combat the scourge is less 
than 83 million 
the market is expanding theres no doubt about that said 
the mounties assistant commissioner marcel coutu we could do a 
better job if we had more money and more people 
drug offenses also rose 9 percent last year montreal police say 
half the crime in the city is now drugrelated marijuana remains 
the most popular drug while canada has about 500000 cocaine users 
compared to an estimated 12 million in the united states crack 
use is not widespread 
soviet customs agents helped with the best tip of the year they 
told the mounties that a drug ring planned to ship 11277 pounds of 
hashish from kabul afghanistan through leningrad to montreal the 
hash was seized on arrival and three canadians are now behind bars 
ontario police hope a proposed new law will enable them to 
freeze the proceeds of drug trafficking when an arrest is made 
unlike us legislation however the seized assets would not be 
earmarked to fight drugs 
the italian mafia chinese triads iranian pakistani and other 
criminal organizations control the heroin market while colombian 
crime families are flooding canada with cocaine according to the 
mounted police other drugs are imported by vietnamese gangs in 
vancouver motorcycle gangs such as the hells angels and satans 
choice and traffickers from jamaica and lebanon 
the foot soldiers in trafficking or mules are ordinary 
people recruited for cash as a jamaican immigrant in toronto 
recently disclosed 
she told the toronto star she earned 16600 bringing three 
suitcases stuffed with 150 pounds of marijuana back from kingston 
she sailed through customs by traveling with her husband and three 
young sons and pretending to be vacationers 
the whole scam is so easy its ridiculous the 35yearold 
woman said

with an actors grace and a politicians 
flair president reagans farewell to the party he returned to the 
white house is designed to avoid stealing the show from the new 
standardbearer george bush 
reagan himself insisted on delivering his speech to the 
republican national convention on monday instead of later in the 
week where it might draw attention from bush officials say 
if the two men appear together in new orleans this week it will 
only be briefly 
this is his reagans swan song the convention will be awash 
with nostalgia says rep guy vander jagt head of the national 
republican congressional committee but it has to end on a note 
of looking to the future sending off the man we hope will be 
president for the next eight years 
it will be an emotional time for the man who appeared in several 
motion pictures hosted death valley days and ge theater 
and burst onto the national scene during the 1964 convention that 
nominated sen barry goldwater of arizona for president 
reagan who led the gop to the white house in 1980 in a bitter 
defeat for president jimmy carter faces a bittersweet transition 
as a 77yearold president with little beyond bushs election on 
his remaining agenda in retirement he plans to speak for repeal 
of the 22nd amendment limiting presidents to two terms 
the white house gave reagan the leading role he rarely got as a 
hollywood actor and hes relished this attention but a 
performers feel for stage positioning convinced reagan that bush 
must stand without him for thursdays climatic convention moments 
party and campaign officials say 
so the gop passed up the chance to have the nation see bush 
hoist his arms in a unity show with reagan however presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said tentative plans call for reagan and 
bush to meet on tuesday at belle chase naval air station as reagan 
is leaving the convention city and bush is arriving 
republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf talking of reagans 
monday night speech said i think were going to see a very 
proud man proud of the accomplishments of the last seven years 
ronald reagan at his age looks as good if not better than he 
did when he came into office fahrenkopf said ronald reagan is 
an individual who knows who he is and is comfortable with who he 
is thats why in many ways ronald reagan doesnt have an ego 
problem 
a source who participated in talks about the presidential role 
in new orleans discussing a conversation on grounds of anonymity 
said reagan at one point this spring argued forcefully about which 
day he would speak 
initially it was penciled in that he would do the speech on 
tuesday night this source said but he realizes that wherever 
he goes hes the focus of media attention this was his decision 
he said i dont want to do it tuesday i want to do it monday 
gov thomas keans keynote address was thus put off until 
tuesday as party strategists sought to make reagans valedictory 
and bushs coming out party politically compatible and graceful 
mitchell daniels white house political adviser in earlier 
reagan years said no one is more conscious of the need for this 
to be a george bush convention than ronald reagan 
hell be very comfortable with the balance that has been 
struck said daniels a hudson institute scholar whos going to 
the convention as a delegate from indiana a lesser man would 
have insisted on a bigger share of the limelight 
said vander jagt rmich the challenge is to make hello 
to george bush as exciting as goodbye to ronald reagan 
from a variety of republican sources declining to be named 
publicly the reagan itinerary in new orleans will go like this 
the president and his wife nancy will arrive on sunday have 
dinner with several members of the family and renew some political 
acquaintances on monday mrs reagan will be the guest of honor at 
a luncheon being organized by the presidents daughter maureen 
reagan on monday night former sen paul laxalt rnev will 
deliver a testimonial to his longtime friend mrs reagan will 
precede her husband on the podium speaking briefly to the 2277 
convention delegates 
after that there will be a film presentation on the reagan 
presidency the president will arrive on the podium while delegates 
are watching the film in darkness to await his reception when the 
lights go back on 
hell address a fundraising breakfast away from the convention 
hotel tuesday morning and then head to his vacation ranch in the 
santa ynez mountains of california 
reagan who reminded the 1984 dallas convention it was the 
last time he would address such a gathering as a candidate has 
said people should be able to elect a president as often as they 
wish 
but he also has said he was never interested in a seeking a 
third term 
james david barber a duke university presidential scholar said 
the mood at the new orleans convention will likely be cheerful but 
also nostalgic 
nancys counsel to him reagan will be that this is the 
last major speech that hell make in a power situation and 
therefore it should be the best barber speculated he said that 
mrs reagan seems to have a fundamental concern with how 
history will judge her husband 
therell be a lot of cheers a lot of tears when reagan 
speaks said donald devine a former head of the office of 
personnel management who now runs citizens for america a 
selfstyled grassroots reagan organization 
im sure whats going on in their mind is they dont want 
ronald reagan to steal the scene and thats a legitimate 
consideration devine said i think at first the president was 
a little bit hesitant about warmly embracing bushs candidacy 
but i have do doubt that they are working together now

they could scarcely be more different one 
with neatly trimmed hair and beard and a boys figure 
quietspoken thoughtful the other with the unkempt look of a 
struggling artist an impetuous man with a loud laugh and hearty 
appetites as evidenced by his belly 
they are george lucas and francis coppola respectively along 
with steven spielberg they are the titans of american film in the 
postmajor studio era despite their outward differences lucas 
42 and coppola 49 have been friends and often partners for two 
decades after meeting in film school in the late 1960s 
both conduct their operations outside of hollywood in the san 
francisco bay area and both have created landmark films lucas 
with the star wars trilogy coppola with the godfather 
epics 
now lucas has produced and coppola has directed tucker the 
man and his dream which paramount released this weekend the 24 
million saga starring jeff bridges in the title role is a true 
story that obviously appealed to both filmmakers a gifted 
entrepreneur challenges the establishment he was preston tucker 
whose postwar attempt to market an innovative car ended in failure 
partly because of pressure from the big three automakers ford 
general motors and chrysler 
coppola had mulled the tucker idea over the years but always was 
sidetracked with other projects at one point he even considered 
doing it as a musical 
tucker is not the first collaboration between lucas and 
coppola lucas worked as coppolas assistant on the rain people 
in 1969 which was filmed on a fivemonth trip across the united 
states coppolas zoetrope company produced lucas science fiction 
thx 1138 in 1970 which was not a success 
lucas was unable to find a studio for american graffiti in 
1973 then coppola hit big with the godfather universal agree 
to back graffiti if coppola would produce over the years they 
have combined on other projects including akira kurosawas 
kagemusha and disneylands captain eo 
coppola and lucas recently talked about their collaboration with 
the associated press here are highlights from that interview 
q when did you first become intrigued with the preston tucker 
saga 
coppola it was a project i brought with me from college ucla 
i first learned about it by being one of the kids in those crowds 
looking at the car depicted in the movie my dad took me to see 
it and i was very disheartened when i heard the car wasnt going 
to come out i couldnt understand it i said its a good car 
why wont they let him make it my father said oh they wont 
let him buy steel 
lucas francis has talked to me about it over the years then 
one time we were talking about movies and i told him tucker 
could really be great eventually he called and asked if i would 
be interested in producing it i said yes absolutely 
we started on the screenplay with arnold schulman once we got a 
script finished i started taking it to the studios everybody 
turned it down it didnt fit into one of their little pigeonholes 
of what they thought commercial movies were if it doesnt fit one 
of those little slots they dont know what to do with it that 
combined with the expense 
if that had been a 15 million movie they would have said we 
dont understand this movie but well do it anyway because big 
names are connected with it we said wed love to make it for 15 
million but we cant we have cars and factories and period 
costumes and crowd scenes add that up and you have a big budget 
q how many tuckers do you own 
coppola i have two and he has two my deal with the company 
was that they could have my cars free of charge if they fixed them 
up made them beautiful and they did 
lucas my deal was that we had all those cars there and i was 
able to buy two i had to have as many as francis did 
q tucker has a number of directorial touches such as 
angled shots and having both sides of a telephone conversation on 
the screen at the same time how did you arrive at the style 
coppola i thought in the spirit of the car which was a kind of 
rube goldberg contraption that the movie ought to have the same 
flavor why make a movie about an innovative car unless you can do 
those things in movie terms 
since tucker was traveling a lot i knew there would be a lot of 
phone scenes normally you shoot phone scenes separately i 
thought the actors would do better playing with each other such 
devices are all in the wonderful studio tradition as you know 
ive always been a fan of the hollywood studio tradition and want 
to see it continue im always sad when i hear they have sold a 
studio or dismantled a studio they are assets that should be 
preserved 
q both of you have worked outside the mainstream of the film 
industry is there a parallel between your own careers and tuckers 
lucas i think one of the main themes of the movie is that 
regardless whether a project succeeds or fails the ideas that you 
bring to it can live on if you can keep your creative spirit 
alive thats what is really important you must persevere over 
adversity even if the projects youre working on dont work out 
you have to go on and do it again 
thats one of the main themes in the film and one of the main 
themes for us personally weve had to go through it time and time 
again in order to get innovative ideas into movies every time we 
get an idea like tucker theyll say 
coppola theyll say no its not like anything we ever saw 
we dont want it but then theyll copy it afterwards 
lucas you go through that whole process every time whether the 
project itself is successful you have generated a lot of new 
ideas its the perseverence of the creative spirit that is 
really important 
q what did you learn from your first work together the rain 
people 
coppola we realized you could make pictures anywhere we 
decided we were going to make films and be independent and use new 
methods

the movie tucker the man and his 
dream has many people looking back at the postwar years when 
industrial dreams came true in the factory town 
preston tuckers biggest venture a sleek aheadofitstime 
automobile that challenged the antiquated designs of the major 
automakers was launched in 1946 it collapsed in 1949 
the memory is still vivid for mary lee mcandrew tuckers 
daughter who at age 20 christened the first prototype car 
informally dubbed the tucker torpedo with a splash of champagne 
in a june 1947 unveiling 
mcandrew worked with director francis coppola while the film was 
made she recalled the days of traveling with her father to a 
whirlwind of meetings with potential investors dealers and others 
at chicago washington and new york hotels 
her ranchstyle house shaded by trees and overlooking the 
washtenaw country clubs rolling fairways is a few miles west of 
the white house with its wide pillared porch where tucker and his 
wife vera lived with their five children a menagerie of pets and 
the ubiquitous cars 
a few miles in the other direction lives 78yearold daniel 
leabu he was one of a handful of machinists and mechanics who 
built the first four tucker engines in a barn behind the tucker 
house 
leabu recalled the rush job i was out there till two or three 
oclock in the morning getting chicken anything just to keep 
them working 
but too young to remember the rise and fall of the tucker 
automobile was prestons grandson john tucker a 36yearold store 
designer 
i was only 4 years old when he died he said about the 
only thing i remember is sitting on his knee the summer before he 
died and i remember the energy that always went on around that 
house 
tuckers project started in boom times for ypsilanti about 35 
miles west of detroit not far from leabus house bomber street is 
a reminder of the roundtheclock production of bomber planes in a 
plant operated by henry ford tuckers ypsilanti machine amp tool 
co also thrived 
born in capac mich in 1903 tucker grew up in the lincoln 
park area south of detroit he worked as a policeman and later 
sold cars in memphis tenn and indianapolis before moving to 
ypsilanti 
his company made a rotating ball gunturret designed for a fast 
combat car devised by tucker but actually used in airplanes 
building autos after the war came naturally mcandrew said of 
her father all of his life he was into cars from the first time 
he saw one 
to manufacture his car tucker leased a mammoth plant near 
cicero ill that produced aircraft engines during the war the 
plant is now a vast shopping mall where observances are being held 
in connection with the movie 
he bought a company that made helicopter engines that could be 
adapted to power the car that was the job of leabu and his crew 
in the movie he is a character named eddie 
tuckers house has been converted to apartments and there are 
cars parked in back but the barn still stands and leabu recently 
took a visitor there 
this is where we started the first engine he said in the 
old barn we hung a fuel tank from the ceiling and hooked up a 
battery and it started that was the most beautiful noise i ever 
heard 
in 1948 the tucker cars created a stir they were capable of 
going 120 miles an hour and driven more economically getting 30 
miles to the gallon 
startling at the time were the rearengine design aerodynamic 
styling safety features such as seat belts padded dash and 
popout windows and blue maroon silver and other brilliant 
colors 
only 50 cars were built before pressure from the big automakers 
and money problems collapsed the enterprise a federal 
investigation ended with tuckers acquittal of fraud charges in a 
1950 trial but word of the probe had long since dried up funds 
jack miller a dealer in antique hudson automobiles said tucker 
might have been brought down regardless by the same economic 
forces that swallowed up other small auto companies such as kaiser 
nash hudson willys studebaker and packard 
people thought maybe he was going a little too fast the 
antique car dealer said 
leabu said tucker might have had an edge others lacked we had 
something nobody ever had before right at a point when the others 
were getting retooled he said we needed a little more money 
to get it across 
he was one of the most ingenious men ive ever met 
leabus desk is full of memorabilia brass badges plant 
employees wore keys to tucker cars and copies of tucker topics 
house organ of the shortlived plant 
after his empire fell tucker returned to ypsilanti and 
continued running the machine and tool company by the time tucker 
died of cancer in 1956 he had made several trips to brazil to plan 
the manufacture there of a car he called the carioca 
while the movie was being shot coppola often had children and 
grandchildren around the set therefore he could understand the 
boisterous closeknit tucker tribe that romped through the park 
street house 
we were all happy we were a very loving family the house was 
full of people all the time relatives friends we were 
teenagers so we had all our friends mcandrew said 
there were pets too at one time including two cows a pony and 
a pig that were all trooped to a nearby pond to be soaped up and 
washed down wed take the pony and the pig and everything she 
said we had a ball dad was the first one in and the last one 
out 
vera tucker now 86 and living in arizona liked the film she 
thought it caught the spirit of the family very well and my 
fathers magnetic spirit her daughter said 
she told coppola during filming my father is looking down on 
this and smiling

the rare tucker automobile featuring a 
spaceship design roaming cyclops headlamp and rearmounted engine 
is becoming a hot item for collectors with the release of a film 
about the cars creator 
francis coppolas tucker the man and his dream which 
chronicles the life of rebel automaker preston tucker opened over 
the weekend at theaters nationwide 
but two major collectorcar auctioneers based here disagree on 
the movies impact on the cars actual value rick cole says the 
current 50000 pricetag should stay the same but tom barrett 
insists the value will soar to 250000 
its worth 50000 and that wont change said cole it 
was the de lorean of the 40s it was stuck together with glue and 
spit and anything else 
barrett disagrees they are now selling in excess of 150000 
and these cars will go up rapidly with the movie insisted 
barrett they will easily go to 200000 
coppola has two tuckers and producer george lucas bought two as 
soon as he finished making the movie with coppola 
woe be the guy who runs out and buys a tucker because of the 
movie warned cole 
preston tucker with the help of designer alex tremulis built a 
safetyconscious luxury car that could be affordable barrett said 
the only difference today is its affordability 
when first introduced tucker owners displayed signs in the back 
window reading youve just been passed by a tucker 
they were very fast could go more than 100 mph barrett 
said the torque was so tremendous the car would kick up on one 
side they would run away from anything at the time 
only 50 tuckers with a pricetag of 2450 were made in 1948 
before the big three automakers ford general motors and chrysler 
allegedly conspired to torpedo the vehicle dubbed the car of 
tomorrow today there are a surprising 45 left 
barrett whose collectorcar auction in scottsdale ariz last 
janurary brought in a record 32 million with the sale of 1000 
cars said the tucker is one of the most soughtafter vehicles 
hes owned and sold seven tuckers 
for an american car built after world war ii the tucker is 
the most collectible in the world he said 
the most popular car overall right now is a 1964 ferarri gto 
which goes for about 3 million next is the tucker followed by 
the 1955 ford thunderbird 1957 cadillac eldorado and 1957 
chevrolet he said 
barrett however still raved about the tucker the design was 
way ahead of its time they were way ahead of themselves it is too 
bad they got shut down barrett said 
safety features included popout windshields made of safety 
glass a crash board protection cowl in case of a headon crash and 
the centermounted cyclops headlamp that moved with the steering 
wheel 
that was very unusual at the time and still is but it was 
very clever when you are going into a turn said barrett 
the rearengine allowed tremendous room inside you could sit 
four people abreast in one seat it was a huge car about 18 feet 
bumpertobumper 
but the tucker is a fourwheeled relic that will be quickly 
forgotten once the moviehype has passed said cole whose monterey 
sports and racing car auction on aug 19 is one of californias 
largest 
i wasnt interested in tuckers before the movie and im not 
interested after the movie either said cole adding there are 
no tuckers in his lineup 
a guy called me last week and offered to sell me his tucker 
for 250000 i told him id pass said cole im sure ill get 
another call as soon as the movie comes out the phone will ring

several of the stars in the new movie 
tucker the man and his dream were groomed in this southern 
kansas town where wheat is more often a conversation topic than 
hollywood 
the stars are the 1948 tucker automobiles 
stan gilliland of the tucker automobile club of america is the 
owner of an antique auto restoration business worked on virtually 
all 22 cars used in the movie in 1973 he staged an organizational 
meeting for the club which now has 210 members most of whom dont 
own tuckers he has owned as many as six at a time 
hailed as a revolutionary highpowered car only 50 tuckers were 
made in a chicago plant where b29 engines once were built by 
dodge the autos were engineering prototypes not production cars 
and no two are alike gilliland said 
in tests a tucker powered by its flat sixcyliner 335 cubic 
inch engine reached 130 miles per hour preston t tucker 
encouraged employees who test drove his cars to log as many miles 
as possible at 100 mph gilliland and other club members have 
driven them faster than that 
probably the most distinctive appearance feature of the car was 
its hoodmounted third headlight that turned with the front wheels 
that and its low sleek body design captured postwar imaginations 
hungry for something new 
tucker raised 30 million to make the auto which he planned to 
sell for around 2500 a price competitive with cars of the day 
that is also the price coppola paid 18 tucker owners to use 
their cars for filming he also utilized his two tuckers and two 
owned by producer george lucas 
the movie finally gives tucker the fair treatment he didnt get 
when he sought to manufacture what he called americas first 
completely new car in 50 years 
coppola portrays tucker as a hero who stood against the big 
three automakers ford general motors and chrysler but went 
bankrupt after a lengthy securities exchange commission 
investigation and a criminal trial that ended in his aquittal 
tucker died of cancer in 1956 
the automobile makers just couldnt stand for anybody to bring 
out a new car gilliland said im not saying there was for 
sure a conspiracy but there was a lot of funny stuff going on 
tucker antagonists pictured him as a highliving con man who 
never intended to actually manufacture cars supporters saw him as 
visionary whose innovations such as disc brakes padded dash and 
rearmounted aluminum alloy engine eventually were adopted by the 
detroit automakers 
walker began his fascination with the cars while still a 
schoolboy he read a december 1946 science illustrated magazine 
article about tuckers plans for the car 
he finally got to see one when he sneaked under a sideshow tent 
at the kansas state fair a few years after tuckers bankruptcy in 
college he wrote a freshman term paper titled the startling 
story of the tucker

growing american airlines is beefing up its 
presence in south florida home of its shrinking 
financiallytroubled rival eastern airlines 
robert w baker senior vice president for operations of the 
carrier announced plans wednesday for a crew base of up to 700 
pilots and flight attendants in miami 
american airlines is deeply committed to the florida market 
and believes florida will play a critical role in our future 
expansion baker said 
fort worth texasbased americans expansion in south florida is 
based on longterm plans and on expectations that the florida and 
caribbean markets will continue growing not on the potentially 
temporary problems of competitors baker said 
the specific and wellknown problems of eastern really had 
very little to do with our decision baker said 
but he added the expansion in miami would give us some 
additional flexibility in case of such opportunities as 
availability of latin american routes currently flown by eastern or 
pan american world airways both of which are seeking labor 
cutbacks to avoid service reductions 
i dont think it will have any effect eastern spokeswoman 
paula musto said of americans move american is in a growing 
mode and if miami is their choice i say more power to the miami 
community and economy 
eastern has some 850 pilots and 1800 flight attendants based 
here she said 
us district court judge barrington parker on tuesday extended 
until aug 26 a restraining order prohibiting eastern from 
dismissing about 4000 workers as part of a costsaving measure he 
planned to hear arguments today in washington 
eastern which has lost about 1 billion over the past 10 years 
posted a second quarter net loss of 898 million compared with 
net income of 271 million a year earlier easterns revenue in 
the most recent quarter declined to 1 billion from 12 billion 
the eastern plan announced july 22 also calls for elimination 
of 140 of its 1225 daily flights to help cut costs 
the plan would end nearly all operations at kansas city 
easterns principal hub for the western united states and 
dramatically reduce flights at its philadelphia hub flights to 14 
cities also would be dropped under the plan 
american also announced addition of a flight attendant crew base 
in nashville tenn one of its five hubs american said it would 
staff the new base with 75 flight attendants in october and perhaps 
as many as 600 in the early 1990s 
american also has hubs in dallasfort worth chicago 
raleighdurham and san juan 
by january american will base 160 flight crew members in miami 
fort lauderdale and west palm beach baker said the total will 
reach 700 within a few years he said 
the expansion reflects a rise in flights that already was under 
way they said and will help in expansion to the caribbean basin 
that began with establishment of a hub in puerto rico about 1 
years ago 
in two years american had increased its daily flights in 
florida from 29 to 78 and boarded nearly 1 million passengers in 
florida in the first six months of 1988 compared to 412000 the 
first half of 1986

gold prices rose 
the dollar fell to 18950 marks shortly after gerhard 
stoltenbergs statement then recovered a bit but remained below 
late wednesdays 19155mark rate 
traders said the market was extremely nervous wondering whether 
central banks would follow up on the statement with intervention 
but one trader in rome added that the market had shown quite a 
bit of resilience to stoltenbergs comments the market is still 
a buyer of dollars he said 
in london the british pound was quoted at 17015 compared 
with 16910 wednesday 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late 
wednesdays rates included 18975 west german marks down from

share prices bounced back today on the tokyo stock 
exchange from a major drop the day before while the us dollar 
declined sharply against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which plunged 
61549 points wednesday the largest singleday drop in eight 
months regained 23011 points or 083 percent to close at 
2778498 
there is still a strong bullish sentiment in the tokyo 
market said a dealer at a tokyo brokerage speaking anonymously 
investors who had been sidelined because of a lack of incentives 
to participate in the market are buying depressed shares today 
without hesitation 
securities dealers said the stock market overcame negative signs 
in new york overnight including the 45point drop in the dow jones 
industrial average and the sudden downturn of the us dollar 
they also said activity was centered around strong buying of 
largecapital shares by institutional investors who were taking 
advantage of wednesdays drop 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 600 
million shares compared to 700 million wednesday 
the dollar meanwhile opened at 13365 yen or 127 yen lower 
than wednesdays 13492 close it moved in a range of 1335013413 
yen before closing at 13407 yen down 085 yen from wednesdays 
close 
dealers attributed the dollars sudden downturn to fierce 
profittaking by investment banks which bought the dollar at the 
135yen level wednesday in new york 
however they said traders began buying dollars in the afternoon 
session which slightly raised the price of the dollar toward the 
end of the days trading 
the low opening is apparently a carryover from new york but 
profittaking is pushing the dollar higher said a tokyobased 
dealer at a us investment bank also speaking anonymously 
but no major shift is likely as the market awaits next weeks 
us trade report he added 
the commerce department is scheduled to release us trade 
figures for june on monday in washington

toshiba machine co whose illegal exports to the 
soviet union drew sharp criticism from the west last year said 
today it will cut its american operations in the face of 
restrictions on its us exports 
we understand it is only a matter of time now that the us 
trade bill will be signed and take effect said hiroshi 
yamaguchi the companys senior spokesman so whether we like it 
or not we will have to trim down the us unit sooner or later 
if president reagan signs the omnibus trade bill as expected 
toshiba machine which makes and sells machine tools will be 
barred from exporting to the united states for three years 
the united states moved to penalize toshiba machine for selling 
milling machines to the soviet union that could be used to build 
quieter submarine propellers 
the sophisticated machines are prohibited from sale to soviet 
bloc countries by an international agreement of the parisbased 
coordinating committee for multilateral export controls 
reagan is expected to sign the bill as early as next week 
toshiba machines whollyowned us subsidiary toshiba machine 
co america based in the chicago suburb of elk grove villege has 
sales and maintenence responsibilities in the united states it has 
85 employees 55 of them locally hired and offices in los angeles 
new york and toronto canada 
we will try to protect the interests of our locally hired 
peple as much as possible said yamaguchi but eventually the 
sales function of the us unit will inevitably be removed because 
we wont be able to sell in the us for three years 
exports to the united states accounted for 122 percent of 
toshiba machines sales in fiscal 1987 the company expects a sharp 
decline in its exports to the united states for the current fiscal 
year which began in april but its total sales will likely 
increase because of brisk domestic demand yamaguchi said 
the us trade bill also bars toshiba machines parent the 
electronic giant toshiba corp from sales to the us government 
for three years for poor supervision of its subsidiary

the salary of the highestpaid career civil servant from 77500 to

world grain production is projected to decline for 
the second consecutive year as a result of the drought in north 
america causing stocks to plunge at a record rate the un food 
and agriculture organization reported thursday 
although widespread rain in july provided some relief it only 
averted further deterioration of the corn and spring wheat crops 
which had already suffered severe losses the agency said in its 
august issue of food outlook 
the report said faos forecast of 1988 world grain production 
has been lowered further to 1772 billion metric tons down 24 
million tons from the previous year and 13 million tons from last 
months forecast 
as a result of the production shortfall world grain stocks are 
projected by fao to fall by 80 million tons in 198889 the biggest 
annual drop on record the report said 
at the projected level global stocks at the end of the 198889 
marketing year would be at the minimum level fao considers 
necessary to safeguard food security 
fao has said the reduced stocks could cause food shortages in 
some developing countries 
the reduction since last month has been mostly in the production 
forecast for coarse grains which is now put at 772 million tons 
against the earlier forecast of 785 million tons and last years 
harvest of 819 million tons the report said the forecast for 
wheat has been lowered by 4 million tons to 516 millions tons the 
same as the belowtrend 1987 output 
in contrast the production forecast for rice has been raised by 
4 million tons to 484 million tons which would be some 23 million 
tons or 5 percent above the droughtreduced harvest of 1987 fao

citizens from housewives to factory 
workers are scraping together whatever cash they can and invading 
brokerages to join in an investment craze triggered by the 
spectacular boom of the local stock market 
but while the craze has conjured up dreams of instant wealth it 
also has some experts warning of a possible nightmare when the 
heated market cools down 
brokerage trading rooms have been crowded with office and 
factory workers retired civil servants housewives and others 
anxious to play the market despite official warnings that prices 
might soon tumble 
the market is real hot many factory owners have to come to 
brokerage houses to snatch their employees back to work su 
sanho a stock manager at the well phones securities co in the 
port city of kaohsiung 216 miles south of taipei said during a 
recent interview 
taiwans stock index posted seven consecutive record highs 
through tuesday when it surpassed 7000 points for the first time 
ever it managed another record close on wednesday despite a 
615point plunge on the tokyo stock exchange but closed sharply 
lower today on profittaking sparked by the declines in overseas 
markets 
the index has soared more than 200 percent so far this year and 
35 percent in just the past month 
stockbrokers on nanking east road nicknamed wall street for its 
many brokerages and business firms have hung huge red balloons 
imprinted with the latest stock index showing outside the buildings 
it is unbelievable said john nelson an analyst of jardine 
fleming taiwan ltd no one seems to have a good reason for this 
incredible rise 
share trading volume zoomed to 116 billion in the first seven 
months of this year a 214 percent increase from the same period 
last year 
the accumulated figure was the fourthlargest in the world after 
the tokyo new york and london exchanges according to jardine 
fleming 
many taiwan companies have set aside a fund for stock 
investments in which profits are shared with employees to prevent 
them from sneaking away from work to the brokerage floors brokers 
say 
they say some office workers even have quit their jobs figuring 
that in two weeks time playing the market they can earn more than 
their annual income which averages about 10500 
several local consulting firms forecast the stock index would 
hit 8000 or 10000 points by the end of this year 
but chen paorei an economist at the government council for 
economic planning and development recently warned share prices 
cannot continue to surge without an end the higher the prices 
rise the sharper the fall may be 
wu jungyi professor of economics of national chunghsing 
university said the overheated market is an irregular 
phenomenon that could lead to share prices falling like 
dominoes 
analysts say the latest surge began in midjuly when the ruling 
nationalist party convened a landmark congress in which it decided 
to lift import bans on major raw materials from rival mainland 
china 
the congress was quickly followed by a cabinet overhaul in which 
several aging economic officials were replaced by a younger group 
in a move seen as a precursor to reforming taiwans restrictive 
financial system 
this islands robust economic growth also is viewed as a key 
factor behind the rising share prices but analysts note that 
taiwans economic performance appears to be slowing and should not 
have boosted the market to such heights 
the government projects a 7 percent economic growth for this 
year down from the 1987 rate of 11 percent 
john chien president of the usbased federated international 
investment consulting co believes share prices have shot up 
because too many cashrich people are chasing too few stocks 
the local exchange lists only 145 companies the relatively 
small market allows manipulation by major investors who pushed 
certain share prices up before selling for huge profits analysts 
say 
another factor contributing to the overheated market is the 3 
percent daily gain and loss limit authorities imposed on share 
prices the limits designed to prevent drastic price surges or 
tumbles have prompted speculation by reducing investment risk 
analysts say 
the government in june tightened credit in an effort to dampen 
rampant stock and real estate speculation but to little effect 
credit is a little tighter but money is still abundant

polaroid corp directors reportedly are expected 
to tell shareholders and employees friday that an offer to sell the 
company to shamrock holding inc for 40 a share is not enough 
the directors also do not consider shamrocks offer to be 
legally binding because it was subject to several conditions the 
boston globe today said it was told by unidentified sources 
the rejection would be supported by an evaluation from shearson 
lehman hutton polaroids investment banker and the opinion of 
some directors that the value of the stock depends partly on the 
amount of damages the eastman kodak co pays polaroid for patent 
infringement 
we have no way of knowing whether kodak will pay 500 million 
or 3 billion to 4 billion so the value of polaroid shares is 
uncertain a source is quoted as saying 
lawyers for both companies prepared to discuss a schedule for 
the damages trial with us district judge a david mazzone today 
polaroid shares sold for 42 wednesday

two abandoned steel mills that have become 
public property will be turned into industrial parks and 
recreational areas in an attempt to draw employers and jobs to the 
depressed monongahela river valley 
we want to make sure all the talents we have in the mon valley 
are fully utilized said tom foerster chairman of the allegheny 
county commissioners 
the directors of the countys industrial development authority 
signed an agreement with usx corp on wednesday to transfer the 
duquesne works in duquesne and national works in mckeesport to the 
authority 
the deal culminated two years of work that began before similar 
recommendations were made in march by urban planners and architects 
who visited the area as part of an international remaking cities 
conference 
the county is taking a risk our neck is way out on the line 
because now its up to the county to develop that property 
foerster said we thought its time government took a risk 
the private regional industrial development corp will oversee 
the mills demolition a task expected to take three years as each 
section is razed it will be redeveloped as quickly as possible 
said stephen m barrouk executive director of the county authority 
its not going to happen overnight but its going to 
happen barrouk said 
jim taylor chairman of the mon valley commission which 
recommended the sales agreement in a 1987 report said hes 
received numerous inquiries from businesses interested in moving 
into the planned industrial parks he declined to elaborate but 
said numerous jobs likely will be created 
usx sold the two plants including land buildings and 
equipment for 3662800 or 10000 an acre to be paid by 
promissory note the county will repay to usx at least that much 
per acre when parcels are sold or leased 
the county authority and the regional industrial development 
corp will share responsibility for removing any hazardous wastes 
identified by a planned environmental survey 
any hazardous wastes found later will be cleaned at public 
expense up to 3 million usx would pay half of any costs above 3 
million said authority solicitor scott irmscher 
removing known deposits of asbestos and other hazardous wastes 
will cost about 14 million with the sale of scrap metal expected 
to easily cover the cost imscher said 
usx will reserve about 20 acres of the 380acre sites under a 
leaseback arrangement for an annual rental of 1 for 10 years over 
the next decade the company can repurchase all or any part of that 
area for 1 plus improvement costs 
usx will continue to make payments to the county local 
municipalities and school districts in lieu of real estate taxes 
following the anticipated closing in midseptember 
theres a good chance that if we do it correctly and everybody 
cooperates that it will be successful taylor said 
the changes that we make in these communities are for the next 
century barrouk said so we cant afford not to do it right

illegal trade in endangered or protected wildlife 
such as crocodiles parrots and chimpanzees represents an estimated 
15 billion annually an official responsible for enforcing an 
international treaty protecting such species said thursday 
illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summer 
and christmas holiday seasons because customs officials are often 
overloaded and illegal shipments slip past them jeanpatrick le 
duc told a news conference 
also at christmas live animalsmake good presents he said 
in europe for example parrots and reptiles including baby 
crocodiles are increasingly popular pets he said 
le duc is an enforcement official for the convention on 
international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora 
the convention in force since july 1975 has been ratified by 95 
countries including the united states most latin american 
countries except mexico and many asian african and european 
nations 
it aims to prevent international trade from threatening species 
with extinction signatories are to enforce bans on commercial 
trade in an agreed list of currently endangered species and to 
regulate trade in others that might become endangered 
according to cites endangered species include all apes the 
giant panda many south american monkeys the asian elephant all 
rhinoceroses many birds of prey and parrots all sea turtles some 
crocodiles great whales no permits are issued for international 
trade in these species except under unusual circumstances 
le duc said total trade legal and illegal in wildlife amounts 
to 5 billion annually he estimated that illegal trade is about 
30 percent of the total 
the hotspots of illicit wildlife trade are southeast asia 
japan latin america and africa though africa is doing more than 
any other developing country to try to control it le duc said 
to give an idea of how lucrative wildlife trade can be le duc 
said a trader could buy a gray parrot in ghana for about 10 and 
resell it for about 600 in north america 
a press release from cites headquarters in lausanne listed 10 
examples of illicit trade that have been thwarted in the past 10 
weeks 
in one a notorious convicted animal trader sent crates 
with live animals from equatorial guinea destined for honduras via 
spain the report said 
it said that customs agents stopped the shipment at the madrid 
airport in the crates they found five chimpanzees 12 crocodiles 
nine mandrill monkeys 11 agama lizards seven tortoises 17 
saimiri monkeys and 31 gray parrots several of the animals were 
found dead the surviving animals were given to the madrid zoo the 
report said 
in two other separate cases a total of 8000 baby crocodiles 
were shipped from colombia to taiwan it says one shipment of 
2000 was discovered because of the stench of some 1500 that had 
died 
and recently a female asian elephant arrived in the dutch port 
of rotterdam from vietnam hidden in a large crate her skin had 
dried up during the onemonth journey and she was in a pitiful 
state it said the elephant survived and now is at rotterdam zoo

a district court jury has awarded a 
montana man 129 million after finding general motors corp at 
fault because a 4wheeldrive pickup truck rolled over him while he 
was working on it 
the verdict represents the first case nationally where the 
4wheeldrive design used by gm ford motor co and chrysler corp 
between 1973 and 1979 has been challenged at trial said dennis 
conner of great falls kruegers lawyer 
the jury said the truck was defective and caused the injuries 
that paralyzed him 
jurors deliberated about five hours tuesday night and wednesday 
before reaching a unanimous verdict the jury found that an 
opendifferential design in the 1976 chevrolet pickups transfer 
case was unreasonably dangerous and that the automaker failed to 
warn consumers 
the jury said both failures contributed to andrew kruegers 
injuries in the feb 17 1983 accident 
the jury ruling not only ends five years of legal efforts by 
krueger but also we now have a verdict here in montana that says 
this product is unreasonably dangerous and that they have failed 
to warn the lawyer said 
that has to have implications that reach all the way back 
to detroit conner said 
the jury found no liability by krueger for his injuries 
curtis thompson a defense lawyer said the defense team was 
assessing options such as posttrial motions and possibly an appeal 
the verdict ended a twoweek trial before district judge thomas 
mckittrick 
the trial centered on the fulltime fourwheeldrive design used 
on gms and other automakers vehicles between 1973 and 1979 the 
plaintiffs sought to show the opendifferential design in the 
transfer case of the fourwheel drive defectively allowed a vehicle 
that was stopped and in the park gear to roll if one wheel were 
jacked up or the driveshaft dropped 
krueger was injured in the accident on a sloping driveway in 
great falls an unemployed man with about five years experience as 
a mechanic krueger was paralyzed from the upper chest down after 
he slipped under his borrowed fulltime fourwheeldrive pickup and 
disconnected its front driveshaft 
the vehicle was set on park and fourwheel drive though krueger 
had not blocked its wheels used the parking brake nor put 
fourwheel drive in the lock position

thousands of seals are dying on north 
sea beaches and environmentalists say pollution is the killer but 
scientists are not ready to blame a toxic cocktail they are 
finding in the carcasses 
an estimated 7000 diseased harbor seals have died since april 
about half the population in the north sea waters of west germany 
the netherlands norway denmark and sweden 
west german television gives the death count nearly every night 
and shows closeups of carcasses being loaded onto trucks to be 
hauled away for disposal more than 2000 of the seals have died in 
west german waters 
governments marine biologists and environmentalists agree the 
north sea is heavily polluted and the seals are dying of one or 
more viruses the cause of the disease remains unknown 
thousands of west germans demonstrating concern formed a 25mile 
human chain july 24 that stretched the length of sylt island 
earlier this summer greenpeace environmentalists tried to stop 
an incinerator ship from burning burning spanish toxic waste in the 
north sea 
two greenpeace activists tried to board the 3356ton vulcanus 
ii about 100 miles from britain on june 21 but crew members using 
highpressure water hoses knocked them into the sea and damaged the 
breenpeace vessel 
environmentalists call the seal epidemic one of the worst 
ecological disasters ever 
this really shows that society is not taking care of the 
environment claudia sieg hamburg spokeswoman for greenpeace 
said in a telephone interview 
greenpeace and other environmental groups hold pollution 
responsible for the epidemic and demand that industry take 
immediate measures to stop it 
independent scientists say the hypothesis has not been proven 
they also are uncertain about consequences for other forms of 
marine life 
we have found a huge cocktail of different toxic agents in 
these seals but we have not yet seen any direct connections between 
pollution and the disease said guenter heidemann an expert on 
seals at the university of kiel 
heidemann added however that he suspects highly toxic 
polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and other chemicals have increased 
the susceptibility of harbor seals to disease 
many north sea beaches are considered unhealthy for swimmers 
because of manmade wastes 
greenpeace says the rhine elbe and weser all german rivers 
carry more than 450000 tons of phosphates and nitrates 100 tons 
of lead and 50 tons of mercury into the north sea every year 
scientists have found fish on sylts eastern shore with tumors 
and lesions believed caused by pollutants spewed into the sea by 
the rhine and other rivers 
officials and independent experts say pollution in the rhine is 
far less serious than 15 years ago because of improved treatment 
plants but they acknowledge that swiss west german french and 
dutch factories and communities still dump waste into the river 
oil is another source of north sea pollution experts say about 
400000 tons of it leak into the sea each year from offshore 
drilling rigs and other sources 
fertilizer runoff from farmland adds to the pollution load say 
scientists in the north sea nations but they cannot about the 
effect of pollution on seal life 
norwegian scientists have speculated that seal overpopulation 
may have increased their susceptibility to viral infections 
swedish researcher susanne liljenstrom counters that the population 
is much smaller than at the beginning of the century 
experts also argue over whether a single virus is causing the 
epidemic 
gunnar holt of oslos veterinarian institute said he believes 
the deaths are due to a virus called picorna that has been 
registered in seals before 
now it seems as if researchers have found exactly the picorna 
virus which causes seal death he said 
heidemann the west german expert responds it is not known 
if this virus is mainly responsible for the epidemic most of the 
animals die from lung infection or from infection of the stomach 
and gut system but nobody knows what has really triggered these 
developments 
some put the blame on waste dumped by britain and carried by 
north sea currents but the british government says responsibility 
lies with continental europe 
whoever or whatever is to blame the entire harbor seal 
population may be in danger 
at first we thought this would soon end but no end is in 
sight heidemann said it is a possibility that most of these 
animals might die

the federal aviation administration is 
stopping work on a 36 billion air traffic control system 
following a protest by a losing contractor 
the protest by hughes aircraft earlier caused the general 
services administrations board of contract appeals to suspend 
procurement for the system being put together by international 
business machines corp hughes claims it should have gotten the 
contract 
the advanced automation system is a new generation of air 
traffic control system where the computer is actually involved 
in the decision making said faa spokesman john laden the 
system which is to be completed by the turn of the century is 
intended to improve air safety and reduce air controllers 
workloads 
the faa is in the process of drafting a stop work order 
said laden the next step will be for the gsa to decide on the 
merits of the protests 
hughes last week asked the government to revoke the contract 
alleging that ibm was allowed to undercut hughes bid in part 
because ibms offer included the use of used computers hughes had 
agreed to use new ones 
we are pleased by the decision and are looking forward to 
pleading the case on its merits said lee pitt a hughes vice 
president 
the contract is the largest award in ibms history 
we maintain that the hughes protest is without merit and 
should be denied said ibm spokesman michael dutton 
while the contract boards action does not mean the contract 
has been suspended said dutton it certainly is going to slow 
down development of the system 
additional hearings on the contract review are scheduled for 
early next month

threats of a lawsuit by homeless families 
hoping to find shelter in foreclosed houses caused the federal 
government to cancel a major sales promotion that was aimed at 
selling 15000 houses this weekend 
critics of the sale said it could have deprived the homeless of 
possible living space and would mainly benefit speculators 
the department of housing and urban development announced 
wednesday it was calling off its coordinated national sales 
weekend after advocates for the homeless threatened legal action 
the promotion was to include special advertising open houses and 
other activities to push sales of more than 27000 houses in 
several states which the federal government has taken over because 
their owners couldnt meet payments on federal housing loans 
the houses will remain on the market across the country but 
local hud offices have been told not to proceed with the planned 
sales effort because of the threatened lawsuit 
roberta youmans of the national housing law project praised the 
action but said the group which had threatened the lawsuit still 
would pursue ways of getting more foreclosed houses into the hands 
of some of the three million americans who have no place to live 
we received calls from homeless individuals saying hud was 
selling units and they couldnt get them ms youmans said in a 
telephone interview 
she said the group which is based in berkeley calif had 
written hud to object to the campaign and threaten a lawsuit the 
project assists lawyers helping indigent clients with housing cases 
ms youmans said many of the hud sales result in homes being 
sold to speculators and sometimes the homes themselves have been 
taken away from people who originally were homeless putting them 
back on the streets others are being rented to people who are 
rendered homeless by the sales she said 
she said the group first heard about a plan to sell 150 
foreclosed houses in the washington dc area later this month 
and then discovered the planned nationwide campaign the washington 
area effort also has been stopped 
ms youmans said homeless advocates plan to meet with hud 
officials to discuss ways the houses can be used to decrease 
homelessness 
bill glavin a hud spokesman said the sales effort was stopped 
as a result of the threat of litigation by homeless advocacy 
groups since any protracted litigation could have an adverse 
affect on the future sales of foreclosed properties 
he said the agency also was reviewing its programs for making 
the houses available to the homeless both lease and leasepurchase 
programs are available and about 90 percent of the available 
houses can be purchased at a 10 percent discount by local agencies 
that would make them available to the homeless hud said in a 
statement 
foreclosed government properties generally are available through 
bids that are to be opened on a specific date for each property

president reagan signed a 39billion 
droughtrelief package today telling farmers it isnt as good as 
rain but it will tide you over until normal weather returns 
at a ceremony in the white house rose garden reagan said 
this bill expresses a distinctive american tradition that of 
lending a helping hand when misfortune strikes 
he said the measure was a product of bipartisanship as members 
of both parties in congress saw that the need to help our farmers 
rose far above any partisan politics 
this legislation is helpful and generous but at the same time 
it is not a budget buster the president said 
to ensure the continued success of this important bill we 
must stick to the principles i have outlined targeting assistance 
to the truly needy and emphasizing sound business decisions he 
said 
addressing the nations farmers directly the president said 
this bill isnt as good as rain but it will tide you over until 
normal weather and your own skills permit you to return to your 
accustomed role of being the most productive farmers in the world 
the measure provides aid for farmers suffering crop losses of 
more than 35 percent of their expected harvest because of the 
drought or other calamities such as hail insect damage or 
excessive rain the payments would be equal to 65 per cent of the 
lost income 
farmers whose crop losses exceeded 75 per cent of the expected 
yield would receive payments equal to 90 per cent of lost income 
its a good buffer and its probably enough to get most 
people over the hump this year said keith salter who figures he 
will get 12000 because the drought baked all 420 acres of wheat 
barley and oats on his farm near menoken nd 
it wont be like a crop but its better than nothing said 
the 53yearold farmer 
the white house said reagan would sign the bill in the white 
house rose garden today his signature already had been assured 
farm organization leaders said the bill the most expensive 
disaster relief measure ever enacted for agriculture wont be 
enough to keep all financially squeezed farmers in business 
if a farmer has been struggling these past few years this 
will not allow him income to pay down debt and interest said 
john leininger spokesman for the 33000member north dakota 
farmers union we are definitely going to see some farmers leave 
i am sure 
according to the farmers union a farmer with an average wheat 
yield of 30 bushels an acre who harvested nothing this year should 
receive at least 42 an acre in disaster aid the payment would go 
up to about 92 an acre if the farmer had federal crop insurance 
the same farmer harvesting a normal crop would earn about 114 
per acre based on market prices this spring leininger said 
money for the payments is expected to come from savings that the 
government will realize as a result of the drought since 
incomesupport payments are based in part on how much individual 
farmers produce with crops down because of the drought the amount 
the governmentowned commodity credit corp must put out in such 
payments is also down 
under the bill farmers will not have to repay such payments 
that they have received already if their payment amount is lowered 
because of production losses resulting from the drought they may 
not however retain such payments for lost crops and still receive 
disaster aid money for the same crops 
farmers will have to purchase federal crop insurance for 1989 to 
be eligible for disaster payments 
livestock owners who have to buy feed because of the drought 
instead of growing it as usual also would receive assistance 
the bill places a limit of 100000 on payments to any one 
farmer it prohibits payments to any producer whose qualifying 
gross revenues as set by a congressional formula exceed 2 
million 
many reports by private forecasters and commodity specialists 
indicate a reduction of about 40 percent in this falls corn 
production from last years 706 billion bushels and a 20 percent 
to 25 percent decline in soybeans from the 1987 harvest of 191 
billion bushels 
the wheat crop also has been reduced but not as greatly because 
most of the wheat came from the winter crop which was planted last 
fall and harvested before the full impact of the drought was felt

the stock market showed no clearcut trend 
today struggling to stabilize after its recent steep decline 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 4499 points

tally of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 504 up 685 
down and 525 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 5841 million shares at 
midmorning 
analysts said the markets drop over the past week had pushed 
prices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for 
bargains 
but they also said widespread concern persisted over the recent 
rise in interest rates 
several large banks raised their prime lending rates today from 
95 percent to 10 percent a day after the federal reserve 
increased the rate it charges on loans to private financial 
institutions 
the timing of the federal reserves increase in its discount 
rate from 6 percent to 65 percent suggested to many wall streeters 
that the fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becoming 
more aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up 
for one thing the rate increase came just as the treasury was

light trading ahead of this afternoons agriculture department crop 
production report 
the usda is expected to reduce its crop production estimates 
especially for corn and soybeans to reflect crop damage wrought by 
the summerlong drought

royal dutchshell group the worlds largest oil 
company on thursday reported secondquarter profits slipped 4 
percent while fourthranked british petroleum co plc saw net 
income jump 126 percent during the period 
royal dutchshell based in the netherlands and in london said 
its profits for the three months ended june 30 totaled 633 million 
pounds the equivalent of 117 billion compared with 656 million 
pounds 
accounting methods used by british companies put a different 
value on inventories than methods used in the united states which 
makes direct comparisons difficult 
using the american accounting method royal dutchshells 
aftertax profit rose 5 percent to 657 million pounds or about 
12 billion from 626 million pounds 
revenues fell 7 percent to 136 billion pounds or 25 billion 
from 146 billion pounds a year earlier 
the company said strong returns from its worldwide refining and 
marketing operations failed to offset lower natural gas and crude 
oil prices 
for the first six months of the year net income rose 8 percent 
to 15 billion pounds or 26 billion from 135 billion pounds 
under us accounting methods profits jumped 27 percent to 16 
billion pounds or 28 billion from 12 billion pounds 
sixmonth revenues fell 6 percent to 272 billion pounds or 50 
billion from 29 billion pounds 
londonbased bp which owns standard oil co of cleveland said 
secondquarter profits totaled 357 million pounds the equivalent 
of 655 million up from 317 million pounds 
under us accounting methods profit surged 242 percent to 323 
million pounds or 596 million from 260 million pounds 
a strong performance by the companys petrochemical refining 
and marketing divisions helped boost earnings during the quarter 
revenues however fell 7 percent to 648 billion pounds or 
119 billion from 7 billion pounds 
for the first six months net income fell 20 percent to 620 
million pounds or 11 billion from 775 million pounds under the

in a nation that loves credit and in fact is 
hooked on it an increase in interest rates immediately falls into 
the category of bad even painful news 
couples postpone buying homes cars appliances and trips 
companies find their sales hurt lenders cant find qualified 
borrowers uncle sam always in a bind finds it even more 
difficult to pay down his bills 
rising interest rates create a bad mood all around because they 
signal in fact force an economic slowdown few people look at 
whatever good higher interest rates might do such as helping to 
avert inflation 
among those least likely to see much good in the latest federal 
reserve action is george bush the republican presidential 
candidate because the vdi or voter discomfort index is now on 
the rise 
the vdi is a significant economic measure because it suggests 
discontent with the incumbent party it has nothing to do with 
political fairness it is not an indepth measure of understanding 
but it suggests how people vote 
as constructed by economist albert h cox jr the vdi is made 
up of the jobless rate mortgage rates inflation rate and growth 
rate the first three are added and the fourth is then subtracted 
from the total 
in 1976 the year of president carters election the vdi was 
161 made up of a 77 percent jobless rate 9 percent mortgage 
rates 48 percent inflation rate and 54 percent growth rate the 
latter based on gross national product 
it was a high rate and rising it was only 109 in 1976 and as 
low as 7 in 1964 which helped defeat the incumbent 
by 1980 it was even higher and rising in fact it had doubled 
to 325 the job situation had improved a bit but mortgage rates 
and inflation were in doubledigit areas while economic growth had 
almost ceased the mood was blue 
as everyone knows ronald reagan rode into the white house on a 
surge of votes a consequence at least in part of the terrible vdi 
by 1984 the vdi was back down to 174 and reagan was reelected in 
a landslide 
the current vdi is just under 16 which means it has shown very 
little improvement since 1984 the unemployment and mortgage 
situations are better inflation is about the same but economic 
growth has been cut in half 
in other words says cox senior economic adviser of bil 
trainer wortham inc favorable economic momentum is not evident if 
the reference point is economic conditions before the last national 
election 
and now that the federal reserve has raised its basic interest 
rate to 65 percent from 6 percent the vdi may very well 
deteriorate while inflation still could worsen economic growth 
might slow 
cox observes that president reagan made effective use of the 
question are you better or worse off obviously the answer to 
that question was much worse off in 1980 and much better off 
in 1984 
what would the answer be today neither or not sure or dont 
know said cox when he compiled his latest vdi but that was 
before the fed raised interest rates today the interpretation 
would be even worse for bush 
the vdi doesnt tell it all it is a record of existing 
conditions and says nothing whatever about the ability of a 
candidate to inspire voters and to portray a new and better 
economic life but it sets the mood 
says cox economic momentum both negative and positive was a 
powerful factor in president reagans big election victories if he 
were running again this year he would not have that advantage 
and candidate bush does not have that advantage

the us federal reserve raised its discount rate by half a 
point to 65 percent on tuesday on thursday several major us 
banks raised their prime rates to 10 percent from 95 percent 
in new york the dow jones industrial average was off a modest 
213 points at 203201 as the london session drew to a close 
after opening higher 
london dealers had been expecting a sharply lower start in new 
york and were keeping a close eye on activity there to see if 
shares would take another tumble after wednesdays 4499point drop 
on wall street 
the london session began on a buoyant note because stock prices 
had risen earlier in tokyo where us bond prices also rose 
however equities turned suddenly lower shortly before midday 
and dealers cited a disappointing earnings report from the royal 
dutchshell group of companies which said its secondquarter net 
profit was off 4 percent 
market watchers said there was no concerted selling pressure

the head of research and development for 
smith kline amp french laboratories the pharmaceutical division of 
smithkline beckman corp has resigned 
stanley t crooke 43 had been president of the division since 
1982 after joining the pharmaceutical manufacturer in 1980 he 
oversaw a budget of about 235 million as well as the opening 
several years ago of a new research facility in suburban 
philadelphia 
the company said in a statement wednesday that crooke would be 
replaced by george poste 44 a veterinarian and cancer researcher 
who has been second in charge of research and development 
smithkline officials did not offer an explanation for crookes 
resignation it follows by several weeks the resignation of james 
cavanaugh 51 former head of the companys us pharmaceutical 
operaions and comes at a time of financial and managerial turmoil 
for the company crooke was unavailable for comment 
clearly smithkline is going to be looking at its businesses 
including research to find ways to initiate savings and maybe cut 
programs that dont make sense said joseph ricardo a drug 
industry analyst with bear stearns amp co a lot of people are 
going to be singled out and many more heads will roll 
on june 16 smithkline officials disclosed that the company 
expected a sharp decline in profits for the second quarter because 
of a decline in sales of its two main prescription drugs tagamet 
which is used to treat ulcers and dyazide an antihypertension 
drug the two products which are facing intense competition from 
rival drugs account for about 15 billion of smithklines 43 
billion annual sales 
then last month the company reported that its secondquarter 
profit had dropped by 25 percent from levels in the same quarter 
last year 
company officials also disclosed that they would restructure 
smithklines threetiered pharmaceutical business in an effort to 
gain better ccontrol over the relatively autnomous units make 
communication easier among the segments and increase the companys 
ability to respond to competition

donnay sa rose to top seed among the 
worlds tennis racket makers when bjorn borg wielded its ware but 
as the swedish champions career faded so did the companys 
fortunes 
those close to the belgian firm said thursday that familyowned 
donnays debts have mushroomed to 35 million and there is little 
hope of reaching an accord with creditors to avoid bankruptcy 
we do not see how we can survive any longer in the current 
financial situation donnay managing director ile mioc told the 
daily de standaard 
donnays creditors refuse to provide fresh capital unless the 
firm which has subsidiaries in the united states hong kong 
brazil and switzerland comes up with a acceptable restructuring 
plan said fabrice jacquemart a spokesman for the government of 
wallonia in southern belgium 
the donnay family still controls 55 percent of the firm with 
wallonia and the belgian government owning the remainder 
the most likely solution is a takeover after the bankruptcy 
jacquemart said 
donnay was founded in 1910 as a family business with six workers 
making wooden tool handles it was decades later after donnay 
signed a promotion contract with a littleknown swedish rookie 
that the company skyrockted to prominence 
borg went on to reap five consecutive wimbledon titles and 
dominated the sport in the late 1970s and early 1980s and donnay 
followed his fortunes making over 15 million rackets a year and 
employing a staff of 600 
borg was such a piece of luck to them said jacquemart 
they were nowhere near what they were once they had him 
but donnays success began to fade when the swede retired in 
1981 
borg left midway through a fiveyear 5 million contract with 
donnay depriving the firm of its main advertising outlet it all 
went downhill from there said jacquemart 
donnay which also makes sports wear never managed to attract 
another leading player to promote its products they did not have 
the negotiating skills to catch another big contract said 
jacquemart 
the companys problems were exacerbated by a management that had 
difficulty adapting to donnays new international market position 
as well as keeping pace with the latest tennis technology 
tennis players were shifting from wooden rackets to synthetic 
materials and donnay all but missed out on the revolution 
they did not know what was happening with their weak 
management capabilities they did not fathom the importance of the 
technology change said jacquemart 
finally in 1986 donnay stopped making the wooden rackets that 
had accounted for twothirds of its sales just five years earlier 
donnays output fell to 800000 rackets a year its staff was 
cut to 350 and last year the company lost 223 million donnays 
share of the world racket market now amounts to a mere 10 percent 
despite its flagging fortunes money was a problem because of 
the oncefamous donnay name banks continued to provide the company 
with millions of dollars worth of credit 
with debts piling up it is unlikely a takeover candidate will 
surface before donnay is declared bankrupt 
there will be a lot more candidates when there is a 
bankruptcy jacquemart said

an increasing likelihood of rain in the midwest on friday 
profittaking ahead of the agriculture departments crop 
production report added to drop in prices for future deliveries of 
corn wheat and soybeans analysts said 
several private meteorologists said a tropical depression near 
the gulf coast could bring more rain to the droughtstricken

inc 
soybeans led the decline with the contract for august delivery 
tumbling more than 10 cents a bushel 
the usda crop report scheduled for release at 3 pm edt in

soybean production from last years levels

448 billion bushels a 37 percent reduction from last years

a federal judge has given nationwide 
classaction lawsuit status to farmers who allege that the chubb 
group of insurance cos breached contracts by failing to pay 
drought insurance claims 
us district judge carl rubin granted the classaction status 
wednesday and confirmed thursday that it applied to affected 
farmers nationwide not just in ohio 
stanley chesley a cincinnati lawyer representing the farmers 
said he believed the class action would cover an estimated 8800 
farmers in 10 states who could have claims against chubb chesley 
estimated it could cost 380 million to pay off all those claims at 
once 
the cases trace to socalled drought insurance offered to 
farmers earlier this year chubb authorized issuance of up to 30 
million in coverage to farmers whose crops suffered major damage 
attributed to the drought but agents sold an estimated 400 
million worth of insurance 
the suits name as defendants new jerseybased chubb and its 
agent californiabased good weather agriculture the suits demand 
full payments for farmers whose crops were damaged by the drought 
as well as unspecified punitive damages lawyers for the farmers 
hope the case can go to trial within four months 
chubb officials say the company did nothing wrong the company 
recently took out fullpage newspaper advertisements in numerous 
cities to defend its practices 
at least 5000 of 8717 applicants for drought insurance have 
opted to take a doublepremium refund from chubb rather than hold 
out for insurance coverage the company said another 1100 have 
decided to take the insurance valued at a total 40 million of 
coverage chubb spokeswoman mary lu korkuch said 
the doublepremium offer was made last month after agents sold 
farmers more than 400 million of the drought insurance coverage a 
maximum of 30 million had been authorized by the underwriter but 
chubb maintained that a huge volume of applications in the last 
days the insurance was available caused it to be oversubscribed 
chubb officials said the doublepremium refund will cost the 
company about 20 million chesley said he will try to invalidate 
the doublepremium offer which could have the effect of preventing 
farmers from taking part in the class action 
the nationwide classaction suit will be broken into subclasses 
by state to account for the differences in state insurance laws 
the drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack 
of rain between june 1 and aug 31 based on a sliding scale

commending the indomitable spirit of 
droughtstricken farmers president reagan on thursday signed 
americas largestever disaster relief bill 
this bill isnt as good as rain reagan said but itll 
tide you over until normal weather and your own skills permit you 
to return to your accustomed role 
the president signed the measure just hours before the 
agriculture department issued a new crop forecast that said 
production of the nations no 1 crop corn would be down more 
than a third from last year the drought will cause consumer food 
prices to go up an average 3 percent to 5 percent from 1987 
reagan standing before several farmers invited to the rose 
garden signing ceremony said the 39 billion aid package 
expresses a distinctly american tradition of lending a 
helping hand when misfortune strikes 
reagan praised democratic and republican congressional leaders 
for putting aside partisan differences to speed act on the bill 
and the heads of the house and senate agriculture committees 
returned the compliment 
one of the farmers herman krone who gave reagan a tour of his 
ravaged corn and soybean crops last month near du quoin ill 
said i think that washington has done one of their better jobs 
right here 
its a good buffer and its probably enough to get most 
people over the hump this year said keith salter who is 
struggling with his droughtbaked wheat barley and oat farm near 
menoken nd 
it wont be like a crop but its better than nothing he 
said 
reagan said the legislation which also provides assistance to 
dairy cattlemen and ethanol producers represents the largest 
disaster relief measure in history 
congratulations to americas farmers for the indomitable 
spirit with which they have been facing this crisis he said 
the usda report estimated this years corn harvest at 448 
billion bushels down 37 percent from 1987 and the soybean harvest 
at 147 billion bushels down 23 percent from last year 
production of all wheat was indicated at 182 billion bushels 
down 13 percent 
earlier the national weather service said that its 10day 
outlook promised little relief from the dry spell with the 
exception of rains spawned by tropical storm beryl in the southeast 
the disasterrelief measure among other things provides aid 
for farmers suffering crop losses of more than 35 percent of their 
expected harvest because of the drought or other calamities the 
payments would be equal to 65 percent of the lost income farmers 
whose crop losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected yield would 
receive payments equal to 90 percent of lost income 
the measure also makes feed assistance available for producers 
of many varieties of livestock including cattle sheep goats 
pigs poultry horses used for food or in food production and fish 
used for food 
money for the payments is expected to come from savings that the 
government will realize as a result of the drought since farm 
incomesupport payments are based in part on how much individual 
growers produce with crops down because of the drought the amount 
the governmentowned commodity credit corp must put out in such 
payments is down also 
reagan noted that he was at one point concerned that the bill 
would be overloaded with costly specialinterest provisions and 
quoted krone as telling him lets save the christmas trees for 
the 25th of december 
well weve done just that reagan said 
the agriculture department said farmers intending to apply for 
relief under the drought bill should organize all their records and 
other evidence of their crop losses the department said however 
that the agricultural stabilization and conservation service would 
not be ready to start accepting applications for several weeks 
once the preliminary rulemaking for the program is complete 
farmers will apply to their ascs county agent for both the disaster 
payments and livestock feed assistance farmers seeking government 
loans also available under the program should contact their local 
farmers home administration offices usda said 
as approved by the senate the measure would have allowed 
ethanol manufacturers to buy as much as 2 million taxpayerowned 
bushels of corn a month each at bargain prices ethanol is ethyl 
alcohol that is mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol 
the final version reagan signed makes the program optional and 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng is not expected to put it in 
effect the measure also would put the subsidy off limits to huge 
corporations 
its not a perfect solution but it is a helping hand to those 
in need out there said rep e kika de la garza dtexas 
chairman of the house agriculture committee as ive stated all 
along hold on help is coming its a compassionate sensitive 
piece of legislation that hopefully will keep most of those that 
are suffering because of the drought in business 
its safe to say without this bill hundreds of thousands of 
farmers and ranchers would have faced bankruptcy this fall said 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee 
from a standpoint of proceeeding in farming itll make a 
difference whether the man farms after this year or not krone 
said 
asked if he could use some of the water being generously spread 
over the white house north lawn by an elaborate sprinkler system 
krone replied if i had the water id be sprinkling my crops

labor agreement and analysts said thursday the move could spark a 
new round of conflict between labor and management at the 
financially pressed airline 
members of the transport workers union voted by a substantial 
margin to reject the contract agreed on by the unions leadership 
and pan am management on july 15 union spokesman jim gannon said 
thursday he said the final vote count was not available yet 
the union represents about 5200 mechanics aircraft service 
personnel and flight dispatchers at new yorkbased pan am the 
nations eighthlargest airline 
pan am declined to comment on the vote which dealt the airline 
a major setback in its efforts to cut labor costs the vote against 
the contract fueled speculation that pan am could revive its recent 
threat to sell a large portion of its assets 
the proposed transport workers contract had called for a wage 
freeze in return for pan am withdrawing its threat to sell assets 
the airline engaged in sporadic talks with the transport workers 
since february originally had sought a 10 percent cut in wages 
its not going to be easy said john pincavage an airline 
analyst for painewebber inc they pan am could go back to the 
old way of threatening to do different things 
speculation has been rife in recent weeks that the embattled 
carrier could target for sale its relatively profitable south 
american routes and its maintenance operations in miami and new 
york 
in a recent interview pan am chairman thomas plaskett disclosed 
that potential buyers were lined up for the international routes 
the miami repair facility and parts of pan ams maintenance 
operations in new york 
plaskett also has threatened to close down the airline if 
wage cuts and other labor concessions arent made by all the unions 
management could take a softer approach and seek concessions 
from the transport workers on work rules and other nonpay issues 
instead of the wage freeze pincavage suggested 
pan am which lost 2653 million last year believes it needs 
about 540 million over three years in pay cuts and other 
concessions to turn itself around the contract with the transport 
workers would have saved the airline about 81 million over the 
next three years according to both the union and pan am 
pan am also is seeking 90 million in wage reductions from its 
flight attendants and has imposed 35 million in cuts on employees 
represented by the teamsters union under federal labor rules the 
unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed to cuts 
totaling about 240 million over three years 
efforts were underway thursday to bring together representatives 
of the three holdout unions the transport workers flight 
attendants and teamsters to propose a new round of joint 
negotiations to pan am said william genoese director of the 
teamsters airline division 
margaret brennan president of the flight attendants union at 
pan am said it was too early to tell how the transport workers 
vote would affect her unions situation 
the defeat of the transport workers contract raises the specter 
of renewed labormanagement strife at the airline like the conflict 
that exploded last february with the teamsters after their strike 
deadline passed leaders of the 4500member teamsters local vowed 
guerrilla warfare against pan am including deliberate 
diversion of baggage 
this time its not clear how close to the edge both sides are 
going to push it said anthony hatch an analyst for argus 
research corp 
he suggested that pan am could flex its muscle with the 
recalcitrant unions by selling profitable assets such as its world 
services subsidiary which sells security maintenance and other 
services to government agencies and other airlines

stock prices hovered in a narrow range today 
struggling to stabilize after the markets recent steep decline 
analysts said the markets drop over the past week had pushed 
prices down to levels where they attracted some buyers looking for 
bargains 
but they also said widespread concern persisted over the recent 
rise in interest rates 
several large banks raised their prime lending rates today from 
95 percent to 10 percent a day after the federal reserve 
increased the rate it charges on loans to private financial 
institutions 
the timing of the federal reserves increase in its discount 
rate from 6 percent to 65 percent suggested to many wall streeters 
that the fed was seriously worried about inflation and was becoming 
more aggressive in an attempt to stop it from heating up 
for one thing the rate increase came just as the treasury was 
beginning a quarterly sale of debt securities

batus inc on thursday extended its 44 
billion tender offer for farmers insurance group inc in what was 
described as a plan to demonstrate shareholders support for the 
proposed buyout 
the 63ashare cash tender offer to farmers shareholders set 
to expire thursday was extended until midnight wednesday the 
louisville kybased tobacco and retailing company said 
that is two days before the deadline on a parallel offer to 
management that offers 72 a share in cash if a friendly deal can 
be forged 
farmers which has said it would consider the higher bid had no 
comment on the extension 
the 63ashare offer values the company at 44 billion the 
72ashare offer for a friendly merger values it at 5 billion 
it is customary to announce the number of shares stockholders 
have tendered or offered to sell when an offer is extended with 
the extension of its 63ashare offer batus expects to have 
received offers from a significant number of shareholders before 
the deadline set on the higher bid to management 
announcing strong shareholder support would increase pressure on 
farmers management to negotiate a friendly buyout said spokesman 
gene russell 
as of aug 10 owners of 17 percent of farmers stock had 
offered to sell their shares batus said thursday 
that is considerably fewer than the approximately 30 percent 
batus reported had been tendered as of the last extension of the 
offer russell attributed the difference to institutional traders 
practice of tendering their shares immediately before such 
deadlines and then withdrawing them until the next deadline looms 
los angelesbased farmers and batus a subsidiary of bat 
industries plc of great britain also are fighting the takeover 
battle before insurance regulators in nine states

nations the united states japan great britain west germany 
france italy and canada continued to circulate even though no 
meeting has been scheduled

the market during the trading session while it was unclear whether 
the federal reserve was on hand selling dollars deluna said 
whoever did it did a good job of concealing who they were he 
said the dollar was sold mainly against the west german mark but 
other currencies also were affected 
earl johnson a vice president at harris trust and savings bank 
in chicago said all the rumors basically got the market pretty 
nervous and the dollar fell through several technical resistance 
levels

the condition of first republicbank corp of 
dallas was clearly worse than anyone of us knew when federal 
regulators created the bank by merging two troubled texas banks 
the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp testified 
thursday 
thirteen months after the merger of interfirst corp and 
republicbank corp the fdic took over firstrepublic in what may be 
the largest federal bank rescue ever 
the fdic is advancing 4 billion to help ncnb corp of 
charlotte nc acquire the bank the north carolina company has 
agreed to pay 210 million to 240 million to acquire a 20 percent 
stake in ncnb texas national bank for five years it will have an 
option to buy the remaining 80 percent from the fdic 
fdic chairman l william seidman estimated the goverment may 
recoup some of the 4 billion to reduce the agencys cost to 2 
billion to 3 billion which would still be more than the 17 
billion the fdic does not expect to recover from its 1984 bailout 
of continental illinois bank amp trust co of chicago 
at a hearing by the senate banking committee seidman said 
regulators knew the two dallas banks were in trouble but could not 
foresee that conditions would change rapidly and adversely after 
the merger took place 
while regulators knew both banks were in trouble seidman said 
officials believed the new institution had a reasonable chance to 
succeed 
although the merger was to result in an infusion of 200 million 
in new capital and annual reductions of 100 million in operating 
costs it was not enough to overcome these problems he said 
without the merger the two banks clearly would have failed 
he said 
banking committee chairman william proxmire dwis said 
auditing of the two banks before the merger was not sufficiently 
adequate 
the comptroller of the currencys office handles those audits 
and spokeswoman lee cross said that although a formal examination 
was not done before the merger the agency did a thorough review of 
the two banks loan portfolios 
in a letter to the federal reserve which had final approval of 
the merger the comptrollers office wrote in april 1987 
both interfirst and republic are seriously troubled 
institutions as confirmed by our recent onsite reviews we believe 
that their future viability depends on some form of outside 
assistance or other transaction such as the one proposed 
in developing our recommendation we were mindful of the fact 
that certain unresolved accounting questions as well as lingering 
difficulties in the texas economy may affect adversely some of the 
underlying financial projections in the proposals especially 
shortterm profitability 
also we are aware that the proposal is being viewed with some 
degree of skepticism by market funding sources whose continued 
support will be critical to the survival of the combined 
instituion these matters unquestionably are clear threats to the 
ultimate success of the proposal 
ms cross said the letter was not what you call a ringing 
endorsement of the merger proposal 
she said officials believed the real estate market in texas was 
about to turn around at the time of the merger but its failure to 
climb out of recession hit the new bank hard 
seidman said the fdic had recommended the merger 
sen bob graham dfla said he understood that the dallas 
branch of the federal reserve had recommended against the merger as 
imprudent but seidman said he did not know that to be the 
case 
seidman said the fdic may have two more large bank failures on 
the horizon but would not identify the banks their locations or 
when a collapse might occur 
when asked about the most pressing needs of the banking 
industry seidman said the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
needs prompt attention 
seidman said it could cost about 50 billion to restore health 
to the savings and loan industry while the federal home loan bank 
board regulator of the nations 3100 savings and loans puts the 
price tag at 31 billion

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply rose in the week ended aug 1 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 30277 billion from 30227 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
38232 billion from 38202 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose to a 
seasonally adjusted 7844 billion from 7819 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30151 billion a 61 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 38004 billion up 59 percent while m1 
rose 62 percent to an average of 7763 billion 
the fed said in mid1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent 
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 
percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since 
early 1987 
in other reports 
the federal reserve bank of new york reported commercial and 
industrial loans at major new york city banks fell 77 million in 
the week ended aug 3 compared with a decline of 102 million a 
week earlier 
the federal reserve said discount window borrowings from the 
federal reserve system averaged 525 million a day in the week 
ended wednesday down from 656 million the previous week 
the federal reserve said net free reserves totaled 124 million 
in the two weeks ended wednesday down from a revised 625 million 
in the previous twoweek period 
the federal reserve bank of st louis reported that the 
monetary base the seasonally adjusted total of member bank 
reserves held at federal reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and 
in circulation was 2779 billion in the twoweek period ended 
wednesday down from 2814 billion two weeks earlier

major us banks boosted the prime lending rate 
back into the double digits thursday for the first time in three 
years reflecting the federal reserves drive to push all interest 
rates higher to stave off inflation 
the halfpercentage point hike in the prime to 10 percent 
pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the spring of 
1985 it was the third increase in the rate so far this year and 
the second in a month 
because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixedand 
adjustablerate loans the increase is likely to pinch the 
pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise 
in recent months 
it will slow the economy but it wont stop it in its 
tracks explained robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
the investment firm nikko securities co international thats a 
healthy thing right now 
you try to get your flu shot before you get the flu thats 
preventative medicine thats what the fed is doing 
economists say the rise in the prime will affect small to 
mediumsized businesses and consumers more so than large 
corporations which borrow more cheaply in the open market by 
issuing commercial paper or shortterm unsecured ious 
home equity lines of credit are usually pegged to the banks 
prime rate while many home mortgages are tied to interest rates 
paid on treasury bills 
the financial markets took thursdays news in stride after 
weathering the storm that followed the feds increase in a key 
lending rate earlier in the week 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed 
up 516 to 203930 bond prices which generally decline in the 
face of rising interest rates ended mixed 
the dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies 
although the prime rate hike was credited by some european traders 
for preventing a free fall 
chase manhattan bank was the first to announce the prime hike 
thursday morning with other major banks across the country quickly 
following suit 
the increase brings the closely watched rate to its highest 
level since june 18 1985 when it was lowered to 95 percent from 
10 percent 
at the start of the year the prime stood at 85 percent it was 
raised to 9 percent on may 11 and then another half percentage 
point on july 14 
the latest move had been anticipated after the fed signaled its 
desire to tighten credit by raising its discount rate to 65 
percent from 6 percent on tuesday citing inflationary pressures 
the discount rate is the interest the fed charges on loans to 
member banks 
economists said banks were justified in raising the prime to the 
current doubledigit level because their own borrowing costs had 
risen rates banks pay on products such as certificates of deposits 
or money market accounts have been forced up although not at the 
same pace as bank loans 
the trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing 
concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be 
overheating and inflation creeping up 
elizabeth g reiners an economist for the investment firm dean 
witter reynolds inc said the catalyst for raising the prime came 
from the rising federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans 
between banks that rate which has lingered around 75 percent for 
most of the summer surged above 8 percent at the start of business 
thursday 
usually theres a pretty good correlation between the spread 
of fed funds and the prime rate she said

grain and soybean prices closed mostly lower thursday on the 
chicago board of trade but market analysts said new government 
estimates of a sharply smaller harvest could send prices higher on 
friday 
after trading closed for the day the agriculture department 
predicted the smallest harvest in 12 years from americas 
droughtstressed soybean fields 
on other markets thursday cattle futures moved lower while pork 
futures advanced precious metals were mixed energy futures 
gained and stockindex futures rose 
the usda estimated 1988 soybean production at 147 billion 
bushels based on crop conditions aug 1 that would be the smallest 
us soybean crop since the 1976 harvest of 129 billion bushels 
the governments soybean estimate was well below market 
expectations and should drive prices higher at the opening friday 
on all the chicago crop futures markets said jerry gidel an 
analyst in chicago with the gh miller division of lit america 
inc a britishowned commodities trading firm 
the soybean estimate represents a 23 percent decline from last 
years 191 billionbushel harvest grain traders and crop analysts 
had been expecting about a 20 percent reduction 
well you cant say the usdas holding back on that one 
gidel said they impressed everybody 
he said corn prices could rise despite the usda corn production 
estimate of 448 billion bushels which was higher than the market 
had expected the number represents a 37 percent drop from last 
years harvest of 706 bilion bushels 
the usda estimated wheat production at 182 billion bushels 14 
percent below the 1987 crop and oat production at 206 million 
bushels 45 percent lower than the 1987 harvest 
trader victor lespinasse of dean witter reynolds inc said the 
crop report could push grain prices higher on friday but said the 
increasing prospect of rain in the midwest on friday saturday and 
sunday could lead to some selling 
several private meteorologists added rain to their forecasts on 
thursday citing moisture moving northward from a tropical 
depression near the gulf coast the forecasts sparked a light 
selloff near the close of thursdays session 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in september at 382 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 
3 cents lower with september at 297 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
to 3 cents higher with september at 274 a bushel and soybeans 
were 6 cents to 19 cents lower with august at 856 a bushel 
pork futures rallied thursday on the chicago mercantile exchange 
as cash prices rose but cattle futures retreated on profittaking 
despite continued strength in the cash cattle markets 
fundamentally its hard to justify a break in cattle futures 
prices but i guess the market needed one after being so strong 
earlier in the week said philip stanley a livestock analysts 
with thomson mckinnon securities inc in chicago 
stanley said a leap in soybean futures prices could bring a 
corresponding jump in pork futures prices because soybean meal is 
used as feed for hogs 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 43 cent lower with august at 
6905 cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent to 50 cent lower 
with august at 8090 cents a pound hogs were 45 cent lower to 72 
cent higher with august at 4662 cents a pound and frozen pork 
bellies were 17 cent to 97 cent higher with august at 3572 cents 
a pound 
gold and silver prices were nearly unchanged thursday on new 
yorks commodity exchange 
the inflationary implications of a rise in grain prices should 
give the precious metals markets a boost said john oconnell 
metals analyst in new york with refco inc 
the crop report is likely to influence the metals for the next 
day or two he said it looked like some pretty horrendous 
numbers for the beans 
gold settled 20 cents lower to 10 cents higher with august at 
42930 a troy ounce silver was 05 cent to 12 cents higher with 
september at 6715 a troy ounce 
energy futures prices finished mostly higher in light trading on 
the new york mercantile exchange after fluctuating in a narrow 
range 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 23 cents 
higher with september at 1576 a barrel heating oil was 13 cent 
to 41 cent higher with september at 4456 cents a gallon and 
unleaded gasoline was 15 cent lower to 45 cent higher with 
september at 4602 cents a gallon 
stockindex futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange 
where the contract for september delivery of the standard amp poors 
500 index settled 115 points higher at 26320

the federal communications commission is 
satisfied with us sprint communications cos efforts to resolve 
billing complaints from its longdistance telephone customers an 
fcc official said thursday 
from our perspective the matter is closed said greg vogt 
chief of the enforcement division of the fccs common carrier 
bureau 
the fcc had sent us sprint a letter last month warning the phone 
company that it faced sanctions unless it did a better job 
responding to billing complaints 
the agency ordered us sprint to explain the procedures it has in 
place to investigate complaints forwarded by the fcc and outline 
what steps the company intended to take to speed resolution of 
these complaints 
in response to the letter us sprint earlier this week told the 
fcc it is getting fewer complaints about billing problems and that 
the problems are being resolved more quickly 
the fccs concern focused on the complaints that the agency 
receives from us sprint customers and forwards to the company at 
the time the letter was sent vogt said these complaints likely 
were far fewer than the number of customer complaints sent directly 
to us sprint 
but us sprint says it is well on the way to resolving the 
billing problems that plagued the company after it was formed in 
july 1986 as a joint venture of gte corps sprint and united 
telecommunications us telecom united telecommunications will take 
a majority ownership of us sprint later this year 
us sprint officials have blamed much of their billing problems 
on the merging of the two phone systems 
we think the severe billing problems we had in the past are 
pretty much behind us said leon kestenbaum a us sprint vice 
president who met with fcc officials about the matter on wednesday 
there are always going to be some things that arent perfect 
but basically we think the problem is well over 90 percent 
solved he said 
vogt said the agency was very pleased with us sprints 
efforts to resolve quickly customer complaints about bills he 
added that the fcc will continue to monitor the companys 
performance and well see in the next few months whether they 
live up to their promises 
us sprint is the nations thirdlargest longdistance company 
after american telephone amp telegraph co and mci communications

the pittsburgh supercomputing center said 
thursday it has ordered a powerful new computer nearly two years 
before cray research inc expects to produce the machine 
the order was made public in a joint statement by 
minneapolisbased cray and the pittsburgh center which is a joint 
venture of the university of pittsburgh carnegie mellon university 
and westinghouse electric corp 
we think proteins are the key to biochemistry and we want to 
establish the foremost protein research center in the country 
here carnegie mellon president cyert said one of the most 
critical elements is the supercomputer center 
as part of a contract the center will make a 10 million down 
payment for the 25 million machine which is not scheduled for 
delivery until the third quarter of 1990 
cray officials said this was the first time the company had 
committed itself to selling a specific supercomputer so early in 
development and they admitted being concerned because of the great 
amount of work remaining to be done 
theres no reason to believe that we will not be successful 
said edward a masi crays vice president of marketing but you 
never know until you ship the product 
the machine to be known as the cray 3 is expected to be the 
worlds most powerful supercomputer capable of speeds at least 
three times as fast as todays quickest machine it also would be 
the first commercial computer to be based on gallium arsenide 
rather than on silicon microelectronics 
cray hopes to have a prototype ready for testing by the end of 
this year 
under terms of its contract with cray the supercomputing center 
will first purchase a cray ymp a machine introduced in february 
the ymp capable of 26 billion calculations per second will be 
traded in for the cray 3 when that machine is ready 
after accounting for that tradein and another on a cray xmp 
that the center already owns the entire contract will be worth 
about 30 million cyert said 
cray executives acknowledge difficult problems must be 
surmounted before the cray 3 can be built 
cyert said the supercomputing centers contract contains a 
number of escape clauses if cray cannot meet certain target dates 
the cray 3 is the latest creation of seymour cray the computer 
designer who founded cray research in 1972 if the machine fulfills 
its promise it will represent the fifth time that cray has set a 
new standard for computer speed and power 
he has said the new computer under development for six years 
will make as many as 16 billion calculations per second that is 10 
times as fast as his last machine the cray 2 and at least three 
times as fast as the eta10 made by eta systems inc a control 
data corp subsidiary 
cray research is turning to gallium arsenide for its 
semiconductor chips because electricity passes through the compound 
more rapidly than through silicon and dissipates less quickly the 
result is a faster chip that uses less power it also produces less 
heat allowing chips to be more densely packed into the machine 
gallium arsenide computer chips have been used in semiconductor 
testing equipment and specialized military equipment but the cray 
3 is the farthest anyone has gone in the commercial field said 
gene miles president of aztek associates a technology consulting 
firm 
officials of the supercomputing center said they ordered the 
ymp and the cray 3 to assure that researchers would have the most 
advanced computers 
the 3yearold pittsburgh supercomputing center is one of five 
such centers established around the country with financing from the 
national science foundation

an annual agriculture department survey 
confirmed thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall 
corn harvest by a third or more resulting in higher retail food 
prices for months and years to come 
however government officials said bountiful crops in recent 
years has built stockpiles so high the united states need not fear 
actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting 
food 
the report came hours after president reagan signed a 39 
billion relief bill that he acknowledged wont bring rain to crops 
already sweltering but hopefully will help farmers survive to 
plant again next spring 
the new surveys led usda experts to predict the 1988 corn crop 
will total 448 billion bushels down 37 percent from last years 
harvest and the smallest output since 1983 
sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans wheat and a 
number of other crops cotton which thrived last month in the hot 
humid weather is expected to increase from last year 
overall the departments agricultural statistics board put 
total us crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average a 
scale used to compare output from year to year that matched the 
low 1983 reading when sharp cutbacks in government acreage 
programs along with drought reduced crop production sharply 
the corn crop is expected to average 785 bushels per harvested 
acre down from 1194 bushel per acre last year a record 
yeartoyear decline of 34 percent 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american 
farmers and as a feed ingredient is essential to the production 
of meat poultry and dairy products 
assistant secretary ewen m wilson the departments chief 
economist said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food 
this year 2 percent next year 
todays reports confirm that the drought has had a major 
impact on this years crops wilson told reporters but because 
of large preseason stocks total supplies are enough in most cases 
to assure and adequate food supply at home satisfy foreign 
customers and meet our foodaid commitments 
sen patrick j leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said in a statement todays crop report confirms our 
fears about the impacts of this summers tragic drought 
fortunately it appears we will have enough stocks to make it 
through this marketing year 
the usdas grim news came hours after president reagan on 
thursday signed a 39 billion disaster relief bill aimed at 
helping droughtstricken farmers recover 
this bill isnt as good as rain reagan said to the nations 
farmers but it will tide you over until normal weather and your 
own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role 
the new usda crop estimates were based on field surveys as of 
aug 1 in may and june before drought had made its biggest 
impact usda projected the corn harvest based on trends and an 
assumption of normal weather at 73 billion bushels 
but those projections were revised downward a month ago to 52 
billion bushels assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder 
of the season 
the soybean harvest was estimated at 147 billion bushels down 
23 percent from 19 billion bushels produced last year prospects 
last spring called for about 188 billion bushels and the july 
projection was 165 billion bushels 
production of all wheat was indicated at 182 billion bushels 
down 13 percent from 21 billion produced in 1987 in may and june 
the usda forecast this years output would be up slightly the july 
projection was 184 billion bushels 
the wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall which 
barely stayed ahead of the drought later plantings of durum and 
other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness 
winter wheat production was estimated at 155 billion bushels 
down 1 percent from last year but durum and the other spring 
varieties which are produced in the hardhit northern plains 
showed sharp declines 
durum was estimated at 546 million bushels down 41 percent 
from last years harvest and other spring wheat was shown at 212 
million bushels down 53 percent from 1987 
cotton production was estimated at 149 million bales up 1 
percent from last year the crop was projected at 137 billion 
bales in july 
department officials said us grain production this year is 
expected to total 192 million metric tons 31 percent smaller than 
the 1987 output the total grain supply for 198889 which 
includes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season is 
down 24 percent from last season 
in addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields wilson 
said production of some other springplanted crops has suffered 
including oats 206 million bushels down 45 percent barley 288 
million bushels also down 45 percent and sorghum 561 million 
bushels down 24 percent 
wilson said usda experts continue to believe that the drought 
will add only one percentage point to consumer food prices this 
year 
the department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3 
percent to 5 percent before the heat and dry weather usda had 
expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer 
price index for food next year 
thats on top of an additional estimated increase in food 
prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent wilson said so 
this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent 
he also said the united states is looking at an export 
situation that is not as good as it was a year ago he said 
production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food 
supply caused by the drought 
our figures here today would indicate that food production in 
other countries has not been cut that much he said there 
remained a possibility that the united states would import some 
soybeans this year wilson said 
he scoffed at any suggestion however that the united states 
may have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses he 
noted that 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production 
this year in addition to millions of additional acres in the 
longterm conservation reserve program 
meanwhile usda weatherman norton strommen said rain in the 
midcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought 
the drought as you can see is still basically with us 
throughout the entire united states strommen said

the house voted thursday to end all us 
investment in whitedominated south africa and impose a neartotal 
trade embargo in what opponents called an electionyear politcal 
ploy 
supporters hailed the sweeping disinvestmenttrade embargo 
measure approved 244132 as a lastchance opportunity to bring 
strong economic pressure to bear to help end south africas 
apartheid system of racial separation 
republican opponents said the bill represents needlessly 
destructive economic warfare and a scorched earth policy 
intended to score political points for democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis and democratic political activist jesse 
jackson on the eve of the gop national convention 
in the rapidly dwindling time remaining in the 100th congress 
it is uncertain at best that the bill will be passed by the senate 
or be cleared by congress over presidents reagans likely veto 
in a policy statement the administration said reagans senior 
advisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if it 
emerges from congress in its present form because it undermines 
the presidents ability to conduct foreign policy 
before the final vote the house rejected three 
republicansponsored amendments all aimed at diluting or reversing 
the impact of the sanctions 
it defeated 236154 an amendment by rep william broomfield 
rmich to permit the president to waive all sanctions if west 
germany france britain italy and japan do not impose sanctions 
of equal strength it also would have authorized the president to 
extend us aid to help develop black private enterprise in south 
africa 
rep jon l kyl rariz was dealt a 214169 defeat on his 
amendment to permit the president to waive the section of the bill 
barring military and intelligence cooperation with south africa if 
he certifies that is in the best interest of the united states 
the house also defeated 259145 an amendment by rep dan 
burton rind to strike all new sanctions while retaining the 
more limited sanctions imposed in 1986 the amendment would have 
urged us companies operating in south africa to contribute 15 
percent of their payroll to black development projects 
broomfield insisted the sanctions bill was politically motivated 
some of us wonder if the real purpose is to be responsive to 
the jacksondukakis foreign policy broomfield said 
we are not bringing this bill to embarrass republicans said 
rep ronald dellums dcalif principal sponsor of the measure 
we are here to free black south africa this has nothing to do 
with presidential politics 
in an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from his 
colleagues dellums told the house i listened to those who said 
this is going to hurt blacks its going to hurt corporations but 
human beings will struggle for their freedom in peace if they can 
in violence if they must that pales every single argument you 
have made we must end the madness of apartheid 
at the state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
additional sanctions against south africa are much more likely to 
retard the end of apartheid than to accelerate its end 
we particularly regret the timing of this house action which 
comes at a delicate moment in the important serious us mediation 
efforts between south africa angola and cuba she said 
the house debate is more likely to complicate than to promote 
their successful conclusion 
the us effort is aimed at encouraging the withdrawal of cuban 
and south african forces from angola and independence and black 
majority rule for namibia 
the disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economic 
sanctions voted by congress in 1986 they banned all new public and 
private loans and investments in south africa and barred certain 
imports and exports 
the bill contains these major provisions 
all us investment in south africa would be banned and us 
corporations with such investments would be compelled to divest 
them the investment ban would not apply to any business in which 
blacks or other nonwhites have at least a 90 percent ownership 
interest 
all south african imports to the united states would be banned 
except for certain strategic minerals and publications the 1986 
sanctions law banned only agricultural products coal textiles 
uranium and military vehicles 
all us exports to south africa would be prohibited with the 
exception of agricultural products publications and us public 
and private assistance 
the bill bars an american company or vessel from transporting 
crude or refined oil to south africa americans also would be 
forbidden to engage in the production of nuclear material in south 
africa
