the marines tend to change the address to any marine as they 
read the notes many of them in care packages of toll house cookies

we are very thankful for your fighting for our country 
the least we could do was make you some homemade cookies wrote 
two children 8yearold chris horrigan and his 4yearold sister

the marines tended to avoid popcorn shipments which arrived 
stale cookies were a hit but nothing brought whoops of joy like 
racy books or perfumed envelopes

us troops in the region will be able to mail their letters 
postcards and cassettes free of charge after all 
the pentagon said friday that it agreed with the us postal 
service to go ahead with the free mail service despite the lack of 
action on pending congressional legislation permitting such a move 
the decision clears up a problem that arose earlier this week 
when the postal service said it was ready to go ahead with the 
privilege but the pentagon said it lacked congressional 
authorization 
the free mail authorization will be funded by the postal service 
as an interim measure until legislation allows the appropriated 
funds for postage the pentagon said in a statement

more than tax increases and spending cuts are 
at stake in the nearly roundtheclock deficitreduction 
negotiations between congressional and bush administration 
officials 
as they struggle to avert wholesale cuts in federal programs 
next month the presidents aides and top members of congress also 
must decide how to divide targeted tax cuts that would cost more 
than 20 billion over the next five years the intended 
beneficiaries include rich investors giant corporations 
firsttime homebuyers and workers pursuing employerfinanced 
educations 
most of a dozen tax benefits that expire this year enjoy wide 
support in congress and are backed by the administration thus 
their renewal is likely to be attached to any deficit package 
approved by the negotiators that package likely will be the only 
tax bill passed this year 
the fate of another big proposed tax cut one that has been the 
subject of a running battle between congress and president bush 
since he took office is far less certain the administration 
insists on including in the package a cut in the tax on capital 
gains but democratic leaders are saying that cant be done unless 
overall income tax rates on upperincome americans are raised to 
pay for it 
senate republican negotiators on friday reacted angrily to 
implications that their party is trying to favor the rich that 
is the old democrat lie that has been out here for 20 30 40 
years said gop leader bob dole of kansas 
his anger was prompted by disclosure of an analysis showing that 
a package of tax increases offered by republicans would lopsidedly 
favor higherincome americans chiefly because nearly 80 percent 
of the benefit of a capital gains reduction would go to those with 
incomes over 100000 a year 
negotiators apparently had little success in another day of 
closeddoor meetings friday at nearby andrews air force base in 
maryland they will try again sunday hoping for quick agreement 
but promising nothing 
as far as progress is concerned griped sen pete domenici 
rnm were nowhere 
the goal of the talks is a plan to slash 50 billion from the 
budget deficit during the 12 months that begin oct 1 plus another 
450 billion in the following four years without an agreement the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law will be triggered forcing 100 
billion in cuts in most federal programs 
but while most of the government is focused on the need to rein 
in spending the budget negotiators have their eyes on renewing 
several tax breaks that otherwise would die this year 
the biggest special benefit likely to be added to the 
antideficit package is supported by bush and most members of 
congress it would cut business taxes by more than 92 billion 
over the next five years by renewing a credit and deduction rules 
aimed at increasing investment in research and experimentation 
another 37 billion would go to investors who build or 
rehabilitate rental housing available for lowincome people 
among other expiring tax breaks that are likely to be renewed a 
14 billion credit for part of the wages employers pay newly hired 
lowincome workers a 17 billion exclusion for a limited amount 
ot tuition that employers pay for workers a 546 million exclusion 
for employerfinanced legal aid for workers a 770 million subsidy 
for lowerincome people buying a first home and a 18 billion 
credit to help selfemployed people pay for health insurance

duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is with the 14 
guardsmen as they deploy overseas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after two weeks of hard training comes 
the hardest day 
its all right hon its going to be fine sgt earnest 
deloach said over and over as his wife lillie sobbed into his big 
chest its okay 
the 265th quartermaster detachment was leaving for the mideast 
ima jean rooker went to hug her son spc mark rooker a big 
strapping boy of 20 whose desert camouflage uniform was hung with 
canteens chemical warfare gear and his m16 
her smile dissolved into tears as she reached out for her 
youngest ooh was all she managed to say 
rookers father jerry stood to the side reaching in around 
his sunglasses to rub his eyes 
nineteen days ago rooker was a college student deloach was a 
prison supervisor and the rest of the 14man unit of the south 
carolina national guard worked jobs from truck driving to 
construction 
but military planners determined they needed water purification 
specialists in saudi arabia and the allendale sc unit showed up 
on someones list 
the unit was mobilized and rushed through a busy training 
schedule of physical conditioning marksmanship chemical warfare 
and radio communications 
now it was time for goodbyes 
it reminds me of your gi joe days mrs rooker said to her 
son her voice choking 
ill be home before you know it rooker said there was an 
uncomfortable silence 
suddenly spc ulysses calhoun began to sing sometimes i feel 
like a nut sometimes i dont 
everyone laughed and the tension was broken 
calhoun a 23yearold construction worker was usually the one 
to complain about the duty or the weather or the food today he was 
light and breezy joking with everyone and playing with his 
daughter whitney a fearless 3yearold who marched around with a 
us flag in her hand her fathers desertissue sunglasses propped 
on her face 
daddy why you always wearing the same clothes she asked 
pointing to his uniform 
whitney had seen her father on local television a number of 
times but calhoun was unimpressed with his celebrity 
id rather i was on a game show he said 
the goodbyes lingered through most of the day the unit traveled 
to hunter army air field in a tight little convoy of four pickup 
trucks and one van the families followed in their cars headlights 
on like a funeral procession 
no one talked in the crowded van why yall so quiet sgt 
john williams asked how about some music 
no one noticed the rap music booming out of the radio mostly 
they napped or stared out the window at signs and yellow ribbons 
wishing godspeed to troops already departed for saudi arabia 
the 265ths immediate destination was a large open airplane 
hangar halffilled with cots a color television bleachers video 
arcade games portable latrines and magazines in eastern airline 
folders creedence clearwater revival and pink floyd echoed from a 
loudspeaker in the rafter 
this was lockup a holding area for men and material 
shipping out to the mideast once in the men couldnt leave their 
families werent allowed near the area 
so the families gathered in bleachers set 1000 yards away to 
watch their husbands and sons load duffel bags and flak jackets 
onto one of their trucks 
a while later the families sent over packages of fried chicken 
and had their own picnic as the men ate in the sweltering heat of 
the runway 
but finally it was time for the families to go they shouted 
and waved as the men rushed out to wave back 
goodbye goodbye they called their voices high and thin in 
the distance

the us military is handing out 
radios and more newspapers to gis hungry for news but its not 
printing or broadcasting anything the strictly moslem government 
could deem religious or racy 
in the early weeks of the deployment troops often asked 
visitors to send copies of local newspapers saying they knew 
little about their mission or the situation back home 
operation desert shield since has spawned two new newspapers 
the desert defender and the desert dragon as well as several more 
informal newsletters 
the military this week distributed portable radios by the dozens 
at base camps so the troops can hear armed forces radio and local 
englishlanguage broadcasts 
the radios were distributed after the military refined 
programming to make sure none of the broadcasts include religious 
programming or gospel music 
we are being very sensitive to the culture of the host 
country army col rick kiernan said we want to get the troops 
music information and sports programming but we also want to be 
good guests 
a transmitter was recently installed in saudi arabia to relay 
the radio and armed force television also is available in some 
areas where us troops are housed in military housing or hotels 
television programming includes sports news and other shows 
transmitted under agreements with the us cable news network espn 
and the major television networks 
the air force published the first issue of the weekly desert 
defender last week and issued no 2 a few days ago 
most of the editorial material is written by air force public 
affairs personnel included on the front page of the second issue 
was the text of president bushs aug 30 address to the troops 
also on the front page is a photograph of the f117a stealth 
fighter which reporters have been asking to see for several weeks 
the paper also contains comics and a crossword puzzle 
the desert dragon a fourpage newspaper printed on glossy paper 
by a local public relations and advertising firm will publish its 
first issue within days 
articles include details of the arrival of several army units 
and the availability of legal advice to the troops 
capt michael edrington of the 49th public affairs office 
detachment which publishes the dragon said it has a 40000 
budget to print 10000 issues a week for 12 weeks 
he said there will be no pictures of women unless they are in 
uniform and performing military duties 
cheesecake isnt done any more said edrington who has a 
staff of five enlisted men helping him with the paper 
one of the men specialist michael hixson of fort lauderdale 
fla said the first issue almost was delayed because the arab 
printers reading from right to left as is their custom typeset 
the columns too wide 
it was pretty hokey for awhile but we got it done hixson 
said you got a deadline you got to meet it

kuwait once a showcase of stability and 
wealth has been ravaged beyond recognition by saddam husseins 
marauding soldiers and by civilian iraqi looters recent escapees 
say 
some report indiscriminate shootings of kuwaitis and random 
terrorizing of western residents 
kuwait city has become a city of ghosts following iraqs 
aug 2 invasion said hussein mohammad 23 a palestinian graduate 
student who was interviewed on arrival in amman jordan 
people are afraid to walk the streets at night in order not to 
get caught in the middle of clashes between iraqi troops and 
kuwaiti resistance said mohammad who was born in kuwait 
all that you hear at night is gunfire or explosions during 
heavy clashes he said 
elizabeth walters an evacuee from kuwait who arrived in britain 
on wednesday told of a british man in kuwait who was taken off 
into the desert blindfolded and told to get out of the car then 
iraqi soldiers threatened to kill him she said 
he was then pushed back into the car and they drove him round 
again and did the same threatening to kill him again she said 
they were terrorizing him just for the sheer hell of it 
part of the terror for remaining westerners is trying to avoid 
detection 
the us state department said wednesday that iraq was 
intensifying its efforts to find american men in kuwait most 
likely to use them as human shields at military targets in iraq 
in kuwait there has been increased harassment of us 
citizens and more systematic housetohouse searches for american 
men are now being conducted department spokesman richard boucher 
said 
kuwaitis also live in fear the iraqis are shooting kuwaiti 
people and burning their houses down for writing slanderous 
graffiti against them said deborah ahmed a briton who was 
evacuated to london this week 
other western refugees have told of such slayings 
the plundering was not limited to the military said mohammad 
the business student 
i saw iraqi women looting the muthana shopping center on fhad 
al salem street a few days after the invasion i saw scores of 
iraqi women carrying away bags full of clothing and shoes running 
out of shops he said 
after saddam issued an order to hang all looters the iraqi 
civilians left for home mohammad said but what is the use of 
the order people had already stolen everything in the city and 
there was nothing much left to worry about 
but mohammad said iraqi authorities have hanged numerous iraqi 
civilians and officials including an army colonel for looting 
i saw the hanging of col kathem khazal who was accused of 
stealing money from the people he said he was hanged on aug 
25 in front of the town hall in front of hundreds of people his 
body was left hanging for at least four hours so everybody could 
see it 
gasoline stations are open and water and electricity are still 
available throughout kuwait city except at most of the holdout 
foreign embassies that refuse to shut down 
egyptian diplomats left kuwait this week because conditions had 
become unbearable an egyptian official in cairo said they 
couldnt take it any more 
a businessman working for a bahrainbased firm who would only be 
identified as bs said families put their garbage on the streets 
and burn it 
by many acounts the most critical problem people face is 
obtaining enough food to eat 
people drive round the streets to buy food from anyone 
selling bs said 
mohammad said food prices have risen four times in some cases a 
carton of 30 eggs sells for 8 
some people even go to basra or baghdad just to shop for 
food he said the trip to iraq includes a stretch across the 
desert of more than 310 miles

senate judiciary committee members on both 
sides of the abortion issue have failed to extract from supreme 
court nominee david souter his view of how he would approach the 
subject on the nations highest court 
but the responses from the new hampshire judge could make either 
side nervous 
in his second day of testimony friday souter denied he would 
join the supreme court with any decision already made on 
overturning the 1973 abortion rights ruling in roe vs wade 
i have not got any agenda on what should be done with roe vs 
wade i would listen to both sides of that case i have not made up 
my mind he said 
he later strenuously declined an invitation from sen edward 
kennedy dmass to express his view legalisms aside on the 
morality of abortion 
feminist groups convinced by his remarks that souter would join 
other conservatives on the court in voting to overturn roe v wade 
held a protest friday calling for his rejection 
but during the hearing souter also gave some pause to the 
antiabortion side 
explaining his vote in favor of allowing abortions at a hospital 
on whose board he served souter spoke of the health risks women 
would face if they had no such facility and sought abortions 
anyway 
the discussion sounded much like the rationale of people who 
object personally to abortion but still oppose making it illegal 
but souter said the vote did not necessarily reflect his moral 
outlook 
souter also lavished praise upon justice william brennan the 
liberal prochoice justice whose retirement created the vacancy 
souter would fill if confirmed 
whatever his personal feelings souter insisted they will play 
absolutely no role in his decisionmaking once on the court 
just before the hearings broke for the weekend the questioning 
got testy for the first time in the two days as kennedy pressed 
souter on the nominees defense of a new hampshire literacy test 
for voters 
kennedy read a quote attributed to souter that the votes of 
illiterates dilute the votes of those people who can read when 
souter responded that is kind of a statement of math kennedy 
suggested that reasoning was callous 
thats something that i find is troublesome kennedy said 
when kennedy also hammered at souters apparent lack of 
compassion in the case of two elderly ailing brothers who failed 
in seeking unemployment benefits after being laid off from 
parttime work the nominee pointed to the legislature for passing 
the law that created the situation 
but souter was far from entirely opposed to the judiciary 
stepping in when the legislature didnt act 
asked by sen charles grassley riowa about activist judges 
and rights created by the courts souter said he believed the 
supreme court is left to act alone when the political branches do 
not act beforehand 
souter said in brown vs board of education the 1954 decision 
that outlawed racial segregation in public schools the court acted 
because we had no decision from any other branch of the 
government at any other level of the government facing the 
undoubted constitutional problem that had to be solved 
souters testimony before the committee resumes monday the 
committee also will hear from legal experts 
after the hearings are completed the judiciary committee will 
meet to recommend full senate action if confirmed souter would 
become the 105th person to serve on the nations highest court

transportation secretary samuel skinner is 
labeling as unrealistic and irresponsible senate legislation that 
would require tougher auto fuel economy standards saying it would 
cause hundreds of additional traffic deaths 
skinner denounced the legislation friday only hours after the 
senate voted 6828 to consider the proposal next week 
the measure would require automakers to increase average fuel 
economy of new cars to 35 miles per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles 
per gallon by 2001 
supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements once 
fully implemented would save 28 million barrels of oil a day but 
key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure 
skinner told a news conference that if the measure clears 
congress he would strongly advise president bush to veto it 
but the measure likely will run into serious opposition in the 
house where supporters must maneuver around the energy and 
commerce committee whose chairman rep john dingell dmich is 
strongly opposed to the legislation 
skinner said the bill is unrealistic irresponsible and more 
important unattainable he said auto executives have convinced 
him there is no technology to achieve the bills goals without 
making cars smaller 
it should be called the highway fatality bill skinner said 
he cited a new study by the national highway traffic safety 
administration that concluded there is a clear link between 
reducing the size of cars and increasing numbers of traffic deaths 
joan claybrook nhtsa administrator during the carter 
administration and now president of the consumer group public 
citizen disputed claims that cars necessarily will have to be made 
smaller to burn less fuel 
she cited a transportation department research vehicle built in 
the 1970s that achieved 43 mpg while providing occupants improved 
protection over conventional cars 
sen donald riegle dmich who has led the opposition to the 
plan said he would continue the fight against bringing the measure 
to a vote next week 
weve just had the first inning of this nineinning game 
said riegle we hope and intend to win this fight 
but the senate vote reflected the growing support in congress 
for an effort to reduce us reliance on foreign oil a subject in 
the spotlight since iraqs invasion and annexation of kuwait early 
last month 
in floor debate riegle said the bills fuel savings wouldnt 
likely begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to todays 
oil crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 mph 
later a riegle spokeswoman said the senator didnt necessarily 
support a change in the speed limit and would vote against such a 
measure if it were introduced 
sen richard bryan dnev the bills sponsor described the 
measure as a message to the automakers that theyre going to have 
to look at fuel economy and not just muscle cars

asian refugees heading home from kuwait are 
finding more strife in the desert even after being moved from a 
nightmare camp on the iraqi border 
relief officials closed the squalid shaalan i border camp on 
thursday and transferred about 5000 indians to an organized tent 
city near azraq 50 miles east of the capital amman 
but 14 hours after arriving on a barren windswept slope most 
of them had gone unfed and on friday they appeared worried about 
their future 
this morning we are eating only dust said jose daniel as 
the constant wind blew clouds of ochrecolored powder across the 
camp situated on a field of lava rocks 
the red cross which built the azraq i camp distributed 
sandwiches bread fruit and vegetables a couple of hours later 
but that did little to relieve the uncertainty and bewilderment 
among the refugees 
we thought we were going to amman they brought us here in the 
night said pa abraham who was among the indians bused from 
shaalan i 
he and others said they had left cooking utensils and some food 
behind at the border camp 160 miles away 
they told us we would have everything we left all our things 
behind so as not to carry extra luggage said achuthan sreekumar 
compared with shaalan i a haphazard collection of makeshift 
tents that sprang up on the border after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait azraq i is a model camp 
shaalan is population swelled to as many as 50000 indians 
bangladeshis pakistanis sri lankans and filipinos 
many were stranded for up to two weeks with little food and

the fourth countdown for space 
shuttle columbia began early today after nasa checked and rechecked 
for hydrogen leaks that halted two earlier launch attempts 
columbia was scheduled to lift off with seven astronauts and an 
astronomical observatory at 128 am edt tuesday 
the space agency replaced a temperature sensor after a helium 
test found a slight leak thursday said bascom murrah in charge of 
prelaunch operations the sensor about the size of a spark plug 
is on a fuel line leading to one of three main engines in the rear 
compartment 
a final check produced no further leaks murrah said 
earlier in the week workers replaced a crushed seal on a fuel 
valve engineers believe hydrogen entered columbias rear 
compartment around the seal during fueling for the first launch 
attempt in may and one last week 
murrah said he was more confident than he has been for months 
until this week we were shotgunning it we were going at the 
thing even if we didnt know it was leaking murrah said we 
have found two definite leaks to me that says weve actually 
found something and fixed it 
the true test will come when more than a halfmillion gallons of 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are pumped into columbia on 
monday none of the other countdowns have made it past that point 
time quickly is running out for the astronomy mission nasa will 
try for a few days to launch columbia before turning its attention 
to discovery which must lift off with a sun probe by oct 23 or 
face a 13month delay 
discovery is the only shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not 
been found it was the last shuttle to fly carrying the flawed 
hubble space telescope into orbit in april atlantis was grounded 
in june 
columbias astronauts return to kennedy space center this 
weekend for another try at getting off the ground four of them are 
astronomers who will operate the 150 million observatory called 
astro 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope 
will observe more than 260 highenergy objects some of them 
millions of degrees problems with the xray telescope forced nasa 
to halt columbias second countdown late last month 
the observatory will remain in columbias cargo bay throughout 
the nineto 10day mission

scientists say a hormone they found appears to 
play a role in development of high blood pressure and could lead to 
a new test for hypertension 
researchers from the university of maryland school of medicine 
and the upjohn co said it is possible drugs could be developed to 
block the activity of the hormone which is still unnamed 
the scientists said they do not fully understand how the hormone 
affects blood pressure or how many cases of hypertension it could 
be responsible for 
the announcement thursday came on the first day of the american 
heart associations threeday conference on hypertension 
high blood pressure affects an estimated 60 million americans 
and is a leading cause of heart attack stroke kidney failure and 
congestive heart failure 
the scientists said the hormone appears to be similar to 
ouabaine which was extracted from tropical trees and shrubs by 
south american indians to make poison darts 
the hormone apparently circulates in everyones blood system 
the researchers said scientists detected the hormone during eight 
years of studying dogs cats rats sheep pigs and cows 
its kind of surprising that something like a poison can be 
present normally in the circulation of every mammalian species we 
looked at said dr john m hamlyn associate professor of 
physiology at the maryland university 
early in the century physicians prescribed ouabaine to 
stimulate sluggish hearts later they switched to digitalis 
because it was less toxic 
the scientists said abnormally high levels of the hormone appear 
to impede cells lining the blood vessels from expelling sodium 
this upsets the cells chemical balance causing them to retain 
abnormally high levels of calcium 
elevated calcium causes the vessels to constrict more than they 
should raising blood pressure said dr mordecai p blaustein 
chairman of physiology at maryland 
reasons to measure levels of the ouabainelike compound in 
peoples blood include children who have normal blood pressure but 
a family history of hypertension they could be tested for elevated 
hormone levels and to see if they risk developing high blood 
pressure 
such a test also could be used to see whether someone has bona 
fide hypertension or white coat hypertension which is a 
passing elevation in blood pressure caused by anxiety 
a mistaken diagnosis can condemn patients to years and years 
of drug therapy hamlyn said

joe and joyce cruzan say they arent ready to 
give up on their lengthy battle in the courts to allow their 
daughter to die 
the missouri couple whose 33yearold daughter nancy was the 
subject of the supreme courts first righttodie ruling said 
friday they hope to succeed in a new legal effort 
the bottom line is we havent stopped fighting yet because we 
believe in what were doing said cruzan a sheet metal worker 
from carterville mo 
he and his wife on friday spoke at a law and medical symposium 
on the righttodie issue 
the couple last month asked a missouri state court for 
permission to remove the tube that carries food and water to their 
braindamaged daughter they cited new evidence saying three 
people had come forward recently with information about her wishes 
concerning lifesustaining medical treatment 
the supreme court in its first righttodie decision ruled 
that the cruzans lacked clear and convincing proof that their 
daughter would want to die in the 54 decision the justices said 
states have broad power to keep patients on lifesupport systems 
when they have not made their wishes known conclusively 
in their friday appearance the cruzans made their first 
extensive public remarks since the ruling last june they received 
a standing ovation from the nearly 500 people in attendance 
they expressed frustration with the legal system but said they 
were not angered by the supreme courts decision 
we were not surprised and it was kind of strange in a way to 
hear people say well its finally over because it wasnt over 
for us said mrs cruzan 
her husband declined to comment extensively on the pending case 
but said i feel like that the new witnesses coupled with the 
existing testimony if thats not clear and convincing then i dont 
know how youre going to achieve that unless nancy can raise up 
from her bed and write out something and then lay back 
no hearing has been held on their latest request 
nancy cruzan has been in a comalike condition called a 
persistent vegetative state since a 1983 automobile accident 
there are an estimated 10000 americans receiving similar 
lifesustaining care

people living in or near counties with nuclear 
facilities face no increased risk of death from cancer results of 
a government study show 
but the survey methods used in the twoyear investigation the 
results of which were released friday by the department of health 
and human services said friday did not permit an assessment of 
risks in more limited areas around a facility the head researcher 
cautions groups concerned about the health and environmental 
effects of nuclear power pointed to that flaw in the study 
hhs secretary louis sullivan called the national cancer 
institute survey an important step in evaluating the possible 
hazards of living near nuclear facilities he said other studies 
at the state and federal level are in progress 
ncis mortality survey involved 107 counties across the nation 
containing or close to 62 nuclear facilities 
among the facilities were 52 commercial plants nine energy 
department research and weapons plants and one commercial 
fuelreprocessing plant all of which began operating before 1982 
hhs said in a statement that cancer institute researchers 
examined deaths from 16 types of cancer including leukemia cancer 
death rates in the 107 counties with or near nuclear facilities 
were compared to cancer rates in a control group of 292 similar 
counties with no nuclear facilities nearby 
the agency said some of the 107 counties had higher rates of 
certain cancers than the control counties and some had lower rates 
either before or after the facilities came on line 
there was no convincing evidence of any increased risk of 
death from any of the cancers we surveyed due to living near 
nuclear facilities said john boice chief of ncis radiation 
epidemiology branch 
however boice said the counties may be too large to detect 
risks present in limited areas around nuclear installations no 
study can prove the absence of an effect he said adding that 
any risk would be too small for detection with the researchers 
methods 
starting in 1987 the nci scientists surveyed more than 900000 
cancer deaths using county mortality records collected from 1950 to 
1984 they evaluated changes in mortality rates for 16 types of 
cancer from 1950 to the date the facility started operation and 
from the start of operation until 1984 more than 18 million 
cancer deaths were studied in the 292 control counties 
michael mariotte director of the nuclear information and 
research service said his national network of 1000 environmental 
groups considers the nci research incomplete and misleading 
their methodology was not designed to find anything 
mariotte said 
mariotte said cancer has a long latency period and victims dont 
die from it instantly most of these plants havent been up long 
enough for people who have developed cancers to die from them he 
said you have to look at the incidence of cancer rather than the 
mortality 
the other main problem he said is that the countywide data 
does not specifically address the population most at risk people 
living downwind of the plants these are the people where you 
would expect the maximum exposures he said you really have to 
look at meteorological data 
the nci survey was sparked by public concerns in the united 
states and a british survey that found elevated rates of childhood 
leukemia deaths near some british nuclear installations

last eight years 
green ordered election officials to hold the hearing on 
hinckleys voting rights claim at the hospital 
hinckley is legally entitled to a public hearing but st 
elizabeths officials said they could not allow reporters or other

americans believe their views should be 
protected under the first amendment but that constitutional 
protection should not necessarily be applied to others says a 
group that conducted a private survey on free speech 
americans surveyed overwhelmingly believe the constitution 
guarantees their individual freedom of expression but more than 
onefourth say that protection shouldnt apply to the arts or the 
media according to the survey released friday by the thomas 
jefferson center for the protection of free expression 
the nationwide telephone survey of 1500 adults in june also 
showed that while nearly threefourths defended an artists right 
to display works that might be offensive fewer than 25 percent 
favored supporting those works with tax funds 
robert oneil founding director of the center said the survey 
spotlighted an appalling gap in public understanding of free 
speech and equally protected freedom of the press 
we found alarming evidence of a double standard a sense that 
the first amendment protects what the speaker wants to say but not 
so clearly the views of others oneil said releasing the survey 
results at a news conference on the steps of the jefferson 
memorial 
while 90 percent of americans believe the government has no 
business telling them what to say nearly 59 percent said the 
government should have some power of censorship according to the 
centers survey 
in addition more than half said the government has the right to 
ban the sale of recordings that favor drug use or broadcasting of 
sexually explicit lyrics 84 percent favored mandatory labeling of 
recorded songs containing such lyrics 
the survey said between 25 percent and 30 percent of those 
questioned believed the first amendments guarantees of free speech 
didnt cover art works films music radio cable and network 
television play newspapers or photographs 
on federal support for controversial art an issue that has 
plagued the national endowment for the arts for months the survey 
showed that nearly 74 percent of americans backed artists rights 
to display works that might be offensive 
but 72 percent opposed spending tax money for objectionable 
art films or plays the survey said 
oneil urged congress not to impose any new antiobscenity 
restrictions on the nea the same position taken earlier this week 
by a bipartisan study commission created by congress 
it is one thing for government simply not to be a patron of 
the arts said oneil a legal scholar and former president of 
the university of virginia it is quite another for government to 
say it will support only individual works or artists it does not 
deem objectionable 
the center is a nonprofit nonpartisan privately financed 
institute associated with the university of virginia that defends 
first amendment rights of free expression 
its trustees include syndicated columnist james j kilpatrick 
jr film producer richard roth american civil liberties union 
president norman dorsen and political consultant mary dent crisp 
former cochairwoman of the republican national committee

the administration is preparing to submit to 
congress a request to sell saudi arabia 18 billion worth of 
weapons including f15 fighter planes tanks and other 
sophisticated arms an official says 
officials at the state and defense departments were working with 
saudi officials to determine that countrys needs to withstand the 
military threat posed by iraqi president saddam hussein 
its not all finalized yet and it wont be until we submit it 
to congress said the official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
if it goes through it is believed the sale would be the largest 
single arms deal in us history 
the administration has already proposed selling saudi arabia 3 
billion in new weapons to bolster its defenses including f15 
fighter planes m60 tanks 15000 rounds of armorpiercing 
antitank ammunition and 200 stinger antiaircraft missiles 
according to congressional sources 
the larger package includes 24 additional f15s as many as 48 
apache helicopters 385 m1a2 tanks 400500 m2 bradley armed 
personnel carriers and thousands of trucks and jeeps the new york 
times said in todays editions

would range from 18 billion to 23 billion and also would include 
patriot air defense systems naval command and control systems and 
thousands of tons of ammunition 
earlier in the day an administration official noted that 
additional sales had been promised to saudi arabia when the latest 
package was recently announced however the official said no 
recommendations have come to the white house 
once the larger package is submitted to congress lawmakers will 
have two months during which they can debate it and decide whether 
to approve the sale 
the white house had approved the sale in principle and passed 
the plans along to technical teams to work on the details the 
official said 
the administration is trying to speed up submitting the package 
in order to take advantage of the bipartisan support for president 
bushs policy on saudi arabia and his decision to send more than 
100000 troops to defend the oilrich kingdom said another 
official familiar with the deal

a book about israels secret service that israel 
tried to suppress has sold out all over town and orders to the 
publisher have more than doubled 
bookstores were swamped friday with requests for copies of by 
way of deception the making and unmaking of a mossad officer

blowing their covers 
the author victor ostrovsky says he was a mossad agent for 
four years in the 1980s he wrote in the book that israel had 
detailed information about preparations for the bombing that killed 
241 us marines in lebanon in 1983 but gave the united states only 
a vague warning so that usarab relations would be damaged 
a sampling of city bookstores friday found most still waiting

wiping out the kuwaiti resistance fighters and an animal rights 
official accused the iraqi forces of eating most of the animals in 
kuwaits zoo 
more than 270 americans were to leave today for baltimore after 
arriving at gatwick airport outside london along with other 
nationalities aboard an iraqi jet the night before the us 
embassy said 
galina suliman from san francisco who arrived on the iraqi 
airways boeing 747 from baghdad said the kuwaiti resistance has 
been put down ruthlessly by the iraqis in the past day or two 
her husband rani said he saw the bodies of seven kuwaitis 
hanged by the iraqis for looting one was hanging from a crane 
they left him there for four days he said 
andrea hanson from portland ore who arrived on the same 
uschartered flight into gatwick said kuwaiti groups did not 
have enough weapons to fight the iraqis

been wiped out including rare species such as the soemmerings 
gazelle and the shoebill stalk the newspaper article did not 
specify how watkins got his information or how many animals were in 
the zoo 
watkins the societys director for the middle east said the 
soldiers have eaten many antelope and deer it is a dreadful 
situation things are desperate enought for the people so anyone 
might understand how bad it is for the animals

americans plus 43 canadians 26 britons six japanese six 
australians two west germans and a number of indians syrians and

miles south of london shortly before midnight the americans and 
others spent the night in hotels

plane are believed to have been among the last who expressed a wish 
to leave behind their husbands and fathers in kuwait 
ms hanson who traveled with her son zach 5 said people in 
kuwait had to wait in line five hours for some food items 
she added i saw with my own eyes a lot of looting and burning 
but i cannot say it was all by iraqis

is very haphazard they havent got enough people they havent 
got enough weapons

the canadian auto workers union today began a 
strike against ford motor co of canada after negotiators decided 
they could not meet a midnight deadline for settling the dispute 
over pay benefits and job security 
parallel talks in the united states recessed early today with 
the united auto workers telling its members not to strike against 
general motors corp the negotiators in detroit agreed to extend a 
similar deadline and more talks were set for later today 
the canadian talks were also to continue later today spokesmen 
for ford and the canadian union said 
we still have a very significant distance between the two 
positions don mackenzie fords chief negotiator told reporters 
as discussions broke off friday at a downtown toronto hotel 
the union president robert white said the strike the first 
against ford of canada since 1976 would begin midnight friday 
up to 12800 workers are expected to walk off the job at nine 
plants and two offices in ontario the company has two plants in 
oakville five in windsor one in st thomas and one in niagara 
falls 
however the strike wont mean anything in terms of production 
until monday because canadian ford plants do not operate weekends 
after announcing the strike late friday white said the tough 
issues were job security protection from inflation and time off 
ford is balking at putting enough economics on the table to get 
an agreement he said 
both sides have refused to disclose details of their proposals 
and demands it was not known how much of a raise the union was 
demanding over the current hourly base pay of about 15 us 
earlier friday union and company officials had agreed 
communication was good and that work was progressing toward a new 
contract but white had acknowledged it was impossible to get 
everything done by the midnight deadline 
in detroit the united auto workers union and general motors 
corp agreed to extend their national labor contract friday local 
union leaders said 
theyre going to negotiate through the weekend said charlie 
gledhill acting president of uaw 549 at gms metal stamping plant 
in mansfield ohio in both countries the unions target a single 
company in their talks in hopes of fashioning a pattern contract 
for workers at other automakers 
white said earlier in the day that ford had not made a new 
economic proposal since the first one put on the table a few days 
ago which the union found unacceptable he said the union had 
presented ford with a counterproposal early friday and that ford 
officials went off to calculate the numbers 
ford canada spokesman jim hartford confirmed that but said he 
did not know how long it would take ford to work out the cost of 
the union proposal 
neither side offered details of the proposals

irene lee wait simply wanted to 
replace the ronze plaque that branded her pioneer 
greatgrandfather the mastermind of the most shameful episode in 
mormon history 
i was so unhappy about it it wasnt true said the 
75yearold descendant of john d lee the only man ever charged in 
the infamous mountain meadows massacre 
from her vexation has come not only a new marker but a new 
memorial a stone arch etched with the names of arkansas migrants 
who were slaughtered by mormon militiamen and paiute indians 133 
years ago 
kindled too was a spirit of reconciliation among the victims 
descendants and those of the mormon pioneers who as one historian 
said were frenzied by mistaken zeal to protect their homes 
families and church 
i hope that what it will do is change the focus from what 
happened in the past to what can happen in the future said rex 
lee president of mormon churchowned brigham young university and 
john d lees greatgrandson 
on friday about 60 of lees descendants he had 19 wives 
gathered at the old monument in southwestern utah to replace the 
marker on a monument erected in 1932 the new memorial will be 
dedicated saturday in cedar city 
those who have gone to the other side you can feel their 
presence they have made their peace and so have we wait said 
in a benediction 
the massacre on sept 11 1857 occurred after president james 
buchanan concluded that the fiercely independent mormons who had 
fled persecution in ohio missouri and illinois were in rebellion 
when he ordered an army to the utah territory war fever ensued 
into the storm rode a californiabound company of arkansas 
settlers led by alexander fancher and john t baker along with a 
band of horsemen from missouri who baited the unfriendly mormons as 
they wended southward from salt lake city 
in her definitive history the mountain meadows massacre 
juanita brooks said lee was not present when local mormon militia 
leaders decided the fancher train camped in the meadows 35 miles 
southwest of cedar city must be done away with with the 
paiutes help 
they sent a runner to mormon leader brigham young in salt lake 
city but his orders to leave the settlers alone apparently arrived 
too late 
lee was present however at the massacre which began with a 
trick 
lee and another man convinced the emigrants they would help them 
reach safety from indian attack mormon militiamen then escorted 
the unarmed settlers single file from the safety of their wagons 
on a signal the militiamen shot the men and the indians sprang 
from the brush to kill the women and older children 
of some 120 people 17 young children survived and eventually 
were turned over to federal agents their cattle and supplies were 
sold and the indians blamed for the slaughter 
over the years whispers about the massacre grew to persistent 
demands for justice lee his greatgranddaughter says became the 
scapegoat for his church excommunicated in 1870 he later was 
convicted and condemned to die 
lee was brought to mountain meadows in 1877 where seated on the 
edge of his coffin he denounced young for abandoning him then he 
was executed by a firing squad 
the fate of the emigrant train was decided by military 
leaders wait said he didnt confess to anything he gave his 
life to save the church 
the old plaque named lee as the confessed militia leader and 
misrepresented the number of dead the new marker gives a 
straightforward account and casts no blame 
wait hopes the marker and memorial will ease the pain of the 
fancher train descendants one of whom she met at the old monument 
one lady came up to me very angry and said i want to know 
what happened to the stock and the money from the train wait 
recalled 
i stopped and thought for a moment i said i can understand 
why youre hostile i would be too if my ancestors were 
killed 
her whole attitude changed wait said and she said id 
be angry too because your ancestor was killed for something he 
didnt do 
we were friends then

the new york post screamed the good news 
aint over yet read the front page in what could have been the 
final edition of the nations oldest continuously published daily 
the post got a temporary reprieve friday night when all but one 
union agreed to 19 million in concessions after more than 12 hours 
of negotiations 
the ultimate fate of the 189yearold newspaper depends on a 
vote monday by members of the newspaper guild its negotiating 
committee voted 73 against the settlement agreed to by bargainers 
for 10 other unions 
if the choice is death or three days to live ill take three 
days said jerry nachman the newspapers editor 
publisher peter kalikow is demanding massive concessions to make 
the tabloid break even the newspaper is losing about 27 million a 
year 
the more than 850 post workers represented by the 10 unions must 
ratify the the agreement the guild represents 352 reporters and 
members of the advertising staff 
a cheer went up in the newsroom when kalikow announced in a 
televised news conference that the newspaper had at least another 
three days 
eric breindel editorial page editor said kalikow had written 
two columns for todays newspaper one celebrating its survival 
one lamenting its demise on friday some post reporters worked on 
live post issues while others worked on dead post issues 
weve been through a wringer all day long for a few days and 
were going to have to go through it again said metropolitan 
editor john cotter 
cotter said a prepared farewell edition that included 
reminiscences from past post columnists was terrific but 
hopefully itll never be read by the public 
money troubles are not new to the post founded in 1801 by 
alexander hamilton 
in 1939 heiress dorothy schiff bought the post and made it one 
of the nations most liberal newspapers but the post also became 
known for making do with a small staff and old equipment 
in 1976 schiff sold the newspaper to australian media baron 
rupert murdoch for 31 million at the time the newspaper was 
losing 500000 annually 
under murdoch the post went conservative editorially and began 
running sexy pictures racy headlines including the famous 
headless body in topless bar and a steady diet of crime 
stories 
murdoch said the newspaper lost 150 million before he sold it 
in 1988 for 37 million to kalikow a real estate developer who 
also acquired the newspapers valuable waterfront land in lower 
manhattan 
the post said today that kalikow is demanding that the drivers 
union give up 100 of 263 jobs the 70 printers cut their work week 
to four days and the 17 paper handlers give up five jobs 
the guild was asked to give up 43 jobs and to agree to a 
fourday work week for four days pay 
i feel optimistic that when the members see it they will 
approve it said kalikow if they turn it down the paper will 
stop publishing immediately 
the daily news which also is losing money and is in the midst 
of a labor conflict has demanded that any concessions the unions 
give the post must be extended to the news under metoo 
contract clauses 
the new york times said it would seek union concessions related 
to the same economic conditions that have affected the post and 
news and led to declines in ad revenues

government troops today advanced 
slowly through boobytrapped buildings and mined streets toward the 
main hospital in the northern city of jaffna military officials 
said 
capturing the hospital offers the government both strategic and 
psychological advantages in trying to loosen the tamil rebels grip 
on the town 
the abandoned hospital is in the center of jaffna about a mile 
from jaffna fort which the army said it reached thursday breaking 
a threemonth siege by tamil separatist rebels 
the government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least 
136 wounded since thursday it claims more than 100 tamil tigers 
have died 
the tigers office in london has denied the siege was broken 
the military officials did not say how far their men had 
advanced today but a senior officer said they were under constant 
rebel fire and progress was very slow because of mines buried in 
the streets and booby traps hidden in buildings along the way 
the overwhelmingly tamil town 185 miles northeast of colombo 
the capital has been a tiger stronghold since the rebels embarked 
on their separatist war against sri lankas sinhalese majority in 
1983 
but this summers new outbreak of civil war coupled with the 
tigers strongarm tactics of soliciting funds is sapping 
enthusiasm for the guerrilla cause in the city of 60000 recent 
visitors to the town reported 
the tigers also claimed their first successful attempt to down a 
government plane with a sam7 missile 
the government conceded that a singleengine groundattack plane 
crashed in jaffna lagoon on thursday but it said the pilot ditched 
the italianmade marchetti aircraft when he could not pull out of a 
dive after attacking a tiger gun position the pilot was reported 
missing 
the military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
accused the tigers of killing eight unarmed moslem civilians in 
eastern sri lanka thursday night and friday 
four tiger guerrillas were killed in clashes with government 
troops in the region the officials said 
the tigers have been fighting for political autonomy or 
independence for the tamil minority claiming to have been 
victimized by sinhalese discrimination in jobs education and use 
of the sinhala language 
the sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of sri lankas population 
of 16 million control the government and the military 
tamils who account for 18 percent of the people live mostly in 
the north and east of the indian ocean island moslems make up 7 
percent of the total population most of them live in the east 
at least 14000 people have been killed since the war erupted in 
1983 in this onceidyllic nation of palmfringed beaches precious 
gems and tropical plantations

investigators took body samples 
from a suspect in the slayings of five college students and 
considered searching an area frequented by another suspect in the 
case 
searchers waded through alligatorinfested swamps and scoured 
dense woods friday looking for body parts and other evidence near 
three complexes where the bodies were found nearly three weeks ago

humphrey 18 frequented wooded areas rusty knives metal paper 
products and clothing were among items found in the search 
police lt sadie darnell said the objects must be analyzed to 
determine if they are connected with the slaying of four women and 
one man two of the women were mutilated and another was 
decapitated 
polk county authorities meanwhile announced that the florida 
department of law enforcement had taken body samples from 
stephen bates 30 a burglary suspect jailed in bartow since aug 
29 
investigators already have taken blood and hair samples from 
humphrey at the brevard county jail where he has been held in the 
aug 30 beating of his grandmother 
humphrey also faces warrants in an aug 25 assault on two male 
university of florida students and an october 1988 armed burglary 
and attempted rape in indian river county 
bates and humphrey are the two suspects publicly identified by 
police six other people also are considered suspects 
darnell said authorities may search sebastian inlet state park 
the area searched shortly after humphreys arrest humphrey a 
university of florida freshman frequented the area 
we have a lot of information on mr humphrey but we have not 
connected him to these murders ms darnell said

president alberto fujimori says president bush 
extended the deadline for signing an agreement on us antidrug 
aid which fujimori has criticized for lacking funding to help coca 
farmers switch to other crops 
fujimori on wednesday appeared to reject the 359 million in 
economic aid saying that since the package is destined only for 
the fight against drug trafficking we are not going to sign this 
agreement 
fujimori had said any agreement must include aid to wean farmers 
away from growing coca leaves the main ingredient for cocaine and 
persuade them to cultivate other cash crops better roads into 
cities have been suggested as one solution 
however the peruvian president told the state news agency 
andina that bush on friday extended a recently expired deadline for 
agreement fujimori said he was confident the two nations would 
negotiate an agreement by the end of the month 
fujimori met friday with us ambassador anthony quaynton who 
delivered the message from bush 
the aid proposal includes 20 million to provide soldiers with 
arms and equipment and to build a training camp in the cocarich 
upper huallaga valley 
the northern valley 250 miles northeast of lima is the worlds 
largest supplier of coca leaf the raw material for cocaine 
the army wants the agreement to focus on aid for fighting the 
maoist shining path rebels according to the local news magazine 
caretas the magazine said the united states wants the wording of 
the agreement to state the aid is solely to fight drug trafficking 
opposition politicians have criticized the proposal fearing it 
could lead to direct us involvement in a 10yearold guerrilla 
war that has claimed nearly 20000 lives 
the police which direct peruvian antidrug efforts already 
operate with the us drug enforcement administration an antidrug 
helicopter base in the huallaga valley guerrillas attacked the 
base in april battling us pilots

the us military says it has 
canceled a planned moraleboosting variety show for american troops 
after the saudi government objected to a burlesque dance routine 
they objected in general but it was pretty clear that it was 
the women that set them off said a military source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the saudis complained to us military officials after 
monitoring the show on cbs which broadcast a brief segment showing 
four women dancers 
lt col john olsen a us military spokesman said the 
military decided it would not send audiences to the shows because 
of the saudi objections 
it caused some discomfort on the part of the saudi 
government and we regret that olsen said 
the episode is the latest in a series of incidents that have 
caused increasing cultural strains between the americans and their 
saudi hosts 
earlier in the week the saudi government complained to us 
commanders about american soldiers venturing into saudi towns 
carrying their weapons saudi officials have also been relaying 
complaints about women in the military driving on saudi roads 
women are not allowed to drive here 
the 90minute show was being staged by a group of americans 
britons and other westerners who wanted to show their appreciation 
to the thousands of americans deployed in operation desert shield 
at opening night wednesday 400 members of the 82nd airborne 
were repeatedly brought to their feet by the performers and many 
said afterward that the show was a break from the heat boredom and 
isolation of the desert 
a second show was staged wednesday night and two more on 
thursday but two planned for friday night were effectively 
canceled when military officials responding to the saudi 
complaint said they would not allow troops to attend 
the troupe had planned to put on six shows next week and hoped 
to continue the show for several weeks to allow troops to be 
rotated in for entertainment while awaiting the arrival of 
entertainers being brought in by the uso 
we were just trying to give the guys a break one of the 
organizers of the show said insisting on anonymity because of 
fears she would be penalized for participating we were worried 
what might happen if the saudis found out 
from the outset saudi and american officials have predicted 
some cultural clashes as the 100000plus american troops settled 
in and began to interract with saudis 
after weeks of relatively few incidents the last week has become 
tense with several us commanders complaining privately the 
saudis appear unwilling to bend their traditions 
saudi offials in turn have complained the americans were 
unnecessarily engaging in activities that offended local customs 
during a thursday visit by gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff a saudi official walked up to a senior 
american officer and argued furiously that servicewomen be sent 
home or at least prohibited from driving 
the officer gen gus pagonis who is in charge of the logistics 
and supply efforts for the us deployment could hardly get a word 
in as the saudi official who refused to identify himself 
afterward insisted driving by women be halted 
im trying to hold back but i must perform my mission 
pagonis told the official they must perform the mission 
saudi women appear in public draped in clothing that covers 
their faces arms and legs western women also are advised cover 
their calves and arms when in public

france will send 4000 more soldiers to the persian gulf and he 
expelled iraqi military attaches a day after an iraqi raid on the 
french diplomatic compound in kuwait 
mitterrand said other iraqi diplomats will be confined to paris 
in response to what he called iraqi aggression against the french 
embassy in kuwait he also urged that the embargo against iraq be 
extended to air shipments 
we will do what must be done the french president said at a 
press conference following an emergency meeting this morning of his 
inner cabinet 
but we wont be taking hostages he said 
iraqi troops raided the diplomatic compounds of france canada 
and belgium in kuwait on friday briefly detaining five western 
consuls including an american and capturing four french 
citizens 
one of the four frances military attache was freed after 
several hours mitterrand said in a press conference today that the

the 4000 troops to be sent to the gulf will include helicopter 
and antitank units mitterrand said he did not elaborate on just

emirates and has nine warships in the region or enroute the 
aircraft carrier clemenceau is among those that have arrived 
the united states has deployed about 150000 military personnel

france will demand an emergency meeting of the un security 
council to examine holes in the united nations embargo of iraq and 
occupied kuwait mitterrand said 
the embargo has been enforced by a massive buildup of naval 
forces in the persian gulf mitterrand said france would continue 
to rely on the embargo to dislodge iraqi troops from kuwait 
to make the embargo more effective it must be extended to air 
traffic to and from iraq and occupied kuwait mitterrand said

jim lords basement is chockfull of 
tractortrailers moving vans dump trucks and gasoline tankers 
theres so many of them the traffic jam has spread to his barn 
at last count the retired pipefitter had 2700 toy trucks but 
not just any trucks the ones lord collects are reproductions of 
bigname company haulers that cant be found in stores 
lord 75 is one of about 4000 enthusiasts to search out the 
handcrafted gems made by winross co for such companies as exxon 
corp the adolph coors co and campbell soup co 
you cant get them in stores so we have to find out about 
them via the grapevine he said recently its really the 
challenge of getting them that makes them so soughtafter 
the 6inchlong trucks are sold to companies by winross a 
familyowned business in rochester ny for about 30 each they 
look like the companies real trucks logos included and are used 
as promotional giveaways 
when winross makes too many of one model it sells off the 
overflow to enthusiasts lord also finds rare models at toy shows 
or buys them from other collectors 
winross began making the silkscreened metal toy trucks about 
30 years ago they were initially sold retail but then the company 
began filling only bulk orders for companies that wanted their 
logos advertised 
we were amazed that people got so interested in collecting 
them said phyllis austin coowner of winross 
i still dont understand it i always thought of collectibles 
as being things that were antique these become collectible as soon 
as we make them she said thursday 
lord says hes long been a collector of items ranging from 
stamps to matchbox toy cars 
he became interested in winross trucks in the mid1970s now 
shelves of the toy vehicles line his basement leaving room for 
only a washer and a dryer more of them are beginning to fill his 
barn 
winross does not put out a complete list of all models it makes 
so lord does the job himself 
in 1977 he began compiling and publishing a list of winross 
trucks he knew existed subscribers pay 2 a year for his monthly 
newsletter lord also sells a photo catalog of the latest truck 
models for 70 to 80 
he resells duplicate models for up to 400 using the profit to 
buy the nearly 250 new trucks he estimates winross puts out every 
year lord estimates his collection is worth about 150000 
lords wife who recently died never shared his enthusiasm for 
model trucks 
my wife put up with me he says the rule was no toys 
upstairs but she never minded me having them

democratic party chairman ronald h brown said 
today his party stands firmly behind president bushs persian gulf 
policy saddam hussein will get no mixed signals from america or 
from this party he said 
in a speech to a meeting of the democratic national committee 
brown coupled his support for the us commitment in the middle 
east with a slashing attack on republican domestic policy 
well stand up to saddam hussein but we wont stand by as the 
new republican recession wreaks havoc on our economy he said 
democratic party leaders meeting today uptown from the white 
house are formally endorsing bushs decision to send troops to 
block iraqs aggression in the middle east 
but that backing for the republican president doesnt extend to 
his domestic policy which the democrats say characterize a 
decade of republican greed and debt 
on the agenda for the meeting of the democratic national 
committee were resolutions denouncing the failure of three 
successive republican administrations to develop a national energy 
policy and blaming the gop for the savings and loan crisis 
the resolution demanded that the president explain why 
highranking bush administration officials have made concerted 
efforts to suppress new conservation measures developed to respond 
to the iraqi oil crisis 
brown praised the party regulars for completing what he called 
housekeeping matters related to the 1992 nominating convention 
at a record early date the democrats have selected their 
convention city new york and now are ready to adopt the 
convention call which includes the formula for allocating 
delegates 
the number of delegates allocated to individual states wont be 
determined until after the final 1990 census figures define changes 
in house seats and the november elections change the political 
makeup of the nations governorships 
what is known is that the 1992 convention like the 1988 will 
have more than 4000 delegates each democratic convention is 
always a little larger than the one before and the 1992 meeting 
will have at least 80 more unpledged delegates 
that allocation was inserted into the call to please state party 
leaders who wanted additional slots for state and party officials 
a highlight of the meeting friday of the partys executive 
committee was the appearance of sen sam nunn dga a figure 
never before seen at a national committee meeting 
five years ago nunn was a founder of the democratic leadership 
council which was created as a conservative counterweight to the 
national party 
nunns denied his appearance before the executive committee was 
a signal of his interest in running for president in 1992 
i have no inclinations or plans to run for president nunn 
told reporters who crowded around him as he left the party meeting 
but the senator continues to stir presidential speculation with 
such actions as his resignation from an allmale golf club and his 
recent declaration of support for abortion rights after decades of 
being in the opposition camp 
nunn said his interest in party politics began with formation of 
the dlc which he described as an effort to get the democratic 
party back in the mainstream 
asked if he believed the people hed just spoken to were now in 
the mainstream nunn replied well i dont know everybody 
here 
nunn said he didnt believe the tendency of americans to rally 
around the president in a time of crisis would hurt democratic 
candidates in the fall 
i dont think its a partisan issue he said i dont 
think the publics going to be voting in november based on the 
middle east 
the executive committee approved without dissent a resolution 
that began by saying today our nation stands united in support 
of americas mission in the middle east united in opposition to 
iraqs aggression we the democratic party of the united states 
do here formally express our support for our armed forces and the 
persian gulf policy of our commander in chief 
but the next paragraph called on the nation to abandon 
republican economic policies 
the party voiced agreement with bushs call for spending 
reductions but added we insist that those reductions must not 
discriminate against those who benefited least from a decade of 
republican greed and debt 
it said the sampl crisis is the certain result of donothing 
republican public philosophy hearnothing republican regulatory 
policy and seenothing republican administration of justice

return to his nation said iraqi spokesman riyadh jawad his 
excellency he wants to give examples to prove that our behavior is 
not aggressive to our guests 
we did not treat them as hostages as in lebanon we 
treat them as guests in our country he said 
jawad said mary ewalds plea for her sons release was the only 
one the iraqi embassy has received and that saddam is open to other 
humanitarian pleas 
ewald was one of only a few men on the plane carrying almost 400 
passengers iraq has been holding most foreign men hostage while 
releasing women and children

baltimorewashington international airport later today after an 
overnight stop in london said us chief of protocol joseph verner 
reed

after the invasion he was allowed to enter the us embassy 
compound in baghdad on thursday

one week ago and forwarded it to baghdad 
after two three days saddam ordered to allow ewald to 
return to his nation said jawad 
mrs ewald declined to release a copy of the letter 
ewald called his parents from london on friday and told them 
that people still being held hostage wished him well said his 
father william ewald 
when the other hostages learned he was being released they 
said tell your mom were proud of her the elder ewald said 
we are grateful for him having responded this way with tom

response 
i also hope the other hostages get out said mrs ewald 
their parents and families are still going through this 
about 1350 americans remain in kuwait and 200 in iraq with 
about 75 being held as socalled human shields according to the 
state department

a bomb exploded inside a metal sculpture 
outside the federal building early today causing some damage to 
the building but no injuries police said 
the explosion which may have been a prank was felt blocks 
away said police lt randy nisleit 
some people in the area saw four militarylooking type 
people running from the area and laughing so it was probably just 
a prank of some kind but were checking the area out just in 
case nisleit said 
he said the device appeared to be a pipe bomb attached to a 
freon gas cannister to give it more explosive force 
theres a large piece of modern art sculpture in front of the 
building and they apparently threw some kind of charge down one of 
the tubes nisleit said 
he said the 1245 am explosion shattered a large window in the 
building and damaged a guardrail but did little damage to the 
sculpture 
a few people called who live blocks away to say the blast 
shook the ground so the explosion must have been substantial 
nisleit said 
agents from the fbi the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms and the fire departments metro arson strike team were 
also investigating

the united auto workers union and general motors 
corp resumed contract talks today after extending the current pact 
for more negotiations affecting about 300000 workers nationwide 
the union appealed to workers to stay on the job while 
bargaining continued today 
until you are notified otherwise i urge you to demonstrate 
solidarity and discipline and report to work as scheduled uaw 
vice president stephen yokich said on a telephone recording for uaw 
members 
negotiators had faced a midnight deadline but the deadline was 
extended after hours of talking friday the union and the worlds 
largest automaker agreed to extend the current threeyear contract 
on a daytoday basis 
talks resumed at 8 am today after breaking for the night at 
1240 am 
the only gm assembly plant scheduled for operation today in the 
united states was the corvette factory in bowling green ky 
meanwhile in canada the canadian auto workers union struck ford 
motor co when that unions contract with the no 2 us 
automakers canadian subsidiary expired at midnight friday 
about 12800 unionized ford workers were on strike early today 
none of fords canadian plants was scheduled to operate during the 
weekend talks resumed this morning in toronto 
in the united states the gm workers were among more than 
450000 active workers employed by gm ford motor co and chrysler 
corp whose uaw contracts technically expired at midnight friday 
the union froze negotiations at ford and chrysler pending the 
outcome of the gm talks the uaw plans to use an agreement ratified 
by gm workers as a pattern for contracts with ford and chrysler 
when the gmuaw contract extension was implemented there was no 
official word from gm or the union about what issues remained 
unresolved bargaining friday included job security health care 
wages and pensions 
union members nationwide have been kept pretty much in the dark 
about the talks going on at gm headquarters in detroit 
that has caused some problems 
gary sorrell president of uaw local 977 at gms marion ohio 
stamping plant said he and other leaders were feeling some heat 
from members 
the extension he said put us in a situation where the 
members feel were keeping something from them and were not 
speculation about the extension rose during the final days of 
the 1987 gmuaw national agreement friday night the union was 
faced with three choices sign a tentative agreement extend the 
existing contract or strike 
i think with the economy today and with the market share we 
have today we couldnt afford to strike said paul mitchell 
financial secretary of uaw local 5960 at gms lake orion car 
assembly plant near pontiac mich 
during the 1980s the big threes collective market share 
dropped about 6 percentage points to about 68 percent last year 
during the same time the japanese companies share rose by about 
the same amount to more than 25 percent 
that forced gm ford and chrysler to shrink their operations and 
their work forces in response the uaws primary emphasis has 
shifted to job security from wage increases 
the last time the uaw struck gm was in 1984 that walkout which 
affected about two dozen factories lasted a week

democrat john silber is trying to recover from his 
latest political blunder while republican william weld is enjoying 
a lastminute surge as primary election day approaches in the 
chaotic massachusetts governors race 
weld is running tuesday against state house minority leader 
steven pierce with republicans in the best position in two decades 
to capture the governorship they last won in 1970 
during the tenure of michael dukakis the massachusetts miracle 
of economic growth has become an economic debacle 
the state that once had the lowest unemployment rate among major 
industrial states now is tied for second highest at 67 percent 
after his unsuccessful bid for the presidency dukakis returned to 
a state heading for serious economic trouble and announced he 
wouldnt seek reelection 
the legislature passed the largest tax increase in the states 
history this year 12 billion but the current budget already is 
spiraling into deficit 
i think either republican would be highly competitive said 
ralph whitehead a university of massachusetts journalism professor 
and political analyst this is going to be a tightly contested 
election 
weld who is independently wealthy has pumped more than 1 
million of his own money into the campaign 
pierce had maintained a comfortable lead in polls but weld has 
surged within striking distance 
weld a former federal prosecutor credited his campaigns 
resurrection to his summerlong whistlestops and to his 
performance in two televised debates where he was considered more 
aggressive than pierce 
the two candidates and political analysts predict dwindling 
interest in the democratic contest may attract a record number of 
the states 135 million independents to the gop primary 
weld and pierce support a tax rollback initiative on the 
november ballot pierce is personally opposed to abortion while 
weld favors abortion rights 
on the democratic side silber faces the frontrunning former 
state attorney general francis bellotti who benefited from lt 
gov evelyn murphys decision earlier this month to drop out of the 
race 
silbers campaign has been marked by controversies over 
harshsounding statements they became known as silber 
shockers concerning immigrants welfare mothers and health care 
for the elderly 
the latest flap came during a televised debate with silber 
saying he saw no point going to an inner city area to talk to a a 
group of drug addicts about crime 
later silber said he did not mean to imply that all residents 
of the predominantly minority area were on drugs 
bellottis performance in the debate was lackluster and even he 
admitted that his stumbling closing statement was terrible 
terrible 
independent tracking polls conducted for the boston globe and 
wbztv showed bellotti with a commanding lead after the tuesday 
debate but silbers campaign said its polling showed a tighter 
race 
murphy who was tied in voters minds with dukakis trailed 
badly in public opinion polls and fund raising when she dropped 
out 
her decision to leave the race came after she attempted to 
impose a different budgetcutting plan than dukakis while the 
governor was on a european trade mission 
whitehead said silbers campaign was shot when murphy left the 
race and the democratic political establishment united behind 
bellotti 
silber never had a chance in a twoperson field whitehead 
said 
one of silbers leading supporters state senate president 
william bulger remained confident 
i tell you what the silber shockers going to be next 
tuesday silber wins he said while making a campaign swing 
through western massachusetts 
in the us senate race incumbent democrat john f kerry is 
unopposed in tuesdays primary two republican businessmen james 
rappaport and dan daly are competing for the gop nomination with 
rappaport considered the favorite 
the only serious congressional primary involving an incumbent is 
in the district of democrat richard neal of springfield a former 
mayor being challenged by another former mayor theodore dimauro 
democratic rep barney frank reprimanded by the house for his 
relationship with a male prostitute is unopposed in the primary

on a hot overcast day last june as a band 
played military music at the justice department president bush 
announced the formation of elite platoons that would be dispatched 
to the front lines in his administrations war on savings and loan 
fraud 
the new rapid response teams bush said would be teams of 
razorsharp prosecutors and auditors striking city by city 
teams that will jump right into the paper chase teams that will 
hit the trail while that trail is still hot 
the paper trail of sampl fraud may have cooled a bit since june 
but so far at least the new teams apparently havent responded 
rapidly or at all 
there is just no business for these people right now 
justice department spokesman doug tillett said this past week 
they really havent done anything at this point 
tillett said the new teams of hundreds of lawyers and 
accountants coordinated by the department are intended to be a 
resource pool that can be tapped by sampl enforcers already in 
the field so far he said the us attorneys fbi agents and 
support staff already investigating sampl fraud in locations around 
the country havent needed to call on the specialized expertise of 
the new squads 
i find it very hard to believe that there is no work for the 
rapid response teams said rep charles e schumer dny a 
member of house banking committee which is investigating the 
savings and loan crisis 
the american public assumed that fast action was forthcoming 
after the teams were appointed he said im sure they would be 
shocked to learn that sampl fraud has dissipated so greatly that 
urgency may no longer be needed 
there are a great deal of allegations to be investigated 
schumer said every resource possible should be used to its 
fullest 
more than 165 people have been convicted in sampl cases since 
october 1988 but the justice department has a backlog of 21000 
cases 
james g richmond the justice department official appointed to 
direct the teams said this summer that the fraud squads would be 
available whenever local investigators needed their special 
expertise 
but so far tillett said local prosecutors are dealing with 
things theyve seen before 
they havent been thrown any curve balls at this point he 
said 
in the dallas area for example where a special task force has 
been prosecuting some of the largest and most scandalous sampl fraud 
cases for some time the locals have had only an educational 
contact with the new teams 
the help from washington hasnt been needed because of the 
large presence we already have said marvin collins the us 
attorney for northern texas in fort worth 
bushs announcement of his new initiative on june 22 followed 
weeks of heated criticism by democrats that the administration was 
not vigorously prosecuting sampl fraud 
abuse by some thrift operators was partly responsible for the 
collapse of hundreds of institutions in recent years it will cost 
us taxpayers an estimated 500 billion to pay for the bailout of 
the federally insured sampls 
the scandal had reached bushs doorstep his son neil had made a 
highly publicized appearance in may before a congressional 
committee investigating the 1 billion collapse of a colorado 
thrift silverado banking savings and loan association 
federal regulators have accused neil bush 35 of conflict of 
interest in his role as a former director of silverado 
in addition to establishing the sampl fraud squads the president 
also moved to double spending for justice department and internal 
revenue service sampl investigators and prosecutors from 50 million 
to 100 million in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
bush also created the new special counsel position at justice 
the administrations top gun on sampl fraud 
my mandate is to basically get this entire program of 
administration initiatives up and running richmond told the ap 
this summer we need to put those people in jail and call them to 
account for their conduct 
richmond a large jovial man who also seems to have a toughguy 
aspect has been both an fbi agent and a lawyer in private 
practice he bristled at the suggestion that the new fraud teams 
and interagency group might be a showpiece adding another layer to 
the federal bureaucracy 
the purpose is to cut through the bureaucracy he said 
noting that government employees in the sampl enforcement effort have 
easy access to him 
well be here long after the klieg lights are gone on this 
issue richmond said

fighting in townships around johannesburg since august here is a 
firsthand account of one of those deaths 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the sun rose brightly in soweto 
saturday shining through the smoky haze people walked along the 
roads and swept their red dirt yards dogs scampered through piles 
of garbage 
at inhlazane train station a man would soon die 
shortly after dawn groups of residents milled about on one side 
of the train platform they pointed at a small crowd of blacks on 
the other side of the tracks who live in a nearby migrant workers 
hostel 
the station formed a 150yard barrier between them when trains 
arrived people getting off crouched low and scurried across the 
platform and tracks using the coaches as a shield 
someone fired a handgun everyone ducked 
robin oupa 36 said he was supposed to go to work at a 
hospital right now i cant even go to the train terminal 
he said 
on the platform a group armed with machetes and crude spears 
questioned people getting off a train suddenly they began pushing 
a large man in a blue worksuit down the stairs toward the street 
the man resisted but did not fight more people joined the 
shouting crowd 
attackers kicked the man then hit him with fistsized stones 
several plunged small daggers into his head back and chest 
they kicked him down and some hurled boulders the size of anvils 
at his head 
he continued to crawl more rocks hit him and he collapsed 
someone poured petrol on him 
when the match struck he burst into flames and leaped in the 
air onlookers yelled what sounded like a cheer a woman danced 
he ran in circles before falling for the last time a youth 
hacked at his head with a machete 
some attackers said the man had failed to correctly answer their 
questions they said he was a zulu spy from the hostel dwellers on 
the other side of the tracks 
oupa said zulu supporters of the conservative inkatha movement 
lived in the hostel he said they attacked residents of the small 
brown houses on the near side most of whom support the african 
national congress 
they take a young boy kill him and cut off his private 
parts he said those people are wrong when they kill a 
young boy it is wrong 
inkatha blames the anc for the fighting charges of police and 
rightwing whites provoking the ongoing violence also have 
surfaced 
attacks on trains and taxis last week killed dozens of blacks 
we cant go by trains no taxis what can we do oupa said 
we must fight

this city of gritty air bicycle gridlock and 
hostile sales clerks has become a kinder cleaner emptier place on 
the eve of hosting its first major world sports event the asian 
games 
the repaved streets are lined with flowers buildings have been 
washed and painted with false facades hiding the ugliest houses 
an army of 20000 students patrols the sidewalks ready to fine 
spitters or litterbugs 
most outoftown chinese visitors averaging 1 million per day 
have been ordered to stay home vehicle traffic also has been cut 
for the sept 22oct 7 games a kind of olympics for 38 asian and 
mideast nations 
most striking of all chinas normally cranky service personnel 
are being polite to foreigners anyway 
can i help you clerks rush to ask in newly learned english 
in hotels and shops adjoining the shiny new asian games village 
even police have added please and thank you to their 
vocabularies as beijing orchestrates an unprecedented public 
relations campaign directed at an often critical outside world 
of course it is a political event more than a sports event 
said a chinese reporter 
the communist leadership is determined to vindicate socialism 
and especially the army attack that killed hundreds of peaceful 
prodemocracy protesters in beijing last year drawing 
international condemnation 
officials have said the 100000 foreign tourists expected in the 
city of 10 million for the games will see firsthand a china that is 
stable and loyal to the communist party 
to ensure nothing happens to spoil that work units across the 
city are telling their employees to stay off the streets on the 
games opening day and watch the ceremonies on television 
large gatherings are banned for the 17day period and college 
students chinas most volatile citizens are to stay on campus 
security is at its heaviest since martial law was lifted in 
january paramilitary police drill openly with riot gear and 
helicopters buzz overhead in unexplained security exercises 
appeals for cooperation and order are being made in the name of 
patriotism not sportsmanship the tens of thousands of students 
and office workers who spent weekends aiding a lastminute dash to 
finish building stadiums and hotels were told that voluntary labor 
is a glorious revolutionary tradition 
privately many beijing residents say they are sick of the asian 
games even before they start most of the nightly television news 
has been given over to progress reports on the preparations and 
messages on public etiquette during the games are everywhere 
hardly a storefront in the city lacks decals of pan pan the 
games smiling panda mascot 
the beijing television news perhaps inadvertently acknowledged 
the public annoyance in brief footage shown this summer an irate 
bicyclist being fined for violating traffic regulations was shown 
screaming at a policeman everything is asian games its all 
nonsense 
normally unruly beijing commuters are learning that it pays to 
obey traffic rules these days some private street vendors and 
repairmen have been ordered out of business on the grounds that 
their operations are unattractive 
supplies of electricity to other parts of the city are being cut 
so the games venues can have enough heavily polluting factories 
are being shut down for the term of the games 
people with unregistered pets are being ordered to kill them to 
reduce the chance of a rabies outbreak 
heavy trucks and vehicles deemed unattractive such as locally 
made jeeps are barred from main roads 
but authorities dont want to hear any complaints 
chinese sources say that officials in their work units have 
warned that all public comments on the asian games must be 
positive for malcontents the message is summed up in a proverb 
the bird that sticks out its head will be shot down

after meeting with chancellor helmut kohl later in the day

was not authorized to interpret the remarks 
iraq denied its soldiers entered the foreign compounds and said 
the troops were under strict orders not to enter the embassies 
saddams troops invaded and annexed kuwait after the baghdad 
government demanded the oilrich emirate relinquish border 
territory compensate for billions in oil pumped from disputed land

the world society for the protection of animals as saying iraqi 
soldiers in kuwait have eaten 70 percent of the edible animals in 
kuwaits zoo the newspaper did not specify how watkins got his 
information or how many animals were in the zoo

the people so anyone might understand how bad it is for the 
animals he was quoted as saying 
iraq has an estimated 265000 troops in and around kuwait 
the united states has led the multinational buildup in saudi 
arabia and the gulf with 150000 troops and more than 30 warships

cf18 jets would be sent to fly cover for three canadian warships 
en route to the gulf

token numbers to symbolize shared involvement with the military 
buildup bakers meeting with italian officials in rome came before

divonnelesbains france ap although she lives in a posh 
vacation villa and rides to school in a luxury car 12yearold 
dalal finds that enforced exile is no fun tears of homesickness 
give her away 
dalal is one of 60 kuwaiti children who last week entered french 
public schools in this spa town 11 miles north of geneva their 
wealthy families who for years have spent summers here were 
stranded when iraqi forces occupied kuwait on aug 2 
the children face the prospect of their first cold winter and 
their first taste of financial hardship 
during a recess dalal turned on her walkman casette player to 
listen to patriotic kuwaiti songs she began sobbing and two of 
her kuwaiti friends clad in tight blue jeans and baggy 
sweatshirts cried with her 
living in france is not a problem the people are very 
kind said 16yearold shaika the trouble is that we are 
outside our country and we cant go home we feel alone but when 
we talk to each other it helps 
divonnelesbains a town of 6000 people nestled in the 
foothills of the jura mountains boasts luxury hotels a manmade 
lake with sand beaches a casino golf course and race track 
several dozen kuwaiti families live in lakeside and hillside 
villas surrounded by high iron fences many of the homes have 
tennis courts swimming pools and satellite dishes 
the families are worried about security and school officials 
asked that the children be identified only by their first names 
but the students spoke freely about the new uncertainties in their 
lives 
they said their families had become budgetconscious for the 
first time because some bank accounts were inaccessible kuwaiti 
assets were frozen by many governments in order to shield them from 
plunder by the iraqis 
my parents used to take us out to dinner all the time dalal 
said now its out to the supermarket and back 
we used to go shopping and choose anything we like we had 
everything added hawazen 16 now my mother tells me to pick 
something cheap something ill wear a lot 
many of the fathers who include diplomats and businessmen used 
to spend the evenings at the casino now they offer assistance to 
the kuwaiti embassy in geneva and drink tea together while watching 
nightly television news reports 
the youths said a return to kuwait now would be dangerous 
possibly even fatal but they all said they would not have fled if 
they had been home when the invasion occurred most have relatives 
left behind 
for haifaa a 21yearold kuwaiti university student picking up 
her brother and cousins at school is the main daily activity she 
finds the waiting intolerable 
i would rather go back to kuwait to be with my other brothers 
and sisters and die than be separated like this she said 
school officials have gone out of their way to accommodate the 
kuwaitis whose children speak arabic and english not french no 
tuition is charged and alternative meals are offered on days when 
the french students are fed pork which is taboo for moslems 
one western custom has not been modified coed classes dalal 
said she didnt mind her first exposure to male classmates but one 
14yearold kuwaiti boy sabih complained about girls in his 
class 
the director of the secondary school chantal daux said she 
initially suggested that multilingual private schools in geneva 
would be more suitable 
but the parents insisted on the divonnelesbains schools 
apparently mindful of 10000 annual tuition at the private 
schools 
the parents expect us to teach the children french discipline 
and the european way of life ms daux said our goal is to 
help them adapt smoothly without pampering them in a gilded 
ghetto 
a additional englishspeaking teacher has been hired to assist 
the children in special language courses aimed at preparing them to 
do all their studies in french as soon as possible 
ms daux said she never questioned the importance of welcoming 
the kuwaitis into her school 
its a terrible human tragedy for anyone who loses his 
roots she said i thought about the children and their 
despair i put myself in the place of their mothers and did what i 
would want done for my children

in 1965 the year that us forces in vietnam 
grew from 23300 to 184300 troops sen j william fulbright 
complained bitterly in private that the johnson administration had 
misled him about the wars progress according to newly 
declassified documents 
defense secretary robert s mcnamara had testified in 1964 that 
the americans could get out of vietnam by april 1965 and 
fulbright chairman of the senate foreign relations committee told 
fellow senators on july 23 that he had allowed himself to be taken 
in 
i think maybe we have been too easy on mcnamara and some of 
those in the years gone by in accepting their optimistic 
statement i did not know enough to say why you are a bloody 
fool this is absolute nonsense fulbright said at a closeddoor 
hearing of the committee i just did not know enough 
he mcnamara said it and he has been out there fulbright 
continued it was long after the fact that it began to be 
apparent that they had utterly misjudged the seriousness and the 
character of the whole thing 
fulbrights frustration comes to light in transcripts of the 
committees closed hearings in 1965 released saturday by the 
panel the transcripts provide a footnote to the history of that 
period 
fulbright an arkansas democrat is now a washington attorney 
attempts to reach him by telephone on saturday were unsuccessful 
fulbright later to become one of the senates foremost critics 
of president lyndon johnsons war policies was playing the role of 
a reluctant supporter 
but in an interview with the associated press on april 12 1965 
he called for a temporary halt in bombing raids on north vietnam as 
a spur to peace talks 
secretary of state dean rusk replied that such an act would 
only encourage the aggressor and johnson reacting to fulbright 
said that until the independence of south vietnam was guaranteed 
there is no human power capable of forcing us from vietnam 
three years later on march 31 1968 johnson went before a 
nationwide television audience to announce a unilateral halt of the 
bombardment of north vietnam and his own decision not to seek 
reelection three days later north vietnam agreed to open 
negotiations in paris 
the united states withdrew from vietnam in 1973 and the war 
ended with the north vietnamese capture of saigon in 1975 
in august 1964 the year before fulbrights private 
disenchantment he steered through the gulf of tonkin resolution 
which johnson used as the equivalent of a declaration of war 
it passed the senate 882 and the house 4160 a few days after 
two us navy vessels reported they had come under attack in the 
tonkin gulf off the coast of north vietnam the resolution 
authorized johnson to take all necessary measures to repel an 
armed attack and to prevent further aggression 
many times in the ensuing years fulbright expressed dismay that 
he used his influence to help pass so openended a resolution 
the transcript shows that as early as april 1965 fulbright was 
concerned about the way resolution was being used as a de facto 
declaration of war 
the existing mission i thought was a rather limited one 
he told rusk but in effect for all practical purposes we arewaging 
war on north vietnam it would seem to me not out of 
order if we are going to send 30000 50000 100000 men that the 
congress might have the say about it 
he added the operation in vietnam has obviously become quite 
controversial a lot of us have been quiet we do not want to 
embarrass the administration we have not discussed it in public 
rusk replied well mr chairman it is very hard to look into 
the future to that extent 
we have the impression that hanoi is not yet convinced that it 
cannot win in the south we also have the impression that they are 
relying heavily on the buildup of international and domestic 
opinion in this country to cause the united states to in some way 
pull back from the situation

as iraq and its foes dig into the sand for 
a long hard war of nerves leaders in jordan fear their 
oncethriving desert kingdom will be the first casualty 
we could simply disappear observed an influential banker 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he recalled an old proverb 
when elephants fight the grass gets trampled 
jordan was rocketed to prosperity by the persian gulf oil boom 
in the 1970s amman joined chaotic beirut as a regional capital 
but since 1985 regional recession has plunged jordan into hard 
times 
now economists warn the gulf crisis might deliver a fatal 
blow if it drags on for a year jordan could lose 2 billion its 
annual budget is only 37 billion 
jordan and other countries in the gulf region will loose 
billions of dollars worth of trade service fees and worker 
remittances as a result of the unimposed economic sanctions 
against iraq and the crisis itself 
tourism another source of income for jordan is also at a low 
at petra only the flutes of bedouin children tending goats echo 
off the ancient ruins that once attracted 1000 foreign tourists a 
day 
this has gone beyond crisis said riad khouri a jordanian 
who directs middle east business associates in beirut this is 
catastrophe 
the future is a black abyss one european diplomat put it 
jordan might get smothered by circumstances 
saudi arabia a reliable if reluctant benefactor has turned off 
the tap a foreign debt of 85 billion rescheduled at great pain 
cannot be repaid 
even if foreign aid promised by the european community and 
japan among others offsets some losses the disrupted economy 
threatens the livelihood of many jordanians who now must compete 
with the thousands who have come home from iraq and kuwait 
in amman knots of asian refugees huddle under trees on empty 
lots giving the flowered comfortable capital an air of wartime 
despondency 
everywhere stalled construction projects leave the new 
hampshiresize nation of 31 million hanging somewhere between 
biblical times and the space age 
and economics is only part of it jordans historic role as a 
mediator among regional extremes is now in question 
in the stormiest part of the political world king husseins 
jordan has been the lightning rod the country has bent in each 
wind and sprung back to center but this time the winds may be too 
strong 
were trying to maintain this position at the center said a 
senior jordanian official spreading his fingers in reflection 
but its true this will be very difficult 
western powers want jordan to seal off iraq and condemn saddam 
hussein as an outlaw saddam wants his ally and trading partner to 
help him evade what he calls antiarab sanctions 
king hussein is obliged to lean toward iraq not only by the 
strong popular support for saddam within jordan but by the 
palestinians who straddle both banks of the jordan river his 
position has angered western allies 
israel regards jordan as a potential corridor for invasion from 
iraq its rightwing government rejects negotiation with the 
palestinians over the israelioccupied territories 
the economic and political strains promise only to worsen 
nearly 300000 jordanians work in the gulf and possibly half of 
them might return even in normal times jordans population growth 
rate of 4 percent is among the worlds highest 
unemployment was already at 20 percent when iraq invaded kuwait 
aug 2 and it could soon double inflation now near 15 percent 
could also double if the jordanian dinar loses more value 
food subsidies have been cut the price of sugar tripled 
overnight 
authorities fear crime will no longer be a rare phenomenon among 
jordanians who are mostly devout moslems 
were being flooded with people whove lost everything and 
desperate people cannot afford morality said sabri rubeihat a 
police major who teaches sociology and criminology this will be 
very serious 
developments so far have stung the royal family which aides 
say feels it has been tragically misunderstood by its friends 
crown prince hassan writing in the washington post blamed 
hostility in washington on uninformed naive american 
columnists 
he wrote the shrieks of important media pundits have all too 
often a distressing way of shaping public perceptions 
particularly in the united states a country that jordan has always 
felt close to because of shared democratic and cultural values 
we do not wish to lose the friendship and goodwill of 
americans and especially not on account of impressions sustained 
by malevolent editorializing 
but us officials watch not only the newspapers but also food 
and supplies slipping across the border to iraq in defiance of the 
un economic sanctions public criticism has been muted but us 
sources say they are concerned 
one jordanian political analyst who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity added his voice to a generally pessimistic mood 
jordan did not exist in 1920 he said there is no reason 
for it to exist in the year 2000

five floors under the streets of 
this desert capital lies the war room where us and saudi 
officers plan strategy for the troops tanks and aircraft hundreds 
of miles to the north 
the emphasis is on equal partnership as top officers gather 
behind the vaultlike doors twice a day for briefings on the latest 
situation in the confrontation with iraq 
officials familiar with the workings of the topsecret command 
post say the operations joint nature is intended to keep the 
massive us military force from overwhelming the saudis in their 
own country 
us officers acknowledge that the lines of command authority 
often appear fuzzy but insist there is no major conflict over who 
is in charge 
two associated press journalists were granted access to the 
command post on condition they did not name any officers or reveal 
the location of the center 
in interviews us and saudi officers agreed the system has 
worked relatively smoothly 
decisions can be taken jointly and then communicated to the 
separate command lines in the field said a senior us officer 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
but he noted his saudi counterpart at the center is free to 
issue orders to american officers 
even the name of the underground bunker is meant to symbolize 
harmony the coalition coordination communications and 
integration center or cccic which is based on nato and other 
integrated military headquarters 
weve taken pieces of experiences elsewhere and put them 
together the pieces intelligence operations air surface 
naval are all pretty standard how weve glued them together is 
whats different the senior officer explained 
the center set up in the early days of operation desert shield 
and still being assembled is run by two major generals one 
american and one saudi who sit at adjoining desks 
the rest of the large highceilinged room is taken up with 
groupings of desks for separate air land and sea operations 
officers mostly colonels and majors from the two countries 
work side by side to collect and analyze information from the 
field 
we try to keep the ranks as even as we can said a us 
officer 
business is conducted in english since few of the americans are 
proficient in arabic many of the saudi officers trained in the 
united states or britain 
the us general heading the american side is a veteran of 
service in saudi arabia his saudi counterpart wears a graduates 
ring from the us army war college at carlisle barracks pa 
some of us have a cultural awareness but even though we know 
each other were very conscious of the difference we dont 
dominate we specifically try to balance things said one us 
officer 
at the field command level us officers maintain control over 
their own troops the saudis lead their units as well as the 
egyptian syrian moroccan and other arab forces 
gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of the us forces in 
saudi arabia and his counterpart prince khaled bin sultan the 
saudi chief of staff are frequent visitors to the command center 
but in the event of war they would move around stay 
flexible because they can be in instant touch with the command 
center from anywhere the senior officer said 
should fighting actually break out he said there would be 
some sort of early warning the iraqis could not take us by 
surprise then there would be a focused integrated defense plan 
bringing all the us and islamic forces together

slowly for his taste 
chad sullivan 16 who had been kicked out of his grandmothers

were covered with slurs against blacks jews and police according 
to police and the apartments owner 
an orleans parish juvenile court judge is to decide monday 
whether sullivan should stand trial as an adult 
mrs gourrier was shot wednesday while driving in new orleans 
sullivan had been arrested thursday on a trespassing charge 
after police caught him swimming in a canal

saying that one of sullivans friends called police thursday and 
said the youth had been bragging about killing gourrier other 
friends confirmed the report the source told the newspaper

a man accused of gunning down two women 
college workers in a drunken shooting spree in a campus cafeteria 
has pleaded guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder 
john w aills faces a maximum of 100 years in prison on each 
count when he is sentenced oct 25 he also faces extradition on 
another charge to south carolina where he could get the death 
penalty 
aills originally pleaded innocent and indicated he would claim 
the may 18 shootings at carroll college a small roman catholic 
college in helena were a result of a mental disease or defect 
but a series of psychological evaluations this summer failed to 
support that defense lewis and clark county attorney mike mcgrath 
said before fridays hearing 
aills 34 from dayton ohio said little in court other than to 
acknowledge that he understood the charges against him and the 
consequences of his guilty pleas to deliberate homicide and 
attempted deliberate homicide 
asked about a possible motive mcgrath said friday there 
appeared to be none 
what the record shows is that he was very drunk and very 
mean he said of aills he had a long history of alcoholism and 
has had a gun fetish for a long time 
security was tight for the hearing because authorities had 
received several death threats against aills over the past two 
weeks said mcgrath he refused to elaborate 
the court was filled with relatives of the victims 
defense attorney nick jacques said aills did not remember 
anything of the shootings he said the guilty plea reflected aills 
belief that the evidence against him would be enough for 
convictions 
mcgrath recounted some details of the incident noting that 
there were witnesses and the murder weapon a 44caliber revolver 
was next to aills when he was found hiding under a fir tree on 
the campus shortly after the shootings 
aills a former ranch hand but unemployed at the time of his 
arrest has been held without bail since his arrest for the murder 
of sharon hance 52 a carroll college secretary and the wounding 
of emma peschke 42 a food service worker the two women were shot 
while they sat with a group of college workers on their coffee 
breaks 
after his sentencing he will be extradited to south carolina 
where he faces another murder charge in a 1987 stabbing mcgrath 
noted that aills could face the death penalty in that state

nasas fourth countdown for columbia 
began saturday as scientists prepared once again for the long 
astronomy mission and tried to keep their excitement in check 
columbia has been grounded for 3 months because of leaking 
hydrogen officials will not know for sure whether all of the leaks 
have been plugged until the shuttle is fueled for tuesdays early 
morning launch 
this is the fourth countdown were going through were 
getting a little bit too used to it said mission scientist ted 
gull but the nervousness of the first flight isnt there we 
know were ready and thats a very positive thing to say 
since the last launch attempt 1 weeks ago nasa has replaced 
two leaking components in columbias aft compartment a new set of 
recirculation pumps also was installed but engineers later 
determined there was nothing wrong with the ones that were removed 
hydrogen flooded columbias aft compartment during fueling for 
the sept 6 launch attempt but no leaks were detected around new 
fuel lines between the orbiter and external tank the site of 
extensive leaking during fueling for the first launch attempt in 
late may 
columbias second countdown was halted late last month after 
communication with one of four telescopes aboard the shuttle was 
disrupted the telescopes constitute a 150 million observatory 
called astro that will probe ultraviolet light and xrays emitted 
from some of the hottest objects in the universe 
gull and other scientists have had to revise astros observing 
schedule after each launch delay the mission originally was 
scheduled for march 1986 but was put on indefinite hold when 
challenger exploded earlier that year 
only three or four targets were lost as a result of the latest 
12day postponement gull said among the more than 260 objects 
astro is set to observe are a comet making its first recorded pass 
through the solar system a supernova and jupiter 
four astronomers who are part of columbias sevenman crew will 
operate astros three ultraviolet telescopes roundtheclock the 
xray telescope will be managed by computer commands sent from the 
ground 
the observatory will remain in the shuttles cargo bay 
throughout the nineto10day mission the first in five years 
devoted entirely to scientific research 
theres guarded excitement gull said i think its about 
time astro deserves success nasa deserves a success too 
nasa has not launched a shuttle since april when discovery 
carried the hubble space telescope into orbit two months later 
the 15 billion telescope was found to have a badly flawed mirror 
that blurs images 
launch director bob sieck said columbia will have two chances to 
lift off tuesday and wednesday if it isnt launched by then its 
mission will be postponed until after discoverys october mission 
to deploy a sunprobing satellite 
discovery must lift off by oct 23 or wait until late 1991 when 
earth is in proper alignment again with the sun and jupiter the 
satellite called ulysses needs jupiters gravity to achieve the 
right solar orbit 
gull already is mapping out an observing schedule for november 
in case columbia does not get off the ground this week 
were trying to hedge our bets he said

the chairman of the democratic party offered a 
preview saturday of his strategy for the 1990 elections full 
support for president bush on the persian gulf coupled with an 
allout attack on republican domestic policies 
saddam hussein will get no mixed signals from america or from 
this party ronald h brown told a meeting of the democratic 
national committee 
he declared that the opposition party stands behind our 
president as he acts to roll back iraqs blatant aggression 
but brown made clear where partisan politics begins 
well stand up to saddam hussein he said but we wont 
stand by as the new republican recession wreaks havoc on our 
economy 
the closest brown and his fellow democrats came to criticizing 
the republican president on the middle east was to denounce bush 
and ronald reagan for failing to have an energy policy that would 
make the nation less dependent on imported oil 
on domestic issues brown pulled no punches he hammered at bush 
for proposing massive tax cuts for americas plutocrats and he 
blamed the republicans for the savings and loan crisis 
were in the fall campaign for real and we democrats are 
running hard brown told the dnc 
his speech reflected the electionyear dilemma created by iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the bush administrations military 
response 
on the one hand the democrats feel they have no choice but to 
back the president at a time when american troops are confronting a 
hostile force overseas 
at the same time the persian gulf crisis has made it difficult 
for the democrats to get voters to pay attention to issues on which 
the republicans looked vulnerable before the invasion 
people are angry about the sampl scandals said ohio 
democratic chairman jim ruvolo and they blame republicans more 
than democrats 
but now thats faded into the background he added 
theres this big screen between voters and information and that 
screen is iraq 
the twoday democratic party meeting was remarkably free of the 
internal bickering has characterized such sessions in past years 
which was just what brown had hoped for 
the democrats adopted the formal call for their 1992 nominating 
convention including the rules which will determine how more than 
4000 delegtes will be allocated among the states and territories 
the precise allocations wont be known until after the 1990 
census and the shift in congressional seats california will have 
the largest convention delegation and its share of the total will 
increase dramatically preliminary census figures show california 
likely to gain seven new house seats 
in the past bitter fights have been waged around such arcane 
matters as the wording of the call but this time it passed without 
debate or a dissenting vote 
the democrats also adopted resolutions criticizing the 
republicans for lacking an energy policy and urging the president 
to sign legislation now moving through the democraticcontrolled 
congress that would strengthen laws barring discrimination in the 
workplace 
bush has threatened to veto the legislation on the grounds it 
would force businesses to adopt quotas and would promote increased 
litigation 
with browns strong backing the democrats tabled a resolution 
that would have urged budget negotiators to reject new taxes as a 
way to balance the bush federal budget

university of florida senior jodie 
spencer has been commuting 60 miles home to jacksonville ever since 
the bodies of five students were found in offcampus apartments 
im terrified said miss spencer i have an apartment 
here but i havent spent one night here since aug 28 and i will 
not until someone is arrested 
this college town has been reeling since the discovery of five 
murdered students three of them mutilated including one who was 
decapitated hundreds of students fled the campus on labor day 
weekend 
the fact that the mostpublicized suspect edward lewis 
humphrey 18 is in jail on unrelated charges has caused some 
students to let down their guard but has not eased the tension for 
many others humphrey a university of florida freshman with a 
fondness for military fantasy and knives has not been charged in 
the slayings 
im not back to normal even though i think everyone else is 
miss spencer said the severity of the mutilation is what bothers 
me 
university officials said an estimated 500 students have 
withdrawn from school as a result of the slayings which occurred 
as fall classes were starting 
michelle hager a 20yearold junior from miami says shes 
concerned that many students are neglecting their own safety now 
that three weeks have passed 
students are pretty much back in the swing of things but many 
are starting to slack off she said some of her friends are even 
walking alone at night she said 
most people think it is humphrey she said 
humphrey is being held in lieu of 11 million bond in brevard 
county he has been charged with beating his 79yearold 
grandmother at their home in indialantic about 180 miles away he 
also faces warrants in an aug 25 assault on two male university of 
florida students and an october 1988 armed burglary and attempted 
rape in indian river county 
the only other suspect whose name has been disclosed stephen 
bates 30 also is jailed on unrelated charges in the polk county 
jail in bartow 
while most of the public attention has focused on humphrey 
search of bates lakeland home has turned up a hangmans noose 
personal satanic writings and books on satanism and jack the 
ripper the lakeland ledger reported saturday 
police have said there are eight suspects 
i think a lot of people are letting down their guard because 
they think edward humphrey is the guy but i think the attacker is 
still out there said desiree mooney 22 a senior from west palm 
beach 
debbie rohlfing 20 a senior from montclair va lives in the 
hawaiian village apartments where humphrey also had an apartment 
she never met him 
i think a lot of people are trying to get on with their lives 
but some students are still paranoid she said she said she is 
acting as if the killer is loose and added people are being 
real careful 
danny grissom 22 a senior from miami said he and his roommate 
had taken precautions against attack 
my roommate has a gun and i have a knife he said i feel 
safe but even now i feel you have to be careful 
police said theyve seen a noticeable decline in tension 
things are calming down and leveling off said police lt 
sadie darnell who added that extra patrols around apartment 
complexes are continuing 
a dramatic jump in the number of calls to police was reported 
the week after the slayings calls to the 911 emergency number were 
up 81 percent and calls to the main police telephone number jumped 
557 percent 
calls are still more frequent than normal but are decreasing 
ms darnell said 
media attention also has dwindled but the killings are never 
far from the consciousness of university of florida students 
christopher cairns a 25yearold engineering student said 
business has picked up in the pub where he works immediately after 
the killings no one came in at night 
im more relaxed but still cautious he said thats how 
i am and i perceive others to be

should war break out in the persian gulf 
the weak link in iraqs formidable combatseasoned military 
machine could well be saddam husseins high command military 
analysts say 
his tightly centralized chain of command allows field commanders 
little tactical initiative a factor that frequently cost the 
iraqis dearly in the 198088 war with iran 
analysts say that saddams 1 millionman military the fourth 
biggest in the world after the united states the soviet union and 
china is led by men promoted because of loyalty rather than 
professional skills 
he surrounds himself with people who have very little 
operational ability said bernard trainor a former us marine 
general who has visited iraq several times their job is to keep 
the boss placated theyll even allow casualties in the field to do 
that 
the problem for saddam is that when youre in that kind of 
environment told only what you want to hear you lose your 
perspective and the ability to act decisively and quickly said 
trainor who heads the national security program at harvards john 
f kennedy school of government he spoke in a telephone interview 
from boston 
zeev eytan a former israeli army colonel who is now an analyst 
with the jaffee center for strategic studies in jerusalem noted 
saddam controls all military affairs so its safe to assume that 
corps and divisional commanders will do only what they are ordered 
to do 
eytan and others believe that the tight rein saddam keeps on his 
commanders inhibits their ability to conduct effective rapid 
maneuvers 
in the gulf war the iraqis performed better in defense than 
in offense they did well in offensive operations only when their 
missions had been well rehearsed eytan said 
as a civilian strategist with no formal military training 
saddam is reminiscent of hitler eytan said in a telephone 
interview 
hitler always intervened in high strategy often disastrously 
he trusted his own intuition more than the advice of the 
professionals around him he noted 
perhaps after fighting for eight years against iran saddam has 
acquired some grasp of military strategy eytan said 
many analysts dont think so 
saddam invaded iran in september 1980 expecting a quick victory 
instead he triggered the longest conventional war this century 
one that caused a million casualties by conservative estimates 
saddams inner circle of military advisers are air marshal hamid 
shaaban 59 who commanded the air force until last year and is now 
an adviser to saddam gen abdeljaber khalil shansal the 
70yearold defense minister and former chief of staff and brig 
gen hussein kamel 50 the minister of industry and military 
industrialization 
the current chief of staff is lt gen nizar abdulkarim 
alkhazraji a corps commander during the persian gulf war 
shaaban and kamel who is saddams cousin and soninlaw are 
both members of his clan from takrit his hometown in northern 
iraq kamel is widely considered to be the rising star in baghdad 
and a possible successor to saddam 
shansal was made defense minister after gen adnan khairallah 
saddams cousin and brotherinlaw who held the post throughout the 
war died in a mysterious helicopter crash in 1989 
the iraqis said the helicopter went down in a sandstorm but 
word was khairallah had been feuding with saddam 
since he took power in 1979 saddam has made sure that the 
military has been put under the complete control of the ruling 
baath party the only political organization military men can 
belong to 
the army is riddled with informers from saddams security 
apparatus all senior military posts are held by baathists and 
there are party cadres assigned to all heaquarters down to 
battalion level 
saddam doesnt trust the army its the only institution that 
could threaten him said trainor 
eytan said saddam constantly shuffles commanders around to 
prevent any of them from establishing a power base he regularly 
purges the military particularly of important officers or war 
heroes whose popularity he perceives as a threat 
this discourages initiative in the officer corps said 
eytan everyones very careful in iraq 
diplomats in baghdad have recently reported signs of unrest in 
the officer corps unconfirmed reports have said as many as 120 
officers have been executed for opposing the invasion of kuwait 
its not clear how the army views saddams decision to throw in 
the towel with iran last month relinquishing all territory seized 
in the war and giving tehran sovereignty over the eastern half of 
the shattalarab waterway 
saddam did that to secure his eastern border with iran while he 
was locked in the escalating confrontation with the united states 
it must have been a bitter pill for the army to swallow they 
must have wondered what the hell they fought the iranians for eight 
years for said hansheino kopietz a middle east specialist 
until recently with londons international institute for strategic 
studies

the likelihood of a lengthy us 
military deployment in saudi arabia is fostering nervousness among 
commanders who doubt diplomacy will resolve the crisis and think 
time may be on saddam husseins side 
apprehensions became apparent over the last week that a long 
wait in the desert could try the patience of saudi hosts hurt 
soldiers morale and make a scapegoat of the us military 
as the feeling that war with iraq is inevitable has given way to 
uncertainty discontent has surfaced among us troops complaints 
have flowed from both americans and saudis about the cultural 
strains caused by the us presence 
despite public statements to the contrary top us officers in 
saudi arabia are increasingly saying in private that time is more 
an enemy of the united states and saudi arabia than of saddam 
while the final decision may be out of their hands us 
commanders are engaged in a debate over whether to push for a 
deadline after which force would be used 
saudi leaders clearly oppose a long deployment 
six months will be pushing it a saudi diplomatic official 
said recently in a private discussion our society will not be 
able to take more than that if theres no war by then well start 
one for you 
a saudi government official in oilrich eastern province where 
most us troops are settling in said theres a big group of 
people out there who wish to see a military action quickly 
for now diplomacy must be given a chance us commanders say 
some hold out slim hopes a resolution will be reached in any case 
the united states needs 610 weeks to complete its military 
buildup 
gen michael dugan the air force chief of staff said the two 
possible courses of action now were patience and sweat or 
violence and blood 
dugan endorsed patience but he acknowledged if theres any 
culture in the world thats impatient its mine its the united 
states 
by late october were going to be faced with a fundamental 
decision said a ranking officer speaking on condition he not be 
named did we come here to sit and watch and wait or did we come 
here to put saddam hussein in his place were going to need a 
clear mission or were going to be in big trouble 
the prospect of waiting much past the end of october alarms 
military commanders 
politically they fear that arab support even saudi support 
for the deployment might begin to waver a greater worry is that 
the american publics support might begin to erode 
im not sure the american people will be with us for the long 
haul a senior officer said during a visit to saudi arabia last 
week theres great support now but its an uneasy support and 
could disappear quickly 
he said he believed the helsinki summit between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev ended with a gentlemans 
agreement to give moscow for years a close iraqi ally time to 
attempt a backdoor diplomatic solution 
my understanding is that in exchange we asked the soviets to 
be supportive or at least understanding if it came down to 
military action he said 
but another official on that trip said it was highly unlikely 
the united states would ever take unilateral military action 
against iraq 
if the worlds support collapses and its us against saddam 
the military will be set up to take the fall thats what a lot of 
us are worrying about the official said 
evidence is mounting that neither commanders nor their troops 
particularly like it in saudi arabia with its harsh desert 
conditions far from home and rigid social customs particularly 
attitudes toward women 
at each base camp he visited last week gen colin powell 
chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff was asked by soldiers 
when they could go home at one point a saudi officer ran up to a 
us commander and demanded that us servicewomen be sent home 
every day were running into a new aspect of cultural 
differences the us commander gen h norman schwarzkopf said 
in an interview theres no magic solution 
powell suggested thursday that rotations are planned to give the 
troops stationed in saudi arabia a break 
but many units have brought most of their men and assets with 
them leaving little leeway for rotations 
when the enthusiasm starts to wane and there are signs that 
it is already well face some morale challenges an army general 
said its my biggest worry right now but i dont have any 
answers

if visitors to the evansville museums 
earthquake exhibit arent all shaken up theyre certainly 
attentive particularly since a scientist has predicted a quake 
could hit the area this december 
a lot of times people walk through exhibits nod their heads 
and walk out this one they pay attention to said mitchell 
luman the museums science director 
new mexico climatologist iben browning who believes quakes can 
be triggered by tidal forces putting stress on earthquake faults 
has estimated that a major quake could strike the midwest on dec 2 
or 3 
although many earthquake specialists scoff at the notion they 
say there is no doubt there will be a major quake along the new 
madrid fault eventually 
we tell people its not necessarily going to appen in 
december but it is going to happen luman said we tell people 
to be prepared all the time 
the temporary exhibit sponsored by the independent insurance 
agents of evansville was planned three years ago long before 
brownings prediction caused a sensation luman said 
but the museum welcomes the attention the shake rattle and 
roll display which includes a seismograph faultline maps and 
safety tips has been extended two months until dec 16 because of 
its popularity 
about 16000 people have visited the museum since the display 
opened july 8 luman said he said there was no way to know how 
many were attracted by the earthquake information which uses about 
10 percent of the museums space 
but its obvious that the display is causing a stir 
people spend two to four times as long in here as they do in 
other exhibits in this space luman said theyre really 
serious and engaged by what they see here 
maps show the location of the new madrid fault system which 
reaches through kentucky missouri tennessee and arkansas 
paducah ky is just 30 miles from its northern end memphis 
tenn lies 25 miles from the southern end 
in 1811 and 1812 a series of violent quakes centered in new 
madrid mo were felt across much of the eastern united states 
they have been estimated at around 8 on the richter scale far 
higher for example than last years san francisco area quake 
there is a 50 percent chance that the area around the new madrid 
fault will be hit by an earthquake of at least 60 on the richter 
scale within the next 10 years luman said there is a 90 percent 
chance of such a quake within the next 50 years he said 
the museum quotes a federal emergency management agency study 
that says a major new madrid earthquake 76 on the richter scale 
would kill 227 people in the evansville area if it hit during a 
school day more than 1000 people would be injured and 11000 
would have to leave their homes the study predicts 
nevertheless luman said the museum tried to get its safety 
message across while keeping the exhibits tone light 
its not doom and gloom were not trying to get too 
serious luman said thats why the title is shake rattle 
and roll its not live now die later 
visitors walk through a threeroom model of a house where the 
safest areas to go during a quake are marked off those include 
doorways and underneath strong tables the exhibit also shows how 
to make homes safer in case of a quake 
a quakes destructive potential was not lost on 8yearold zach 
fussner of newburgh who recently viewed the museums photographs 
of the oct 17 san francisco earthquake with his mother 
whats scary about it is am i going to live or what he 
said what if i die my house might fall on me 
zach said he felt better however knowing he should be safer 
hiding under his desk if a quake strikes

the magellan spacecraft bounced radar 
off venus today trying to make maps of the cloudcovered planet 
for the first time since the probe was plagued by communications 
blackouts a month ago 
were mapping said jim scott magellan mission director at 
the national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory most people are sighing with relief 
magellan started bouncing radar waves off the cloudcovered 
planet at 916 am pdt he said the spacecraft is designed to 
collect the echoes then send the information to earth where they 
will be assembled into maps and pictures 
confirmation that the radar echoes were collected properly and 
would result in good pictures was expected later today scott said 
adding the pictures should be released publicly sometime next week 
engineers lost radio contact with magellan for 14 hours starting 
aug 16 then for 17 hours beginning aug 21 
they still havent learned the cause of the temporary blackouts 
which they have said could happen again but they gave magellan new 
computer instructions so it can recover quickly from future 
communications breakdowns 
magellans 744 million mission is designed to produce the most 
detailed pictures yet of venus surface concealed beneath dense 
clouds as well as a global map of the planet 
the craft was launched from the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 and started orbiting venus on aug 10

egypt intensifying its campaign against 
iraq said saturday it has restricted the entry of iraqis and 
citizens of countries that support baghdad and prohibited 
politicans and journalists from attending a proiraq conference 
a senior security officer said the curbs apply to jordanians 
yemenis palestinians and kuwaitis 
previously citizens of those countries could get sixmonth 
visas automatically on arrival in egypt like nationals of other

police on saturday announced 
iron fist measures intended to halt savage street fighting that 
has killed almost 800 blacks but the african national congress 
called them too little too late 
the measures include curfews roadblocks and the deployment of 
more police and soldiers in black townships plagued by almost five 
weeks of violence maj gen gerrit erasmus told a news conference 
anc leader nelson mandela has repeatedly called for stronger 
government action including use of the military to quell the 
unrest 
after meeting friday with president fw de klerk mandela 
accused the government of instigating the fighting and warned of 
civil war if it continued 
mr mandela wants an iron fist we will give an iron fist 
erasmus said saturday iron fist is the operations code name 
he said razor wire would be placed around migrant worker hostels 
and squatter camps flashpoints for much of the fighting anyone 
entering or leaving the compounds would be searched for weapons 
erasmus said 
police vehicles would have machine guns installed on top to 
protect officers from attacks by blacks with assault rifles the 
official said police patrols already carry submachine guns in 
addition to shotguns 
the government last month sent police and army reinforcements 
into the townships and imposed emergency regulations but the 
violence raged on and has spread into johannesburg itself 
almost all the fighting occurs at night when there are 
virtually no police patrols in the townships the main combatants 
are zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha movement and xhosas and 
other blacks who support mandelas anc 
police said saturday the townships were quiet however 
associated press staffers witnessed an unarmed black being stoned 
stabbed and then burned to death at a train station in soweto on 
saturday morning the attackers said they were supporters of the 
anc and the victim was a zulu who backed inkatha 
mandela told a news conference later saturday he believed the 
new police measures would be totally ineffective 
he noted more than 700 blacks had been killed in the fighting 
since aug 12 but the new measures came after attacks in recent 
days that killed several police officers including two whites 
if these two policemen had not died i can assure you the 
government would not have come out with these measure mandela 
said 
it looks like the government is arming itself to deal with the 
liberation movement he said adding that other countries used 
water cannon and tear gas not live ammunition to control crowds 
asked who he thought was behind recent attacks on blacks in 
train stations and townships mandela said certain state 
agencies were involved the security forces are suspect he 
said 
he gave no indication the anc intends to reverse its decision 
last month to suspend its 29year armed struggle against the 
government but he said people have the right to be armed to defend 
themselves in their homes 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi said saturday he believes 
the primary cause of the violence is the ancs decadeslong calls 
on south africans to kill for political purposes 
the anc and inkatha the two main black opposition groups blame 
each other for the violence both oppose apartheid but differ over 
tactics and plans for a future south africa 
black leaders also have charged that a secret third party 
possibly rightwing whites has taken part in attacks on blacks 
rightwing whites have rejected de klerks reform efforts and 
threatened armed struggle against attempts to end white domination 
in south africa 
de klerk said friday that unidentified groups were attempting to 
sabotage government efforts to end apartheid and draw up a new 
constitution free of racial discrimination

a judge rejected a mathematicians 
bid to have his head frozen before he dies so that future 
scientists can find a way to cure a malignant brain tumor and 
attach his head to a healthy body 
superior court judge ronald stevens dismissed a petition friday 
by thomas donaldson for the right to have cryonics technicians 
freeze his head before he is pronounced legally dead 
stevens said the courts have allowed the terminally ill to 
refuse medical treatment but it would mark a giant step to 
allow others to freeze donaldson before he is declared dead the 
judge ruled 
assistant attorney general kristofer jorstad said donaldson can 
put a bullet into his own heart but he cant have people 
associated with cryonics put that bullet into his heart thats 
murder one 
donaldson 46 of sunnyvale says he wants his head quickfrozen 
using a process known as cryonic suspension the procedure is 
allowed after death from natural causes but donaldson contends 
that if he waits until then there would be no point in being 
revived 
under the current stupid criteria my brain could be entirely 
destroyed before im declared dead said donaldson a computer 
consultant to silicon valley companies thats why i filed the 
lawsuit 
donaldson said his tumor cannot be surgically removed and has 
not responded to chemotherapy according to court papers its 
currently stable and he has a 40 percent chance of living until 
august 1993 
donaldson has 30 days to amend his suit and resubmit it to the 
judge he said he would appeal if it is rejected again 
if the case goes all the way to the supreme court and they 
turn me down ill just starve myself to death then i can be 
frozen before my brain goes and no one can be prosecuted he 
said 
donaldson said he believes scientists eventually will be able to 
safely remove the tumor then use his cells to create another body 
as i see it this is the only alternative to death he said 
i know we dont have all the technology right now but i think 
its entirely possible in the future

west germany will provide more 
than 2 billion in immediate support for the usled military 
operations in the gulf chancellor helmut kohl said today 
kohl announced the figure of 21 billion after talks with us 
secretary of state james a baker iii at the chancellors home in 
this town in the southwest of the country 
the united states has been pressing west germany its richest 
european ally to help meet the mounting costs of stationing some 
150000 troops in saudi arabia and participating in the naval 
armada that is enforcing the unimposed sanctions on iraq 
before the specific number was made public baker had told 
reporters after a luncheon meeting with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher that were very pleased with the 
numbers that were presented at lunch baker had described them as 
significant and substantial figures 
west germany had been sharply criticized in the united states 
for the small size of its assistance thus far 
genscher said the west german government was determined to help 
with the enforcement of un sanctions against iraq 
baker arrived in bonn this afternoon on the most difficult stop 
of his latest trip abroad he was determined to overcome west 
germanys sluggish response to helping out in the campaign against 
iraq 
baker was bolstered in his talks in west germany by separate 
letters from the pentagon and the state and treasury departments 
and a pledge from the italian government of eight fighter planes 
and a warship to join the international naval force in the gulf 
us officials said the letters laid out the case for helping to 
meet the mounting costs of the gulf effort 
britain on friday became the first european country to commit 
ground forces to the gulf ordering an armored brigade of 6000 
troops and 120 tanks to saudi arabia and baker said in rome that 
canada was sending forces to help prevent any additional actions by 
iraq which invaded neighboring kuwait on aug 2 
all of this taken together i think can only send a very 
clear signal that the international community is united in wanting 
to see a reversal of this aggression baker said as he posed for 
pictures with italian president francesco cossiga 
the west german transport ministry already has given the united 
states a list of more than 50 merchant ships that could be used to 
transport us troops to the gulf the united states also has made 
contact with west german civilian airline companies to determine 
whether planes could be chartered to ferry troops to the middle 
east 
the west german government however says that it is up to the 
individual companies to decide whether they wish to put the ships 
and planes at american disposal 
baker last week raised 12 billion from saudi arabia the united 
arab emirates and the overthrown kuwaiti regime 
syrian president hafez assad told baker in damascus on friday 
that he would send more troops to saudi arabia syria has sent 
3000 troops there already and western sources estimated assad 
might send as many as 15000 more 
japan announced meanwhile that it would contribute 4 billion 
other countries have offered lesser amounts or logistical support 
but in the meantime the situation appeared to worsen as iraqi 
soldiers swarmed the diplomatic compound of france canada and 
belgium on friday in kuwait

three weeks after iraq ordered 
embassies in kuwait to close their doors governments around the 
world are pondering the purpose of an embassy and the duty of a 
diplomat 
as of saturday 20 embassies about onethird of the diplomatic 
missions in the conquered emirate were still defying the order to 
shut down 
in the sweltering heat of the persian gulf the iraqi occupiers 
have steadily stepped up the pressure on the diplomats surrounding 
their missions with soldiers and cutting off water electricity and 
food supplies 
tensions reached a new high last week when iraqi troops raided 
the diplomatic compounds of france canada belgium and the 
netherlands and temporarily detained half a dozen diplomats 
france announced saturday it would dispatch 4000 more soldiers 
to the persian gulf and expel iraqi military attaches in paris in 
response to the iraqi raids 
six days after its aug 2 invasion iraq annexed kuwait and 
subsequently told the embassies they had no further business in the 
emirate kuwait was now an iraqi state baghdad said and diplomats 
who chose to stay on would no longer have diplomatic immunity 
that was a serious threat in a country where western civilians 
have been rounded up and taken to key installations to serve as 
human shields against potential us attack 
nations which have many citizens trapped in kuwait have an 
incentive to stay open as long as possible but even those 
diplomats who are doggedly remaining at their posts behind locked 
doors with dwindling supplies and patchy communications may no 
longer be able to help anyone 
even so the principle is important to many governments they 
believe closing down their embassies could be interpreted as tacit 
recognition of the iraqi rulers 
the application of that principle has taken many forms 
some ambassadors have declared that their embassies remain open 
but have abandoned their compounds or flown home at the swiss 
embassy the flag is still flying and the gardener is in charge 
finland and turkey pulled their diplomats out of kuwait early on 
but said their empty embassies were symbolically open the soviet 
union evacuated all its citizens and closed the embassy but said 
it still maintains diplomatic relations with kuwait 
norwegian foreign ministry spokesman bjorn blokhus said it was 
not worth staying open once the risk to diplomats safety became 
too great but the norwegian ambassador whose government ordered 
him to leave last week said he could have held out longer 
one western diplomat in oslo suggested some envoys may have 
their own reasons for facing down the iraqi threat 
frankly holding out for two weeks without food or water in 
terrible heat is a great career booster said the diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
some envoys including dutch ambassador joop veling have been 
cautioned not to engage in any exaggerated heroics 
but others including the egyptians were told to hold out in 
kuwait as long as was humanly possible and until conditions became 
impossible to endure said a foreign ministry official in cairo 
that point came last thursday when egypt pulled out its staff 
it is difficult for foreign ministry officials to assess misery 
levels from thousands of miles away the decision to evacuate is 
usually taken in consultation with the diplomat in the field 
but with telephone lines cut and generators that power shortwave 
radios wearing down communication is difficult 
even in embassies where living conditions have been tolerable 
the diplomats lot has been difficult 
the psychological stress is heavy life is monotonous there 
is always the chance for trouble said belgian foreign ministry 
spokesman johan verbeke 
at the us embassy once a posh palmshaded compound food is 
reported to be scarce or spoiling the diplomats have boiled water 
from the swimming pool to drink burned furniture for cooking fuel 
and slept outside with the bugs to escape the heat 
still ambassador w nathaniel howell has been lowkey about the 
hardships it isnt very pleasant he said

be confined to paris 
iraqi solders also invaded the embassies of canada and belgium 
on friday 
they did not invade the us embassy where ambassador nathaniel 
howell and a handful of aides held out despite a cutoff of 
electricity and water 
state department spokesman mark dillon said saturday that their 
situation remained the same and there had been no word of any 
iraqi moves on the us compound despite the continuing presence 
of soldiers outside 
the administration meanwhile prepared to submit to congress a 
request to sell saudi arabia 18 billion worth of weapons 
including f15 fighter planes tanks and other sophisticated arms 
according to an official 
the administration has already proposed selling saudi arabia 3 
billion in new weapons to bolster its defenses including f15 
fighter planes m60 tanks 15000 rounds of armorpiercing 
antitank ammunition and 200 stinger antiaircraft missiles 
the official late friday that the package was not yet finalized 
but would result from us analysis of saudi arabias military 
needs to stand against a potential invasion threat from iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
the expanded package has been under review but no 
recommendations have come to the white house another 
administration official said saturday 
the new york times said in saturdays editions that the new 
package includes 24 additional f15s as many as 48 apache 
helicopters 385 m1a2 tanks 400500 m2 bradley personnel 
carriers and thousands of trucks and jeeps 
the washington post said the package would range from 18

an international conference seeking tighter 
nuclear export controls ended without a formal accord saturday 
after the united states and mexico disagreed on the issue of atomic 
weapons tests 
oswaldo de rivero of peru chairman of the meeting reviewing 
compliance with the 1970 nonproliferation treaty said mexico 
blocked consensus on a final declaration which would have 
contained important advances in the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons 
earlier mexico appeared ready to drop its call for a halt to 
nuclear testing by 1995 in return for a commitment by the united 
states britain and the soviet union to begin negotiations on a 
ban conference sources said 
the compromise collapsed when western countries wanted to insert 
a reference to stepbystep negotiations mexico apparently saw 
the phrase as an attempt to water down the pledge by the nuclear 
powers said the sources speaking on condition of anomyity 
us policy states testing is needed to ensure the safety and 
reliability of nuclear weapon stockpiles us officials also note 
two of the worlds five nuclear weapon powers france and china 
are not members of the treaty organization 
the treaty binds states that do not possess nuclear weapons from 
building or acquiring them in return the three nuclear weapon 
states in the pact the united states britain and the soviet 
union pledge to work toward nuclear disarmament and to provide 
nonmilitary atomic technology to other nations 
the fourweek meeting attended by about 100 of the the groups 
141 member countries ended early saturday after unsuccessful 
negotiations between mexico the united states and other nations 
spurred by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait delegates agreed 
friday on draft measures aimed at strengthening the treatys ban on 
the spread of nuclear weapons iraq is a member of the group but 
has tried to acquire possible nuclear bomb parts 
the draft measures were to have been included in a final 
conference declaration 
because there was no final document adopted the texts which 
had been negotiated in the conference have no legal status 
conference spokeswoman lucy webster said 
members of the treaty organization meet every five years

the spacecraft magellan bombarded venus 
with radar saturday in the first attempt to make pictures of the 
planets cloudshrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost 
touch with it last month 
most people are sighing with relief said jim scott 
magellan mission director at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory were just happy to 
get into the position where we wanted to be 
acting on computerized commands radioed 1549 million miles from 
earth magellan started bouncing radar off the planet during the 
morning and engineers received confirmation 13 minutes later scott 
said 
nasas deep space network tracking station at goldstone calif 
started receiving data on the radar images and computers will 
assemble it into pictures that will be released to the public early 
this week said ed sherry technical assistant to magellans 
project manager 
im just delighted im happy as a clam he said 
magellans 744 million mission is designed to produce the most 
detailed pictures yet of venus surface totally concealed by 
clouds as well as a global map of the planet it was launched from 
the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 and started orbiting 
venus on aug 10 after a looping 948 millionmile voyage from 
earth 
the spacecrafts radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed 
than those produced by earthbased radar or radar on the soviet 
venera 15 and 16 spacecraft which reached venus in the mid1980s 
engineers lost radio contact with magellan for 14 hours starting 
aug 16 then for 17 hours beginning aug 21 they still havent 
learned the cause of the temporary blackouts which they believe 
could happen again 
but they gave magellan new computer instructions so it can 
recover quickly from future communications breakdowns 
the aug 16 blackout happened only hours after magellan used its 
radar for its first pictures of venus during two orbits around the 
planet only 1 orbits worth of picture information was sent to 
earth before contact was lost 
half the remaining picture information was radioed to earth on 
wednesday and the rest was sent back saturday before mapping 
resumed scott said 
the first pictures showed venus has large flows of solidified 
lava pervasive venusquake faults big meteorite impact 
craters volcanic cinder cones large collapsed volcanic craters 
called calderas and parallel mountain ridges and valleys like 
those in the great basin that covers most of nevada and western 
utah 
nasas official position is that magellans formal mapping 
mission wont begin until late this month but if all goes well 
through the weekend officials may decide afterward that the 
243day mapping effort began saturday scott and sherry said 
venus the second planet from the sun rotates once on its axis 
every 243 earth days magellan circles venus in a nearly polar 
orbit so as venus revolves beneath it the craft should be able to 
map 70 percent to 90 percent of the planet during its 243day 
mission nasa however has said it expects to use magellan for 
additional 243day cycles so the entire planet can be mapped 
venus is considered earths virtual twin in terms of size mass 
density and distance from the sun although the planets surface 
has been heated to 900 degrees fahrenheit by a runaway greenhouse 
effect 
magellans goal to learn exactly what forces shape venus and 
whether its crust is broken into giant drifting plates like those

the snake out of the tree and sent his wife to the store to find

two marxist palestinians who were banned 
from jordan for 20 years were greeted by loud applause as a 
conference of leftist and islamic groups convened saturday to 
demonstrate solidarity with saddam hussein 
the participation of george habash and nayef hawatmeh 
underscored a growing alliance between iraq and radical arab 
factions that is alarming western officials 
habash is leader of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine and nayef hawatmeh heads the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine 
habash and other palestinian leaders were kicked out of jordan 
after the 1970 civil war pitting plo rebels against the jordanian 
army the war started when habashs guerrillas hijacked three 
jetliners and blew them up in the jordanian desert 
habash was welcomed back at the start of a threeday conference 
of arab leftists and islamic activists sympathetic to iraq who 
demand that the usled multinational force leave the persian gulf 
region 
jordans king hussein considered a us ally has been 
inclining toward his powerful neighbor saddam since iraq invaded 
kuwait aug 2 the king has said he opposes the occupation of 
kuwait but wants an arab solution of the crisis 
in his speech saturday habash urged washington to avoid double 
standards in dealing with iraqs invasion and israels occupation 
of arab territories 
we reject the us principle of selectivity in dealing with 
the un security council resolutions habash said in a speech 
marked by ovations from the audience of about 150 delegates 
shortly after the invasion saddam said he would contemplate 
leaving kuwait only if un resolutions calling for israels 
withdrawal from occupied lands were implemented at the same time 
israel seized the west bank gaza strip and the golan heights in 
1967 and has held a border strip in south lebanon since 1982 
saddams declaration threw many palestinian leaders into his 
camp habash who had been based in syria recently moved his 
headquarters to baghdad 
suleiman arar speaker of jordans house of representatives 
warned against the formation of a usled alliance in the gulf 
the sole successful solution lies in the arab context without 
foreign pressures he said 
the threeday conference patronized by the jordanian monarch 
is being held under the slogan of expressing solidarity with iraq 
in its confrontation of the imperialist offensive in the gulf 
the delegates represent about 20 parties and political groups 
from morocco tunisia algeria libya sudan mauritania yemen 
lebanon syria jordan iraq and the plo 
egyptian opposition parliament members planned to attend but 
were barred from traveling to jordan by the government of president 
hosni mubarak which has sent forces to saudi arabia to oppose 
iraq 
hawatmeh took a more moderate stance than habash during a news 
conference friday but he made clear that palestinians would 
support iraq against western aggression 
we say to the aggressors hands off the gulf region if an 
aggression takes place all of us will side with iraq hawatmeh 
said 
he implicitly supported iraqs withdrawal from kuwait however 
when he said a solution to the gulf crisis should depend on 
allowing the right to selfdetermination to all peoples of the 
region

government troops advanced through 
boobytrapped buildings and mined streets saturday seeking to 
capture an abandoned hospital and gain a strategic edge in 
warravaged jaffna military officials said 
the hospital is in the center of the rebelheld town and about a 
mile from jaffna fort controlled by government troops that claim 
they defeated tamil separatist guerrillas thursday to end a 
threemonth siege 
the government meanwhile warned citizens of possible attack by 
tamil forces in the northern jaffna region most of which is 
controlled by the rebels 
due to the success of the security forces in the jaffna 
peninsula the tamil tigers heirarchy has instructed its cadres 
to attack civilians said a defense ministry statement issued 
saturday 
military officials did not say how far their men had advanced 
toward the hospital but a senior officer said troops were under 
constant rebel fire and progress was slow because of mines buried 
in the streets and booby traps hidden in buildings along the way 
control of the hospital would give the sinhalesedominated 
government a major base in the town of 60000 people and more 
importantly a chance to win support among residents by resuming 
medical services 
the overwhelmingly tamil town 185 miles northeast of the capital 
city of colombo has been a rebel stronghold since the separatist 
war against sri lankas sinhalese majority began in 1983 
but recent battles in the area and the rebels strongarm 
tactics of soliciting funds has sapped enthusiasm for the guerrilla 
cause in jaffna recent visitors to the town reported 
at least 14000 people have been killed in the civil war 
the government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least 
136 wounded since the siege on the 17th century fort was broken 
thursday it claims more than 100 tamil rebels have died 
the tamil office in london however denied the siege had been 
broken the rebels also claimed they downed a government plane with 
a sovietmade sam7 missile 
the government acknowleged a singleengine groundattack plane 
crashed in jaffna lagoon on thursday but it said the pilot ditched 
the italianmade marchetti aircraft when he could not pull out of a 
dive after attacking a rebel gun position the pilot was reported 
missing 
military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
accused the rebels of killing eight unarmed moslem civilians 
including four children in eastern sri lanka thursday night and 
friday 
four guerrillas were killed in clashes with government troops in 
the region the officials said 
the rebels seek political autonomy or independence for the tamil 
minority claiming sinhalese discrimination in jobs education and 
use of the sinhala language 
the sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the nations 16 
million people control the government and the military 
tamils account for 18 percent of the people and live mostly in 
the northern and eastern sections of the island nation moslems 
make up 7 percent of the population

restore diplomatic relations with israel after a 23year gap if 
israel agrees to participate in an international peace conference 
italys foreign minister said saturday 
israels prime minister yitzhak shamir has made it clear that 
israel would only consider taking part in an international 
conference limited to the persian gulf crisis 
foreign minister gianni de michelis met with gorbachev a day 
after the soviet president met with israels finance and science

to recognize israel immediately if it agrees to participate in an 
international conference that would determine rules and principles 
for security and cooperation in the region said de michelis

on sept 4 the soviets proposed an international conference to 
discuss the persian gulf the arabisraeli dispute and the lebanese 
civil war 
at the time soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
the soviet union might take a fresh look at the issue of 
sovietisraeli relations if the jewish state agreed to 
participate

conference over the palestinian conflict fearing such a wide forum 
would try to force israel to concede territory to the arabs

yitzhak modai and science minister yuval neeman who were in moscow 
discussing a trade deal the meeting was not announced beforehand 
neeman said saturday in jerusalem that gorbachevs warm

new level that i assume is the last before complete relations 
israeli foreign minister david levy and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze are expected to meet later this month during

palestine liberation organization and shipped arms to militant arab 
states including iraq it cut off arms supplies to iraq the day 
after it invaded kuwait

chancellor helmut kohl on 
saturday extended nearly 2 billion in economic and military aid to 
the drive led by the united states against iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
the action announced outside his country home in the rhineland 
after a 90minute meeting with secretary of state james a baker 
iii overrode the hesitation west germany had shown to more than 
nominal participation in the usled persian gulf campaign 
we are aware of our responsibility kohl said we are 
ready and willing to do our share 
apart from the 187 billion kohl pledged to the united states 
and to poor nations west germany is contributing 271 million as 
part of an aid package approved by the 12nation european 
community 
there was no indication that west germany would contribute to 
the military force assembled in the gulf to guard oil fields in 
saudi arabia against an iraqi takeover and to police the economic 
embargo of iraq authorized aug 6 by the united nations security 
council 
still the german contribution marked a turnabout and reflected 
the growing confidence of a nation already the richest in europe 
that will grow more power after unification 
about half the german aid will go this year to the united states 
to help defray the staggering cost of stationing troops in saudi 
arabia and deploying a naval armada in the persian gulf 
the other half kohl said will go to poor nations battered by 
the crisis kohl singled out jordan egypt and turkey 
the chancellor said the west german constitution which he hopes 
parliament will change after unification with east germany 
prohibits sending troops and warships to the gulf 
but he said the forces there are also defending our 
interests 
asked if iraq could be compelled to relinquish its control of 
kuwait short of war the german leader said i hope so i am no 
prophet 
he said iraq which invaded the smaller oilrich gulf country 
aug 2 has to acknowledge the largest share of the world 
community is against it 
with tears in his eyes kohl thanked the united states for 
helping to fulfill the german dream of unification which will 
occur oct 3 
baker said as germany becomes larger and greater its 
responsibilities grow 
no one could draw any conclusion but that germany is doing 
more he said they go far beyond what we had discussed through 
private channels and substantially 
in all baker raised nearly 14 billion during his 11day trip 
which ended with his flight back to washington from west germany 
three oilrich arab countries saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and the kuwaiti monarchy overthrown by iraq volunteered 
12 billion after talking to baker last week 
about half will offset us expenses which will total about 9 
billion by the end of the year and the other half will go to poor 
countries 
i think that the trip has been very successful in terms of 
pointing up the isolation of iraq baker said 
the west german assistance includes 636 million in radio 
equipment cranes generators and equipment to protect us 
soldiers against chemical weapons about 60 armored vehicles worth 
127 million are designed to detect chemical weapons about 254 
million will go toward transportation costs 
egypt will receive about 650 million in aid about 135 million 
will go to jordan which is saddled with caring for thousands of 
refugees from iraq and kuwait and about 75 million is for turkey 
a nato member which has lost the revenues of an iraqi pipeline that 
ran through the country and was closed at the start of the crisis 
kohl said the turks also will receive from germany some 
defense materiel for which he did not offer a pricetag 
i was very pleased by the numbers that were presented to us 
baker said after west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher outlined the assistance earlier over lunch at petersberg 
a new government guest house in the hills outside bonn 
baker called the sums very significant and very substantial 
he later confirmed the offer with kohl at his country home near 
heidelberg 
until bakers visit west germany had offered 65 million in 
technical aid to the us forces in saudi arabia but the high cost 
of unification with east germany 77 billion to the soviet union 
alone to compensate for the withdrawal of 370000 soviet troops 
stoo in the way of a larger contribution 
west germany imports negligible amounts of oil from the gulf 
getting most of its supplies from norway and britain 
still considering its wealth and world power status the 
germans distance from the usled campaign against hussein raised 
eyebrows in congress 
italy volunteered a squadron of tornadoes during bakers visit 
to rome while egypt and syria said they would send more troops to 
saudi arabia 
two countries baker did not visit britain and france said 
they would send more troops and canada joined the international 
force with a squadron of 12 cf18 jets to fly cover for three 
canadian warships en route 
france is sending 4000 soldiers including an 1100man 
helicopter regiment 48 tanks and a squadron of 30 warplanes and 48 
helicopters 
britain is contributing an additional 6000 combat troops and 
120 tanks

three east german government ministers 
including defense minister rainer eppelmann are suspected by 
investigators of having cooperated with the former communist secret 
police an east berlin newspaper reported saturday 
eppelmann said the allegations were totally made up 
according to the east german news agency adn 
the berliner zeitung said eppelmann along with construction 
minister axel viehweger and former economics minister gerhard pohl 
were also on a list of suspected former agents for the secret 
police or stasi 
the list of names was compiled by a committee set up by 
parliament to conduct a probe into whether any lawmakers might have 
been stasi agents 
officials overseeing the dismantling of the stasi have said that 
three government ministers and 68 deputies in the 400member 
volkskammer or parliament are suspected of having been secret 
police agents 
their names had not been published until saturdays report in 
the berliner zeitung which did not say how it obtained the list 
prime minister lothar de maiziere said the government will 
investigate the latest allegations 
eppelmann a lutheran pastor often sheltered dissidents during 
the communist regime and played a leading role in the popular 
movement that brought down the communist government last year 
he later helped found a small conservative party the democratic 
awakening and became minister of defense and disarmament in east 
germanys first democratically elected government in april 
de maizieres government has been rocked by growing allegations 
that members of his cabinet and many legislators have past stasi 
links 
the issue has overshadowed preparations for german unification 
on oct 3 when de maizieres government will turn over control of 
the economically troubled country to the west german government 
a fourth cabinet member environment minister karlhermann 
steinberg also has been named as a suspected former stasi agent 
meanwhile interior minister petermichael diestel came under 
more fire saturday when an official charged that diestel has been 
hindering and delaying the purge of stasi agents 
de maizieres spokeswoman angela merkel said friday that 
diestel had been stripped of the job of dismantling the stasi 
apparatus 
however de maiziere said saturday that diestel will remain the 
top official in charge of the operation although his deputy 
eberhard stief was given the job of directly supervising the 
process 
on thursday diestel survived a parliamentary motion for his 
ouster from office

washington saturday to meet with defense secretary dick cheney and 
israeli media said he would seek more military aid in light of the 
persian gulf crisis 
the daily newspaper al hamishmar said arens would ask for us 
funding of a naval submarine project and discuss the us 
contribution to the joint arrow missile project 
washington provided 80 percent of the 158 million in the first 
phase of the missile project and has agreed to continue funding 
but exact amounts have not yet been set 
israel radio said arens would also ask the bush administration

waive a 67 billion egyptian debt after egypt sent troops to the 
gulf as part of the multinational force facing iraq 
a report in the washington post saturday said arens would also 
ask cheney to consider providing israel with realtime links to 
us spy satellites such links would allow israel to target iraqi 
military sites and chemical weapon facilities on short notice 
dan naveh arens spokesman confirmed the israeli defense 
minister would meet cheney on monday but declined comment on both 
the washington post report and on the agenda 
there are many issues on the table but i do not want to go

f15 and f16 fighter planes as well as two patriot antiballistic 
missile systems 
in an interview on israel radio last week arens said the 
dangers faced by israel in view of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
warranted more american aid 
arens said he belived washington now had a more realistic view 
of the the dangers confronted by israel adding i hope that it 
will also express itself in additional aid 
the supply of us weapons to arab states hostile to israel is 
also causing concern president bush has asked congress to approve

after days of waiting in the hot sun of the 
jordanian desert nearly 2000 sri lnakans boarded a passenger ship 
saturday for a 10day trip home that started off with a meal of hot 
curry 
the voyage augmented a 10day airlift organized by the un 
international organization for migration for tens of thousands of 
penniless asians who fled kuwait after iraqs aug 2 invasion 
the group is hoping to charter more ships as a slightly less 
expensive way of moving the refugees the voyage of the sri lankans 
was costing about 780000 said yahya maroufi an agency official 
the 1767 sri lankans arrived in aqaba in a convoy of 41 buses 
that had picked them up in amman the pakistani ship safinaearab 
was starting its voyage saturday night 
women in colorful saris and men in loincloths balanced bundles 
and suitcases on their heads as they clambered up the gangway 
we left kuwait three weeks ago and have spent three terrible 
weeks in desert camps now at last we are on the way home said 
mohammed maizer a young man from colombo who was accompanied by 
his wife 
some were grieved by a traffic accident overnight on the

jordanian schoolchildren have written 
letters pleading with world leaders to find a peaceful solution to 
the persian gulf crisis 
please stop the war because i dont want to die me and my 
family and my dogs and cats read one letter to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar if there is a war i 
will be scared 
the letter from thirdgrader ammar qweider was one of dozens on 
display at a downtown hotel 
the letters were organized by a womens group called childrens 
letters for peace committee which asked children in amman and a 
major suburb to write them prior to perez de cuellars peace 
mission in amman earlier this month 
the letters were accompanied by collages and drawings depicting 
scenes such as bombings and in stark contrast fanciful pastoral 
settings many pictured children killed by war 
one drawing showed two globes one labeled war in red 
print had horns an angry snarl and a knife in its side with drops 
of blood coming from it the other labeled peace showed a 
smiling brighteyed world 
please world leaders i ask you to sort this out before 
someone makes a rash decision and pushes the little button that can 
ruin the world read another letter by dina tinam 
not surprisingly many of the letters struck a sympathetic chord 
with iraq and the arab world in general 
im sorry to inform you that the decision you took against 
iraq was a bit unfair said rami bisher there was no need for 
any military action the blockade itself was enough cause im 
sure there are some kids in iraq suffering from the shortage of 
milk and other goods 
angie hussanni wrote please tell mr george bush that the 
arabs are not that bad we are a civilized nation once upon a time 
we were the best and i can assure you we will be the best again 
sometime in the future 
please talk not fight wrote fourthgrader aboud nasser 
if there will be a war i will never get the chance to grow up and 
become an architect just give me and my friends a chance to make 
the world a better place 
the amman talks between perez de cuellar and iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz ended without progress as the diplomats were 
unable to agree on an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait which saddam 
husseins troops overran aug 2

twentyseven years ago four black girls 
attending church on a sunday morning died in a racist bombing that 
tore at the conscience of birmingham 
on saturday at an illkept hillside cemetery where three of the 
girls are buried several dozen people whites and blacks gathered 
in sweltering heat to remember them as martyrs for social change 
the group also dedicated a state historic marker in honor of the 
four and called for the restoration of the nearly abandoned 
greenwood cemetery in downtown birmingham 
the girls addie mae collins carol robertson and cynthia 
wesley all 14 and denise mcnair 11 died when a dynamite bomb 
exploded in a stairwell of the sixteenth street baptist church on 
sept 15 1963 
the church bombing stunned the civil rights movement and broke 
down resistance among many whites who were shocked by such violence 
against children in a house of worship 
they forever changed the face of this state and the history of 
this state said state sen roger bedford their deaths made 
all of us focus on the ugliness of those who would punish people 
because of the color of their skin 
they died so freedom could live said kenneth mullinax who 
spearheaded the drive for a state historic marker and for a grave 
marker for addie mae collins 
robert edward chambliss a white man linked to racist 
resistance was convicted of murder in the bombing and sentenced to 
life in prison he died in 1985 at age 81 
besides remembering the girls short lives participants 
saturday called for help restoring the cemetery where three of the 
girls are buried denise mcnair is buried in shadowlawn cemetery 
rev fred shuttlesworth a black leader in birmingham during the 
civil rights movement said the bombing shook birmingham it 
shook the world in fact 
among those affected was thengovernor george wallace said his 
son state treasurer george wallace jr 
until the bombing the governor was an outspoken segregationist 
but wallace jr said his father was shaken by the deaths and 
condemned those responsible he agonized over it 
the fourterm governor later voiced racially moderate views and 
won strng black support in his final victory in 1982 
mullinax who worked in the last wallace administration said he 
was angry about the condition of the cemetery 
the grave of addie mae collins had been marked only by a thin 
piece of wood with the writing on it worn off mullinax and other 
donors bought a marker for the childs grave two of collins 
sisters attended the ceremony but did not speak during it and 
declined to talk to reporters later 
wilheminia anchrum earlier organized a drive to clean up the 
cemetery which once was an elite black cemetery in segregated 
birmingham but fell into bankruptcy and neglect in recent years 
graves have been dug up and markers turned over 
anchrum and other volunteers cleaned up part of the cemetery for 
the memorial saturday and are raising money to establish a 
permanent maintenance program

a tribunal on saturday began 
reviewing corruption charges against ousted prime minister benazir 
bhutto in what her followers have characterized as a political 
witch hunt 
president ghulam ishaq khan a conservative dismissed ms 
bhutto and her government on aug 6 last week an armybacked 
caretaker government filed four corruption charges against the 
37yearold former prime minister 
several of ms bhuttos cabinet ministers face similar changes 
and hundreds of supporters of her pakistan peoples party have been 
arrested 
the special tribunal was set up to try corruption cases and 
determine whether ms bhutto and her allies will be able to run in 
a new election scheduled for oct 24 
if convicted ms bhutto would be disqualified from elections 
for up to seven years criminal charges could follow 
the special tribunals originally were created in 1977 to try ms 
bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto who was 
overthrown in a military coup and hanged two years later 
the caretaker government has promised that many of ms bhuttos 
political opponents also would be investigated for corruption but 
so far the only inquirites have been into ms bhuttos government 
elected in november 1988 
pakistani politicians speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the trials were bolstering ms bhuttos image as a martyr like her 
father they predicted the trials ultimately would fail unless they 
were broadened to include her opponents 
there is a feeling among many pakistanis that this has not 
been very fair so far said a member of the senate for the 
rightwing coalition known by its urdu initials iji which opposes 
mrs bhutto 
us ambassador robert oakley has said the tribunals should also 
look into corruption from 198588 when the iji parties and 
politicians ran the government for the military 
otherwise the proceedings will inevitably be seen as partisan 
and further divide the country oakley said in a speech to the 
asia society in washington last week 
the powerful army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg has 
reportedly urged ishaq khan to broaden the scope of the tribunals 
to lend credibility to the process

italy agreed to give the soviet union 272 
billion in credits saturday one day after soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev warned that his nation is in danger of bankruptcy 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis announced the loans 
at a news conference following his kremlin meetings with gorbachev 
and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
on friday gorbachev presented an economic plan to the national 
parliament that proposes marketoriented policies and other 
measures to halt the nations slide toward bankruptcy 
gorbachev described the countrys international economic 
position as catastrophic and warned of possible government 
insolvency on international markets 
for decades the soviet union was considered a good 
international credit risk because the government always promptly 
paid its import bills but because of a widening trade gap the 
soviets have fallen behind on their payments and are seeking trade 
credits from other nations 
west germany has already agreed to give more than 3 billion in 
credits to the soviet union that is on top of the 76 billion 
bonn has pledged to pay to cover the costs of withdrawing soviet 
troops from east germany in connection with german reunification 
other western european countries are also expected to grant 
loans to the soviets but the united states has so far rejected 
proposals for direct financial aid to moscow the bush 
administration has said the any massive infusion of funds might be 
wasted if the soviet economy does not first undergo a major 
overhaul 
washington instead has offered technical assistance including 
advice on improving the collapsing food distribution system or how 
to establish private banking 
 
de michelis also said he talked with soviet leaders about the 
creation of a stabilization and currency reform fund as well as a 
balanceofpayments support fund for the soviet union 
western countries provided a 1 billion backup fund for poland 
to support its currency the zloty when it became internally 
convertible on jan 1 as part of its crash transition to a market 
economy the fund has not been touched and is viewed as a 
successful confidencebuilder for the zloty 
but a similar project for the soviet union would be far more 
expensive given the size of the soviet economy 
de michelis said the aid proposals were related to the soviet 
economic reform plan which envisions a crash program of 
budgetcutting and selling off government property to the public to 
stabilize the nearly worthless ruble 
after the money supply is balanced and store shelves refilled 
gorbachev proposes completing the switch to a market economy by 
gradually freeing prices 
de michelis said the two sides also discussed deals involving 
fuel electric power and telecommunications the soviet union 
reportedly is trying to gain western help to develop its oil 
reserves 
he said 1 billion of 272 billion in italian credits would not 
be tied to particular trade deals 
he said the two countries also agreed to write a new treaty on 
friendship and cooperation to be signed when gorbachev visits rome 
before the end of the year 
on the gulf crisis de michelis said one topic of discussion was 
an italian proposal to extend sanctions to countries that violate 
the un trade embargo against iraq he said they also discussed 
extending the sea blockade to air shipments 
we agreed we should put maximum political and economic 
pressure on iraq to ensure its political isolation de michelis 
said 
de michelis also reported that gorbachev is ready to restore 
diplomatic relations with israel after a 23year gap if israel 
agrees to participate in an international middle east peace 
conference

chancellor helmut kohl on 
saturday extended nearly 2 billion in economic and military aid to 
the drive led by the united states against iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
the action announced outside his country home in the rhineland 
after a 90minute meeting with secretary of state james a baker 
iii overrode the hesitation west germany had shown to more than 
nominal participation in the usled persian gulf campaign 
we are aware of our responsibility kohl said we are 
ready and willing to do our share 
apart from the 187 billion kohl pledged to the united states 
and to poor nations west germany is contributing 271 million as 
part of an aid package approved by the 12nation european 
community 
there was no indication that west germany would contribute to 
the military force assembled in the gulf to guard oil fields in 
saudi arabia against an iraqi takeover and to police the economic 
embargo of iraq authorized aug 6 by the united nations security 
council 
still the german contribution marked a turnabout and reflected 
the growing confidence of a nation already the richest in europe 
that will grow more powerful after unification 
about half the german aid will go this year to the united states 
to help defray the staggering cost of stationing troops in saudi 
arabia and deploying a naval armada in the persian gulf 
the other half kohl said will go to poor nations battered by 
the crisis kohl singled out jordan egypt and turkey 
the chancellor said the west german constitution which he hopes 
parliament will change after unification with east germany 
prohibits sending troops and warships to the gulf 
but he said the forces there are also defending our 
interests 
asked whether iraq could be compelled to relinquish its control 
of kuwait short of war the german leader said i hope so i am 
no prophet 
he said iraq which invaded the smaller oilrich gulf country 
aug 2 has to acknowledge the largest share of the world 
community is against it 
with tears in his eyes kohl thanked the united states for 
helping to fulfill the german dream of unification which will 
occur oct 3 
baker said as germany becomes larger and greater its 
responsibilities grow 
no one could draw any conclusion but that germany is doing 
more he said they go far beyond what we had discussed through 
private channels and substantially 
in all baker raised nearly 14 billion during his 11day trip 
which ended with his flight back to washington from west germany 
three oilrich arab countries saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and the kuwaiti monarchy overthrown by iraq volunteered 
12 billion after talking to baker last week 
about half will offset us expenses which will total about 9 
billion by the end of the year and the other half will go to poor 
countries 
i think that the trip has been very successful in terms of 
pointing up the isolation of iraq baker said 
later at a news conference at cologne airport before flying 
home baker said to say we are pleased would be an 
understatement 
asked whether iraq could be stopped short of war baker said 
its our strong preference that it be solved without war 
but he said the united states would not water down its demand 
for iraqs withdrawal from kuwait and was keeping all options 
option to attain that end 
he characterized saddam hussein as mercurial and said i dont 
think anyone can predict what action he will take 
on a related subject baker who telephoned president bush 
before boarding his plane for the flight home said he had asked 
the soviets during his stop in moscow to help transport the 
additional troops syria was sending to saudi arabia and that the 
request would be considered 
an estimated 15000 syrian troops are to be added to the 3000 
already in saudi arabia 
the west german assistance includes 636 million in radio 
equipment cranes generators and equipment to protect us 
soldiers against chemical weapons about 60 armored vehicles worth 
127 million are designed to detect chemical weapons about 254 
million will go toward transportation costs 
egypt will receive about 650 million in aid about 135 million 
will go to jordan which is saddled with caring for thousands of 
refugees from iraq and kuwait and about 75 million is for turkey 
a nato member which has lost the revenues of an iraqi pipeline that 
ran through the country and was closed at the start of the crisis 
kohl said the turks also will receive from germany some 
defense materiel for which he did not offer a pricetag 
i was very pleased by the numbers that were presented to us 
baker said after west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher outlined the assistance earlier over lunch at petersberg 
a new government guest house in the hills outside bonn 
baker called the sums very significant and very substantial 
he later confirmed the offer with kohl at his country home near 
heidelberg 
until bakers visit west germany had offered 65 million in 
technical aid to the us forces in saudi arabia but the high cost 
of unification with east germany 77 billion to the soviet union 
alone to compensate for the withdrawal of 370000 soviet troops 
stood in the way of a larger contribution 
west germany imports negligible amounts of oil from the gulf 
getting most of its supplies from norway and britain 
still considering its wealth and world power status the 
germans distance from the usled campaign against hussein raised 
eyebrows in congress 
italy volunteered 145 million and a squadron of tornadoes 
during bakers visit to rome while egypt and syria said they would 
send more troops to saudi arabia 
two countries baker did not visit britain and france said 
they would send more troops and canada joined the international 
force with a squadron of 12 cf18 jets to fly cover for three 
canadian warships en route 
france is sending 4000 soldiers including an 1100man 
helicopter regiment 48 tanks and a squadron of 30 warplanes and 48 
helicopters 
britain is contributing an additional 6000 combat troops and 
120 tanks

jimmy carters former pilot who left iran last 
week after being imprisoned there for nine years said saturday he 
may return to that country 
e david rabhan said saturday he had been told by iranian court 
officials he could resume his work there if he chose 
theyve given me a letter saying i could come back to iran 
travel in iran just be free in iran he said in a telephone 
interview from the home of his mother frances rabhan in savannah 
if i choose to go back i feel that i can 
rabhan 64 who had worked as a businessman in iran flew to 
savannah late friday following a private reunion with former 
president carter at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
rabhans relationship with carter dates back to at least 1970 
when he volunteered his services as a pilot during carters second 
campaign for governor of georgia 
he credited carters efforts to get him released 
they are dear friends said rabhans sister joan jacobson 
who also met him at the atlanta airport 
he said he was unprepared for the reporters who met his flight 
from zurich switzerland and peppered him with questions 
really i didnt expect to have anybody be concerned about 
it rabhan said adding that he objected only to what he called 
the stupid questions like how does it feel to be free what do 
they expect me to say 
rabhan went to iran in 1976 to begin a business using a fish 
protein concentrate to make breads and snack foods he was arrested 
in september 1981 according to his attorney phillips d hamilton 
of statesboro ga 
his arrest came almost two years after the attack on the us 
embassy in tehran which started the 444day hostage crisis that 
contributed to carters 1980 reelection defeat 
initially rabhan was charged with violating irans financial 
laws he told carter by telephone later that he had been charged 
with spying 
after leaving the presidency carter described rabhan as a 
hostage but neither the reagan nor bush administrations 
considered him a hostage and his plight went largely unreported 
according to letters he managed to get out of iran rabhan said 
he was physically abused and his weight once fell by 44 pounds he 
spent part of his imprisonment in solitary confinement in a 
windowless cell his letters said 
he said his treatment had improved during the last two years 
i think one reason was because of the concern that president 
carter had for me he said i also think the attitude of the 
iranian government started to change their attitude toward 
humanitarianism 
the iranians reassessed david rabhans case and determined 
that he had never been guilty of any crime and so they apologized 
and let him go carter said friday after meeting rabhans flight 
he was never a spy he never had any kind of connection with 
the cia or any sort of espionage or spying carter earlier told 
the atlanta journal 
rabhan said saturday he wanted to spend his time in savannah 
visiting with relatives and planned no special activities ive 
been without things so long that anything i do seems to be special 
to me he said

longestrunning daily newspaper dodged a bullet with help from its 
unions 
post owner peter kalikow said the 505000circulation paper 
known for its racy headlines would have to close saturday without 
union concessions because it has been losing 27 million a year 
ten of the new york posts 11 unions agreed late friday to a 19 
million concession package that would eliminate jobs and shorten 
work weeks

negotiating committee voted 73 to reject the concession deal 
they were saying shut it down said thomas pennacchio 
secretarytreasurer of guild local 3 
kalikow said the paper would publish until the guilds members 
voted on the concessions a vote on whether to accept elimination 
of 43 jobs and four work days a week was scheduled for monday 
i feel optimistic that when the members see it they will 
approve it said post owner peter kalikow if they turn it 
down the paper will stop publishing immediately 
the post said in saturdays editions the concessions from its 
960 employees include 100 fewer truck driver jobs down from 263 
its 70 printers cutting to a fourday work week and five fewer

during the first hectic weeks of 
operation desert shield the pentagon said it moved enough troops 
weaponry and supplies to fill a midsize town 
but this forts acres of tanks and the 15000 troops going 
with them are only just beginning to leave for saudi arabia and 
they arent scheduled to get there until well into october 
the row upon row of m1 tanks m109 howitzers armored 
personnel carriers and assorted warmaking machinery has become the 
stuff of dreams 
well all sleep better when it gets there growled one 
colonel accompanying a group of visitors on a tour of the 
217000acre base 
fort hoods 1st cavalry and 2nd armored divisions represent the 
heavy forces that the top us military commander in saudi arabia 
gen h norman schwarzkopf says hell need to have on the ground 
before he can defend saudi arabia against any kind of iraqi attack 
but moving such massive amounts of material isnt an easy job 
so the armys chief of staff gen carl vuono came to this post 
on the rolling texas savanna to check whether his commanders had 
prepared their men women and machinery for the trip 
its show time vuono called out to a room of generals 
colonels and toplevel sergeants gathered to give him the update 
are you ready 
lt gen richard graves the threestar commander of fort hood 
and the armys iii corps briefed vuono on the multiplicity of 
headaches brought on by moving nearly onethird of his personnel 
and hundreds of 60ton vehicles some 9000 miles to saudi arabia 
its been nothing but frenzied activity here since people 
learned theyd deploy on aug 10 
first they had to get several hundred tanks troop carriers and 
howitzers ready for transport by rail to the port at beaumont 
texas from there the tons of war machinery was to be transferred 
to huge container ships for the lengthy trip to saudi arabia 
weve got lift constraints graves reminded vuono during 
their talk 
in the intervening weeks it had become clear the system for 
sealifting equipment needed improvement 
the rapid deployment forces from the 24th infantry division 
mechanized from fort stewart ga the first group to deploy to 
saudi arabia with the heavy m1 tanks showed up at portside with 
bridging equipment instead of the seven ships thought necessary 
10 were needed 
so at least 13 ships instead of the original eight have been 
scheduled to move the texas units a spokeswoman for the navys 
sealift command said 
and after the heaviest weapons are sent on their way the troops 
must be checked to ensure theyve got the latest training and most 
uptodate supplies 
every soldier going is carrying a weapon that hes fired and 
carrying a gas mask that hes trained with graves said weve 
got 12 days of personal training scheduled 
before departure hundreds of rounds of ammunition for each tank 
and artillery piece must be prepared for shipment graves said 
gun barrels were replaced on the many of the units more than 
230 m1 tanks metal treads on all armored vehicles were being 
checked to see whether theyd sustained a minimum of 300 miles of 
wear 
on the individual level commanders had to ensure that each 
service member had the correct vaccinations nextofkin records 
filled out and even hiv testing done 
families had to be informed and informational telephone support 
line set up about 1200 family members showed up for the first 
briefing graves said 
training reviews on everything from chemical weapons protection 
to personal hygiene in the desert must be attended to 
what about the mess cooks you talking to the mess cooks we 
dont want the whole company down with dysentery vuono demanded 
flipping a series of viewgraphs on the wall graves showed 
vuono that his personnel count was good more than 90 percent of 
his troops were deployable 
in the count of all the men and women 11 percent of the troops 
were pregnant a figure that translated into 84 percent of the 
female troops being pregnant and therefore ineligible for 
deployment 
others unable to deploy were the 3 percent in transit because of 
changes in orders about 18 percent with medical problems and 15 
percent with some sort of legal entanglement 
down the road at a motor pool a cloud of pink dust hovered over 
a group of junglegreen trucks and tankers that were being painted 
a rosy desert beige 
the general paused to speak to the officers and sergeants in 
charge of an artillery unit telling them in no uncertain terms 
that they were entrusted with the most precious commodity that 
this nation has its sons and daughters 
so when youre humping ammunition when youre going into 
position and the temperature is 118 degrees in the shade and you 
are as bonetired as you will be as a leader you have a 
responsibility to push that aside and look out for those precious 
soldiers vuono said because they ask for so little and they 
deserve so much from us

three towns of about 5000 people 
were threatened saturday by a fire in the stanislaus national 
forest in the sierra nevada that had charred more than 2200 acres 
although the fire was considered 50 percent contained its 
eastern edge was still burning freely a us park service 
spokeswoman said 
that edge was less than two miles from the small resort towns of 
miwuk sugar pine and sierra village and about 5000 people were 
warned to be ready for possible evacuation she said 
a shift to damp weather friday night caused unexpected problems 
for firefighters they had planned to set a backfire to control 
that edge of the fire but it was too damp and as a result the fire 
threatened saturday to go into the tuolumne river canyon 
we are concentrating all our efforts on the eastern side 
because if it goes into the canyon then miwuk sugar pine and 
sierra village are in some real trouble said park service 
spokeswoman mary hale 
its in a real bad area hale said if it gets in the 
canyon those firefighters out there are looking at a long haul 
on the other hand fire officials said they expected containment 
by sunday morning 
its like a seesaw today it could go either way she said 
as of saturday afternoon no structures had been destroyed and 
fire officials reported only three minor injuries 
fire officials allowed about 400 people who had evacuated 
earlier from a subdivision southeast of twain harte in the sierra 
nevada 150 miles east across the state from san francisco to 
return to their homes saturday 
at one point before dawn friday flames crept within 100 yards 
of the houses there hale said 
the blaze called the cotton fire began thursday in the 
riverside campground on the north fork of the tuolumne river 
we know this is humancaused said fire spokesman jeff 
fontana we havent had lightning around here he could provide 
no details about how the fire got started 
a 147000acre burn tore through the stanislaus forest around

talks aimed at settling the dispute over pay benefits and job 
security 
parallel talks continued saturday in the united states between 
the united auto workers and general motors corp after negotiators 
in detroit agreed to extend a midnight strike deadline 
the uaw told its members not to strike while negotiators worked 
to reach a new threeyear agreement covering 300000 gm workers 
nationwide 
the strike in canada wont affect production until monday 
because ford of canada plants do not operate weekends 
up to 12800 workers were expected to walk off the job at nine 
plants and two offices in ontario the company has two plants in 
oakville five in windsor one in st thomas and one in niagara 
falls 
the canadian auto workers union called the strike the first 
against ford since 1976 after negotiators failed to meet a friday 
midnight deadline for reaching agreement on a new contract 
negotiators for both sides met formally and informally saturday 
at a toronto hotel they were to hold a formal negotiating session 
on sunday morning 
the process is continuing on both sides ford spokesman jim 
hartford said we are experiencing a strike were doing our best 
to ensure its a short one 
union spokeswoman peggy nash said there were still many 
unresolved issues separating both sides 
it sounds like the two sides are still very far apart ford 
negotiator don mckenzie said he was still optimistic this could be 
sorted out quickly she said union president bob white 
didnt seem so optimistic 
the unions contract with ford expired on friday 
everybody is pretty much ready for this windsor autoworker 
tom bellmore said after saturdays strike announcement everybody 
is resigned that this is the way its got to be 
like many of his fellow workers bellmore said he had stocked up 
on groceries and other supplies in preparation for the shutdown 
both sides have refused to disclose details of their proposals 
and demands the union is seeking higher wages including money to 
help offset a proposed federal goods and services tax better 
benefits and more time off white said the average hourly base pay 
now is about 15 
white said progress has been made on job security and mckenzie 
conceded that money is the main problem 
the union rejected the companys initial offer on wednesday the 
union made its proposal on friday but the company has yet to 
respond white said 
in detroit the uaw and general motors agreed to extend their 
national labor contract past its friday expiration date and talks 
continued saturday 
both sides have refused to disclose the progress of the 
negotiations but aspects of job security and benefits for gm 
workers remain unresolved 
in both countries the auto workers unions target one company in 
their talks in hopes of fashioning a pattern contract for workers 
at other automakers

the iraqi architect of a libyan chemical weapons 
complex invested 5 million in a florida cherry flavoring plant in 
an apparent bid to export cyanide to the middle east a newspaper 
reported in sundays editions 
two former associates said deceased financier dr ihsan barbouti 
used the boca raton plant to establish a front through which he 
could export deadly hydrogen cyanide and the technology to produce 
it in quantity the dallas morning news reported 
the former associates said barbouti sought to export the poison 
to middle east countries identified by the us government as 
supporters of terrorism barbouti acknowledged contracts with iraq 
and iran they said 
barbouti has been identified in western news reports as the 
architect of libyan col moammar gadhafis chemical weapons plant 
in rabta he died july 1 in london on lung and heart complications 
according to his death certificate he was 63 
the president of the florida flavoring plant said he had no role 
in the diversion of any toxic material but acknowledged that at 
least 150 gallons of a cyanide compound were unaccounted for the 
cyanide was a byproduct of a process used to extract bitter almond 
oil a concentrate for cherry flavoring from apricot pits 
the cyanide could have been taken from product ingredient 
technology inc without his knowledge louis s champon said 
my feeling is that it was his intention to ship out cyanide 
to overseas champon said 
peter kawaja whose company installed a 1 million security 
system at the plant said the cyanide was removed during night 
trips to another site in florida he declined to identify 
shipments have left the us and technology has left the 
us said kawaja were talking about the research and 
development of chemical weapons in the united states 
kawaja declined to identify the final destination of the 
potentially lethal chemical 
the newspaper said us customs and the fbi have accelerated 
their investigation of barboutis role in the flavoring plant since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait last month they are examining his vast 
holdings in dallas houston oklahoma city new orleans tennessee 
new jersey and new york 
the federal agencies declined comment 
if theres an ongoing investigation were not going to 
comment on it those are attorney generals guidelines im not 
confirming that there is an investigation i dont know if there is 
or there isnt fbi spokesman jeffrey w maynard told the 
associated press on saturday 
the central intelligence agency also refused to discuss the 
investigation 
we decline to comment at this time i would say though that 
if there is any indication or intelligence of hostile activities we 
would bring that to the attention of the appropriate law 
enforcement authorities cia spokesman peter earnest told the ap 
customs service spokesman cliff stallings in miami said saturday 
that he had been in washington last week and was unaware of the 
case 
you can quote me saying if its under investigation then we 
wont talk about it he said 
barboutis holdings are controlled by his son haidar barbouti 
who lives in new york city the younger barbouti has been president 
and director of 20 to 30 of his fathers companies 
there was no answer at barboutis manhattan residence or at the 
barbouti holding company ibi industries inc saturday 
champon said he has filed a lawsuit to sever his business ties 
with the barbouti family champon said he and barbouti often 
quarreled about disposal of the waste cyanide and that barboutis 
funding stopped when we flatly refused to send out any cyanide 
complex 
dr barbouti many many times mentioned that he wanted this 
cyanide shipped to germany champon said of the cyanide 
waste from the plant 
and according to kawaja and champon the barboutis asked the 
plants architect to computerize the blueprints of the operation 
without champons knowledge 
they were trying to steal the plans champon said

a jury has awarded 136 million to auto racing 
promoters who sued a newspaper for libel over articles about the 
cleveland grand prix 
the case stemmed from articles written by reporter gary webb for 
the cleveland plain dealer primarily in 1984 and also in 1985 and 
1986 
the eightmember jury returned the finding friday on the second 
day of deliberations 
alex machaskee publisher of the plain dealer said the 
newspaper intends to appeal 
the plaintiffs were charles k newcomb and james h foster 
along with the company ck newcomb and associates they promoted 
the indystyle car race at burke lakefront airport starting in 
1982 when the event was called the budweiser cleveland 500 
the company newcomb and foster sought 6 million in 
compensatory damages and 10 million in punitive damages in the 
suit filed in 1985 
the plaintiffs lawyer jerome s kalur could not be reached 
for comment he was not at his office and has no residential phone 
listing newcomb also has no listing foster was not at his 
residence according to a recorded message 
in 1984 a week before the 1984 budweiser cleveland grand prix 
the plain dealer reported that newcomb and foster paid themselves 
nearly 1 million from race proceeds in violation of a lease with 
the city newcomb and foster declined to be interviewed for that 
story 
the newspaper also said the race did not satisfy rent payments 
to the city because newcomb and foster told the city the race was 
deeply in debt 
lawyers for the plain dealer argued during the eightweek trial 
before cuyahoga county common pleas judge joseph f mcmanamon that 
the primary points of the articles were indisputably true 
but lawyers for the plaintiffs argued the race in fact lost 
money its first two years and that the articles were false 
newcomb and foster sold the rights to the race in march 1985 to 
businessman and former race car driver roger penske and the plain 
dealer later became cosponsor of the event 
mcmanamon said the jury awarded ck newcomb and associates 22 
million in compensatory damages and 2 million in punitive damages 
newcomb 2 million compensatory and 35 million punitive and 
foster 400000 compensatory and 35 million punitive

californias fourth year of unyielding 
drought is stirring fears that a continuing shortage could pit 
thirsty city dwellers against agriculture the states no 1 
industry and biggest water user 
the drought with its images of parched lawns dying trees and 
depleted reservoirs is an indication of things to come said neil 
berlant managing partner of water research associates a 
specialized investment and consulting company in los angeles 
whats emerging out of this is one of the most politically 
charged issues of our time berlant said he sees a future in 
which drinkable water is an increasingly precious commodity like 
crude oil 
i think there is a great probability of prices exploding more 
than anybody realizes he said 
the drought already has revealed residents willingness to pay 
exorbitant prices for water in santa barbara where shortages this 
summer prompted officials to consider building a costly seawater 
desalting plant 
what berlant and others foresee is a collision between the 
irresistible force of californias booming population and the 
immovable object of available water supplies 
they believe political pressures will bear more and more on 
agriculture to reallocate water to urban users 
the issue that comes to my mind is not whether youre going to 
use farm water but how are you going to do it in a way thats fair 
and reasonable said carl boronkay hes general manager of the 
metropolitan water district of southern california which supplies 
water to five counties in southern california including los 
angeles 
rural water agency officials on the other hand predict that 
political pressures will coalesce to support construction of new 
dams and aqueducts 
theres plenty of room to improve our water development in 
this state said stephen hall executive director of the 
california farm water coalition 
agriculture accounts for more than 16 billion of the states 
300billionplus annual economy 
the drought however has exposed factors underlying the debate 
that tend to run against agricultural interests berlant said 
imposing rationing on city residents albeit wellintentioned 
focuses on the smallest sector of water users he said 
most of californias available water 82 percent according to 
the us geological survey is used for irrigating crops 
california leads the nation in water use at 303 billion gallons a 
day 
an acrosstheboard cut in urban water use of 25 percent by 
everybody homeowners commercial industrial would be the rough 
equivalent of agriculture cutting its use by 3 percent says 
state assemblyman phillip isenberg 
it does tend to suggest that agriculture ought to be doing 
something in terms of conservation said isenberg he also has 
called attention to the types of waterintensive crops california 
farmers grow including federally subsidized crops like cotton 
pastures grown for livestock use at least 42 million acrefeet 
of water a year enough for 42 million city residents according 
to marc reisner author of the 1986 book cadillac desert 
in the book he argues the huge effort needed to turn deserts 
into farmland is a waste of both money and water alfalfa uses 
almost as much 41 million acrefeet a year followed by cotton 
and rice one acrefoot is the amount of water needed to flood an 
acre 1 foot deep 
agriculture officials counter that because farms use so much 
water they probably have the highest incentive to conserve 
during the drought state and federal water allotments to 
agriculture have been reduced as much as 50 percent although many 
farms made up the difference by pumping groundwater at higher cost 
some farms have implemented drip irrigation and other lowflow 
methods but farmers tend to argue that their crops water 
requirements are fixed and cant be changed 
i think the bottom line for me on conservation is that it 
should be part of everything we do but if its all we do were 
destined to have chronic water shortages hall said 
berlant argues there is little real incentive for farmers to 
conserve because the water they get is so cheap 
many farms benefit from huge federal or state subsidies for 
government water paying less than 50 per acrefoot in contrast 
berlant estimates that residential water customers in southern 
california pay as much as 400 per acrefoot 
in the future widening price disparity could make farmland look 
cheap to watershort cities and some fear cities might move to buy 
farmland solely to acquire the water allotments that go with that 
land 
hall argues that trying to wring more water out of agricultural 
conservation and water transfers is like a company on the verge 
of bankruptcy cracking down on how many paper clips theyre 
using 
while the potential for antagonism is real boronkay sees the 
differences between urban and farm interests as a chance to 
negotiate rather than an opportunity to incite demagoguery 
some farm water represents part of the urban supply of the 
future said boronkay who added god thats fighting words to 
some people and im not just going to willynilly go around saying 
it

apologized for referring to hispanics as wetbacks during a 
campaign stop for a republican congressional candidate 
the derogatory expression derived from the crossing of the rio 
grande by illegal aliens came up during a discussion on drug 
trafficking derwinski told television station kmtv in omaha

that term slipped and i shouldnt have used it obviously again 
i will apologize if i must and i should derwinski told the 
station friday 
derwinski was campaigning for house candidate ally milder on 
friday were all sorry it happened ms milder said it 
should never have been said

descriptive he said

abortion rights protesters destroyed 
symbolic credit cards of a department store chain and threatened a 
christmas season boycott unless the store abandons plans to cut 
donations to planned parenthood 
the demonstration outside daytons department store was attended 
by about 500 protesters toting signs bearing slogans such as im 
prochoice and i shop 
another sign showed a daytons credit card cut in half with the 
caption you leave us no choice the chanting crowd gathered 
near doors of the store in the southdale shopping center but did 
not enter 
we feel betrayed and sold out by a friend clare gravon 
chairwoman of the minnesota alliance for choice told the mostly 
female crowd 
organizers collected contributions to fund an advertising 
campaign for the threatened boycott gravon said would start the day 
after thanksgiving 
there will be no boycott if the dayton hudson foundation 
restores funding to planned parenthood of minnesota she said the 
foundation is the charitable arm of the minneapolisbased dayton 
hudson corp 
providing family planning and health care to lowincome women 
is the right thing to do gravon told the crowd caving in to 
religious pressure groups is not 
daytons announced in august plans to halt a 20000 educational 
grant to planned parenthood ending a 22year relationship the 
decision came about the time the christian action council said it 
would boycott daytons and other corporations for supporting 
planned parenthood 
dayton hudson spokeswoman ann barkelew said the decision had 
nothing to do with pressure from special interest groups but arose 
from confusion about the donations which some misconstrued as 
support for abortion 
barkelew said foundation trustees are reconsidering the decision 
not to fund planned parenthood she said talks with the agency were 
held last week and will continue 
were confident we will reach a solution she said 
the company had annual sales of 139 million last year about 
half of its sales come during the holiday shopping season barkelew 
said

for a while saturday those gathered in a 
taverns parking lot appeared to falling all over themselves but 
what they were really trying to do was put a right foot on blue and 
a left foot on red 
they were playing twister a 1960s game that attracted droves of 
amateur contortionists who relished a chance to become chicagos 
most twisted twister 
we look at this tournament as wholesome entertainment for the 
truly twisted said sandy rose the owner of the blue frog bar amp 
grill who donated a block of parking space for a twister 
tournament 
the tournaments checkerboards were 25 multicolored 
polkadotted mats the size of tablecloths tacked into the asphalt 
the contestants were tall and petite masculine and feminine and 
generally jovial 
i think you have to be a crazy person a funny person to 
play said brian ohara 34 who last played the game in 1975 
i love it ohare proclaimed minutes before landing on his 
backside when he tried to place his left foot on a yellow circle 
during a warmup match 
players had to shed their shoes pick a partner and outmaneuver 
another team by placing their hands and feet on the colored circles 
haphazardly chosen by the spin of a wheel 
the game ends when both players on a team lose their balance and 
touch the mat with a part of their body other than a hand or foot 
the best at putting their hands and feet on the circles saturday 
were keith and clare bodner of kansas city mo winners of the 
coveted most twisted twister 
its a little like very low impact aerobics with more body 
contact rose said of the game 
many players ended redfaced and weak in the knees after 
tangling their bodies into unnatural positions 
point your toes oh that hurts doesnt it judge and 
organizer scott phillips joked between commands when moans and 
squeals emerged from the human knots on the plastic mats teams 
played simultaneously as an announcer gave the commands until the 
field was narrowed to two teams 
i myself forgot how fun it could be from when i was a kid 
said janis francis 32 you can enjoy it at all ages 
oharas team strategy was to outwit his opponent while francis 
took a different approach 
knock em down bowl em over and entice em she said 
the event drew about 100 people to raise money for chicago 
easter seals organizers said

plumbers trying to unclog a sewer line 
found about 1 million in counterfeit 100 bills beneath a 
university campus 
secret service agents investigating fridays discovery under 
california state university long beach said the wad of fake money 
appeared to come from the same lot as 10 phony bills passed in the 
area over the past 10 days 
investigators said the counterfeiter probably decided to dump 
the bills after people recognized them as fakes 
my guess is that they decided it was unacceptable quality 
and tried to destroy it said george franklin an agent in the 
secret services los angeles office 
authorities said the money could have been flushed down a toilet 
or dropped into the universitys sewage system through a manhole 
authorities said they had no suspects 
im kind of dumbfounded said university president curtis l 
mccray i suppose it could have been someone here but i find 
that hard to believe

that was dark gray with red and white stripes matching air malta 
colors brown said

southeast of cape race newfoundland rescue officials said

had anything else been recovered that was known to have come from 
the jet 
rescue officials didnt receive news of the sighting until 
saturday when a ham radio operator overheard conversations between 
several ships at sea 
search officials said at first they doubted the reports but 
after discussions with the captain were convinced he had probably 
seen a piece of the fuselage 
weather conditions were deteriorating saturday evening as 
hurricane isidore moved northward in the atlantic hindering an 
international group of planes and ships searching a 
60000squaremile area he said

washington ap democrats are avoiding criticism of president 
bushs persian gulf policy while openly condemning his domestic 
stands and his partys greed and debt 
democratic party leaders meeting today uptown from the white 
house are formally endorsing bushs decision to send troops to 
block iraqs aggression in the middle east 
but that backing for the republican president doesnt extend to 
his domestic policy which the democrats say characterize a 
decade of republican greed and debt 
on the agenda for the meeting of the democratic national 
committee were resolutions denouncing the failure of three 
successive republican administrations to develop a national energy 
policy and blaming the gop for the savings and loan crisis 
equals 
washington ap more than tax increases and spending cuts are 
at stake in the nearly roundtheclock deficitreduction 
negotiations between congressional and bush administration 
officials 
as they struggle to avert wholesale cuts in federal programs 
next month the presidents aides and top members of congress also 
must decide how to divide targeted tax cuts that would cost more 
than 20 billion over the next five years the intended 
beneficiaries include rich investors giant corporations 
firsttime homebuyers and workers pursuing employerfinanced 
educations 
most of a dozen tax benefits that expire this year enjoy wide 
support in congress and are backed by the administration thus 
their renewal is likely to be attached to any deficit package 
approved by the negotiators that package likely will be the only 
tax bill passed this year 
the fate of another big proposed tax cut one that has been the 
subject of a running battle between congress and president bush 
since he took office is far less certain the administration 
insists on including in the package a cut in the tax on capital 
gains but democratic leaders are saying that cant be done unless 
overall income tax rates on upperincome americans are raised to

the united auto workers union and general motors 
corp recessed talks early saturday on a national labor contract 
and the union told its members not to strike 
negotiators had faced a midnight strike deadline talks were to 
resume saturday morning on a threeyear contract for about 300000 
active gm workers in 29 states the contract would serve as a model 
for talks with other major automakers 
gm thinks that meaningful progress has been made in the 
current contract negotiations and that an agreement will be 
reached said a statement issued by gm vice president alfred s 
warren jr negotiators will continue efforts to achieve this 
goal 
the latest bargaining session ended about 1220 am 
we are continuing our efforts to reach a settlement uaw 
vice president stephen yokich said in a statement released about 
1045 pm uawrepresented workers have been advised to stay on 
the job and report for work on their regular shift until further 
notice 
only gms bowling green ky assembly plant which makes 
corvettes was scheduled for production during the weekend the 
companys other 30 car and truck assembly plants are idle on 
weekends 
the uaws contracts with gm ford and chrysler corp expired at 
midnight they cover more than 450000 active auto workers in the 
united states and wallaceburg ontario 
in toronto the canadian auto workers called a strike friday 
against ford motor cos canadian subsidiary after negotiators did 
not meet a midnight deadline negotiators had reported talks were 
progressing and bargaining was to resume saturday ford plants in 
canada are closed weekends 
it was the first ford canada strike since 1976 the caw 
represents about 12800 ford workers 
the canadian workers make a variety of components for fords 
us assembly plants a strike in canada would likely affect the 
companys us operations within a week 
in the united states the uaw chose on aug 28 to focus its 
bargaining on gm talks with ford and chrysler have been put on 
hold since uaw leaders have said they plan to use a contract 
ratified by gm workers as a pattern for agreements at ford and 
chrysler 
as the talks entered their final hours unresolved issues 
included job security wages and pensions union leaders contacted 
friday said they were not told details about the unresolved issues 
tentative agreements had been reached on a variety of mostly 
noneconomic issues including health safety and attendance policy 
dramatic changes in the auto industry during the 1980s 
especially the growth of japanese automakers shares of the us 
car and truck market have affected labor relations between the uaw 
and the big three in general and gm specifically 
the big threes collective market share dropped about 6 
percentage points during the decade to about 68 percent last year 
during the same time the japanese companies share rose by about 
the same amount to over 25 percent 
that has forced gm ford and chrysler to shrink their operations 
and their work forces in response the uaws primary emphasis has 
shifted to job security from wage increases 
as the companies worked to cut costs they adopted a parts 
delivery system called justintime under such a scheme 
automakers ship parts and component systems to assembly plants just 
before they are needed sometimes within hours of installation 
at the same time automakers consolidated manufacturing to 
reduce redundancies and expenses 
that opened a new strategy for the uaw one whose effects were 
shown last month 
because of justintime delivery the uaw can shut down assembly 
plants some of which have more than 5000 workers by striking a 
critical parts plant that employs far fewer people 
last month the uaw struck gms ac rochester west parts plant in 
flint for six days over local issues including an employment level 
guarantee before the walkout ended gm was forced to close seven 
assembly plants because of parts shortages those shutdowns in 
turn resulted in layoffs at other component plants

the new york post got a temporary reprieve 
friday night when all but one of its unions agreed to concessions 
designed to save the feisty but unprofitable tabloid 
aint over yet declared saturdays front page headline when 
it rolled off the presses early saturday hours behind schedule 
post owner peter kalikow had threatened to close the paper after 
saturdays editions without the cuts 
ten unions at the paper agreed to concessions during marathon 
negotiating sessions kalikow said he needed 19 million in 
concessions to keep publishing the newspaper the nations oldest 
continuously published daily the paper is losing about 27 million 
a year 
the last union the newspaper guild will vote on his offer 
monday night kalikow said the guild represents 350 editorial and 
advertising employees the unions negotiating team voted 73 
against the offer 
i feel optimistic that when the members see it they will 
approve it kalikow said of his offer 
if the guild members reject the offer the post will cease 
publishing immediately he said the newspaper has a circulation of 
505000 
it was the best offer we could make under the circumstances 
he said 
barry lipton president of local 3 of the newspaper guild said 
he recommended his members accept the package details were not 
disclosed 
its up to the members its the very best we could do i 
hope that the sense of the membership is to swallow what may be a 
bitter pill he said 
members of each union must ratify the agreements but it 
appeared the guild vote was the key because its negotiators didnt 
support the pact 
the reprieve was announced after talks stretched for more than 
12 hours and passed two deadlines the paper had planned to print 
its history including reminiscences of former employees if 
saturdays edition was its last 
its a terrific farewell edition we prepared but hopefully 
itll never be read by the public metropolitan editor john 
cotter said 
talks had resumed friday morning between the paper and the guild 
and other unions representing more than 850 of the posts 960 
employees the newspapers contracts with the unions expire in 
march 1991 
kalikow said the concessions included pay cuts and layoffs he 
said workers would be given stock in the newspaper under the 
agreements 
it was a bitter pill for these people to swallow but they 
realized it was important to save the post he said 
a source involved in the guild negotiations who requested 
anonymity said that the post had roposed a cut of 43 
guildcovered jobs previously the newspaper had favored pay cuts 
rather than job cuts while the union has called for attrition 
through resignations and buyouts 
the situation was complicated by the plight of the daily news 
which also is losing money and which also is in the midst of a 
labor conflict news executives say any concessions the unions give 
the post must also be given the news under metoo contract 
clauses 
and the new york times said it would seek union concessions to 
the extent that they were related to the same economic conditions 
that have affected the post and news and led to declines in the 
papers ad revenue 
money troubles are not new to the post even its founder had 
them alexander hamilton was heavily in debt in 1801 when he 
persuaded a group of merchants to finance the paper 
his was merely the first of many famous names to be associated 
with the paper 
in the 1820s new england poet william cullen bryant began a 
50year tenure as editor poet walt whitman covered the civil war 
for the post franklin delano roosevelt was briefly a coowner in 
the 1920s 
heiress dorothy schiff bought the post in 1939 and tried to 
attract more readers with comics features a tabloid format 
strong sports stories and nearly 50 columnists 
schiff also made the paper one of the nations most liberal her 
selfdescribed formula honest unionism social reform and humane 
government programs 
but the humane reformer also was a bit tightfisted the post 
became known for making do with a small staff and old equipment 
by the mid1970s much of the posts liberal middleclass 
readership had moved to the suburbs in 1976 schiff sold the paper 
to australian media baron rupert murdoch for 31 million at the 
time the paper was losing 500000 annually 
under murdoch the post took on a conservative voice and began 
dishing out sexy pictures racy headlines including the famous 
headless body in topless bar and a steady diet of crime 
stories 
murdoch said the paper lost 150 million before he sold it in 
1988 for 37 million to kalikow a real estate developer who also 
acquired the papers valuable waterfront land on south street in 
lower manhattan

the canadian auto workers union called a strike 
against ford motor co of canada on friday after negotiators 
decided they could not meet a midnight deadline for settling all 
the issues 
at midnight tonight we will be commencing the first strike we 
have had against ford of canada since 1976 caw president robert 
white said late friday 
we still have a very significant distance between the two 
positions don mackenzie fords chief negotiator told reporters 
as discussions broke off for the day at a downtown toronto hotel

resume saturday 
earlier friday union and company officials had agreed 
communication was good and that work was progressing toward a new 
contract but white had acknowledged it was virtually impossible to 
get everything done by the midnight friday strike deadline 
it would take a miracle to get all the work that has to be 
done finished before midnight he had said 
up to 12800 workers are expected to walk off the job at nine 
plants and two offices in ontario the company has two plants in 
oakville five in windsor one in st thomas and one in niagara 
falls 
however the strike wont mean anything in terms of production 
until monday because canadian ford plants do not operate on the 
weekend 
in detroit the united auto workers union and general motors 
corp agreed to extend their national labor contract friday hours 
before the same midnight strike deadline as in canada local union 
leaders said 
theyre going to negotiate through the weekend said charlie 
gledhill acting president of uaw 549 at gms metal stamping plant 
in mansfield ohio were not going to walk out tonight 
those talks recessed early saturday and were expected to 
continue later in the day 
in both countries the unions target a single company in their 
talks in hopes of fashioning a pattern contract for workers at 
other automakers 
white said his unions decision to target ford instead of 
general motors like his counterparts in the united states has 
proved to be the correct move he said the caw now has the full 
attention of ford and its top officials if the canadian union had 
decided to strike gm the efforts and attention of company 
officials would be focused on the us negotiations 
the caw has a 34 million strike fund to support a walkout 
white said earlier in the day that ford had not made a new 
economic proposal since the first one put on the table a few days 
ago which the union found unacceptable he said the caw had 
presented ford with a counterproposal early friday and that ford 
officials went off to calculate the numbers 
ford canada spokesman jim hartford confirmed that but said he 
did not know how long it would take ford to work out the cost of 
the union proposal 
neither side offered details of the proposals both sides had 
indicated progress had been made in some areas 
after announcing the strike late friday white said the tough 
issues were job security inflation and time off ford is 
balking at putting enough economics on the table to get an 
agreement he said 
the canadian branch of the american car giant is suffering from 
flagging sales down 64 percent in august from a year ago 
according to hartford
