when residents of north and south 
scripture lane see a foreigner wandering down their alley they can 
guess why 
are you looking for descendants of the jews asked an old 
man sitting beside the dirt lane in his undershirt and told the 
visitor about li who lived a few streets away 
he waved a hand toward where zhao lived but would not take the 
stranger there hes not accepting visitors anymore the old man 
said hes had too many 
zhao pingyu 68 is one of a few hundred descendants of jews 
living in this ancient center of judaism 390 miles from beijing in 
henan province 
kaifeng the imperial capital from the 10th to the 13th century 
once was home to thousands of jews but they gradually became so 
assimilated that little is left to distinguish them except their 
memories and stories 
in the 1980s as china opened to the outside world kaifeng 
officials sought to cash in on the mystique of jews in china to 
draw attract tourists their attitude appears to have changed since 
the crackdown last year on bourgeois liberalism the catch 
phrase for western ideas 
when a new york family held a bat mitzvah in kaifeng last month 
for their daughters coming of age their requests for permission 
to invite the local jewish community were ignored 
zhao said the kaifeng foreign affairs office had told him not to 
receive foreigners except at official receptions then he added 
but if people come on their own to my house how can i not invite 
them in that would be inhospitable 
although neighbors are reluctant to take people to zhao 
visitors have little trouble finding him zhao is wellknown in 
kaifeng because he is one of the few jews with knowledge of jewish 
history and culture 
he lives with his wife a nonjew in a large room at the back 
of a courtyard on south scripture lane that once was part of the 
synagogue compound 
the synagogue was built in 1163 and stood for 700 years through 
10 renovations it eventually was destroyed by flooding from the 
yellow river and the no 4 peoples hospital now stands on the 
site 
zhao has a diagram of the synagogue which his 
greatgreatgrandfather restored after retiring from an imperial 
court office 
a few years ago after his own retirement from the tax bureau 
zhao started building a model of the synagogue which included 
three elaborate worship halls and several side buildings much work 
still remains 
one of the three stone tablets displayed in kaifengs museum 
exhibit on jews in china came from zhaos family the tablets are 
the jews best historical record 
jewish merchants arrived in china in the 7th century joining 
other traders on the journey along the silk road or by sea from 
south india 
thousands settled in kaifeng eventually creating chinas 
largest jewish community and the one that lasted longest as 
recently as 200 years ago 2000 to 3000 jews worshipped weekly in 
the kaifengs synagogue 
by the mid19th century the jews had intermarried and become 
assimilated they adopted the customs of the majority han chinese 
or the moslems forgot the hebrew language and took chinese names 
a survey of kaifeng in 1980 found only 79 jewish families with 
166 members other accounts say kaifengs population of 500000 
includes up to 300 descendants of jews 
zhao and other jews in the old imperial capital do not observe 
jewish rituals or holidays but he remembers eating unleavened 
bread for the passover meal as a child many chinese jews observed 
passover during the chinese lunar new year 
even though he does not practice judaism zhao maintains his 
sense of jewish identity 
when the jews come here from foreign countries i feel theres 
some connection some relationship by blood he said theyre 
our friends and our brothers 
a menorah given him by an american jew is displayed in the 
middle of zhaos room but he never uses the ceremonial 
candleholder a blue yarmulke handmade by one of his daughters 
hangs on a wall 
i have five daughters he said thats a good thing for a 
jew because judaism is passed down through the mother 
zhaos household registration lists him as a jew but his new 
citizen identification card says says he is han chinese 
he said one daughter was so adamant about being jewish that she 
refused to get an identification card because it would identify 
her as han chinese 
china has 54 minority groups it does not recognize jews as a 
minority because they no longer have a language or customs to 
distinguish them from han chinese 
moslems who still practice their religion and have kept their 
traditions are chinas secondlargest minority they have token 
representation in government and the communist party and are 
entitled to special treatment

ernice dean lives in a small 
weatherbeaten home on this tiny sea island on land that has been 
in her family for generations but the land may not belong to her 
much longer 
ms dean like hundreds of other descendants of freed slaves in 
south carolina has found she cannot keep pace with rising property 
taxes brought on by increased property values 
i was paying 280 and now i have to pay about 400 
annually said ms dean who has been forced to let four other 
people live on her property in order to pay the tax bill 
st helena island population 6230 about 40 miles from lavish 
hilton head island is one of more than 100 sea islands stretching 
from charleston to savannah ga the islands dotted with marshes 
and lined with palmetto trees were settled by slaves freed during 
the civil war 
today warm breezes and fresh seafood make the island chain a 
magnet for visitors 
but with tourism has come development that has driven up land 
prices and taxes and that threatens the residents many of whom 
are poor and subsist on what they can grow in their gardens and 
catch in the sea 
last fall beaufort county auctioned off 87 properties up 42 
percent from the previous year for about 1 million because the 
owners were unable to pay their taxes 
the main source of income the industry of tourism pays low 
wages and is seasonal said emory campbell director of the penn 
community center which has helped the islanders with land problems 
since its founding in 1862 
it emphasizes exclusivity and results in increased property 
values you find that it is extremely out of balance income from 
tourism does not sustain the increased cost of taxes housing and 
food 
tourism is a 5 billionayear industry in south carolina 
beaufort county treasurer eldrid moody also blames the countys 
spending habits the county he said spends more money and has 
more employees than many its size 
taxes are high because we refuse to control spending moody 
said my concern with beaufort county is that we dont have to 
buy the best or build the best we need to put a measuring stick on 
the ability to pay of the masses 
beaufort county has 45000 fewer residents than neighboring 
berkeley county but a budget that is greater by 99 million in 
addition the population has grown only 42 percent annually since 
1980 while the budget has mushroomed 18 percent a year moody said 
county council chairman bill bowen defended the countys budget 
and tax structure 
those quote poor people are the ones who require the most 
services from the county through welfare services and receive the 
most for their tax dollar he said 
residents who lost their property in last years tax sale have 
until october to buy it back but many are impoverished some lost 
their land for failing to pay tax bills as low as 300 
the county council has discussed the tax dilemma but bowen 
isnt sure the council should do anything 
if someone cant afford to own property because they cannot 
pay taxes then they shouldnt own the property he said if i 
cant pay my taxes because my property has gotten so valuable then 
i sell my property for a profit and move to an area where it is 
like it used to be 
there are fewer and fewer places where its like it used to 
be campbell said 
a study conducted eight years ago by the penn center found that 
35 percent of the land in beaufort county was owned by blacks he 
doesnt have current figures but believes thats decreased 
its driving people from a situation where theyre surviving 
to an innercity situation such as publicsubsidized housing or 
even a homeless situation campbell said people usually dont 
have any sympathy there needs to be some kind of recognition of 
the indigenous use of land 
before you know it the thing that attracted tourism and 
development is gone youve ruined your lakes and streams with 
marinas and youve wiped out the native population

president bush ordered defense 
secretary dick cheney back to the tense persian gulf officials 
said monday as american combat troops arriving in saudi arabia 
were told to brace for a long stay 
bush said he would break away from his vacation for a day and 
return to the white house on tuesday for deficitreduction talks 
with his advisers and a briefing at the pentagon on the military 
faceoff with iraqi president saddam hussein 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the naval 
barricade against iraq had forced two or three ships to turn back 
at sea and he declared the embargo is being maintained on 
shipping into and out of iraq 
he also defended the inclusion of food shipments to iraq under 
global sanctions saying the purpose of the embargo is to put the 
pinch on them and deny supplies that allow them to maintain the 
war machine 
in washington the state department said about 500 americans had 
quietly slipped out of kuwait in the face of iraqi efforts to keep 
westerners from leaving 
in saudi arabia meanwhile a 27yearold sergeant stepped off a 
plane at a saudi air base and summed up the concerns of many 
american soldiers yes its scary you have to build up the 
courage and put the fear aside and do what you have to do the 
soldier from claymont del had a gas mask on his belt 
they are telling us to be ready to stay four to six months 
said the soldier the military did not permit troops to be 
identified by name 
the pentagon said cheney will fly to saudi arabia on friday to 
visit us troops and meet with the kingdoms leaders it is his 
second trip to the persian gulf since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said cheney may visit other 
countries before returning to washington next tuesday the 
secretary stopped in egypt and morocco on his earlier trip to saudi 
arabia 
bush meanwhile is to return to his oceanside retreat on 
wednesday and then shuttle back and forth to washington between now 
and labor day 
fitzwater said the persian gulf crisis underscored the need for 
a budgetcutting agreement between congress and the white house 
there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country not only 
about the conflict in the gulf but also about our spending issues 
and about where the budget is going fitzwater said 
as global economic sanctions squeezed iraq the military buildup 
grew steadily in the persian gulf area planes carrying us troops 
and equipment were landing about every 10 minutes one military 
official said bush has committed an estimated 50000 us forces 
to the gulf so far 
sources said the battleship wisconsin meantime has reached the 
eastern mediterranean 
the bush administration says the military buildup and the 
embargo are designed to deter a possible iraqi invasion of saudi 
arabia and to force baghdad to pull its conquering force out of 
kuwait 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler estimated there 
are now about 2500 americans in the iraqiheld country in addition 
to 500 to 600 in iraq itself 
us officials said some of americans have been able to take 
advantage of lax iraqi security at the final check point on kuwaiti 
territory to cross the border into saudi arabia however david 
thomas croskery a briton who apparently tried to flee by the same 
route was shot to death saturday and ms tutwiler said the 
administration was shocked and extremely concerned by that 
action 
she and fitzwater in kennebunkport criticized iraqi reports 
that foreigners were free to leave kuwait we now have cars lined 
up at the saudi border who are unable to get out he said 
the white house spokesman said the global economic embargo 
against iraq would restrict food supplies for the time being 
although there is an exemption for medical products 
overall fitzwater said we assess the impact of the embargo 
as excellent to our knowledge ships are not arriving the embargo 
is being maintained 
he said we have had two or three ships in recent hours that 
have turned away or been turned away or at least have otherwise 
not landed with their cargo none of the ships was engaged in a 
confrontation with us ships fitzwater said 
us intelligence officials were keeping an eye on a particular 
ship suspected of hauling polishmade small arms bound for iraq 
according to reports by nbc news the washington post and the new 
york times 
jane gaffney a spokeswoman for the state department said 
monday she had no information about about the ship 
explaining the decision to restrict food fitzwater said the 
purpose of the sanctions and the embargo is to put the pinch on 
them it seems fairly obvious to me you dont let foodstuffs and 
other things go in that are subject to the sanctions 
the purpose is not let supplies go in that allow them to 
maintain the war machine allow them to maintain their aggressive 
takeover of kuwait fitzwater said you dont give them the 
essentials that enable them to carry on the war 
the administration did not want to use the word blockade to 
describe its quarantine of iraq were not interested in 
semantics were interdicting ships thats our policy fitzwater 
said 
bush called venezuelan president carlos andres perez to discuss 
the gulf situation and world oil supplies fitzwater said us 
officials have said venezuela a member of opec is stepping up oil 
production to help offset the cutoff of iraqi and kuwait oil 
asked about reports that jordan was letting shipments through to 
iraq fitzwater said we are hopeful that jordan will comply 
they have said they will abide by the sanctions he noted that 
the gulf of aqaba a jordanian port has been a traditional trade 
route for iraq 
there may be activity in that area he said 
asked why the united states would block food shipments 
fitzwater said we have obvious humanitarian concerns but we have 
also very real military concerns and this is a force that is after 
all threatening many countries of the world it is a leader who has 
killed people by his own hand and by his own forces

the writer a 27yearold bank employee in 
kuwait kept notes of her experiences after the iraqi invasion aug 
2 the saudi arabian woman and her family escaped from kuwait and 
she made her diary available to the associated press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we witnessed the unthinkable the 
invasion and conquest of kuwait by fellow arab troops of iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
we first encountered their ugly tanks on the streets of kuwait 
city eight days later we managed to escape to bahrain 
here are my notes of the nightmare 
thursday aug 2 as i approached the gulf bank i saw many cars 
outside and people were inside to draw cash indians kuwaitis 
pakistanis eygptians palestinians americans and others were 
outside the building some were yelling go home go home iraq 
has invaded kuwait 
i drove home troops were streaming in and heavy vehicles 
rumbling down istiklal independence boulevard friends called and 
told my family to get ready for war how the hell do you get ready 
for war fill the bathtubs with water buy as much canned food as 
possible buy water call your kin and see if they have any plans 
to escape then wait 
we turned on the radio and took it along with mattresses down to 
the basement 
friday aug 3 whatever little sleep we could have we had it 
was at that point that we heard bombs friends invited us to spend 
the night at their house we went the streets were empty silent 
there were about five radio sets tuned to the bbc another on 
voice of america saudi arabia dubai and iraq radio it was 
horrible to hear what they iraqi radio said especially since we 
knew that they were all lies that the iraqis were in kuwait to 
save its people 
saturday aug 4 we woke up to the sound of bombs they were 
coming from an area called kifan where young kuwaitis had obtained 
rifles and were harassing the iraqis we were proud of them 
friends called and said the iraqis were looting shops and houses 
of rich people who were abroad they said the central bank was 
looted too along with car showrooms 
we heard distant shelling and were told the iraqis were trying 
to silence kuwaiti guns at shuwaikh 
sunday aug 5 the iraqis installed a new government a joke of 
a government a group of young iraqis who tried over television to 
tell us they were kuwaiti their accent betrayed their real 
nationality despite their white robes and ghutra headgear 
wednesday aug 8 we listened to the radio newscast a friend 
called to see if we wanted to leave kuwait we refused 
it was also the same evening that president bush talked i 
cried when mr bush said he wanted the american people to pray for 
the men and women who will be fighting for the principles of 
freedom and democracy 
i am arab and i felt bad that we had to ask for foreign help to 
defend ourselves against an invasion by fellow arabs it was sad 
but i understood it was necessary 
an american friend of my fathers had a heart attack my sister 
and i went to him at hospital immediately his condition improved 
but he was anxious to be with the rest of his family 
thursday aug 9 i went to hospital to visit the american and 
his wife and give them a radio set to listen to newscasts when i 
returned home a friend of ours called nasser was there to offer 
us an escape plan which we accepted 
it pained our hearts to leave kuwait i am saudi arabian but i 
have lived all my years here in this country friends told my 
father the iraqis had rounded up foreigners mainly american and 
british and taken them to baghdad as hostages 
shortly after 11 in the morning nasser came and picked us up we 
took what we can some of our gold and important papers and left 
my heart was tearing up as we drove down fahaheel road where two 
other families in their cars joined us 
we were stopped at an iraqi checkpoint nasser argued with one 
of the soldiers who let us through 
we saw iraqi soldiers near the border nasser stopped then 
turned right to the desert the soldiers waved to us to get back 
we ignored them my heart was beating so fast i could not hear 
anything we began to pray we knew the iraqis shoot first at the 
tires then come and smash the cars and take occupants out there 
were many destroyed cars along the border we didnt see what 
iraqis did with the occupants no shots were fired at us but we 
couldnt get over fear 
nasser told us to start singing to overcome fear the three 
cars were running very fast it took 15 minutes through the desert 
to reach the saudi border which we crossed into the khafji region 
we drove on to nassers house there my father uncle and aunt 
were there we resumed driving this time in safer areas we 
crossed the 15mile causeway on the persian gulf and entered 
bahrain

here is the text of iraqi president 
saddam husseins proposal to solve the persian gulf crisis carried 
by baghdad radio and the official iraqi news agency and translated 
from arabic by the associated press 
in the name of god the compassionate the merciful 
in an attempt on our part to create a peaceful atmosphere in the 
region and place the region in a stable situation and in order to 
reveal america and its ally the monster israel and its small 
allies and their crimes against the nation we have decided to 
propose the following initiative 
the united states has tried to cover its moves against humanity 
and the people of this region by pretending that the economic 
sanctions against iraq are to protest the aid given by iraq to the 
people of kuwait who have saved themselves from the rule of the 
sabah family it lost its mind the day the kuwaitis and iraqis 
decided to reestablish what british colonialism had cut between 
iraq and kuwait as kuwait was a part of iraq until world war i 
iraq has never recognized the crime committed by the colonialists 
america started gathering its naval armada and warplanes and 
beat the drums of war against iraq as an excuse to confront the 
iraqi threat to saudi arabia 
because the spark of war it started will burn many and will 
cause those who are in its arena great catastrophies and in order 
to place the facts as they are in the face of world public opinion 
and the western one in particular and to reveal the phony 
allegations of america that it supports peoples rights when 
actually it only seeks to preserve the interests of the west 
i propose that all cases of occupation and those cases that 
have been portrayed as occupation in the region be resolved 
simultaneouly and on the same principles and basis that should be 
laid down by the un securty council as follows 
preparation for an immediate and unconditional israeli 
withdrawal from occupied arab lands in palestine syria and 
lebanon a syrian withdrawal from lebanon mutual withdrawals by 
iraq and iran and arrangement for the situation in kuwait 
all military withdrawals and all related political arrangements 
should take into consideration iraqs historical territorial rights 
and guarantee the kuwaiti peoples right to decide on their future 
the basis of the program should be all united nations and 
security council resolutions both to arrive at the earliest 
possible solution and to apply the same action taken by the 
security council against iraq on any party that does not comply 
with these arrangements and answer to them 
in order to reveal the facts to the world public opinion to 
judge them according to objective conditions away from american 
wishes and pressure we call for the immediate withdrawal of 
american forces and all other forces that responded to this plot 
from saudi arabia to be replaced by an arab force whose duties 
nationality size and area of deployment should be determined by 
the security council aided by the secretarygeneral of the united 
nations in deciding the nationality of these forces they should 
not include any troops from egypt which is being used by the 
united states as a cornerstone in its conspiracies against the 
arabs there should be an immediate freeze of all boycott and siege 
decisions and matters should go back to normal in economic 
political and scientific dealings between iraq and the world or 
these sanctions should be imposed on any party refusing to comply 
and respond to the conditions stated above 
should the united states its allies and its agents fail to 
respond to our initiative then we as the people of iraq along with 
our brethren in the arab world will resist its evil intentions and 
aggressive schemes we will fight americas evil plans with help 
from the good people of our arab nation and our great iraqi people 
and we will be victorious with gods help the evildoers will 
regret their acts when they are driven out in shame from the region

finding shells on the beach isnt cause to 
close the shoreline to sunbathers unless theyre aging 
unexploded artillery rounds 
most of bukroe beach was open today after officials and 
volunteers using metal detectors found 32 artillery shells some 
dating to world war i in sand dredged from chesapeake bay 
a onemile stretch of beach was closed saturday because of the 
artillery shells all but an 800foot section that needed to be 
checked further was reopened late sunday 
hampton fire battalion chief richard c blakeslee said the 
shells were dredged from an area two miles offshore apparently used 
for target practice 
these are rounds that have been fired but upon impact failed 
to go off he said 
the shells measured about 3 inches in diameter and 10 inches in 
length they came ashore with sand dredged from the bay in a 1 
million beach restoration project that began aug 3 
an ordnance disposal team from langley air force base took the 
shells 
the munitions dating to world war i and world war ii were 
probably not dangerous police and military officers said 
but blakeslee said the danger was real 
all of them still have the explosive material inside the 
shell he said they were designed to take aircraft down and 
can be capable of doing their job for up to 200 years

here are excerpts of iraqi president 
saddam husseins appeal early sunday to iraqi women read over 
baghdad radio by an announcer and monitored and translated by the 
associated press in nicosia 
saddam addressed the women as mujahedat or female holy 
warriors and majeda or glorious women he reviewed at length 
their role in supporting iraqi men in previous wars including the 
198088 war with iran and to the burden of caring for their 
families while the men were at the battlefront 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
today you have additional responsibilities to those you had 
shouldered before you are called to take on a special role in all 
the social and domestic affairs 
the role that is suitable for you today dear majeda is that of 
organizing the economic life from the entire society in addition to 
your previous duties it is when the economic life is organized in 
accordance with the overall plan we seek that we can consider the 
battle over in favor of iraq and the invaders deceived fleeing one 
after the other 
it is then that we will possess all the potentials to take on 
all the amassed forces of evil and those who might be massed in the 
next two months

what is demanded is that the amount of food in pots or on the 
table be limited to only what we really need and that the table 
not be crowded as the tradition has been with various dishes and 
types of fruit 
what is demanded is that no one stockpile food supplies in his 
home and that he keeps only what is needed for the day or a week 
stockpiling will bring about shortages 
i know as well as you do that iraqi families even those with 
limited income are able to live for a year without purchasing 
clothes or food 
each family should take the initiative and tell its neighbor how 
instead of consuming 5 or 10 kilograms 11 to 22 pounds of meat a 
month it has cut down its consumption by half it is with this 
that we can hit the core of the american schemes which they have 
plotted against us in accordance with the mentality that money is 
everything in life 
even during the war with iran our lives were not lacking except 
the very trivial things 
today however after the forces of evil took the decision of 
boycott and siege what is required is an attitude of more 
awareness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i dont believe the patriotic awareness of any of you accepts 
that one stockpiles whatever he can to leave another in distress 
thus diverting the attention away from the needs of the men as they 
prepare themselves for the battle should it break out 
i dont believe any of you accepts to stockpile more of what is 
needed while we all stand on equal footing in the same trench 
master your role as you have done in the past so iraq can emerge 
triumphant as it has in the past 
iraqs national wealth is abundant our supplies of essential 
needs and foodstuffs is great so victory is on our side and defeat 
is certain for the aggressors who have pinned all their hopes to 
their economic sanctions and to their forces and their useless 
fleets

the pilot navigator and bombardier of the 
plane that dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima say they have no 
reservations about making a buck off their place in history 
in recent months theyve been hopscotching the country hawking 
books tshirts caps and coffee mugs commemorating the aug 6 
1945 bombing that claimed nearly 100000 japanese lives and 
hastened the end of world war ii 
its simple supply and demand says 75yearold retired brig 
gen paul w tibbets jr the pilot of the bomber enola gay 
he spent years speaking for free at kiwanis and rotary luncheons 
none of these organizations that ask you to come and talk 
offer you any kind of compensation for doing it he said i 
unfortunately arrived at the point they expect you to do it you 
owe it to them 
well i dont think i owe anybody a damn thing 
setsuko thurlow founder and cochairwoman of hiroshimanagasaki 
relived a torontobased antinuclear group finds that attitude 
appalling she was 13 when she was buried in the rubble from the 
bomb which killed her sister and niece 
i think it is commercial exploitation of the hundreds of 
thousands of people who were killed she said i do question 
their sense of morality whatever they did you would think they 
would feel at least a part of the collective guilt 
but tibbets said its never dawned on me that im trying to 
capitalize on anybodys death my reaction to that is i tell them 
that theyre wrong 
last august tibbets hooked up with an agent clark st john of 
buckeye aviation publishing co which published his book flight 
of the enola gay 
they began touring shopping malls and air shows and later 
persuaded enola gay navigator theodore dutch van kirk and 
bombardier tom ferebee to join them since then theyve visited 
florida georgia alabama ohio michigan and indiana 
both tibbets and st john declined to say how much money was 
coming in 
nobodys getting rich here said st john but i would say 
were certainly in the black 
tibbets said it quickly became apparent they were an attraction 
we found out that people came in and they had all kinds of 
pictures they wanted pictures autographed he said they were 
interested in the book but they had their own mementos you know 
will you autograph this will you autograph that 
that prompted st john and tibbets to develop their own package 
of wares including enola gay coffee mugs 6 tshirts 9 
sweatshirts 1295 videos 1995 and 2495 photographs 6 
and 9 and a copy of the order authorizing use of the atomic bomb 
5 
the mugs and shirts bear the insignia the group that dropped the 
bomb and the words first atomic bombardment the mugs also bear 
tibbets name 
big sellers said st john are tibbets book 1495 and a 
limited edition color lithograph selling for 2495 depicting the 
bomber climbing away as the mushroom cloud blossomed over hiroshima 
autographs and handshakes are free 
the general does not charge for an autograph st john said 
he refuses to get involved in a gimmick like that 
at a recent book signing in salt lake city people who stopped 
by the trios table included a couple of former members of tibbets 
509th composite group who snapped off smart salutes to their 
former commanding officer the group trained at wendover utah in 
194445 
visitors also included other world war ii veterans 
thanks said one grayhaired man whose wife took snapshots 
of him shaking hands with tibbets i was a marine in the south 
pacific and i sure as hell didnt want to have to invade japan 
japan surrendered five days after a second bomb was dropped on 
nagasaki on aug 9 1945 
van kirk said he joined tibbets and ferebee on the road because 
it gives him an opportunity to refresh the memories of his 
countrymen fading 45 years after vj day 
you know i had a young reporter once ask me how to spell 
hiroshima he said i think theres an amazing lack of 
knowledge in this country about what went on in those days 
if im lending even a little bit of knowledge to some people 
i think im making a contribution

a test that blows puffs of oxygen at the eye 
identified alzheimers patients in a group of elderly people 
suggesting it may help in diagnosing the mindrobbing disease a 
researcher says 
the test which employs a form of learning made famous by 
russian scientist ivan pavlov identified 19 of 20 people who had 
been diagnosed with probable alzheimers said diana woodruffpak 
but it also put seven of 20 healthy subjects in the same category 
an error rate that must be reduced she said 
after more research the procedure may become a useful addition 
to the battery of tests used to diagnose alzheimers she said 
woodruffpak is a psychology professor at temple university in 
philadelphia and director of the philadelphia geriatric centers 
cognitive neuroscience laboratory she spoke at a weekend session 
of the american psychological associations annual meeting and in 
a later interview 
her study is intriguing its tantalizing said deborah 
claman program director for neuropsychology at the national 
institute on aging in bethesda md more research must be done 
before the tests usefulness can be assessed she said 
alzheimers disease is a progressive neurological disorder it 
causes gradual memory loss impairment of judgment disorientation 
personality changes difficulty learning and loss of language 
skills 
woodruffpaks test checks for a form of learning called 
classical conditioning essentially that is learning to associate 
one stimulus with another pavlov showed dogs can learn that a 
particular sound meant a meal was coming 
in the new experiment participants wore an apparatus that 
placed the mouth of a tube close to one eye they heard a beep 
lasting for a halfsecond during which the tube blew a puff of 
oxygen into the eye making them blink 
this was done repeatedly and the test was to see how often 
people blinked when they heard the beep but before the puff 
performance in healthy people declines with age with 
significant drops in middle age woodruffpak said 
the elderly people were tested as they watched a silent movie 
the combination of beep and puff was given 90 times at random 
intervals of 10 seconds to 20 seconds 
each participants performance was scored in terms of what 
percentage of the 90 trials produced even a partial blink before 
the puff 
as a group the alzheimer patients scored at 11 percent the 
healthy people who were of similar ages scored at 32 percent 
the result indicates a lack of classical conditioning in the 
alzheimer group woodruffpak said 
when a cutoff of 25 percent was used all but one of the 
alzheimer patients failed to meet the standard all but seven of 
the healthy people scored above the mark 
the healthy subjects are being studied again about a year after 
the experiment woodruffpak said 
at least two of the seven participants who had scored below the 
standard on the eyeblink test have lost ground on a separate test 
used to diagnose dementia she said those who had scored above the 
eyeblink standard appear to be largely stable on this test with 
about twothirds of them retested so far she said 
that preliminary result suggests the eyeblink test may help pick 
up early cases of alzheimers she said 
researchers also found that patients whose dementia was due to 
areas of impaired blood supply in the brain scored higher on the 
eyeblink test than alzheimer patients did that suggests that the 
test may help in distinguishing alzheimers from other types of 
dementia woodruffpak said 
the difference was expected because poor performance on the 
eyeblink test appears related to defects in certain parts of the 
brain she said all alzheimer patients should have those defects 
but only some of the other demented patients would she said

a can of soup believed about 135 years 
old has stood the test of time although no one is willing to give 
it a taste test 
scientists studying the tin can of consommelike soup say a 
chemical analysis determined that it is still edible and nutritious 
the governments commonwealth scientific and industrial research 
organization received the can in 1945 from its liaison officer in 
london he obtained it from a friend whose grandfather ran a store 
the group said 
the research organization believes the soup dates to the 185356 
crimean war in which great britain france turkey and sardinia 
defeated russia 
david hall of the canned food information service said the 
ancient soup is believed to be a light meatbased broth containing 
some vegetables 
he said the can is an early example of canning technology and 
helps to understand how canned food can retain its nutritional 
value without preservatives

disaster for all 
the world council of indigenous peoples after a fourday 
meeting of 400 delgates in tromsoe norway called for an immediate 
ban on nuclear weapons testing 
the colorful assembly including eskimos and american indians 
rejected any celebration of the 500th anniversary of columbus 
discovering america in 1492 
it said the date marks the start of the invasion of our lands 
the genocide against our indian communities and that the 1992

one of the magellan spacecrafts backup 
computers rejected commands when a memory chip failed but the 
glitch wont hurt the 744 million exploration of venus engineers 
say 
its like a stuck traffic light its not allowing the proper 
flow of commands said tommy thompson magellan science manager 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
the spacecraft is healthy except for this little problem and 
we can work around it he added every indication is this will 
have no effect on our operations 
launched from the shuttle atlantis in may 1989 magellan is on a 
mission to use radar to penetrate venus thick clouds and make the 
best pictures and maps yet of the planets rugged landscape 
the spacecraft went into orbit around venus on friday after a 
roundabout 948millionmile voyage to the second planet from the 
sun 
lab spokesman jim doyle said the problem with the memory chip 
should be corrected within a few days by bypassing the failed part 
computer commands are expected to turn on the spacecrafts radar 
on wednesday then order magellan to bounce radar off venus in a 
test on thursday 
that test and others the following week may produce 
postagestamp images of 15by15mile squares of venus surface 
those pictures will be released only if they reveal any interesting 
discoveries project manager tony spear said 
otherwise nasa plans to issue magellans first official 
pictures of venus in september 
mapping of the planet could begin on aug 29 thompson said 
the chip failure happened in an onboard backup computer that can 
accept commands from the spacecrafts main computers then execute 
those commands so the craft points properly toward venus 
thompson said the faulty chip made the computer reject some 
commands but since it is a backup computer those commands were 
accepted and carried out by another computer he added 
magellan orbits venus once every 3 hours 15 minutes thompson 
said its orbit ranges from 183 miles to 5253 miles above venus

a 40yearold flight attendant shouldnt be 
forced to starve herself into her 20yearold size says sen 
howard metzenbaum whos asking american airlines to change its 
weight policy 
the policy is outdated and wrong metzenbaum dohio said 
in a letter urging the texasbased airline to scrap its weight 
standard the senator said the standard appears to be biased 
against women particularly older women 
according to americans flight attendants the standard is 
applied in practice almost exclusively to the female attendants 
certainly it has no application whatsoever to the pilots 
management or executive staff metzenbaum wrote 
american airlines president robert crandall has said weight 
standards are necessary because weve got some people on our 
airplanes that are way too heavy 
company spokesman al becker said american has offered to 
liberalize its weight standards but the attendants union would 
like for us to abandon weight standards altogether 
we are not prepared to do that he said our flight 
attendants are public contact employees 
the association of professional flight attendants the union for 
americans 16000 attendants is suing the company to challenge the 
37yearold weight guidelines which were slightly modified after a 
1975 court challenge 
the trial is scheduled for 1991 in fort worth texas the two 
sides are scheduled to meet aug 22 in fort worth to discuss a 
possible outofcourt settlement company spokesman ed stewart said 
the equal employment opportunity commission has filed a federal 
classaction suit in los angeles contending the policy 
discriminates against women and especially discriminates against 
women over 40 
according to metzenbaum and eeoc lawyer ralph dh fertig 
americans policy requires a firm trim silhouette free of 
bulges rolls or paunches 
american still wants their flight attendants to appeal to a 
male sexist notion of what is sexy fertig said 
pan american world airways last year ended six years of 
litigation by raising weight requirements and allowing an extra 9 
pounds as attendants get older the carrier also agreed to pay 23 
million in lost wages to 115 employees who were not allowed to work 
because of their weight 
northwest and continental have dropped their weight 
restrictions delta airlines and usair use less stringent weight 
charts and provide leeway for older flight attendants 
americans standards are roughly tied to a 1959 metropolitan 
life insurance co chart 
a 5foot5inch attendant may weight no more than 129 pounds at 
american but could weigh up to 138 at delta with 4 added pounds 
as she ages and up to 150 pounds at pan am plus an extra 9 pounds 
as she ages 
becker said american has offered to add allowances for age and 
weightloss leave as part of a weight proposal submitted to the 
union in may but he said he did not have details of the proposal 
we believe we are being reasonable and realistic in this he 
said what we want are a set of weight standards that make sense 
and that project american in the proper light 
metzenbaum urged american to follow the lead of the other 
airlines and adopt fitnessbased employee policies 
his letter pointed out that he heads the senate labor 
subcommittee but did not threaten a formal investigation or 
congressional hearing 
spokeswoman nancy coffey said metzenbaum sent the letter friday 
to encourage american to become more modern and further action 
would depend upon what american does 
becker said he could not comment on the letter because american 
had not yet received it

the feared killer tomato seeds from outer 
space are bearing a rather tame harvest 
people have sampled the fruit of the seeds exposed to five years 
more space radiation than planned none turned into a space monster 
or even got sick neither did a groundhog at elmhurst college who 
took a nibble 
hes not glowing i can tell you that said elmhurst biology 
professor frank mittermeyer one of about 58000 teachers who 
received some of the seeds 
more than 12 million seeds were sent into orbit aboard a 
satellite in 1984 to face deepspace radiation exposure for 10 
months but the 1986 challenger disaster and other problems left 
them aloft five years longer than planned 
astronauts retrieved the 11ton long duration exposure facility 
satellite in january and the seeds were distributed to 4 million 
students nationwide 
a memo from a nasa contractor warned of a remote possibility 
that mutations in the seeds could produce toxic fruit prompting 
some teachers to abandon the program the memo from oklahoma state 
university was not an official nasa statement spokesmen said 
about 6000 participants have reported back to the national 
aeronautics and space administration program manager j gregory 
marlins said so far no one has grown a killer tomato 
most have ignored nasa warnings not to eat the fruit theyre 
eating them all over the country marlins said in a telephone 
interview from washington 
in this first generation there are very few mutations he 
said but philosophically we think its not a good idea to eat 
your science experiments 
tomato plants belong to the nightshade family which includes 
such poisonous plants as the black nightshade marlins said some 
scientists feared mutations could cause the tomatoes to become like 
their poisonous relations 
weve noticed that the colors were a little different but 
nothing yet that scares us or makes us think theyre monsters 
mittermeyer said im really looking forward to eating the 
tomatoes ive been waiting six years 
some of the tomatoes grown from the space seeds are darker than 
those grown from normal seeds and some of the plants have green 
yellow and white leaves instead of normal green leaves said jim 
alston a scientit with park seed co which distributed the seeds 
the importance of those changes is not yet known alston said in 
a telephone interview from greenwood sc where the company is 
based 
many mutations wont become evident until the second generation 
of space plants bears fruit marlins said during the second 
generation mutations hidden in recessive genes may surface 
students and teachers involved in the program are scheduled to 
return their reports to nasa by september marlins said a final 
report on the experiment is tentatively scheduled to be released in 
december

barely 36 hours before saddam husseins forces 
swarmed into kuwait the state departments top middle east 
official was telling congress that its proposed sanctions on iraq 
were too harsh 
the administration had sent its ambassador to speak to saddam 
said assistant secretary john h kelly we counseled restraint 
he reassured a house foreign affairs subcommittee besides the 
administration already was planning to tighten export controls 
and they are working he said 
few on capitol hill are claiming their sanctions would have 
dissuaded iraqs ambitious president from invading his oilrich 
neighbor but there is a feeling that once again congress was a 
step ahead of president bush on an important facet of us foreign 
policy 
in this instance the congress led the president said rep 
lee hamilton dind the chairman of the middle east subcommittee 
where kelly was testifying a better posture would have been to 
act earlier 
nineteen months into his presidency a welldefined pattern has 
developed congress squawks about the us stance in a regional 
conflict and the president driven by criticism or by outside 
forces moves to accommodate 
having largely given in to congressional demands on cambodia 
nicaragua and el salvador and with iraq policy changed overnight 
by the invasion the administration now is being confronted with 
new appeals from capitol hill to wind down proxy wars against 
communist governments in afghanistan and angola 
this president is less fettered by convictions and less 
willing to resist pressure than any since nixon said michael 
mandlebaum an analyst with the new yorkbased council on foreign 
relations 
but administration defenders said the shifts result from a 
changing world and bushs desire for a bipartisan foreign policy 
not from a lack of backbone 
you could butt heads as happened during many years of the 
reagan administration but i think thats been tried and found 
wanting said rep henry hyde rill a senior foreign affairs 
committee member who supported many of the policies that now are 
being cast aside 
bush and his foreign policy team set the pattern early on even 
before he was inaugurated by steering away from the nicaragua 
policy that had brought president reagan into constant conflict 
with capitol hill 
in only a few months bush dropped aid to the contra rebels 
which reagan had created to fight the sovietbacked sandinista 
government and quieted the longestrunning policy fight of the 
decade 
in much the same way bushs policymakers at the state 
department now are negotiating a new bipartisan approach to el 
salvador bowing to congressional insistence that restrictions be 
placed on military aid to the rightist government that reagan had 
supported unconditionally 
the cambodia decision seemed to come from the same mold 
lawmakers had complained increasingly about us support for a 
coalition of forces opposing the communist government because the 
coalition includes the murderous khmer rouge 
secretary of state james a baker iii announced that the united 
states would withdraw its support for a united nations seat for the 
coalition and would open talks with vietnam which installed the 
current government some in congress believe those moves dont go 
far enough and expect further concessions 
still other third world conflicts could be the subject of change 
prompted by the legislative branch changes in us support for 
angolan rebels are reported to be in the works and the senate has 
approved an intelligence bill that sources say slashes by onethird 
the covert us aid given afghanistans mujahedeen rebels and 
eliminates the covert aid program to cambodias rebel coalition 
in each case us aid to antigovernment rebels has been a sore 
point for members of congress and the administrations flexibility 
has been increased because the soviets have eased their own support 
for the current government 
this is a highly pragmatic administration and it sees that 
the death of communism can facilitate the death of 
anticommunism said robert hunter an analyst at the center for 
strategic and international studies a washington think tank 
bush now can indulge a lot of this congressional vision 
without paying heavy penalties hunter said 
the administrations flexibility is limited and the most 
visible example is us policy toward china bush who claims 
personal expertise on the worlds most populous country has 
resisted efforts to punish beijing for last years crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement drawing criticism from congress 
and when change does come the impetus is not solely from 
capitol hill 
each of these already was up on the list of issues that needed 
to be reexamined said a senior state department official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity step by step the president and 
the secretary of state have gone through and said its time for a 
change

macdill air force base fla the commander of the us 
military effort in the middle east said sunday the deployment of 
american forces is running ahead of schedule and that iraq would 
pay a price if it attacked saudi arabia 
but gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of the united states 
central command said the iraqis were continuing to move 
reinforcements into kuwait those forces were taking up defensive 
positions and some were right down literally on the 
kuwaitsaudi border he said 
schwarzkopf said that the iraqi troops had taken a similar 
defensive posture before invading kuwait on aug 2 
theres no question about the fact that they have dug in right 
now for a strong defense the general said but he added they 
have the capability to do just about anything they want to of 
iraqi leader saddam hussein schwarzkopf said it is very very 
difficult to predict the mans intentions 
schwarzkopf showed reporters being taken to saudi arabia the war 
room at the central command headquarters at macdill located in 
tampa from his command desk schwarzkopf said he had instant 
communications with defense secretary richard cheney the joint 
chiefs of staff chairman gen colin powell and virtually every 
other military commander around the world 
behind schwarzkopf were two tiers of desks staffed by command 
directors representing all of the us armed forces the generals 
and colonels faced a display of six digital clocks and screens that 
showed current deployments pending actions force dispositions and 
current intelligence on the persian gulf situation 
theres a constant flow of information in and out of here 
schwarzkopf said 
he also said the flow of troops and materiel to saudi arabia was 
ahead of schedule and had gone exceptionally smoothly 
i would never tell you that the american forces that are there 
are 100 percent out of harms way schwarzkopf said but he 
said we have built up a great deal of force over there now 
and if they do make an attack they are going to pay a price for 
it 
the american ground forces are outnumbered now but schwarzkopf 
said he was confident american air and naval power could neutralize 
any iraqi attack 
he said the saudi military would command the burgeoning arab 
military presence in saudi arabia 
the saudis have made it clear that they are going to command 
the arab forces he said 
were deeply involved in working that out now he said of 
coordination among commanders of the various multinational forces 
an important goal of those talks he said was to prevent 
sidebyside deployment of troops from different nations at key 
strategic points because of language barriers and other 
communications problems 
an old adage is never draw a command boundary through a 
piece of critical terrain schwarzkopf said pentagon officials 
have said saddam has just two direct routes into saudi arabia from 
kuwait should he decide to attack one along the coast the other 
further north near saudi oil fields 
schwarzkopf said military commanders would avoid allowing such 
seams between forces of different nationalities to occur at 
critical locations 
schwarzkopf opened his briefing by describing the logistical 
challenge of transporting us troops and equipment to the middle 
east 7000 miles by air and 12000 miles by sea from the east 
coast 
airlifting one heavy division would take 1538 loads aboard a 
c141 transport and another 269 loads aboard a c5 transport the 
largest aircraft in the world for that reason he said a lot of 
equipment was being shipped by sea 
the magnitude of this task to quote my teenagers is 
totally awesome schwarzkopf said 
asked whether he believed saddams call for resistance in the 
arab world would prompt iraqisponsored terrorism schwarzkopf 
said there are several terrorist organizations that have found 
haven in iraq and i have every expectation that theyre going to be 
asked to do something were paying attention 
but he said it was important to emphasize that the other 
governments in the area recognize saddam is a threat to them as 
well as the united states and that their resistance to iraq would 
not be easily shaken 
he said a small resistance movement continued in kuwait but that 
it was not nearly powerful enough to have an impact on the iraqi 
occupation still he said it was an important symbol 
right now kuwait as i knew it is essentially gone he said 
schwarzkopf said he was confident us troops could perform well 
in the desert climate even if saddam unleashed his arsenal of 
chemical weapons 
its tough sure but its not impossible its nowhere near 
impossible 
asked whether he expected a chemical attack schwarzkopf 
saidgiven their record in the iraniraq war i would never 
discount that possibility were prepared for everything 
he said iraq has been calling up reserves but that its best 
troops were those that invaded kuwait and are still there 
schwarzkopf was in saudi arabia last week with cheney but since 
then had been directing the us military response from the florida 
base with a deputy command center based in saudi arabia but he 
said the main headquarters would soon be set up in saudi arabia and 
that he personally was going

children of divorced or separated parents run 
a greater risk of becoming ill than those who grow up in 
traditional nuclear families a study concludes 
researcher jane mauldon of the university of california at 
berkeley said children of broken families run a 35 percent risk of 
developing health problems over a threeyear period that compares 
with a 26 percent risk among all children 
tonsillitis repeated ear infections and pneumonia accounted for 
nearly onethird of the reported illnesses according to the study 
other problems included allergies asthma chronic skin conditions 
chronic lung problems and urinary infections 
the problems persist even after the mother has remarried the 
report also noted 
the results of the study appear in the august edition of the 
journal demographics published by the washingtonbased population 
association of america 
mauldon wrote that the children are likely to have experienced 
very significant stress because their living standards changed 
dramatically 
they probably also lost many of the resources that contribute 
to good health a safe comfortable environment relatively free of 
environmental hazards and risks of infection good food and 
constant adult supervision she wrote 
with the father gone and many mothers needing to find work after 
divorce children have less contact with their parents mauldon 
observed mothers generally have custody of children after divorce 
divorce can reduce the availability of health insurance for some 
children although those who are in the lowest income group may 
become eligible for medicaid 
mauldon of the graduate school of public policy at berkeley 
studied 6000 childrens health histories in families where a 
divorce occurs children average 013 more illnesses per year after 
their parents divorce than before mauldon concluded 
not only were children of broken families more likely to develop 
health problems than those in intact families but the problems 
also persisted even when the mother remarried mauldon reported 
if postdivorce health problems spring from emotional 
difficulties then we should see more illness in the first year or 
two after separation when children are most upset she reported 
however she found that while the risk of health problems is 
higher than average for children in the first four years after a 
family separation it increases even more after that mauldon said 
her study was published just days after a census bureau study 
showing that divorced mothers receive only about 70 percent of the 
child support payments they are due 
that report said that as of the spring of 1988 there were 94 
million mothers caring for children on their own 
only about 59 percent had been awarded child support payments 
the bureau found averaging 2710 annually 
only about half received the full amount however and onethird 
of mothers raising children on their own were listed as below the 
poverty level 
mauldon said it is possible that divorced mothers are more 
likely to report their childrens illnesses than mothers in intact 
families but she concluded that this is unlikely to account for 
the overall differences in rates of illness

yuppie motherstobe who try to put their children 
on the fast track by talking to them in the womb may be on the 
right track 
studies have found that starting in the womb babies recognize 
speech as a special sound and distinguish between spoken passages 
anthony decasper a psychology professor at the university north 
carolina at greensboro said sunday 
decasper described research involving a group of women who were 
in their 32nd week of pregnancy researchers asked the women to 
recite a particular paragraph of a childrens story three times in 
a row each day until the birth 
three different passages were used but each mother recited only 
one 
about 52 hours after birth the babies were given a special 
nipple and earphones by altering their rate of sucking they could 
choose to hear a woman reciting either the story their mothers had 
recited or one of the other stories 
they chose the familiar story decasper said 
were talking about recognition of linguistically relevant 
speech sounds he said the implication is that fetuses heard 
perceived listened and learned about something about the acoustic 
structure of american english 
in another study 24 newborns were exposed to the sound of a 
heartbeat or a woman speaking decasper said they were able to 
choose which ear would hear the sound by varying the frequency at 
which they sucked a pacifier 
babies chose to hear speech in the right ear and the heartbeat 
in the left ear said decasper so they were already processing 
speech differently from other sound he said 
what it shows is at birth there is some knowledge of the 
language of the culture said decasper who spoke in a 
presentation and an interview at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association 
mriganka sur of the department of brain and cognitive science 
at the massachusetts institute of technology said the idea that 
the result shows specialized processing of speech sounds makes a 
lot of sense to me 
it reflects specialization in the brains two halves called 
hemispheres he said that probably is driven by genes although 
the experience of hearing speech before birth may also play a role 
he said

saddam husseins conquest of kuwait and 
threats against saudi arabia have sharpened the interarab 
rivalries that have long thwarted hopes of forging a regional unity 
against israel 
the failure of the arabs to move against saddam for gobbling up 
a fellow arab state has underlined their inherent inability to take 
decisive collective action but the debate over the iraqi 
presidents action still rings with appeals to panarab concerns 
including declarations by the saddam himself 
the various arab factions all condemned israels seizure of arab 
lands in 1967 and saddam declared sunday he was ready to resolve 
the persian gulf crisis if israel gave up those conquests 
it was saddams own attempt to use one of the few issues that 
all arabs agree on to stir up panarab support for his cause 
most arab nations may have objected to saddams predatory 
invasion aug 2 but they split cleanly over what to do about it 
only a few have sent small military forces to help defend saudi 
arabia the arab worlds bankroller 
king fahd of saudi arabia had no choice but to call in the 
americans to defend his throne against a brother arab because no 
one else was prepared to do it 
the arab league now with 21 members was founded in 1945 to 
unite the arab world as the colonial era ended after world war ii 
but in a region riven by centuriesold tribal feuds overlaid 
with the political and territorial confrontations spawned in the 
postwar era that unity has proved to be as elusive as a desert 
mirage 
gen saad elshazly a hero in the arab world for masterminding 
the 1973 egyptian assault across the suez canal that sent the 
israelis reeling noted in his book the arab military option 
that the arab world is a mosaic 
seen from afar it looks whole but examined closely it reveals 
itself no more than a pattern of glinting multicolored fragments 
the bleak but inexorable verdict has to be that it is impossible to 
see how arab unity can be achieved in the foreseeable future 
he stresses that three diseases ravage the arab world 
debilitating its potential strength rival ideologies uneven 
economic wealth and the conflicting ambitions of its leaders 
the arab world stretches from the indian ocean to the atlantic 
from the mediterranean to the congo its 210 million people share a 
common religion islam 
all speak arabic but traditions and custom vary so much that an 
algerian arab is virtually incomprehensible to a levantine arab 
from lebanon 
the creation of israel in 1948 in what was once palestine 
should in theory have been the catalyst for bringing the 
fledgling arabs states together but it did not and to this day 
still has not 
one reason why the combined arab armies of syria jordan iraq 
lebanon and egypt failed to crush the heavily outnumbered israelis 
in the first middle east war of 194849 was that national 
jealousies prevented the creation of a unified arab command 
that remains true now three unsuccessful wars with the jewish 
state later 
all attempts at political union by some countries such as egypt 
and syria have failed because of conflicting objectives 
no two arab regimes are the same 
the rivalries stemmed in large part from the arbitrary and often 
artificial borders drawn for many of these states by the british 
and french after world war i when they carved up the old ottoman 
empire 
with iraqs annexation of kuwait which was ruled by an emir 
there are now seven monarchies most of them absolute like saudi 
arabia 
seven states have thinly veiled military or militarybacked 
dictatorships such as iraq syria and libya the others are either 
oneparty republics or emerging democracies 
iraq and syria ruled by rival wings of the baath arab socialist 
party have been feuding for more than 10 years and have backed 
different sides in lebanons 15yearold civil war 
algeria and morocco are at odds over the mineralrich western 
sahara 
syrian president hafez assad has been scrapping with plo 
chairman yasser arafat since 1983 
syria ended an 11year rift with egypt in december syria broke 
off relations with cairo in 1978 after egyptian president anwar 
sadat signed a peace treaty with israel 
amid these frustrations many arab states have settled for 
forming subregional economic and security alliances a move that 
some analysts see as evidence of a new pragmatism in the arab world 
the gulf cooperation council was founded in 1981 while the 
iraniraq war raged and includes saudi arabia oman the united 
arab emirates qatar bahrain and what was then the independent 
emirate of kuwait 
in february 1989 egypt iraq jordan and north yemen now 
united with south yemen formed the arab cooperation council 
while libya algeria tunisia morocco and mauretania joined 
together in the arab maghreb union 
saddam husseins invasion of kuwait aug 2 and his massing of 
tens of thousands of troops on saudi arabias northern border was a 
body blow to the gulf cooperation council which despite its 
jointsecurity agreement failed to rally behind kuwait 
saddams action was also a slap in the face for egypt its arab 
cooperation council partner and a leading arab moderate which had 
tried to head off the iraqi invasion 
at an emergency arab summit in cairo on friday egypt was one of 
only 12 arab states that voted for a resolution on sending troops 
to saudi arabia 
economically there are also great imbalances in the arab world 
which have exacerbated the lack of unity 
the oilrich gulf states long reveled in their petrodollar 
wealth while millions of fellow arabs have languished in poverty 
their countries burdened by mountainous debts 
sadats successor hosni mubarak has skillfully guided egypt 
back into the arab fold after a decade of ostracism by the arabs 
and clearly hoped to become the beacon for moderate forces in this 
turbulent region 
his strategy appeared to be making headway until saddam his 
regional ambitions fueled by his selfproclaimed victory in the 
198088 war against iran went on the warpath and shifted the 
center of arab gravity from cairo to baghdad

the historic heart of the old czarist 
capital is crumbling and can be saved only by giving it to the 
people who live there says a young archaeologist who has become an 
influential politician 
for alexei kovalyov one of the gems of european culture is the 
prize to be won or lost by an experiment in market economics and 
individual responsibility 
piles of dirt and debris lie in peace square once a beauty spot 
of the city the broad corinthian columns of the kazan cathedral 
are disintegrating 
majestic structures associated with peter the great 
dostoyevsky pushkin and tchaikovsky sag in dirt and decay 
about 5000 historic buildings dating from the time when 
leningrad was st petersburg are under official protection but 
that has little practical meaning because there has been no attempt 
at maintenance 
the condition of the city is catastrophic and this applies 
not only to its architectural monuments but to all of its 
buildings said kovalyov 26 an intense man who began his 
campaign to save leningrad in 1986 when he was an archaeology 
student 
he now is chairman both of the city council committee on 
historic preservation and one of the council factions like most 
other public issues in the era of glasnost his effort has become 
intensely political 
we usually say we dont have the money we dont have the 
materials we dont have the working hands we need kovalyov said 
of the reconstruction effort thats all an illusion if we had 
normal economic relations we would all of a sudden have the money 
the material the working hands 
since all buildings are public property under the soviet system 
the occupants do not care about them he said in the marinsky 
palace city council headquarters 
most people who live in a historic but rundown building in the 
center of leningrad jump at the chance to move to a new 
prefabricated apartment on the outskirts 
the preservation of our city is possible only in one instance 
if we now start to transfer homes to individual owners kovalyov 
said these owners can be private cooperatives every form of 
ownership permitted in other countries of the world 
similar plans are under way in moscow both cities elected 
reform mayors this year and the two officials leningrad lawyer 
anatoly sobchak and moscow economist gavriil popov quit the 
communist party in july 
although the means are the same moscows purpose is different 
to start a housing market that might spur construction and end the 
chronic shortage of living quarters 
alexander osovtsov chairman of the moscow councils commission 
on social policy told the weekly moscow news in july the city 
would start giving apartments to their residents beginning in early 
1991 
residents with more than the officially allotted space per 
person about 130 square feet will have to buy the excess from the 
moscow city government those with less will get certificates 
entitling them to new and larger housing 
moscow residents say advertisements from potential buyers 
already are appearing on the streets 
in leningrad as in moscow the issue is part of a broader 
effort to eliminate the legacy of soviet rule leningrad seeks a 
special status that could permit it to offer tax holidays give 
free rein to entrepreneurs boost tourism and possibly issue its 
own currency 
kovalyov and his supporters say their city of 5 million has more 
to preserve than moscow or most other european capitals because 
there never has been enough money to modernize it 
many downtown buildings date from the time when the city 
sparkled as an imperial capital 
palaces and parks dot the central district there is little 
traffic on nevsky prospekt the main street that leads from the 
alexander nevsky monastery where luminaries of science literature 
and music are buried to the majesty of the hermitage and the gold 
spire of the admiralty 
of all the european capitals petersburg is the most preserved 
city of all kovalyov said if we take london or paris there 
reconstruction was much more serious 
saving the city must go beyond protecting the most famous sites 
that attract thousands of tourists yearly he said 
for us its most important to preserve the city environment 
all the way to saving every house each structure every gate and 
bracket kovalyov declared 
he said leningrads current state is tied to its namesake 
vladimir i lenin and the communist system he built 
the city was known as st petersburg for more than 200 years 
after peter the great founded it as his capital then to remove 
the names germanic flavor it was rechristened petrograd during 
world war i 
it was named leningrad in 1924 after lenins death 
whether to resume the old name is being discussed on the streets 
and in the city council 
many other cities are demanding and getting their old names 
back but changing leningrad to st petersburg is of special 
significance in a country whose founder has been venerated for 
decades 
skirmishes already have occurred in the council chamber on the 
sensitive topic of renaming landmarks associated with lenin 
last spring the council took up a proposal to rename the square 
in front of the smolny institute lenins revolutionary 
headquarters but referred it to a committee 
it now is called dictatorship of the proletariat square and the 
proposal is to name it for andrei sakharov the nuclear physicist 
and human rights activist who died in december 
kovalyov said leningrad is an appropriate name if the city 
continues to deteriorate but if the conditions of the citys 
existence change then the overwhelming majority of residents will 
understand the need to rename it

westerners nightmares of long lines at 
the gas station and higher fuel prices because of the persian gulf 
crisis are already a reality in eastern europe 
the visions last fall of new freedoms and better standards of 
living as first one former soviet bloc nation and then another 
ousted its communist rulers are increasingly blurred by economic 
difficulties 
and the dramatic increase in oil prices since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait is not likely to help east european countries 
implement planned market reforms 
in contrast however the soviet union the worlds largest oil 
producer stands to gain from the middle east crisis 
we can gain several billion dollars alexei m vasiliev 
deputy director of the african institute in moscow told soviet 
television on thursday this is a breath of fresh air for our 
ruined economy 
the iraqi attack on its oilrich neighbor darkened hopes that 
the difficult transition to a market economy would quickly mean a 
better standard of living 
i would rather have gas prices go up than the cost of bread 
said julia buda a 40yearold budapest translator but i fear 
both along with everything else will be going up 
the soviet union dealt the first blow when earlier this summer 
it cut oil exports to east european countries by up to 30 percent 
according to a cia report soviet oil production has fallen in 
recent months because of aging oil fields and labor and ethnic 
unrest 
the newly democratic governments in eastern europe raised 
gasoline prices by up to 50 percent to try to cut consumption 
citizens resorted to panic buying waiting up to 10 hours to fill 
their tanks 
in czechoslovakia some people have started storing gasoline in 
bath tubs but eastern europe is likely to feel the effects of the 
persian gulf crisis hardest in 1991 beginning next jan 1 the 
countries grouped in the sovietled trading bloc comecon will trade 
in hard currency at world prices 
eastern europe faces the additional burden of the large export 
credits the region granted to iraq for investment projects it also 
faces unpaid bills for weapons and other products sold to iraq 
adherence to the worldwide embargo against baghdad will even 
more complicate the current situation said peter havlik of the 
vienna institute for comparative economic studies 
iraq owes poland for example more than 500 million for 
weapons and other military supplies part of the debt was to be 
paid with oil 
hungary has already begun purchasing oil from libya and algeria 
to offset the soviet reductions of some 30 percent but the 
country strapped with a foreign debt of nearly 20 billion has to 
pay dollars for those imports 
havlik said czechoslovakia east germany and bulgaria were 
likely to be hardest hit because they rely almost exclusively on 
soviet energy imports 
east germany may have an easier time once it unites with west 
germany and can rely on that mighty economy unification of the 
german states is expected to come later this year 
bulgaria recently declared a moratorium on its 103 billion 
foreign debt and has no spare hard currency to buy oil on the world 
market 
romania produces about half the oil it consumes but its economy 
is also in ruins

jordan from baghdad on sunday 
in iraq a government spokesman quoted by baghdad radio said the 
authorities have been instructed to facilitate the travel of the 
arabs and foreign residents in kuwait and other cities of southern 
iraq 
it was not clear whether the spokesman meant foreigners in 
kuwait could leave the country some foreigners were taken from 
kuwait to baghdad in the aftermath of the iraqi invasion 
in london the foreign office identified the slain businessman 
as douglas thomas croskery of northeastern england a source close 
to the family told sky news television that croskery who managed a 
printing company was shot saturday 
britain said croskerys death must be construed as murder 
and called on iraq to punish the culprits whose actions had 
flouted international law the spokesman said 
kuwaits ambassador to britain ghazi alrayes said he was 
told by sources he did not identify that croskery was in a twoor 
threecar convoy detained by iraqi troops 
the second car they stopped and immediately they shot this 
man they asked the others to leave the car and go walking to the 
border which was about three miles away the ambassador told sky 
television news

john norman an accountant from raleigh nc working in 
kuwait said he rode a taxi for five hours across the iraqi desert 
chainsmoking cigarettes and nibbling on hardboiled eggs as the 
cab bounced toward jordan 
at the border checkpoint norman said iraqi soldiers began 
firing their automatic weapons after a broadcast speech by iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
it was an escape norman told the charlotte observer 
saturday it wasnt a walk through i didnt know whether i was 
going to leave iraq alive 
he returned to north carolina on friday ending an odyssey that 
in three days took him by cab private car and jumbo jet from 
baghdad to amman jordan to london and then to raleigh 
norman was scheduled to leave kuwait on a monthlong vacation

their escape

iraqi soldier 
the soldier had tied the husband up raped his wife and then

massacred 173 residents with machine gunfire and machetes 
military officials raised the death toll as families brought in 
more bodies from the stricken villages after the saturday night 
massacre 
it was one of the worst eruptions of violence in this island 
nations escalating ethnic conflict which pits tamil separatists 
against the sinhalesedominated government 
although moslems claim neutrality in the 7yearold civil war 
the government says tamils suspect them of siding with the army 
elsewhere in sri lanka military officials said rebels suspected 
of being tamils ambushed a truck in the northeastern trincomalee 
district at dawn today and killed 15 sinhalese 
on sunday at least 15 tamil tiger rebels four moslems and six

president mikhail s gorbachev has strongly 
denounced estonias rejection of the soviet constitution and said 
the move was intended to legalize the republics withdrawal from 
the soviet union 
such anticonstitutional actions ultimatums and demands have 
no grounds and no future gorbachev said in a statement released 
late sunday by the official news agency tass and published today in 
pravda the communist party newspaper 
last tuesday estonias parliament declared that the 
constitution of the estonia soviet socialist republic was no longer 
effective 
the declaration was part of a package defining the basis for 
estonias independence negotiations with kremlin representatives 
on march 30 1990 estonia declared a transition period toward 
independence gorbachev rejected that move as well as a similar 
step by latvia and an outright declaration of independence by 
lithuania 
however over the following months gorbachev has moved toward 
negotiations with all three baltic states sundays strong language 
broke the pattern 
gorbachev condemned the estonian parliaments move as violating 
united nations principles international standards and the soviet 
constitution on questions of territorial integrity and violation of 
borders 
he said the parliaments main goal appeared to be to legalize 
estonias withdrawal from the union of soviet socialist republics 
bypassing the people of the republic and the existing laws 
the statement ended by inviting estonians to join kremlin 
representatives in working out a new union treaty gorbachev said a 
democratic basis for solving the question of sovereignty will 
be found in this framework 
all three baltic republics have said they will seek full 
independence from the soviet union and do not plan to participate 
in drafting the new union treaty 
gorbachevs statement may have been aimed at supporting 
estonias large russian population which largely opposes the 
republics independence 
russian representatives in the estonian parliament walked out of 
last weeks vote on rejecting the soviet constitution

the french abortion pill has proved to be a safe 
efficient way of terminating early pregnancy but it faces an 
uncertain future abroad 
the drug known as ru486 has been denounced by the powerful 
antiabortion lobby in the united states and has not yet been 
endorsed by the world health organization 
it has been used with 96 percent success by more than 55000 
women most of them in france and a few from 14 other countries 
said catherine euvrard a pharmacist and spokeswoman for 
rousseluclaf the manufacturer 
medical experts say ru486 which must be used in the first 
seven weeks of pregnancy has great potential for reducing illegal 
abortions and complications associated with surgery the drug is 
known as mifepristone and is marketed as mifegyne 
france approved ru486 in 1988 and is the only country in which 
it is available marketing is unlikely to extend beyond britain and 
perhaps a few other northern european countries for at least 
another year 
the drug prevents fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus 
causing miscarriage it is taken with injections of the hormone 
prostaglandin which causes uterine contractions and reduces the 
risk of hemorrhaging 
abortions in france using ru486 cost about 145 but 80 percent 
is reimbursed under frances social insurance system so the actual 
cost to the patient is about 30 
ru486 has a direct toxic poisonous effect on a developing 
baby american antiabortion leader john willke said in an 
interview if it works it kills the baby if the mother changes 
her mind and decides not to abort then weve given a powerful 
poisonous steroid at the time of organogenesis 
willke is president of both the us national right to life 
committee and the international right to life federation based in 
switzerland 
approval by the world health organization a un agency is 
vital to the drugs acceptance in underdeveloped countries because 
of the need for followup care and fear of a black market for the 
job 
the health organization based in geneva notes cautiously that 
ru486 appears to be an effective safe approach to termination of 
early pregnancy and also shows potential for treating endometriosis 
and breast cancer 
who spokesman thomas netter said however that the agency does 
not believe abortion is acceptable as a family planning method 
dr etienneemile beaulieu a consultant to rousseluclaf who 
developed ru486 has claimed who had not approved the drug because 
it feared a cutoff of us funds which make up about onefourth of 
the agencys budget 
washington has withheld 100 million from the un fund for 
population activities in the past five years to protest alleged 
forced abortions in china 
in response netter said we are studying the administration 
of the drug doses timing cost logistics of delivering it to 
local health services the question of followup and how to avoid 
misuse we want to look at every aspect of the implementation of 
ru486 before we can advise on general use of the drug 
he acknowledged ru486 was among the most sensitive matters 
before the agency 
if we approve it or if we dont approve it well be accused 
of murder he said were caught between a rock and a hard 
place 
a major obstacle to selling ru486 in the united states is a 
threatened boycott by antiabortion groups of products made by 
hoechst ag rousseluclafs parent company in west germany 
if ru486 ever reaches the american market we will unleash a 
boycott in the us of any company that sells it any subsidiary of 
rousseluclaf and any subsidiary of hoechst willke said it 
would be a blockbuster boycott involving tens of millions of 
people the company would feel the effects immediately 
on the other hand ms euvrard said the prochoice side has 
told us nicely that they will boycott us if we dont sell ru486 
either way we will have a boycott 
in france this month the association of catholic families 
condemned the vulgar publicity orchestrated anew about the 
pill which it called fatal for babies and in the absence of a 
precise understanding a risk for the mother 
rousseluclaf predicts global acceptance in 15 years 
control of overpopulation is a very big problem in the 
future ms euvrard said the problem of birth control will be 
a top priority even if we have to proceed with abortions its a 
question of life and death for the entire planet

police have arrested about a dozen 
people in what authorities called a probe of alleged corruption in 
the government of former prime minister benazir bhutto according 
to news reports today 
those arrested were stalwarts of ms bhuttos leftofcenter 
pakistan peoples party pakistans president ghulam ishaq khan 
fired ms bhuttos 20monthold government a week ago on charges of 
political ineptitude and corruption 
only five people have been identified although police said at 
least a dozen people were detained over the past two days charges 
ranged from corruption to gunrunning 
supporters of ms bhutto said on condition of anonymity that 
arrest orders were being drawn up for dozens more people most of 
whom live in ms bhuttos power base in the interior of her home 
province of sind 
a spokesman for pakistans interim prime minister ghulam mustafa 
jatoi said none of the arrests was politically motivated jatoi and 
his information minister abida hussein said tribunals to probe 
corruption charges will be established and conducted by supreme 
court justices 
ms bhutto said she will not appear before a tribunal 
established by her successors 
many of those arrested were reportedly close associates of ms 
bhuttos husband asif ali zardari the target of a litany of 
charges of corruption 
the former prime minister repeatedly has denied corruption 
charges against her husband a poloplaying landowner from southern 
sind province 
hussein said tribunals will be set up sometime before the 
planned election date of oct 24 although it is unlikely they will 
have completed their investigations before the polls 
ms bhutto said army troops had surrounded the village of her 
former tourism minister agha tariq it was not clear whether he had 
been arrested 
hussein said supreme court justices appointed to the tribunals 
will decide whether to try only elected officials or whether to 
expand their mandate to include immediate family members of 
politicians 
meanwhile ms bhuttos mother nusrat bhutto left pakistan for 
london on sunday for medical treatment the elder bhutto was a 
senior minister without portfolio in her daughters cabinet which 
put her in charge of the government when ms bhutto was out of the 
country

contributing to rising numbers of teenagers who kill many who are 
poor and use easytoget guns while high on drugs a forensics 
psychologist said 
were about to see an epidemic of juvenile violence such as 
americans have never before witnessed said charles patrick 
ewing who has written a book titled kids who kill 
in the past five years juvenile homicide has increased five 
times faster than homicides committed by adults ewing said 
sunday 
and its not just murder murder is just the awful tip of the 
iceberg he said at a press conference sponsored by the 
university of buffalo at the american psychological associations 
annual meeting here 
the number of juveniles arrested for murder and nonnegligent 
homicide began a steady rise in 1985 according to figures supplied 
to ewing by the fbi in 1989 2208 juveniles nationwide were 
arrested on charges of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter more 
than 25 percent more than the previous year in his study of 225 
juvenile killers over the past 10 years ewing found that more than 
half came from poor backgrounds the majority used guns and 25 
percent had drugs in their systems at the time of the killings 
he pointed to rising poverty figures and drug abuse statistics 
as well as the increasing availability of guns but ewing believes 
escalating child abuse is the most direct influence on the growing 
homcide rate among teens 
kids learn to be violent and they learn from their role 
models especially their parents he said and kids who are 
especially brutalized by their parents learn to be the most brutal 
the mostly likely to kill others 
as social problems like child abuse and drug abuse worsen 
census bureau projections indicate a 7 percent rise in the national 
juvenile population after a 34 percent decline during the previous 
decade he said 
ewing said stricter gun laws are needed and recommended federal 
controls 
richard majors a psychologist who chairs the newly formed 
national council of africanamerican men agreed with ewings 
description of what causes teens to kill 
other factors include the diminishing value placed on family 
church and school while childrens peers have gained importance 
majors said 
he called on large corporations to sponsor mentor programs to 
build urban childrens selfesteem and create hope for an escape 
from poverty

president turgut ozal has basked in the 
limelight since his country which lies on iraqs northern border 
became a key player in the persian gulf crisis 
yet while ozals popularity in the west has never seemed 
greater not all turks are happy with his paramount role in the 
crisis which began when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
as natos frontline state in the region turkey has assumed a 
strategic part in the international campaign to force iraq out of 
its tiny oilrich neighbor and deter president saddam hussein from 
further aggression 
on sunday parliament voted 216151 to authorize the government 
to declare war send troops into combat and allow foreign forces on 
turkish soil but only if the country is attacked the vote was 
seen as a setback for ozal who wanted much broader powers to 
mobilize troops 
there is evidence of some troop movements along both sides of 
turkeys 180milelong border with iraq although ozal and most 
turkish officials say they do not expect an iraqi invasion 
the 64yearold ozal has led turkeys effort to rein in iraq he 
hopes turkeys strong stand against saddam will translate into more 
western support for this country particularly in its bid to join 
the european community 
ozal was elected president in 1989 after six years as prime 
minister although the presidency is normally a ceremonial post 
with little executive power he has remained turkeys most powerful 
politician 
since iraq overran kuwait ozal has clearly run the show he has 
chaired cabinet meetings plotted strategy with military chiefs and 
conducted telephone diplomacy with world leaders 
he has received most of the credit for the tough economic 
sanctions imposed against baghdad including the closure of twin 
oil pipelines across turkey that carried more than half of iraqs 
oil exports 
in his speech announcing the deployment of us troops in saudi 
arabia bush lauded ozal as a staunch friend secretary of 
state james a baker iii traveled to ankara last week to thank ozal 
for the forthright action against iraq and assure him of natos 
support in case of an iraqi attack 
but ozal does not give the impression of a man gearing up for 
war he was in istanbul recently dancing with his wife semra at a 
policemans ball when a reporter entered ozals office at the 
cankaya presidential palace for an interview he found the 
president watching cable news network and chuckling over highlights 
of a brawl between the new york mets and philadelphia phillies 
on sunday as parliament debated the war powers request ozal 
attended a horse race in istanbul 
with tensions rising ozal went on national television last week 
in a skillful performance to explain turkeys position and calm the 
nation 
he went a long way to conveying to the turkish public that the 
world was acting and turkey needed to be part of the world said 
a western diplomat 
turkeys decision to join the economic embargo of iraq was not 
an easy one not only because the country stands to suffer more 
than 2 billion in losses as a result of the un economic 
sanctions against baghdad 
just as importantly ankara has sought friendly relations with 
iraq and other moslem and arab nations of the region while at the 
same time seeking to be part of the west 
ozal a devout moslem stresses turkey has not upset its 
delicate balance between europe and asia we wear two hats as a 
modern nation allied with the west and as a member of the islamic 
bloc he said saturday we want to continue this 
until recently turkey felt it was losing importance in the eyes 
of the west following the end of the cold war but ozal hopes the 
current spotlight on turkey will give the country renewed status 
within the west 
this crisis has highlighted turkeys importance in the middle 
east as a stable and modern country he said 
ozals election by parliament was boycotted by opposition 
parties which accused him of nepotism corruption and 
highspending during his term as premier 
now the opposition accuses him of exceeding the powers of the 
presidency and violating the constitution during a heated 
parliamentary debate sunday chief opposition leader erdal inonu 
compared ozal to a dictator 
others say strong leadership is just what is needed columnist 
ilnur cevik wrote in sundays english language turkish daily news 
as we sail though the current crisis we are better off having an 
able captain than being run aground by someone else

prime minister toshiki kaifu postponed a trip to 
the middle east because he is needed in tokyo to decide japans 
policy on supporting the international force arrayed against iraq 
officials said today 
makoto watanabe director of the foreign ministrys middle east 
affairs bureau appeared to leave open the possibility that japan 
would consider military or militaryrelated aid even while 
observing the nowar clause in the japanese constitution 
the constitution imposed by usled occupation authorities 
after world war ii is interpreted as limiting japans military 
forces strictly to selfdefense and forbidding use of japanese 
troops abroad 
a decision to send troops openly to the persian gulf would raise 
a tremendous controversy in japan though indirect assistance in 
support of the multinational military force might be acceptable to 
the public 
kaifu had been scheduled to depart wednesday on a 13day trip to 
saudi arabia egypt turkey oman and jordan all of which are 
embroiled in the iraqi crisis he would have been the first outside 
head of government to venture into the region since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
scheduled long in advance the trip had been planned as a 
general effort to improve relations with countries in the region 
that supplies 70 percent of japans oil 
the decision to postpone was announced this morning after 
meetings during the weekend among kaifu and top cabinet officials 
the situation has changed the purpose of the trip was forced 
to change and since it has become a hairtrigger crisis we made 
that decision kaifu said in brief comments to reporters 
government spokesman misoji sakamoto the chief cabinet 
secretary said it was necessary for the prime minister to stay 
in tokyo and grasp all the reins of government in order to decide a 
concrete policy as soon as possible 
kaifu hopes to reschedule the trip by early october meanwhile 
foreign minister taro nakayama will visit the same countries to get 
further information on how japan may help watanabe told foreign 
journalists 
asked repeatedly if japan ruled out sending military aid 
watanabe said several times we will examine all possible 
measures while observing the provisions of the constitution 
he said japan was determined to decide on concrete measures 
to assist the international force which already includes us 
egyptian british and french forces 
japan has banned all trade with iraq and kuwait which were 
supplying 112 percent of japans oil in the first half of 1990 
the decision has not caused fuel prices to rise in japan but 
economic worries have knocked tokyo stocks off a cliff the closely 
watched nikkei index of 225 shares has declined 1512 percent since 
aug 2 closing today at 2617643 
todays big drop of 422 percent came on extremely thin trading 
as this week is japans traditional midsummer holiday 
government offices will start energyconservation measures such 
as reducing the use of air conditioning and lighting and encourage 
the private sector to do the same kyodo news service quoted 
officials at the ministry of international trade and industry as 
saying 
the iraqkuwait crisis marks the second time in three years that 
the middle east has thrown japans nonmilitary postureinto an 
uncomfortable light it makes japan vulnerable to accusations of 
taking a free ride when others have to risk manpower money and 
prestige to ensure the flow of oil from the middle east 
in 1987 the attacks on oil tankers by both sides in the 
iraniraq war caused some to urge japan to send at least 
minesweepers to the gulf but the government of prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone decided the constitution would bar sending 
military forces 
later japan took a number of supportive steps it paid to 
install advanced navigational equipment in the gulf extended loans 
and a credit line to jordan and increased its payments to support 
us troops based in japan 
japanese news reports said washington had encouraged kaifu to go 
on the planned mideast trip neither the foreign ministry nor the 
us embassy would deny the reports 
the reports said us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who 
met kaifu in tokyo on sunday had said the united states supported 
the trip

a surrogate mother carrying a couples 
testtube baby says she wants to keep it because the biological 
parents havent lived up to their end of the deal and are therefore 
unfit 
this is the first case that im aware of where the surrogate 
is biologically a stranger and is seeking custodial rights said 
christian van deusen the couples lawyer 
anna johnson 29 intends to sue the couple identified only as 
mark and chris for custody child support and damages for 
emotional distress she said she would file the suit today in 
superior court 
ms johnson signed a 10000 contract to have the couples 
embryo implanted and bear the child to term she was hired because

19 one survived 
the highly publicized baby m dispute four years ago in new 
jersey centered on a child conceived with a surrogate mothers egg 
and the sperm of a man hiring the surrogate the mans wife had no 
biological ties to the child 
like mary beth whitehead the surrogate mother in the baby m 
case ms johnson said she saw the surrogate contract as a 
financial opportunity 
i thought i could save up some money get a car and put 
myself through graduate nursing school she said 
her lawsuit will contend the couple lost interest in her 
pregnancy gave her no emotional support were late with her 
monthly payments and failed to buy her a life insurance policy the 
contract required 
they never held up their end of the deal she said they 
were showing their irresponsibility and the fact that they would 
not be attentive parents to me this is fetal neglect 
van deusen denied the allegations 
every payment that she was due was paid on time and in fact 
two major payments were made early van deusen said 
an insurance policy was arranged through an agent but ms 
johnson never filled out the application despite repeated requests 
he said 
the couple contend ms johnson broke the contracts

for more than a decade rose hoffman nosed 
around biker bars braved threats and talked to virtually everyone 
she met in an effort to find her son 
her quest ended this month when three men were convicted of 
sodomizing and murdering 20yearold gus hoffman jr and stealing 
his motorcycle 
his mothers ordeal began in 1978 when the young man didnt 
return to his san jose home the night of july 4 
were a very close family and when your son doesnt come home 
all night you right then know something is definitely wrong 
mrs hoffman said i would brag he was home every night and i 
would say at least i know where he is 
hoffman was last seen on his rebuilt harleydavidson motorcycle 
at a san jose intersection witnesses said he was being chased by 
two other motorcycles and a car filled with people neither his 
body nor the motorcycle was ever found 
my son was a very gullible young kid he helped a lot of 
people in his life he had a heart of gold mrs hoffman said 
the bike was the reason he was killed he spent almost all his 
money on that bike he only had it running for three weeks and 
then he was missing 
immediately after their sons disappearance the hoffmans hired 
private investigators sent out fliers and offered rewards mrs 
hoffman now 55 began checking out biker bars and other places 
zfor information 
i didnt care if i went into a grocery store or liquor store 
i talked to people she said i just would not give up im 
very very persistent he was my son what would you do for 
your son 
she said she was threatened and told to stop asking questions 
but it didnt bother me she said adding that there are a 
lot of good bikers out there 
the case had been assigned as well to police who didnt find 
much but mrs hoffman kept dogging them to pursue the case on her 
own she learned that a man named michael lee stevenson might have 
had something to do with her sons disappearance 
in 1987 the san jose police departments homicide chief in an 
attempt to close the books on old cases by assigning them to night 
detectives gave the case to sgts jack baxter and jeff ouimet 
they took it from there 
we knew we had leads and witnesses to talk to which led us to 
other witnesses ouimet said there was a ray of hope there 
which felt pretty good 
a key prosecution witness turned up the exwife of suspect 
richard morris dollar who said she witnessed the attack 
deputy district attorney don shearer said the woman whose name 
was withheld had kept silent for years for fear of retribution 
from stevenson and the legal system 
but stevenson in whose garage the assault is believed to have 
occurred was shot to death in 1986 by an elderly man after trying 
to shake down the mans son shearer said 
in 1988 dollar and two other alleged motorcycle gang members 
were arrested in gus hoffmans slaying 
dollar 34 michael allen hodges 38 and john michael stelle 
49 face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole at 
sentencing oct 17 
hodges attorney francis cavagnaro said he will seek a new 
trial

conviction but we did what we could to get justice and our 
prayers were answered

thousands of west bank palestinians rallied 
today in support of iraqi president saddam hussein chanting we 
are with you until victory and urging him to attack israel with 
chemical weapons 
the israeli government meanwhile blasted saddams attempt to 
link an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait with an israeli pullout from 
the occupied territories as cheap propaganda 
but analysts warned that saddams proposal could lead to more 
violence in the 32month palestinian uprising against israel 
on sunday saddam said he would pull out of kuwait if israel 
withdrew from the west bank and gaza strip and a syria withdrew 
from lebanon where it maintains 40000 troops 
president bush vacationing in kennebunkport maine rejected 
saddams proposal i didnt see anything pleasing in there at 
all bush said 
the proposal was saddams third attempt in five days to involve 
israel in the persian gulf crisis in a bid for grassroots support 
from arab countries saddam invaded kuwait on aug 2 and 
subsequently annexed the emirate 
saddams proposal drew praise from palestinians long frustrated 
by failed peace attempts 
in nablus the west banks largest city at least 2000 people 
marched through the winding alleys of the old marketplace waving 
iraqi flags and carried postersized pictures of saddam and 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat who has 
allied himself with iraq 
saddam we are with you till victory they chanted 
get rid of the collaborators working with the crusaders 
shouted others 
many arabs perceive support for iraq as part of a holy war 
against western influence in the middle east they compare the us 
forces in the persian gulf to the crusaders of the middle ages 
in nablus israeli troops fired tear gas at the marchers but 
there were no reports of injuries 
in the west bank town of jenin about 1000 palestinians 
participated in a prosaddam march shouting saddam you hero 
attack israel with chemical weapons 
another march was reported in the balata refugee camp near 
nablus where about 300 masked activists carried posters of saddam 
and iraqi flags 
the marches were the most dramatic signs yet of palestinian 
support for saddam 
palestinian observers said such support for an arab leader has 
not been seen in the occupied territories since mass demonstrations 
in 1970 to hail egypts hardline president gamal abdel nasser 
they noted that since arafat had linked his fate so closely to 
that of saddam a defeat of iraq in the current crisis would mean a 
serious setback for the palestinian cause 
in several cities masked activists used loudspeakers to shout 
slogans in support of iraq calling for a war against reactionary 
forces and all the leaders who support the american colonialist 
position 
in gaza the moslem fundamentalist hamas group issued a sharply 
worded leaflet calling on saddam to attack the heart of tel aviv 
if iraq is attacked by western crusaders 
the leaflet also called on palestinians to prepare themselves 
for a long and tough holy war against israel and its western 
allies and urged the arab countries to attack american and other 
western interests in the arab world 
sunday the military refused to comment on foreign reports that 
israel placed its air force on alert and moved antiaircraft 
missiles to the jordanian border following threats from iraq to use 
chemical weapons against it 
israeli stores have reported a huge increase in purchases of gas 
masks

iraqs last major oil export outlet a 
pipeline across the arabian peninsula is effectively closed and an 
iraqi tanker was turned away when it tried to load at the 
pipelines terminal diplomatic sources said today 
the sources at the terminal at yanbu saudi arabia said the 
tanker alqaddisiyah arrived sunday evening and just tried to get 
alongside the jetty they spoke on condition of anonymity 
tugs that are necessary to help the ships dock did not aid the 
tanker and the vessel sailed away today without taking on oil the 
sources said pumping through the pipeline also ceased they said 
saudi officials refused to comment the kingdom has not said 
publicly it would block the oil flow from the pipeline 
but the diplomatic sources said there was no doubt saudi 
authorities both turned away the tanker and declared the pipeline 
shut 
about 15 million gallons of iraqi crude had been passing 
through the pipeline daily until a boycott by most countries of 
iraqi oil forced baghdad to reduce the flow last week 
the other main outlets for iraqi crude had been two pipelines 
through turkey to the mediterranean those lines are no longer in 
operation 
iraq depends on oil revenue as its main source of income its 
daily opec production quota is 314 million barrels a day but 
punitive actions taken since its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 have 
virtually eliminated the market for iraqi oil 
the giant saudi aramco company operates both the saudi pipeline 
and the terminal 
the iraqis had continued to pump oil through the pipeline at a 
reduced rate because the tanks at the terminal were half full oil 
executives speaking anonymously said the tanks are now full at 
about 10 million barrels 
during the iraniraq war iraq also trucked oil through jordan 
to the red sea port of aqaba jordan has avoided saying anything 
about allowing iraqi oil transports other than to say it would 
abide in principle with a un security council resolution ordering 
an embargo on iraqi goods 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said the united states 
would intercept iraqi oil shipments to ensure full implementation 
of un security council embargo 
there are at least nine us warships and two aircraft carriers 
in the persian gulf region there are also warships from britain 
france and the soviet union in the area to help enforce the un 
sanctions 
the united states has not been using the word blockade but baker 
said there was legal basis to enforce the sanctions 
the pipeline through saudi arabia is capable of pumping 15 
million barrels of oil daily and had been pumping at about 900000 
daily after the un sanctions were approved aug 6 the iraqis 
slowed pumping to 400000 barrels per day according to some 
sources others said it had been as low as 200000 barrels per day 
customers of iraqi oil stopped picking up their imports 
immediately after the un resolution was passed two tankers were 
scheduled to turn up at the yanbu terminal after the resolution but 
did not show up one was norwegian the other indian

two animal rights activists say they were 
struck repeatedly by navy boats as they tried to block explosives 
tests that they say are harmful to dolphins 
the navy conceded the men could have been hit during the protest 
friday near the dry tortugas islands but said they were not hit 
repeatedly and not on purpose 
russ rector who joined richard obarry former trainer of the 
television dolphin flipper in the protest charged the incident 
was no accident 
they used boats as weapons rector said they ran right 
over me i dove down and by the grace of god im not chewed up by 
propellers 
obarry 50 suffered a concussion and bruises according to a 
medical report from florida keys memorial hospital and rector 
suffered a back injury and bruises 
apparently they were pursued and one of the boats could have 
hit them said dan probert who is overseeing the navy trials of 
the explosives 
probert said he spoke with the fbi on saturday about the 
incident 
dolphin activists have demanded cancellation of the navy tests 
because of dolphin sightings in the area fishermen want the tests 
suspended because the region is home to several seafood varieties 
and environmentalists are concerned about possible damage to nearby 
coral reefs 
obarry and rector 42 were dropped from a sea plane into the 
test zone 85 miles northwest of key west in the gulf of mexico 
the pair were swimming when they saw boats approach said 
lincoln obarry richards son and vice president of an activist 
group called the dolphin project 
according to rector the two men were run over by a boat about 
60 feet long and then repeatedly hit by other smaller boats 
obarry said he was hit in the head and jabbed in the face with an 
aluminum pole 
probert described the scene differently 
we have no indication of boats running over them repeatedly 
so far as we know obarry and rector were swimming around boats 
trying to get to the target buoy he said as the boat was 
backing away it appears obarry was not looking at the boat 
they just literally ran into each other 
the two activists didnt know at the time that the navys 
explosives test had been completed 45 minutes before the incident 
lincoln obarry said 
the two men were pulled from the water by the coast guard and 
taken to the hospital in key west on stretchers

at a cross ringed with barbed wire germans 
from east and west paid solemn tribute today to the victims of the 
berlin wall on the 29th anniversary of its construction 
eighty east germans died trying to escape across the 
nowcrumbling barrier that began separating the city on aug 13 
1961 
the bestknown of them is peter fechter an 18yearold east 
berlin worker cut down by communist border guards bullets in 1962 
fechter lay bleeding to death for nearly an hour before he was 
hauled away 
here where peter fechter died we can feel how much suffering 
the wall caused said east berlin mayor tino schwierzina during 
the ceremony this morning 
schwierzina stood beside the cross erected as a memorial to 
fechter in west berlin it is located near where fechter lay dying 
and calling out help me 
a weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony on aug 
17 1962 is tacked to the dark wood 
about 300 people most of them germans gathered for the brief 
service under a brilliant sun more than a dozen large flower 
arrangements were placed before the cross 
although the wall has disappeared there windows in buildings on 
the eastern side still have the bars that kept people from jumping 
to freedom 
in years past the communist east germans marked the walls 
anniversary with bombastic military parades that drew criticism 
from the western allies 
with the wall vanishing and germans rushing to unification 
todays service was the first joint memorial officially linking 
both sides 
west berlin officials promised that part of the berlin wall will 
be kept intact as a reminder to future generations 
the wall cannot disappear completely said city councilor 
erich paetzold he said a remainder will be preserved so that we 
dont forget what happened here so that no one forgets what 
happened here 
the open wound is closing but a scar will stay forever 
paetzold added 
paetzold and the other officials later talked quietly with 
fechters sister ruth who had taken part in the ceremony 
despite the solemn commemoration of the walls victims this 
years anniversary will have an air of celebration tonight the 
rolling stones are planning a concert in an outdoor sports stadium 
in east berlin and the japanese symphony orchestra saito kinen 
conducted by seiji ozawa is to play what was billed as the 
berlin wall memorial concert 
twentynine years ago east german military and paramilitary 
units stunned the world by hastily erecting the foundations for the 
ugly concrete barrier 
the wall was built to halt the exodus of east germans to the 
west more than 25 million east germans fled to the west from 1949 
until the wall went up 
the barrier was watched over by armed guards with 
shoottokill orders 
on nov 9 1989 east germanys communist government opened the 
wall in a frantic bid to retain power and halt a renewed exodus of 
200000 people

korologos a veteran washington lobbyist and former white house 
aide is active only on the fringes of the souter nomination 
lending his counsel when called upon 
but he has been in the thick of the battle for confirmation of 
several current justices as well as in the bruising and 
unsuccessful 1987 fight to win senate approval for robert h bork 
in the past two decades he estimates he has helped steer 
between 200 and 300 ambassadors judges and other government 
officials through confirmation ranging from two vice presidents to 
people nobody ever heard of 
you tell them the hearing process is not fair he said in an 
interview in the ornate reception room just off the senate floor 
it is not judicial it is not done on a level playing field the 
senators even sit higher than you do 
you say the constitution stops at the hearing room door he 
said hearsay evidence is admissible rumors are admissible 
there is no subject on earth to which a senator might not wish to 
address himself whether its about roe vs wade or the designated 
hitter 
so get ready expect the unexpected 
korologos 57 a former salt lake city political reporter came 
to washington as an aide to sen wallace bennett rutah and 
became an assistant to presidents nixon and ford he now is 
president of the washington lobbying firm of timmons and co and 
offers his help for nominees as a free service 
the first step he said is to sit down with the nominee and ask 
some questions such as do they know what they are getting 
into 
most do not said korologos chances are he has never gone 
through a senate confirmation 
souter has been through the mill once before when he was 
confirmed as a member of the 1st us circuit court of appeals but 
such hearings usually are perfunctory 
this time around is sure to take longer the senate judiciary 
committee says it will open hearings on sept 13 on souters 
nomination to succeed retired justice william j brennan jr 
korologos said one of his next steps is to study the voluminous 
financial disclosure and other papers that a nominee must fill out 
to see if theres anything that telegraphs whats going to be 
coming at you 
he asks the nominee if there is anything in his background that 
would be embarrassing to him or the president 
i am not asking you to tell me he says i am asking you 
to get an answer in your head because those guys on the hill are 
going to find it out 
next come courtesy calls on members of the senate judiciary 
committee and other senators with key roles in the confirmation 
process an aide tags along taking notes on what questions the 
senators ask 
the next step is known as the murder board 
you ge a bunch of people to sit around a table and fire the 
rottenest worst questions you can possibly think of at these 
guys korologos said 
he usually starts out by asking mr jones when did you first 
find out the young lady in question was only 15 years old 
everybody laughs and i make the point that it could be that 
bad said korologos 
you help him with answers he said you dont try to 
insert anything into his principles but if he bobs and weaves and 
ducks you say to him thats unacceptable youve got to get a 
better answer than that 
soon though hes ready and the questions from the senators 
arent half as bad as the ones you asked him 
at least not usually korologos said occasionally they are 
worse

cutting a barbed wire fence and trying to march toward the 
demilitarized zone separating the two koreas 
north open the border they shouted accusing pyongyang 
authorities of blocking reunions with their families who live in

time was being a lifeguard was a dream job 
sitting atop a white tower a bronzed adonis for the bikiniclad 
teenage girls to admire 
these days its hard to find people interested in the job 
because of chronically low wages and costly and more rigorous 
certification lessons potential candidates especially in the 
northeast are drawn to easier better paying jobs like flipping 
burgers in fastfood restaurants 
some beaches and pools in new england and the midatlantic 
states have closed for lack of lifeguards according to the us 
lifesaving association 
not too long ago we had waiting lists of applicants said 
tim hall lifeguard coordinator for the maine bureau of parks and 
recreation 
now we have to go out and recruit them the booming economy of 
the late 80s made summer jobs more available to college students 
work as chambermaids waitresses and construction workers paid 
more 
those who do sign up from california to florida are frequently 
much younger than in years past and not always as conscientious 
longtime lifeguards said 
anyone can put on an orange suit but these young guys dont 
know what to look for said rian wilkinson a veteran lifeguard 
from newport ri they just sit on the stands and there arent 
any older guys around to keep them from goofing off 
part of the shortage stems from tougher and more expensive 
training in 1982 the red cross introduced a national lifeguard 
certification program to replace the simpler lifesaving courses 
designed for the general public 
now kids have to pay 75 or 80 for certification when it used 
to be free and so theyd rather work somewhere else said joe 
pecoraro president of the us lifeguard association and general 
supervisor of beaches and pools for chicago 
it used to a be a glamour position said donald cotter 
recreation director in foxboro who began recruiting lifeguards in 
january and did not sign up his last one until a week before the 
season opened young kids just dont want to do the training 
many in the profession say the tougher requirements are part of 
a plan to ensure that lifeguards are better trained and more 
professional 
what we call the beach mystique is still there said hall 
but the lifeguards image has basically changed and thats good 
were not looking for people who want to smear suntan lotion on 
their bodies and look for women were looking for people who are 
interested in someday being policemen firemen paramedics wholl 
see lifeguarding as an emergency service provider 
john crisp 42 assistant chief for lifeguards in the daytona 
beach fla area said volusia county takes lifeguards at 16 in 
the hope they stick with us through high school and college and 
turn into a real professional 
when i first came on here in 1972 it was party time 
something to do to kill a few years said crisp but now were 
trying for a more professional image

thousands of protesters angered by a 
monthlong mohawk blockade of a major commuter bridge hurled 
bottles and rocks at police who responded with tear gas 
at least 75 people including 16 police officers were injured 
but none of the injuries were serious police said eighteen people 
were briefly arrested following the fourhour melee late sunday at 
mercier bridge which connects montreal with its suburbs 
about 10000 people participated in the demonstration at its 
peak 
earlier in the day an agreement was signed between the indians 
and the federal and provincial governments to start negotiations to 
bring down the mohawk barricades 
the indians are blocking the bridge to protest plans to expand a 
golf course on what they claim is sacred tribal land 
today broken bottles bricks rocks the size of grapefruit and 
tear gas canisters littered the area three large plate glass 
windows in the front of a nearby furniture store were smashed 
quebec native affairs minister john ciaccia said the talks were 
expected to start within two days after a team of 24 international 
observers chosen by the international federation of human rights 
arrives 
the observers will remain on the scene until the mohawks remove 
their barricades and all police forces are withdrawn 
sundays ceremony also attended by federal indian affairs 
minister tom siddon was held in the pine forest behind mohawk 
barricades in oka 
the mohawks signed the agreement after provincial and federal 
government officials agreed to allow international observers they 
will verify the free flow of food and supplies through the mohawk 
barricades and to permit unimpeded access for mohawk advisers 
mohawk negotiator ellen gabriel said the indians would not 
remove their barricades in oka and at the kahnawake reserve south 
of montreal where a main commuter bridge has been blocked unless 
there is a final agreement 
a dispute over town plans to expand a golf course on ancestral 
land claimed by the mohawks led to a july 11 gunbattle between 
indians and quebec police at oka 18 miles west of montreal and 
the two sides have faced each other across barricades since then 
an officer was shot to death in the clash that began when police 
tried to storm a barricade put up by the mohawks responsibility in 
the death has not been established 
residents of chateauguay and other southern suburbs across the 
st lawrence river from montreal have been demonstrating and 
blocking roads in frustration at the mohawks blockade of the 
mercier bridge which has forced them to take long detours to reach 
the city 
on sunday about 100 local residents blocked a drawbridge with 
vehicles stopping boat traffic for several hours on the st 
lawrency seaway 
the demonstrators were allowed to occupy the bridge until after 
the late afternoon announcement about the agreement in oka 
about 100 riot police then moved in to clear them out and one 
officer received a cut to the head in a scuffle with demonstrators 
two protesters were arrested

giant 2000yearold 
sequoias were treated with fire retardant to protect them against 
flames advancing today through the majestic forest that 
photographer ansel adams captured on film 
in oregon 1200 army soldiers were being sent to take up 
firefighting positions fires also burned in alaska washington 
idaho and utah 
drought and the threat of more lightning in california worried 
fire officials after more than 200000 acres burned statewide in 
the past week 
more lightning means more fires said forestry department 
spokesman chris parker what were seeing is the culmination of 
four years drought 
yosemite was declared off limits to tourists friday by sunday 
more than 2200 firefighters were battling two fires in the park 
that have burned 17000 acres the flames were about 10 miles from 
landmarks like el capitan half dome and yosemite falls and within 
two miles of a stand of giant sequoias 
workers tried to protect the trees by clearing debris and 
undergrowth from around their trunks and applying a chemical fire 
retardant 
seventyfive people fled a park settlement sunday to escape the 
one of the fires 
fires have burned 127 structures since last week in california 
ranging from outbuildings to homes sixtysix were in foresta near 
yosemite the park which usually gets 25000 weekend visitors was 
empty of tourists 
theres a degree of peacefulness if you are not caught up in 
the frantic business of firefighting said jeff nicholas curator 
of yosemites ansel adams photo gallery 
more than 10 million in property has been destroyed by the 
fires yosemite fire officials said sunday the cost of fighting 
the fire had passed 15 million sunday evening 
the parks chief naturalist len mckenzie called the fires 
catastrophic and blamed past park management for the size and 
intensity of the blazes by suppressing all wildfires in the 
forest he said a huge buildup of dead wood dry grass and other 
fuel built up 
we overprotected the forest he said 
thunderstorms like those that brought 24000 recorded lightning 
strikes last week to california were expected to return by tuesday 
the state has had belowaverage precipitation since the mid1980s 
in tehama county about 200 miles north of yosemite two blazes 
have charred a combined 130000 acres of forest in sequoia 
national forest about 100 miles south of yosemite a fire had 
burned more than 24000 acres 
the 200000acre figure for the state is probably pretty 
conservative said forestry department spokeswoman karen terrill 
what i hear the experts saying is that this could get to be much 
much worse 
more than 12000 firefighters were on duty around the state 
most of them battling 14 major fires 
more than 6000 people worked sunday to corral five lightning 
fires that have burned more than 120000 acres of eastern oregon 
said us forest service spokesman jim guest about 100 soldiers 
from fort lewis wash were sent to oregon on sunday a total of 
1100 more were to follow today after some quick training 
a mule deer and its fawn returned to a charred area after 
surviving the largest of the oregon fires its nice to see the 
animals come back said risa langenavarro a forest service 
field observer 
oregons two largest fires measuring 73700 acres and 18925 
acres were expected to be encircled by fire lines today a third 
was surrounded late sunday and firefighters reported making headway 
in trying to control the two others 
several smaller lightningsparked fires kept washington 
firefighters busy a rash of forest and range fires that broke out 
in idaho last week were brought under control sunday 
the boise interagency fire center in idaho which coordinates 
the fighting of forest fires around the country said nearly 20000 
firefighters were at work sunday on fires covering 856000 acres 
more than half of that in alaska 
the weather cooperated with firefighters battling blazes 
throughout utah as rain and higher humidity helped crews contain 
the states two biggest blazes and slow the spread of several 
others

an iraqi oil tanker steamed away empty from a loading terminal 
today after saudi arabia refused to let it dock diplomatic sources 
said iraqi president saddam hussein urged his countrymen to be 
frugal in anticipation of a drawnout conflict 
saddam in an apparent attempt to change the focus of debate on 
the persian gulf crisis offered sunday to pull out his troops from 
kuwait if israel withdraws from the occupied territories the 
united states and israel rejected the idea but thousands of 
palestinians rallied to support saddam 
the iraqi leader tested the strength of worldwide sanctions by 
sending a tanker to a red sea terminal sunday to take on oil from 
an iraqi pipeline 
sources at the terminal at yanbu saudi arabia said the tanker 
alqaddisiyah was unable to gain entry because tugs necessary to 
help ships dock did not appear the same sources said that pumping 
through the pipeline had ceased 
the saudi pipeline was iraqs last major operating oil export 
outlet following the closure of two pipelines through turkey last 
week in retaliation for the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
saddams army took over the wealthy sheikdom aug 2 in a dispute 
over oil land and money then began massing along the border of 
saudi arabia which has the worlds largest oil reserves 
western nations quickly boycotted iraqi goods including the 
vital oil and some arab nations last week joined the sanctions 
american and arab soldiers were deployed to defend saudi arabia 
while european canadian and australian warships headed to the 
persian gulf to join a us flotilla 
also iraqi troops were accused of fatally shooting a british 
businessman trying to flee kuwait the first report of a foreigner 
dying in the invasion 
iraqi troops refused to allow a british diplomat to recover the 
body the the foreign office said today 
saddam in a statement read on iraqi television called sunday 
for all cases of occupation and those cases that have been 
portrayed as occupation to be resolved simultaneously under the 
same principles and guidelines 
he said israel must leave the west bank and gaza strip and syria 
must withdraw from lebanon if iraq is to leave kuwait israel took 
the territories from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
saddam also demanded the withdrawal of us troops from saudi 
arabia and the end to economic sanctions against his country 
the iraqi leader warned if the spark of war is started many 
will be burned 
israel dismissed saddams proposal as cheap propaganda and 
president bush also rejected it i didnt see anything 
pleasing in there at all said bush on vacation in 
kennebunkport maine 
saddams proposal appeared aimed at broadening the debate over 
his invasion of kuwait into a discussion of a host of middle east 
problems some of which remain unresolved after decades of talks 
and war 
palestinian leaders in the israelioccupied territories welcomed 
saddams proposal an estimated 10000 palestinians staged a noisy 
demonstration of support for iraq at a refugee camp in southern 
lebanon chanting death to america the demonstrators hanged 
effigies of bush and saudi king fahd 
but hussein musawi leader of a branch of the proiranian 
hezbollah movement criticized palestinians for supporting saddam 
saddam is a satan not a moslem leader musawi said the 
one who waged war against the islamic republic iran and syria and 
who unleashed chemical weapons against the kurds is not a hero but 
a satan 
there were signs the iraqis are preparing for a long siege one 
day after warning that black marketeers in iraq would be executed 
saddam urged iraqi women to cut meat and bread consumption in half 
and be frugal with clothing 
what is demanded is that no one stockpile food supplies 
saddam said stockpiles will bring about shortages 
the middle east economic survey a respected weekly newsletter 
reported today that despite baghdads claims to the contrary the 
iraqi economy is weak and illprepared to withstand an economic 
blockade 
a un embargo on trade has blocked outgoing oil iraqs main 
export and incoming shipments of food military parts and 
essential goods however the embargo may allow humanitarian 
shipments of food 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
would honor a request by the ousted kuwaiti government to intercept 
iraqi oil shipments 
lets not use the word blockade baker told abctv lets 
just say we have the legal basis for interdicting these things 
us and allied warships are poised to meet iraqi tankers coming 
from the persian gulf red sea or mediterranean sea iraq is 
heavily dependent on oil exports to buy food and supplies for its 
17 million people 
a french warship sailed through the suez canal today en route to 
join three french naval units in the gulf the dutch government 
announced it was dispatching two warships 
iraq is virtually encircled on the ground with the possible 
exception of jordan where king hussein said he is working for an 
arab solution 
in iraqs northern neighbor turkey the parliament on sunday 
gave the government permission to declare war and send troops into 
combat if turkey is attacked 
iraqi information minister nusayyif jasim today denied 
allegations that iraq was planning an attack on turkey and said 
such assertions were part of the international conspiracy against 
iraq 
the united states has committed 50000 troops to the crisis and 
about 3000 elite egyptian forces had arrived by sunday the 
vanguard of 10000strong arab league force morocco and syria are

aboard the uss la salle flagship of the joint task force middle 
east commander rear adm william m fogarty said us troops are 
prepared to defend themselves in case of an iraqi chemical weapons

ourselves

between the two countries to ease border tensions 
defense officials said indian troops used heavy artillery 
antitank guns and mortars in an attempt to capture an outpost on

under briefing rules we have not attacked we have not used any 
artillery we have not suffered any casualties 
skirmishes and small arms fire are frequent along the ceasefire 
line but sundays assault marked the first time that heavy 
artillery has been used the defense official said 
the defense ministry said indias attack had been reported to 
un military observers in india and pakistan and that defense 
measures had been intensified 
the official said the use of heavy artillery and mortars was an 
attempt to escalate the situation along the line of control to try 
to divert world attention from a moslem secessionist movement in 
indianheld kashmir the agency said 
the uprising which has claimed more than 950 lives since late 
january has heightened already uneasy tensions between 
predominantly hindu india and moslem pakistan which were created 
along religious lines in the 1947 partition of the subcontinent 
the two countries on saturday completed the second round of 
talks aimed at a series of confidencebuilding measures to 
relieve tensions

43yearold dispute over kashmir a former princely state claimed 
by both 
india and pakistan amassed their armies along the ceasefire 
line drawn by wars in 1948 and 1965 indian prime minister vp 
singh asked his countrymen to psychologically prepare for war 
the crisis was averted largely due to diplomatic pressure by the 
united states and the soviet union 
india accuses pakistan of arming training and harboring moslem 
militayts in india kashmir a charge that islamabad denies 
pakistan contends india has unleased brutal force to crush an

potato ice cream may be a good concept 
but it isnt likely to make any flavorofthemonth lists 
david lee recently won high praise for his development of potato 
ice cream as part of his studies for a bachelors degree in applied 
science 
but lee says the commendation he received was more for the way 
he replaced sugar in ice cream with potatoes rather than for the 
flavor itself 
he said potatoes gave ice cream a flourlike taste which he 
tried to counter by adding fruit pulp 
that move was successful in small doses but lee said a 
53gallon batch he produced went down like the proverbial lead 
balloon

warplanes 
from the carrier uss independence have been conducting fighter 
missions over the persian gulf nightly since a few days after 
iraqs takeover of kuwait 
the independence accompanied by six ships reached the area 
aug 5 three days after the invasion after breaking off drills at 
diego garcia 2500 miles south 
before visiting the independence a us department of defense 
regional media pool was aboard the uss la salle flagship of the 
joint task force middle east in the gulf 
rear adm william m fogarty commander of us forces in the 
gulf said in a briefing that us forces rushed to the region 
since the invasion are equipped with protective suits masks and 
antidotes in case of an iraqi chemical weapons attack 
asked if he was worried about chemical weapons fogarty said 
the fact that they do have chemical weapons is disturbing to 
everybody throughout the world but we are a trained force if they 
happen to employ them 
on the independence rear adm jerry l unruh commander of 
battle group delta said the battle groups ships also were 
equipped to deal with a chemical attack but that chances of such 
an attack were very very slim 
fogarty described the persian gulf as a tough environment 
because of the high heat and humidity especially in the summer 
but but said our forces have met this challenge 
he said he would not characterize the iraqi air force as weak 
but added ill tell you were better that i know 
capt robert ellis commander of the independence said his crew 
averaged 1820 years old and most were on their first deployment 
there are 5000 people on board the independence 
for a lot of young people this is their first time away from 
home and they are facing these unknowns for the first time he 
said 
capt jay b yakeley iii commander of navy air wing 14 aboard 
the independence said his pilots had had no close encounters 
and had not sighted any iraqi aircraft 
many of them are combattested against iran we know that we 
know the type of training they have they probably have some real 
good pilots and some that are not so good 
in interviews several pilots said they were aware that iraqi 
president saddam husseins air force had many pilots with recent 
combat experience in the 198088 iraniraq war and said they were 
somewhat familiar with the frenchbuilt f1 mirages flown by iraq 
but they said they were more concerned about the threat of 
surfacetoair missles than engaging in aerial combat with the 
iraqis 
the pilots expressed confidence that despite their own lack of 
combat experience their training and superiority of us aircraft 
gave them confidence 
we all feel as if were ready for it said one 23yearold 
ensign who flies the f18 
any fighter pilot here feels that he can carry out his mission 
better than any third world nation pilot said another ensign 
asked whether american pilots were eager to get into a fight he 
said were not warmongers out here but were ready for action 
and we want to put our training to good use 
fogarty who is in overall command of the us forces in the 
gulf and the north arabian and red seas answers to gen h norman 
schwarzkopf iii commander in chief of central command 
he said the militarys mission was to defend against an iraqi 
attack against saudi arabia and to be prepared to conduct other 
operations as directed 
he said no decision had been made on command structure of the 
multinational force but that the structure is being put into 
force right now it is being worked on it is a matter or 
coordination and communications 
he refused to say whether us forces would be subordinate to 
any nonamerican commanders 
fogarty said he had no intelligence at the time of the briefing 
to back up a report by diplomatic sources in riyadh that saudi 
gunners had fired on two iraqi reconnaissance planes near khafji on 
sunday 
the media pool then flew to the independence where another 
briefing was held by unruh he was asked whether the navy had 
interdicted any oil shipping leaving iraq or occupied kuwait 
we have been given no directive to stop any shipping we are 
not on a blockade mission he said but he said he thought the 
iraqi oil flow had pretty much dried up turkey last week shut 
off its oil pipeline one of three primary outlets used by the 
iraqis 
the 31yearold 80000ton indy carries 60 to 70 aircraft 
made up of seevn types two f14 squadrons two squadrons of the 
f18 hornet and one of the a6e intruder ea6e prowler electronics 
countermeasures plants e2c hawkeye awacs s3a vicking 
antisubmarine patrol planes and sh3 sea king helicopters 
the f14 fighter gap missions over the gulf are to protect the 
us naval force in the waterway now totaling nine ships and to 
respond to other missions as ordered officers said 
a surface warfare officer in the carriers combat information 
center said the iranians were putting out p3 orion surveillance 
plances in the area but they dont get too close they are very 
friendly we talk to them and they talk to us 
the f14s equipped with three kinds of airtoair missiles 
including the highly classified phoenix which can hit an opponent 
at long distance can perform fourhour missions and stay aloft 
indefinitely with the support of air forces kc135 and kc10 
tanker planes in saudi arabia yakeley said 
the mood of the men aboard the independence was one of 
anticipation that they were about to be part of an important event 
they are glad that their country has made this commitment and 
that theyre the ones who were picked to be out here on the front 
line said one officer

ask what japan will do next to help in the iraq 
crisis and the answer is it will observe the japanese 
constitution which forbids military activity 
ask what washington wants japan to do and the answer is even 
more vague no one is saying not even whether washington has put 
specific requests to tokyo 
these issues go to the heart of japans standing in the world 
today its curious mixture of confident wealth and uncertainty of 
how to play the role of a big power what specifically can japan do 
in a heated crisis to back its global partners the united states 
and other big western democracies what can it be asked to do 
the administration of prime minister toshiki kaifu left an 
impression monday of tough choices still ahead so great that kaifu 
postponed a trip to saudi arabia and four other middle east 
countries snared in the iraqi crisis 
the nub of the issue for tokyo is that an international military 
effort is growing in the middle east which is the source of 70 
percent of japans oil and japan steers clear of foreign military 
actions from painful experience a halfcentury ago 
instead of going to the middle east and showing support for the 
countries that oppose iraqs invasion of kuwait kaufu will stay at 
home to direct the government through the minefield of deciding how 
to back the international force in the persian gulf without 
violating the constitution 
japan is determined to decide on concrete measures to 
support the gulf force makoto watanabe director of the foreign 
ministrys middle eastern affairs bureau told reporters 
asked repeatedly whether japan might send military units such as 
naval vessels he stolidly replied we will examine all possible 
measures while observing the provisions of the constitution 
kaifus government already has barred trade with iraq and kuwait 
and fully supports international economic sanctions to dislodge the 
iraqis from kuwait 
the sanctions were a genuine sacrifice for japan foreign 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said last week japan drew 112 
percent of its oil from iraq and kuwait in the first half of this 
year while japan has 142 days worth of oil in reserve the 
government is expected to authorize modest energyconservation 
measures tuesday in case the gulf standoff drags on 
the crisis has knocked 1512 percent off the closely watched 
nikkei index on the tokyo stock exchange the big decline seems to 
belie predictions that japans economy growing strongly at more 
than 4 percent annually has a comfortable cushion in times of 
crisis 
whatever economic sacrifices emerge the tough decision for the 
japanese government is how far it can go to support a foreign 
military effort by its allies 
japans nowar constitution is better suited to a peaceful world 
that does not exist it was imposed by usled occupation 
authorities after world war ii 
the constitution declares that the japanese people forever 
renounce war as a sovereign right and that armed forces as well 
as other war potential will never be maintained 
after the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 the constitution 
was interpreted to mean that japan could maintain armed forces for 
selfdefense 
from there japans defense budget has grown to a limit of 1 
percent of gross national product but there is fierce debate 
whenever anyone suggests projecting military force abroad the 
navy for instance could have been chosen to protect 
plutoniumcarrying ships from terrorists the lowerprofile coast 
guard was picked instead 
in 1987 both sides in the iraniraq war attacked oil tankers in 
the persian gulf the united states led a multinational task force 
to clear the path for oil vital to japan but tokyo decided it 
could not send even such a defensive military unit as a minesweeper 
to the gulf because of the constitution 
instead japan financed a navigation system to keep track of 
ships in the gulf extended new loans and a credit line to jordan 
and assumed a bigger share of the cost of basing us troops in 
japan 
its most likely that japan will use money again to back the 
gulf crisis force other countries will risk manpower and prestige 
and japan will face accusations of getting a free ride again

rising prices and mortgage rates continued to 
undermine the purchasing power of firsttime homebuyers in the 
second quarter despite increased incomes a real estate trade group 
said monday 
and the national association of realtors added a prolonged 
conflict in the middle east will drive up mortgage rates even 
further adversely affecting not only the entrylevel sector but 
the entire housing market as well 
the realtors said its firsttime homebuyer affordability index 
was 729 in the apriljune period meaning a typical renter family 
with wage earners between 25 and 44 years old had 729 percent of 
the income needed to qualify for financing to buy a typical starter 
home 
the index measured 73 during the previous quarter the realtors 
composite index measuring the affordability of all buyers of 
existing homes was 104 during the second quarter down from 1043 
from january through march 
the median income of a firsttime homebuyer rose 245 to 23368 
in the second quarter the median income means half of the buyers 
earn more half less 
however the typical firsttime buyer would need an income of 
32061 8693 higher than the median income to qualify for 
conventional financing covering 90 percent of a home priced at 
81800 the median starterhome price 
the realtors said a firsttime buyer would qualify to buy a home 
costing just 59600 
the starterhome price rose 300 during the second quarter the 
closing interest rate used in the index rose from 1004 to 1015 
percent including additional fees or points paid at settlement 
private mortgage insurance raised the interest rate to 1040 
percent 
the changes in price income and interest rate resulted in a 
monthly payment of 668 up 9 from the firstquarter 
realtors president norman d flynn said the association expects 
mortgage rates to ease if the middle east crisis ends quickly 
if the crisis is of longer duration we expect there to be a 
significant negative impact on housing markets and affordability 
especially for firsttime buyers he said

the white house said today its naval barricade 
of iraqi ships is taking hold as the united states and its allies 
squeeze saddam hussein economically so the iraqis cannot maintain 
their war machine 
the bush administration said bluntly today that even food would 
be withheld from iraq you dont give them the essentials that 
enable them to carry on the war white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
in saudi arabia where american troops are building a massive 
defense against any further iraqi aggression the acting chief of 
staff for us troop operations told reporters i think our 
position grows stronger with each day that goes by 
as maj gen don l kaufman spoke the steady drone of planes 
brought more soldiers and hardware to the saudi desert kaufman 
said planes were landing virtually every 10 minutes or so with 
their military cargo 
on the economic front fitzwater said the sanctions endorsed by 
the united nations are hurting baghdad 
the purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch of them 
fitzwater said in kennebunkport where president bush is 
vacationing we assess the impact of the embargo as excellent 
he said the white house had obvious humanitarian concerns 
about prohibiting food imports into iraq but he added 
the purpose of the sanctions and the embargo is to put the 
pinch on them it seems fairly obvious to me you dont let 
foodstuffs and other things go in that are subject to the 
sanctions the purpose is not to let supplies go in that allow them 
to maintain the war machine allow them to maintain their 
aggressive takeover of kuwait 
asked about reports that jordan was allowing iraqi shipments 
through fitzwater said we are hopeful that jordan will comply 
they have said they will abide by the sanctions 
fitzwater also said the white house reported two or three 
ships in recent hours that have turned away or been turned away or 
at least have otherwise not landed with their cargo 
an iraqi tanker tried to dock at a saudi terminal to take on 
oil but was turned away by saudi officials diplomatic sources in 
the region reported 
bush and his top aides are avoiding the word blockade to 
describe a us decision to use whatever means necessary to choke 
off iraqs oil trade and imports of other goods including food 
but their intention was clear 
i consider interdiction of shipping to be in accord with 
united nations economic sanctions bush told reporters sunday no 
point getting into all these semantics the main thing is to stop 
the oil from coming out of there and that is what were going to 
do 
diplomatic sources at the oil terminal near yanbu saudi arabia 
said the iraqi tanker alqadissiyah which could carry up to 
900000 barrels of oil failed in its attempt to moor sunday night 
because three tug boats that normally would help have been taken 
out of the water 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the tanker 
sailed away today after its apparent attempt to defy a us 
declaration that its warships would enforce a un embargo aimed at 
forcing iraqs saddam hussein to give up his forced annexation of 
kuwait 
prince bandar bin sultan the saudi ambassador to washington 
said on good morning america that saddam should not try to make 
the israeli territories a part of the kuwait crisis 
he is mixing the issues the ambassador said that is not 
an excuse for an arab country to go an invade another arab 
country 
the united states intensified its military fortification of 
saudi arabia and the surrounding seas over the weekend sending in 
marine and army air assault troops and shipping patriot 
surfacetoair missiles and other sophisticated airdeployed 
weapons to the region sources who disclosed the movements said 
pentagon planners assumed that in the event of an iraqi attack an 
initial air battle could be decisive 
the commander of the us military action gen h norman 
schwarzkopf briefed reporters at macdill air force base in florida 
on the logistical difficulties of transporting troops and backup 
equipment 7000 miles by air and 12000 miles by sea schwarzkopf 
said the iraqis are dug in right now for a strong defense 
we have built up a great deal of force over there now and 
if they do make an attack they are going to pay a price for it 
he said 
schwarzkopf said troops would be on guard against terrorists as 
well as iraqi guns and gas an estimated 50000 troops are 
committed to saudi arabia in the initial deployment with 
contingency plans for a force up to 250000 i would never tell 
you that the american forces that are there are 100 percent out of 
harms way the general said 
indeed the pentagon reported the first casualty of the military 
action on sunday air force staff sgt john campisi a 30yearold 
aircraft mechanic from covina calif was klled when he was hit by 
a truck on a darkened runway 
while soldiers took up their stations in the saudi deserts the 
white house pressed forward with its economic isolation of iraq 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
would begin almost instantly to take measures that are 
necessary and proportionate in order to enforce the united 
nations sanctions 
asked if the united states was mounting a naval blockade baker 
appearing on abctvs this week with david brinkley said 
lets simply say that we now have the ability the legal basis 
for interdicting those kinds of shipments he declined to use the 
word blockade 
bush vacationing in kennebunkport maine said the 
unapproved embargo gave us broad authority working in 
conjunction with others to do whatever is necessary to see no oil 
goes out 
asked if the united states would block shipments of food as well 
as oil the president said just watch everything 
the washington post today quoted a senior administration 
official as saying we will fire on a ship if it wont stop 
well do the usual things warn them off fire a shot across the 
bow but if it comes to that there is no question what we will 
do 
the us pledge to stop the flow of goods in and out of iraq 
came after kuwaits exiled leader sheik jaber alahmed alsaba 
asked that the united states take steps to ensure the un economic 
sanctions take hold 
as the bush administration vowed to quarantine iraq saddam in 
a statement read by a spokesman on television in baghdad urged his 
people to prepare for hardships that may result from the 
international economic sanctions 
he also linked any iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to an israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip and a syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon israel seized the occupied territories 
from egypt and jordan in 1967 
the white house categorically rejected saddams proposals 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said calling them another 
attempt at distracting from iraqs isolation and at imposing a new 
status quo only the unconditional withdrawal of iraqi forces 
from kuwait will satisfy the united states he said

soviet citizens on monday expressed hope that the 
new cooperation between the united states and soviet union in the 
persian gulf crisis will lead to further collaboration 
it seems everyone has finally understood as they should have 
long ago that only joint efforts can bring something positive 
said svyeta buzenkova 20 a muscovite interviewed on red square 
she suggested the two superpowers combine efforts in cultural 
pursuits space research and other areas and said she believed the 
warming relations will only improve 
i think people now are finding it more and more 
interesting to talk to each other ms buzenkova said 
army lt alexander soldatov said he regretted the years that the 
soviet union sent millions of dollars in weaponry and military aid 
to iraq the kremlin cut off arms shipments after iraqs invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 
its too bad that those are our weapons there he said i 
wish they had never been sent 
after the invasion secretary of state james a baker iii joined 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in moscow for a rare 
joint statement condemning the invasion and urging a worldwide arms 
embargo on iraq 
the soviet union has two warships in the persian gulf but so far 
has declined to join us efforts to interdict iraqi shipping 
soviet officials say they would consider participating in a naval 
interdiction sponsored by the united nations 
victor borovik a retiree who lives in moscow praised the 
ussoviet cooperation in the middle east following decades of 
superpower competition in the oilrich region 
i dont think we should be suspicious any longer of the united 
states he said we need to continue to take joint measures to 
put out the fire in case of any military conflict 
we need to prevent bloodshed and sit down for talks to resolve 
this he said standing on the sloping drive between the kremlin 
and st basils cathedral but they are aggressors and should be 
stopped 
borovik and others echoed their governments cautious approach 
to taking military action against iraq 
our military absolutely should not get involved in a military 
conflict he said 
i hope the soviet union uses its best efforts for a peaceful 
resolution the globe has shed too much blood

britain and australia said today they will help the united 
states interdict iraqi shipping but france said it would not join 
the barricade because that would make it a cobelligerent in 
the persian gulf 
the netherlands said it would send two frigates to the area as a 
symbol of solidarity and pakistan announced it would send troops 
to saudi arabia to join thousands of us forces already there as a 
defense against iraqi troops massed in southern kuwait at the saudi 
border 
no date for departure or number of troops were given by the 
pakistani foreign ministry 
earlier today official egyptian sources said the first syrian 
ground forces were expected in saudi arabia before tuesday but 
saudi sources said only that the syrians are expected this week 
british foreign office minister william waldegrave announced 
this afternoon that sailors would board any vessel attempting to 
break economic sanctions against iraq imposed in the aftermath of 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of neighboring kuwait 
if there is evidence of sanctionsbusting the navy will take 
the necessary steps waldegrave told a news conference 
the foreign office said britain was responding to a request from 
the kuwaiti government in exile that it take steps to insure the 
effectiveness of sanctions authorized last week by the un 
security council 
president bush said sunday he would use any means necessary to 
enforce the united nations embargo 
i consider interdiction of shipping to be in accord with 
un sanctions bush told reporters sunday asked if the shipments 
of food would be interdicted as well bush said just watch 
everything iraq imports about 75 percent of its food including 
basic foodstuffs like rice and meat 
in paris a government spokesman told reporters that a un 
trade embargo against iraq and kuwait occupied by at least 130000 
iraqi troops does not extend to intercepting shipments of oil by 
the government of iraqs president saddam hussein 
any attempt by french warships to stop tankers would make france 
a cobelligerent in the oilrich region along with iraq the 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the dutch government did not immediately announce whether its 
two ships which may not arrive until september would interdict 
iraqi shipping 
the dutch military presence contributes to international 
solidarity in discouraging further iraqi aggression said the 
letter from the dutch cabinet to the parliament 
added a spokesman for british prime minister margaret thatcher 
certainly we havent mentioned blockade at this stage or 
interdiction he did not rule out a future change in policy 
mrs thatcher is taking a vacation in england and her spokesman 
in london said he did not know whether she and bush had discussed 
the us plan 
economic sanctions are indeed the way it should be played 
initially the spokesman said on condition of anonymity i 
think the idea of sending our forces down there is very much a 
deterrent the primary bite should be the economic sanctions 
a spokesman at australias foreign ministry did not hestitate to 
use the term blockade he said also on condition of anonymity 
that the aim of the naval force was to prevent any supplies going 
into or out of iraq 
the soviet union has two warships in the gulf but has said it 
would consider joining a blockade only under un auspices 
vladimir polyakov moscows new ambassador to egypt told 
reporters in cairo that 8000 economic and military advisers were 
in iraq but none took part in the conquest of kuwait

effort in the middle east said sunday the deployment of american

up to 50000 us troops are expected to arrive in saudi arabia

schwarzkopf said american forces are outnumbered by the iraqi 
troops who continue to pour into kuwait the iraqi occupation 
force is estimated at 130000 to 170000 men

palestinians in the israelioccupied lands are 
celebrating president saddam hussein of iraq as a savior who can 
win back the west bank and gaza strip and restore arab pride by 
teaching the americans a lesson 
the euphoric support for saddam has replaced the widespread 
despair gripping palestinians since middle east peace efforts broke 
down and their 32month uprising against israel lost momentum 
it also has united the plo already closely allied with saddam 
and moslem fundamentalist factions that have been at each others 
throats during the uprising 
prosaddam sentiments reached nearfrenzy monday a day after 
saddam said he would only consider pulling out of kuwait if israel 
withdrew from the west bank and gaza strip 
thousands marched in prosaddam rallies in the west bank and 
celebrated him as a national hero who would deliver by force what 
diplomacy failed to achieve 
in the west banks largest city nablus some 2000 people 
chanted saddam we are with you until victory and waved iraqi 
flags and posters of the leader in the town of jenin about 1000 
marchers urged saddam to attack israel with chemical weapons 
leading proplo activists said the outbursts are a measure of 
the frustration over failed peace efforts they blamed the united 
states for not forcing its close ally israel to make a deal with 
the palestinians and give up occupied land 
people here are frustrated that there is no solution to their 
plight that explains their enthusiastic support for somebody who 
might find that solution said radwan abu ayyash head of the 
arab journalists association in the occupied lands 
the palestinians are antiamerican not prosaddam abu 
ayyash told the associated press 
he said americans applied a double standard by demanding iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait while accepting israels continued 
occupation of territories won in the 1967 middle east war 
people are wondering why the americans are suddenly rambo in 
the persian gulf and where was rambo in 1967 abu ayyash said 
faisal husseini another leading proplo activist said saddam 
has given palestinians new hope by linking israeli and iraqi 
withdrawals 
if there is one way to solve our problem it is through 
saddams initiative it would solve all problems of international 
legitimacy in the area husseini said 
many palestinians said the persian gulf crisis is the final blow 
to efforts by secretary of state james a baker iii to broker peace 
talks between the israelis and palestinians 
husseini once tentatively backed the baker plan which called 
for preliminary talks in cairo to discuss an offer by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to hold elections in the occupied lands 
but he said shamirs refusal to accept the baker plan has forced 
the palestinians to give up 
the palestinians support for saddam meanwhile closed one of 
the few channels of communication between israelis and palestinians 
israeli doves from the labor party led by elder statesman abba 
eban decided sunday to suspend all meetings with husseini and 
other leaders until the palestinians denounce saddam 
my colleagues and i cannot possibly have a fruitful discussion 
with palestinians who applaud the brutality of saddam eban said 
in a telephone interview 
doves from labor and other leftwing parties have been meeting 
regularly with palestinian leaders to find common ground for peace 
negotiations 
officials in shamirs government said they were not surprised by 
the palestinians prosaddam stance 
shamirs government views the new palestinian militancy as proof 
the plo cannot be a partner in negotiations it also reduces us 
pressure on israel to launch peace talks 
among the palestinians meanwhile there were only a few voices 
warning against support for saddam 
the palestinians are now sitting in saddams boat if the boat 
sinks you can say goodbye to the palestinians said zuhair dubi 
a respected proplo journalist and mosque preacher from nablus a 
defeat of saddam will set the palestinian cause back for decades 
palestinian economist hisham al khatib warned that the wealthy 
gulf states angered by the palestinian position may fire many of 
the estimated 800000 palestinians working there and throw them 
out 
hundreds of palestinians who were vacationing in the west bank 
at the time of the iraqi invasion of kuwait have already been 
barred from returning to their jobs in saudi arabia abu ayyash 
said 
palestinian workers in the gulf send about 250 million a year 
to relatives in the west bank and gaza if the funds dry up it 
would be a serious blow to the palestinian economy already badly 
shaken by the uprising 
but the warnings are not dampening the euphoria which has 
quickly assumed religious overtones 
moslem fundamentalist groups have stirred up emotions by calling 
for a jihad or holy war against us forces deployed in saudi 
arabia the moslems compare the americans to the christian 
crusaders who invaded the holy land in the 11th through 14th 
centuries before being defeated by the arabs 
we call on iraq to attack the heart of tel aviv if iraq is 
attacked by the western crusaders said a leaflet distributed 
monday in the gaza strip by the fundamentalist group hamas 
the islamic supreme council the highest moslem authority in 
jerusalem and the occupied lands called on all arabs to send money 
and weapons to iraq to fight the us conspiracy against islam

president bush will break off his 
vacation tuesday to return to washington for two days of briefings 
on the crisis in the persian gulf and on the budget deficit the 
white house said today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the embargo 
against iraq was holding and he defended the us plan to cut off 
even food shipments saying the united states does not want to feed 
saddam husseins war machine 
on americans held in iraq and kuwait fitzwater criticized iraqi 
reports that foreigners were free to leave kuwait as iraq had 
claimed we now have cars lined up at the saudi border who are 
unable to get out said fitzwater 
earlier in the day bush telephoned the president of venezuela 
to discuss the crisis and world oil production 
bush plans to return to his oceanfront summer home wednesday 
after a military briefing and speech to pentagon employees 
fitzwater said 
bush arrived in maine friday for a scheduled 25day vacation 
but said then that the standoff in the middle east would probably 
require him to go back and forth to the white house 
fitzwater briefing reporters at a seaside hotel near bushs 
walkers point home said bush will leave for washington around 
noontime tuesday and meet with his top advisers on the budget and 
efforts to forge a deal with leaders of congress on reducing the 
deficit 
bush will hold a news conference to discuss the budget problems 
after his session with treasury secretary nicholas brady budget 
director richard darman and others fitzwater said 
he will go to the pentagon wednesday morning for a full briefing 
on the military situation in the gulf where bush has sent an 
estimated 50000 troops squadrons of fighter jets and a large 
flotilla of ships to defend saudi arabia and pressure saddam to 
withdraw his occupying army from kuwait 
the united states is leading international efforts to enforce 
united nationsordered economic sanctions against iraq which has 
100000 or more troops massed in kuwait 
we assess the impact of the embargo as excellent fitzwater 
said 
he said the embargo covers food imports as well 
the purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch on them so 
the iraqis cannot maintain their war machine fitzwater said 
pressed on whether the united states would impose a total 
quarantine on shipping through the gulf of aqaba fitzwater said he 
did not want to telegraph our intentions but he added i 
think when the president said yesterday everything that that was 
quite inclusive and adequate to give notice as to what our 
intentions are 
later fitzwater issued a written statement saying the united 
states would not try to intercept medical supplies to iraq we do 
not intend to go beyond the un resolution said fitzwater 
who quoted language from the resolution stating the embargo does 
not include supplies intended strictly for medical purposes 
bush called venezuelan president carlos andres perez today to 
discuss the gulf situation and world oil supplies fitzwater said 
us officials have said venezuela a member of opec is stepping 
up oil production to help offset the cutoff of iraqi and kuwait oil 
on the embargo he said to our knowledge ships are not 
arriving the embargo is being maintained the nations of the world 
are abiding by their commitments we have had two or three ships in 
recent hours that have turned away or been turned away or at least 
have otherwise have not landed with their cargo we are very 
optimistic at this point that the embargo will hold 
asked about reports that jordan was letting shipments through 
he said we are hopeful that jordan will comply they have said 
they will abide by the sanctions 
asked why the united states would block food shipments 
fitzwater said we have obvious humanitarian concerns but we have 
also very real military concerns and this is a force that is after 
all threatening many countries of the world it is a leader who has 
killed people by his own hand and by his own forces 
we are very much concerned about the safety about our soldiers 
and our troops in saudi arabia and concerned about the other 
countries of the region he added 
the purpose of the sanctions and the embargo is to put the 
pinch on them it seems fairly obvious to me you dont let 
foodstuffs and other things go in that are subject to the 
sanctions the purpose is not let supplies go in that allow them to 
maintain the war machine allow them to maintain their aggressive 
takeover of kuwait you dont give them the essentials that enable 
them to carry on the war said fitzwater 
fitzwater had no estimate of what it is costing to keep the 
american forces in saudi arabia there have been reports from 
pentagon sources that it will cost 300 million or more a month 
fitzwater expressed skepticism about such figures but said 
funding will not drive this operation 
the white house announced sunday that after a written plea from 
kuwaits exiled emir to enforce united nations economic sanctions 
the president has decided that the united states will do whatever 
is necessary to isolate iraq 
bush was on the telephone before dawn sunday discussing the 
international effort to isolate iraq with syrian president hafez 
assad often a target of us criticism but in this case an ally 
fitzwater said the united states categorically rejects 
saddams proposals for withdrawing from kuwait 
the iraqi leader demanded an end to the international sanctions 
that have choked off his oil exports plus a pullout of american 
and other forces and an israeli surrender of the occupied 
territories on the west bank and gaza strip 
saddam who has unleashed chemical weapons in the past warned 
that many will be burned if war erupts in the region 
bush asked during a golf outing if he was pleased that saddam 
at least was talking about negotiating said crisply i didnt 
see anything pleasing in there at all none nothing

attorney general dick thornburgh and his 
soviet counterpart justice minister veniamin yakovlev on monday 
began a week of discussions on american and soviet legal systems 
the meetings between justice department officials and the soviet 
delegation headed by yakovlev are a follow up to discussions 
thornburgh had in moscow last fall 
as part of perestroika soviet president mikhail gorbachev has 
expressed an interest in developing a legal system that relies on 
due process rather than arbitrary decisions of bureaucrats 
soviet officials are seeking advice from american legal experts 
on a number of issues among them is the development of a uniform 
commercial code which is seen by western experts as a necessary 
prelude to more foreign investment in the soviet union 
in opening remarks yakovlev said the attorney generals visit 
to moscow last fall opened a totally new page in the history of 
ussoviet relations 
its very important that our jurists and our lawyers work 
closely together he said 
yakovlev said the soviet concept of the rule of law is not so 
different than american thinking but he acknowledged that our 
juridical systems differ quite a lot 
the soviets are particularly interested to understand how 
legislative actions regulate economic functions yakovlev said 
this is very pressing for us 
thornburghs remarks sounded a note of ussoviet solidarity 
during the current mideast crisis 
in this period of stress in the mideast it seems particularly 
significant that our two countries stand shouldertoshoulder in 
the opposition of the naked aggression and the support of the rule 
of law through the united nations and other international bodies 
thornburgh said 
the soviet delegation will meet with the various division heads 
at the justice department 
on tuesday yaklovlev and thornburgh will travel to lake george 
ny to address the conference of us chief justices

bozie an 5740pound asian elephant is in her 20th month of 
pregnancy and delivery isnt long off say officials at the lincoln 
park zoo 
we have a thousand things to prepare for said mark 
rosenthal the zoos curator of mammals we want to get a viable 
healthy baby on the ground 
bozies little one will be only the 16th of its species born in 
the united states since 1985 and the first for chicago and the 
lincoln park zoo only 10 of those calves have survived 
officials surveyed zoos all over the world for information about 
elephant pregnancies as bozies pregnancy progressed keepers 
began taking her measurements and weighing her 
they even built a new room for the delivery where bozie who has 
gained 800 pounds during her pregnancy sleeps away from the zoos 
other elephants 
a suburban northbrook horse veterinarian who knows how to 
perform a caesarean section on an elephant plans be on hand during 
the birth in case of complications 
were all excited rosenthal said but were keeping it 
calm until we see that we have a successful birth then well 
probably get real excited 
the zoo had to go to a lot of trouble to get bozie in a family 
way since it has no male elephants 
bozie was sent to dickerson park zoo in springfield mo where 
she and a male elephant named onyx hit it off bozie was returned 
to the lincoln park zoo after a oneyear stay in missouri

the british press is reacting derisively to the 
refusal by an american actors union to let the star of the musical 
miss saigon repeat his performance on broadway 
film director michael winner writing in the sunday express 
decried the insane decision of actors equity to deny welsh 
actor jonathan pryce permission to headline the hit musical on 
broadway 
pryce won an olivier award londons equivalent of a tony award 
for playing the eurasian pimp known as the engineer he has 
appeared on broadway twice before winning a tony in trevor 
griffiths comedians in 1976 
actors equity said last week that since the engineer is a 
eurasian an actor of asian descent should play the role 
this prompted producer cameron mackintosh to threaten to cancel 
the broadway production which has a record advance sale of almost 
25 million the show a london sellout since september was to 
start new york previews in march at the broadway theater 
the issue is expected to be reviewed at a meeting of actors 
equity this week 
this decision took protectionism to new extremes said 
winner who has doubled as an actor he added my roles in 
america now seem limited to playing middleaged jews 
winner a briton is middleaged and jewish 
sunday telegraph columnist oliver pritchett wrote sarcastically 
that the unions logic meant sharing the plum parts around all 
the ethnic communities 
he envisioned several newly titled musicals including noh 
noh nanette hello bali and the rocky harare show to 
employ japanese javanese and zimbabwean actors 
the peter tory column in the daily express asked should the 
role of the mikado now only be taken by japanese grandees 
dwelling within the shadows of mount fuji 
the implication of the american ban leads to endless 
silliness he wrote 
the daily mail wrote this exclusion illustrates the terrible 
confusion into which this once great meltingpot of a country has 
descended over the issue of race 
reporting on the casting of american actor richard gere as a 
japaneseamerican in a forthcoming film the evening standard 
headlined the article when equity means double standards 
not everyone agreed 
rhoda koenig an american columnist in the independent on 
sunday wrote could mackintoshs highminded political stance 
have been a clever move to get public opinion on his side before 
the opening and present himself as the underdog rather than the 
exploiter 
the greatest irony is that americans are being whipped up 
to get behind a show that presents a tawdry simplistic version of 
their involvement in vietnam she added

the justice department said today that the 
decision whether to retry mayor marion barry on unresolved drug and 
perjury charges will be up to us attorney jay b stephens 
stephens does not need our permission to retry a case said 
justice department spokesman dan eramian when asked if the 
department would participate in the decision stephens hasnt yet 
said whether he plans to retry the case 
the mayor meanwhile returned to work today on a fulltime basis 
for the first time since his trial began in june 
barry was convicted of one misdemeanor count of possession of 
cocaine on friday by a jury that acquitted him of another simple 
drug count but deadlocked on 12 other charges including three 
felony perjury counts 
after a mistrial was declared stephens said he would decide by 
sept 17 whether to retry the unresolved drug possession and 
perjury charges 
eramian said that justice department officials in the criminal 
division stood ready to give stephens advice if sought about 
how to proceed with the barry case but the spokesman said the 
department will not offer unsolicited views on what to do next 
that is the us attorneys call eramian said 
so far there have been no discussions with main justice 
about the case said eramian attorney general dick thornburgh 
has not been involved in the case so far in any way shape or 
form he said 
barry also planned to drop his democratic party affiliation 
today as he weighs whether to run for city council as an 
independent aides said sunday barry who announced in june he 
would not seek reelection this fall believes a run for the city 
council will let him keep a hand in local political affairs aides 
said 
on saturday the mayor said in a speech now is the time for 
healing he asked city residents to forgive me for any hurt i 
may have caused i hope that any of you who still harbor 
resentment and vengeance can let go 
barry also said of the trial jury let their judgment be our 
last judgment 
in his speech the mayor acknowledged he had been behaving in 
ways that were not in keeping with the vows i made to my wife and 
said he had sought and received effi barrys forgiveness 
regarding his treatment for alcohol and prescription drug abuse 
he said theres no shame or disgrace in being addicted to 
anything the shame and disgrace is in not making the decision to 
seek help 
barry has been receiving conflicting advice on whether he should 
run for city council said aides who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
monday is the deadline for switching parties if barry becomes 
an independent he would have to gather the signatures of 2000 
registered city voters to be placed on the ballot he would compete 
for two citywide council seats with winners of the republican 
democrat and statehood party primaries 
winning a council seat would allow barry to maximize his future 
city pension earnings and let him stay active in local politics 
which he has dominated since he was first elected mayor in 1978 he 
was elected to the city council in 1974 
sources said that while some aides believe barry has been 
exonerated and should resume his political career others are wary 
of antagonizing jackson or prosecutors 
the feeling is dont do anything to draw attention to 
yourself one associate said 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson has not yet set a 
sentencing date for barrys misdemeanor cocaine possession 
conviction which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison 
and a 100000 fine 
stephens has said only that the trial evidence will be reviewed 
before he decides whether to retry the 12 charges but politics 
have been intertwined with the case since barrys jan 18 arrest in 
the fbi sting during plea bargain negotiations the mayor has 
said stephens insisted that barry would have to resign his office 
as part of any agreement with the government 
meanwhile a washington post survey published sunday showed that 
while most of those interviewed believe the government should 
abandon its prosecution of the mayor a similar percentage believed 
barry should not seek office this year

every 10 minutes or so 
another plane lands in the saudi desert with us troops and 
equipment 
i think our position grows stronger with each day that goes 
by said maj gen don l kaufman chief of the us military 
training mission to saudi arabia and now acting chief of staff for 
central command forward the command operations for us troops 
the saudi government has been extremely cooperative kaufman 
told a pool of reporters at a briefing monday adding that he 
thinks the saudis were surprised by the size of the american 
commitment 
they are finding that we are not going to allow a handful of 
americans to be in harms way the numbers are larger i think 
than the saudis originally anticipated he said 
president bush ordered about 50000 american troops to saudi 
arabia last week at the request of the saudi government following 
iraqs lightning seizure of neighboring kuwait pentagon sources 
have said the number could climb as high as 250000 in coming 
months 
kaufman said he was aware of no military incident between the 
saudis and iraqis 
as far as i know it has been very stable said kaufman 
reporters in a pentagon pool arrived in saudi arabia on monday 
and were allowed to interview us soldiers under the pool 
conditions the names of the soldiers details of the military 
equipment and the name of the air base where the interviews took 
place could not be disclosed 
dozens of military transport planes vehicles and equipment had 
already arrived at the base us forces and equipment were 
arriving at several places in the kingdom and moving on to various 
positions officials said 
a 27yearold sergeant from claymont del in a support unit 
from fort bragg nc said he had just arrived on a plane 
chartered from federal express and was told to be ready to stay 
four to six months 
i called my wife and told her i might be called on and if i 
go just pray we all get out of here safe said the sergeant who 
had a gas mask attached to his belt yes its scary you have to 
build up the courage and put the fear aside and do what you have to 
do 
at torrejon air force base in spain where the press pool 
stopped for refueling the tarmac was lined with rows of c141 and 
massive c5 transport planes and a wing of f16 fighters some 
carrying sidewinder missiles all apparently were headed for the 
persian gulf region 
a huge hangar was filled with cots so the troops can catch a 
nap volunteers from the local church handed out drinks and baked 
goods 
one young soldier shortly after stepping off a c5 transport 
plane said he had little training for desert or chemical warfare 
so should i think im coming back he asked im pretty

daily massage can speed up the growth of premature 
babies who were exposed to cocaine in the womb a study says 
as a result the babies were able to leave the hospital about 
four days earlier on average than nonmassaged premature infants 
researcher tiffany field said monday 
fastergrowing babies also become more responsive which 
promotes interaction with parents she said other research shows 
that parental involvement helps a childs development in the first 
year of life she said 
fetuses are exposed to cocaine when a pregnant woman uses the 
drug such use raises the risk of premature birth 
field is a professor of pediatrics psychology and psychiatry at 
the university of miami medical school she reported preliminary 
results from the study at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association and discussed it in a later interview 
the meeting concludes tuesday 
the study still in progress has so far produced data on 16 
infants they were born about 10 weeks before their due dates 
weighing about 26 pounds 
they had to stay 20 days to 30 days in a neonatal intensive care 
unit normally such children then require about 20 days in the 
hospital simply to gain enough weight to be discharged field said 
the massage program took place during this latter period 
infants were massaged with firmness field said they love it 
when you give them a little pressure she said 
the routine included 10 seconds of working over the top of the 
head and down to the neck and then 10 seconds going the other way 
she said 
also massaged were the neck and shoulders back legs and arms 
the chest and abdomen were avoided because the infants obviously 
did not like being touched there perhaps associating it with 
painful medical procedures field said 
after five minutes of massage the babies arms and legs were 
moved about for five minutes and then came five more minutes of 
massage 
the 15minute sessions were done three times a day for 10 days 
the massaged babies gained 28 percent more weight per day after 
the treatment than a comparison group of 16 premature infants who 
had also been exposed to cocaine but who were not massaged field 
said 
the difference appeared around the sixth day of the treatment 
and continued for at least a few days after it ended when 
researchers stopped keeping track field said 
nobody knows why massage spurs growth but perhaps it stimulates 
release of hormones that aid absorption of food she said prior 
studies of premature babies have shown simply holding or paying 
attention to them did not cause them to gain weight field said 
the massage treatment looks promising said a prominent 
pediatric researcher dr t berry brazelton of cambridge mass 
but he cautioned that it has to be done with sensitivity to 
the babys condition and responses 
the massager must ease up in response to signals from the 
infant he said 
massage had already been shown to speed up the growth of 
premature infants not exposed to cocaine field said 
in one study a 10day course of daily massage spurred weight 
gain by 47 percent the massaged infants were able to leave the 
hospital six days sooner saving substantial sums of money in 
health care costs field said 
about 10 percent of births in the united states are premature 
amounting to 350000 a year according to the march of dimes birth 
defects foundation 
most premature infants weigh less than 55 pounds at birth 
about 15 percent to 20 percent of premature infants die in the 
first month after birth

flowers were laid beside a cross honoring a 
teenager who was slain trying to escape to freedom as germans from 
east and west on monday marked the 29th anniversary of the berlin 
wall 
the ceremony the first joint memorial of the aug 13 1961 
construction of the berlin wall included a prediction by a local 
politician that the scar left by the crumbling barrier will never 
end 
east german defense minister rainer eppelmann demanded criminal 
probes of those responsible for the shoottokill orders at the 
wall under the former communist regime 
eppelmann said the nowousted communist officials must be 
brought to justice in a fair way 
communist border soldiers killed 80 east germans making dashes 
for freedom at the wall while hundreds of others were caught and 
imprisoned for trying 
germans are engaged in an emotional debate over whether the 
soldiers themselves should be brought to trial 
the open wound is closing said prominent west berlin city 
councilor erich paetzold at the ceremony but a scar will last 
forever 
he spoke beside a roughhewn cross erected in memory of 
18yearold east berlin worker peter fechter who was shot and bled 
to death while trying to escape in 1962 
his death has come to symbolize the bitter separation that 
followed the collapse of nazi germany after world war ii 
east germanys communists suddenly started erecting the wall 
stunning the world 29 years ago to halt the flow of refugees to 
the west 
paetzold said a part of the wall will be preserved so that we 
dont forget what happened here so that no one forgets what 
happened here 
despite paetzolds promise it may be difficult to find a 
suitable memorial site 
many of the most famous stretches of the wall have been torn 
down since last falls reforms swept east germany and other 
countries in eastern europe other sections have been hacked away 
by entrepreneurs and souvenirhunters 
east german and west german newspapers were filled with 
recollections of the wall monday 
they included a picture of the walls mastermind erich 
honecker shown talking to east german troops the month after the 
wall was built 
honecker ruled east germany for 18 years before his ouster last 
october 
honecker 77 is under investigation for possible murder charges 
stemming from the deaths of those who tried to flee to the west 
on nov 9 honeckers desperate successors opened the wall in 
hopes of halting another exodus that already numbered 200000 
east berlins democratically elected mayor tino schwierzina 
reminded the 300 listeners at mondays ceremony that the berlin 
wall caused widespread suffering 
the situation in the german democratic republic makes this 
increasingly clear schwierzina said we who are living behind 
the almost disappeared wall need quick and effective help 
schwierzina said the nations economy was in catastrophic 
condition 
east german demands for money from bonn have led to tensions 
between the two countries as they head into the last stretch before 
unification scheduled for december at latest 
the representatives of the two halves of berlin spoke at a cross 
set up in honor of fechter after his aug 17 1962 death 
fechter bled for nearly an hour before his body was hauled away 
here where peter fechter died we can feel how much suffering 
the wall caused said the east berlin mayor 
a weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony is tacked 
to the cross dark wood more than a dozen large flower 
arrangements were placed by the cross 
although the wall has disappeared there windows on the eastern 
side still have the bars that kept people from jumping to freedom 
from nearby buildings 
in years past the communist east germans marked the walls 
anniversary with bombastic military parades that drew the wrath of 
the western allies 
more than 25 million east germans fled to the west from 1949 
until the wall went up 
communist border soldiers killed more than 200 people attempting 
to flee from east berlin or other parts of east germany to the west

late last month 350 officers 
at us central command headquarters in florida held a training 
exercise a hypothetical crisis requiring american military action 
in the middle east 
according to a spokesman the drill codenamed internal look 
90 was devised by central commands chief gen h norman 
schwarzkopf iii to test our ability to deal with a contingency 
in which a threat overflowed its banks and challenged the interests 
of the united states 
five days later iraqi president saddam husseins armed forces 
rumbled into neighboring kuwait and people around the tampa 
headquarters were asking whether the bear as schwarzkopf is 
called had known something they didnt 
its almost exactly the scenario of il 90 said capt 
ronald wildermuth chief spokesman for the 56yearold schwarzkopf 
schwarzkopf took over in 1988 as commander of us military affairs 
in the explosive region stretching from north africa to pakistan 
schwarzkopf a west pointer with four stars a masters degree 
in guided missile technology and the build of a pro football 
tackle is no stranger to crisis 
he was secondincommand of us forces in the grenada invasion 
in 1983 a decade earlier he led an infantry battalion during the 
bloodiest phase of us involvement in vietnam 
schwarzkopf himself was wounded twice and won three silver stars 
for valor and a host of other medals but he was probably best 
known for his personal involvement with the family of a soldier 
killed by errant american artillery an episode described in the 
book and film friendly fire 
while none of that has made h norman schwarzkopf iii a 
household name the name was already famous in the early 1930s 
when col h norman schwarzkopf led the controversial investigation 
of the lindbergh baby kidnapping 
the elder schwarzkopf subsequently turned up as a us army 
colonel in iran where he organized a national police force that 
helped thwart a sovietbacked communist insurgency at the end of 
world war ii

the trade ministry asked japanese on monday to work 
in sweltering offices and use mass transit to prepare for a 
possible oil crisis because of the persian gulf situation 
about 70 percent of japans oil comes from the middle east 
trade officials are proposing wideranging measures for 
government agencies private companies and individual households to 
conserve energy 
the proposals expected to be approved by the cabinet on tuesday 
and take effect immediately include setting office building 
thermostats no lower than 82 degrees and reducing office lighting 
by onethird 
the situation is not yet so serious because japan has a very 
large petroleum reserve said a trade official speaking on 
condition of anonymity but we ought to be better prepared for 
the possible worstcase scenario 
individual citizens will be encouraged to use public 
transportation people who continue to drive will be asked to go no 
faster than 50 mph on highways 
although the proposal does not call for penalties to be imposed 
for failing to comply with the measures government guidelines 
generally are widely followed 
the trade official said the ministry also decided on stricter 
measures to be implemented if the countrys oil reserves now 
estimated at enough for 142 days deteriorate 
those steps would include limiting both gas station operations 
and latenight television broadcasting officials said 
we are trying to be cautious not to repeat the panic of the 
second oil crisis in 1978 the official said referring to the 
oil crunch caused by the outbreak of the war between iran and iraq 
the confusion occurred because we were not too wellprepared back 
then

the mideast is bristling with billions of 
dollars worth of modern weapons much of the arsenal provided by 
the united states that includes kuwaiti missiles now in the hands 
of iraq 
many of the arms transfers to the mideast have been financed by 
lowinterest longterm us loans israel at nearly 19 billion 
this year and egypt at almost 13 billion are the worlds 
biggest recipients of such aid 
other nations such as saudi arabia and kuwait pay cash for 
us weapons 
both the aid program and the cash sales are aimed at supporting 
friendly governments in the region and assuring the free flow of 
oil 
that overriding interest caused president bush to dispatch us 
military forces to the persian gulf last week to shield oilrich 
saudi arabia from the threat of an attack by iraq which overran 
kuwait aug 2 
pentagon officials say that while the united states sold arms to 
kuwait only infrequently its arsenals included some us hawk 
antiaircraft missiles and several thousand us tow antitank 
missiles all are now believed to be in iraqi hands 
most of kuwaits fighter aircraft including two squadrons of 
frenchbuilt mirage f1s and several dozen american skyhawk 
warplanes are believed to have been flown to safety in saudi 
arabia 
before it was attacked kuwait had arranged a 18 billion 
purchase of us fa18 fighter aircraft plus antiship and 
antiaircraft missiles 
but the aircraft were not scheduled for delivery until 1992 and 
a pentagon official who asked not to be named said that if kuwait 
remains in iraqs control the united states has no obligation to 
deliver them 
over the last 20 years just 15 billion in us weaponry was 
transferred to kuwait a small fraction of the arms sent to other 
mideastern nations 
saudi arabia has been the biggest customer for us arms with 
23 billion in deliveries over that period israel has received 11 
billion in weapons egypt 6 billion 
washington has sold saudi arabia much of its modern weaponry and 
is helping that nation modernize its military capability 
shortly after the iraqi invasion of kuwait the united states 
acted to dismantle congressional obstacles to arms deliveries to 
saudi arabia 
defense secretary richard cheney waived a legislative 
restriction limiting to 60 the number of sophisticated f15 
warplanes saudi arabia is allowed to have the pentagon official 
said the saudis will now be allowed to have 70 f15s 
the saudis previously made a 3 billion purchase of us tow 
antitank missiles which are now being produced the official 
said last year the saudis bought 320 m1a2 tanks which have yet 
to be built for 3 billion 
major saudi arms deals this year include more than 1 billion 
for the modernization of the oilrich kingdoms national guard and 
another 1 billion to modernize the saudi fleet of awacs 
earlywarning aircraft 
in israel the united states is trying to improve that nations 
defensive capability through a naval modernization program which 
includes the construction of submarines the pentagon official said 
israel is also developing and recently tested the arrow defense 
missile which is designed to destroy incoming missiles eighty 
percent of the cost of the program is being borne by the united 
states 
egypt has become a major recipient of us military aid since it 
became the first arab nation to recognize israel in 1979 egypt is 
now buying harpoon antiship missiles 
more modest us aid mostly in the form of military training 
and basic gear is provided to jordan 478 million this fiscal 
year and to other countries in the middle east 
for the next fiscal year the bush administration has asked 
congress for permission to make 43 million in armssales loans 
for us allies in the mideast

president bush in a bid to bolster 
ussoviet trade on monday lifted a longstanding ceiling on the 
number of soviet business people permitted to live and work in the 
united states 
until now only 69 soviets were allowed to reside in america 
while pursuing business deals now there will be no limit 
bush called upon soviet president mikhail gorbachev to match his 
move with reciprocal improvements in the climate for american 
business in the ussr 
he also cautioned the soviets against trying to slip in spies on 
the pretext of doing business 
this action is taken as an expression of our policy to build a 
more normal economic relationship with the soviets bush said in 
a statement issued from his vacation home here 
it is consistent with our interest in expanding business 
contacts and trade with the ussr he said 
we have made clear to the soviets that we retain the right to 
reconsider our decision should there be evidence that this 
opportunity is being misused for intelligence gathering or other 
inappropriate activities the president said 
bush proposed closer economic ties with the soviets at the malta 
summit last december and he and gorbachev signed a trade agreement 
in washington in june during their second summit 
bush noted that the united states is eager to provide the 
soviets with expertise on how to make lasting marketoriented 
reforms in their ailing economy 
our business people in the ussr and soviet business people 
here play an important role in this process the time has come to 
eliminate obstacles to commercial presence in both of our countries 
and to allow the number of resident business people to grow in 
tandem with the expansion of our economic relations bush said

a fire knocked out power to hundreds of offices 
in the citys financial district today disrupting stock market 
trading and stranding hundreds of people in skyscraper elevators 
authorities said 
consolidated edison officials issued an urgent appeal for other 
customers to reduce electrical usage because of the danger other 
parts of the system would become overloaded temperatures in the 
city were in the middle 80s 
eight firefighters were taken to area hospitals suffering from 
smoke inhalation chest pains and burning sensation in their 
throats officials said 
the new york stock exchange remained unaffected by the outage 
spokesman ray pellechia said but officials at the american stock 
exchange new york mercantile exchange and commodity exchange said 
they had to halt trading for the day 
the fire at con eds seaport substation was reported shortly 
before noon said fire department spokeswoman marilyn bernard 
hundreds of people were stuck in elevators at the world trade 
center for up to 2 hours said d joy faber a spokeswoman for the 
operator of the twin 107story skyscrapers by 240 pm people 
were evacuated from all but one elevator the complex was operating 
on emergency power 
my legs are buckling i feel so sore secretary ethel levine 
said after walking down 33 floors 
more than 100 firefighters including a decontamination and 
hazardous materials unit were on the scene 
its very very heavy smoke conditions bernard said with 
power losses all around 
earlier reports of possible pcb contamination were unfounded a 
spokeswoman for the city environmental department said records show 
there were no pcbs used at the electrical substation where the 
fire occurred 
con ed spokesman dan walden said some high voltage cables were 
knocked out by the fire initially only 500 customers were affected 
but two other feeder cables became overloaded and were also knocked 
out causing the blackout to spread he said 
a con ed customer can be an entire building so the number of 
people affected is many times higher than the number of customers 
the blackout area includes wall street and several large office 
skyscrapers 
beekman downtown hospital was operating on emergency generator 
power said spokeswoman maureen flatley she said lights are being 
shut off to conserve power and the air conditioning was shut off 
concern that continued electrical usage by others would overload 
more cables and spread the blackout prompted an emergency plea for 
cutbacks 
the cause of the fire was not immediately known some subway 
trains were either being halted north of the blackout area or 
rerouted to other lines the transit authority said

half the american public fears the iraqi 
conflict will create an oil crisis in the united states with 
rising prices and long lines at the service station an associated 
press poll has found 
respondents to the national survey overwhelmingly blamed the 
recent surge in gasoline prices on oil company greed not the 
middle east tensions but many foresaw true shortages and still 
higher prices in the next few months 
despite those fears and despite widespread expectations of a 
usiraq war the poll found strong support for the use of us 
troops to defend saudi arabia against possible iraqi attack 
sixtyfour percent voiced approval 
the survey of 1004 adults was conducted wednesday through 
sunday after president bushs announcement he was sending troops 
and iraqs announcement it was annexing kuwait which it invaded 
aug 2 
several polls since bushs speech have found americans rallying 
to his side support for the use of us troops has ranged from 63 
percent in a poll conducted tuesday and wednesday to 81 percent in 
a oneday poll wednesday night 
support for bush personally is roughly as high seventyseven 
percent in a poll friday to sunday by icr survey research group 
generally approved of the way he has been handling the situation 
and twothirds said his reaction has been about right rather 
than too tough or too weak 
concerns underlie the support however in the ap poll also 
conducted by icr 33 percent said the united states is very 
likely to become involved in a war with iraq an additional 39 
percent called war somewhat likely 
approval of the us troop commitment varied among some groups 
in the population republicans were more supportive than were 
democrats and independents 74 percent compared with 61 and 63 
percent respectively 
collegeeducated americans also were more supportive of the use 
of us troops and most strikingly women were far less supportive 
than men of the troop commitment 51 percent to 79 percent 
beyond his aid to saudi arabia bush has said iraqs invasion of 
kuwait will not stand but poll respondents were less clear on 
that outcome just onethird expected an international economic 
embargo of iraq to succeed in forcing it out of kuwait 
and many did not favor a military alternative thirtyfive 
percent backed the use of us troops to try to push iraq out of 
kuwait and even fewer 27 percent favored bombing iraqi 
military targets to force it from kuwait 
on oil 86 percent said oil companies were taking advantage of 
the situation when they raised gasoline after iraq attacked kuwait 
just 6 percent called the increases legitimate with the rest 
unsure 
but 52 percent said they believe the situation in the middle 
east is likely to create real oil shortages in the next few months 
with rising prices and long lines at the service stations 
the ap poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points icr of media pa is part of aus consultant

salvage crews sucked up oil from the houston ship 
channel on monday after the third large oil spill in as many months 
in or near the busy shipping channel 
the coast guard said at least 21000 gallons of oil spilled 
sunday when a barge buckled at a dock owned by lyondell 
petrochemical a former arco petrochemical subsidiary that was spun 
off as an independent company the barge was being loaded with fuel 
oil 
coast guard cmdr rex prosser said crews contained the spill 
within a few hours and by monday morning had transferred the 
barges remaining 609000 gallons of oil to another barge 
the salvage crews ran into difficulties monday 
the major problem is that the oil is sitting on the bottom of 
the water said prosser chief of houston port operations 
were trying to bring in some underwater dredges to remove the 
oil from the bottom of the turning basin 
lyondell spokesman david harpole said salvage crews used 
highpressure water sprays to help with the cleanup 
water is being sprayed into the channel to generate some 
turbulence to push the oil into the shore where the vacuum trucks 
and skimmers can get to it harpole said 
coast guard officials said the spill area was surrounded by 
refineries and other industrial plants so concern about the 
environment is minimal 
the 295foot barge owned by ingram barge co of nashville 
buckled at midship creasing the center of the vessel and spilling 
oil from both sides 
crews put temporary patches over a 2foot fracture on the 
barges starboard side and a 3inch split on its port side 
prosser blamed human error for the spill 
they were loading the barge and the tankermen put too much 
weight it was a very heavy cargo in the two center tanks and 
it caused the barge to buckle prosser said

its now up to the judge to decide whether 
subliminal messages exist on an album by the british heavy metal 
band judas priest and if so whether such messages drove two fans 
to enter a suicide pact 
lawyers for the band and cbs records deny the claim in the case 
before washoe county district court judge jerry carr whitehead 
there were unique circumstances there for raymond belknap and 
james vance which did not include subliminal stimuli defense 
attorney suellen fulstone argued hundreds of thousands of people 
have listened to this album with no adverse effect 
the youths reportedly made a suicide pact two days before 
christmas 1985 after drinking beer smoking marijuana and listening 
to the 1978 album stained class repeatedly 
belknap 18 held a sawedoff shotgun in his mouth and died from 
a single blast dec 25 1985 vance then 20 sought to do the 
same but only blew away the lower part of his face 
horribly disfigured he fathered a child and lived for three 
years before dying on thanksgiving day 1988 of complications from 
his injuries and a reaction to medications 
the lawsuit claims subliminal phrases on the album 
particularly do it tout suicide and pushed the youths over 
the edge 
subliminal messages defined as being below the threshold of 
consciousness and apprehension supposedly take effect 
subconsciously by repetition 
band members and defense lawyers maintain the purported do 
its are a combination of a huff of breath by lead singer rob 
halford and the sounds of drums and guitars 
all the court has to do is listen ms fulstone said 
there are no do its on this album 
the judge who heard the case without a jury gave no indication 
of when he might rule in the case but some believe it may be as 
early as this week 
the defense argued during the fourweek trial that alcohol and 
drug abuse family violence and trouble with the law predestined 
the youths fate 
ken mckenna and vivian lynch representing the youths families 
asked the judge for upwards of 62 million in damages for pain and 
suffering 
ms lynch representing the vance family sought between 4 
million and 5 million in part to compensate the family for nearly 
500000 in medical bills 
mckenna asked for 12 million on behalf of belknaps family

us navy 
pilots honing their skills for a possible clash with iraq say their 
biggest worry is not baghdads combatseasoned air force but its 
array of sovietmade surfacetoair missiles 
since this 80000ton carrier with about 70 warplanes arrived 
off the arabian peninsula on aug 5 as part of the massive buildup 
of foreign forces in the region some of its pilots have been 
flying nightly cap or combatairpatrol missions over the 
persian gulf 
their job is to help screen the nine us warships in the gulf 
and several thousand american ground troops sent to man positions 
around airfields and several key sites along the coast of saudi 
arabia 
in interviews with reporters who visited the independence as 
members of a pentagon news media pool the pilots said they have 
yet to encounter any iraqi aircraft and are never closer than 200 
miles to iraq 
that leaves them well out of range of iraqs formidable arsenal 
of antiaircraft guns and missiles 
standard military references say iraqi president saddam 
husseins forces have more than 300 surfacetoair missile 
launchers of at least eight different types most are 
sovietdesigned 
some date back to the 1960s when north vietnam shot down scores 
of american raiders with missiles like the radarguided sam6 
which has an 11mile ceiling 
iraq also has the sam9 sam13 and sam14 all of them medium 
or short range two miles to six miles they are designed to 
pursue the infrared signature of a speeding jet iraq also has 
the roland a frenchdesigned sam 
some of the missiles were used in the war with iran but with 
limited effect as tehrans force of usbuilt warplanes was 
depleted by age and a shortage of spare parts 
in the interviews independence combat pilots said they 
respected their iraqi counterparts for their war experience but 
doubted they would challenge the superior american aircraft and 
training 
i have a hard time thinking theyd want to do that they have 
a lot of experience and not many of us have been in combat but 
were not iran either said one pilot of an f18 hornet 
fighterbomber 
said another 29yearold hornet pilot i do feel that our 
biggest threat to losing aircraft to the iraqis is from their sam 
platforms as opposed to their airtoair fighters he said 
a senior commander who like the others could not be identified 
by name under the terms of the interviews said there were 
relatively few dogfight encounters in the gulf war and those 
that did occur were probably chance encounters where neither guy 
got more than one shot 
he said the speed and armament of the f14 tomcats flying the 
patrol missions gave them a clear edge over iraqs frenchbuilt f1 
mirage fighters 
although some sailors grumbled about the tension of waiting for 
something to happen the carriers crew of some 5000 seemed 
generally in high spirits 
capt robert l ellis jr commander of the independence said 
his crew most of whom are 18 to 22 years old werent thinking 
about combat when they embarked on their current tour of duty at 
san diego on june 23 
but now they have a sense of pride that their country has 
responded and they are the ones on the front line ellis said 
in addition to the fighters on patrol missions other aircraft 
thunder constantly off the carriers steam catapults on aerial 
refueling sorties and night landing practices 
small groups of pilots observe and evaluate their colleages as 
the gray jets roar in at maximum power against the wind to catch a 
tailhook on one of the four arresting tables stretched across the 
deck 
most make it the first time but occassionally one overshoots 
the cables and screams off again hook scrapping the bare deck in a 
great shower of sparks

postmaster general anthony m frank 
responding to complaints from senior citizen advocates defended 
his agencys policy of refusing to automatically forward nursing 
home residents mail when they move 
but frank said in a letter to sen john heinz rpa released 
monday that he was disturbed by reports that welltraveled nursing 
home residents mail was being left behind 
i understand you are aware of places where improper mail 
forwarding has caused a hardship for nursing home residents i am 
very concerned with such reports and can assure you the postal 
service is committed to resolving any problems which may exist 
frank said 
the postal service and the senate special committee on aging 
have agreed to collaborate on a campaign to ensure that nursing 
homes are readdressing the mail of residents who have left the 
committee said also frank said the agency has formed an internal 
committee to determine if policy changes are needed 
because all residents of a nursing home are at the same address 
the postal service says the home should be the agent for their 
mail the mail is delivered in bulk like at prisons hotels and 
summer camps and distributed by the institution 
while other people may submit changeofaddress cards to local 
post offices nursing home residents must rely on the institution 
to write their new address on individual letters then the post 
office delivers it at no extra charge 
heinz the aging committees ranking republican questioned the 
policy in a march letter to frank and a florida elderlyrights 
advocate told congress that some mail was not being forwarded and 
the policy treats nursing home residents like they were in jail 
or something 
but frank defended the policy as costeffective and 
practical 
single point delivery permits management of the nursing home 
with specific knowledge of each residents needs and condition to 
properly handle their mail and complete delivery at the best time 
and in the most appropriate manner frank said 
allowing residents to file address forwarding cards would mean 
postal employees sorting mail would need a record of each person in 
the home frank said he said that is not practical because of high 
resident turnover 
also some incapacitated residents might have problems obtaining 
and completing a changeofaddress card frank said 
heinz was reviewing franks letter said aide isabelle claxton 
in the meantime claxton said the postal service has agreed to 
cooperate with the senate panel in writing to more than 10000 
nursing homes certified by the federal government under medicare 
and medicaid the letters will explain to homes their obligation to 
ensure that mail is forwarded

indian soldiers tried to capture a 
mountain outpost starting a firefight with pakistani soldiers 
along the ceasefire line dividing disputed kashmir pakistan said 
monday 
india denied a battle took place 
the defense ministry said the attack on a remote outpost in the 
himalayas occurred sunday the day after talks on easing border 
tensions adjourned it claimed there were indian casualties but 
did not say how many 
earlier monday a foreign ministry spokesman reported no 
progress in the talks which adjourned without a definite date for 
resumption 
india a predominantly hindu country and moslem pakistan have 
been uneasy neighbors since their creation in the 1947 partition 
that ended british colonial rule 
tensions have been heightened by a moslem separatist uprising in 
indias part of kashmir 
the war threat has never receded said an official of 
pakistans defense ministry who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules this could be an isolated incident or it could 
lead to escalation 
indian soldiers used artillery antitank guns and mortars in 
attacking the outpost 60 miles northeast of muzzaffarabad capital 
of pakistancontrolled kashmir and were driven off with mortar 
fire after about an hour the defense ministry said 
our forces repulsed the attack and inflicted casualties on the 
intruders one official said 
in new delhi an indian government spokesman said its not 
true we have not attacked we have not used any artillery we have 
not suffered any casualties 
he also cannot be identified under briefing rules 
skirmishes and small arms fire are frequent along the 
unmonitored line in kashmir over which the two nations fought 
wars in 1948 and in 1965 
the attack was reported to un military observers in new delhi 
and islamabad the defense ministry said the official described 
the alleged attack as an attempt to divert world attention from the 
secessionist movement in indianheld kashmir 
india accuses pakistan of arming training and harboring moslem 
militants fighting in indian kashmir which the pakistanis deny 
pakistan contends india is using brutal force to crush an 
indigenious independence movement 
the uprising has cost more than 950 lives since indian forces 
cracked down in late january 
tensions increased last spring in the 43yearold dispute over 
kashmir a former princely state both nations claim and their 
armies face each other acros the ceasefire line

president bush will meet with his 
senior economic advisers tuesday to review the costs of the persian 
gulf conflict and prepare for next months negotiations with the 
democrats on the budget deficit the white house said monday 
the gulf crisis has already pushed up oil prices creating a 
further drag on a sluggish us economy veering closer to a 
recession 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady has said the conflict could 
bring the economys alreadyanemic growth rate closer to zero 
although he says a recession is not inevitable 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the white 
house remains hopeful that the democrats are operating in good 
faith and that well be able to reach an agreement 
we think its even more important that we reach an agreement 
now because there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country 
not only about the conflict in the gulf but also about our 
spending issues and about where the budget is going fitzwater 
said 
bush who had planned to interrupt his vacation anyway to return 
to washington for a pentagon briefing first will go to the white 
house tuesday to meet with treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
budget director richard darman economic adviser michael boskin and 
others 
fitzwater said bush wants some preliminary accounting of the 
persian gulf conflict and whether it may require changes in the 
administrations proposal for reducing next years deficit by 50 
billion 
the plan that we had ready to put on the table still 
represents our best view but were prepared to make changes if we 
think its necessary said the spokesman 
bush and his senior advisers will be talking about cutting 
expenditures overall budget figures taxation policy all those 
kinds of questions fitzwater said 
the budget negotiations begun three months ago came to a 
temporary halt in early august having produced little except an 
agreement to come back to the table when congress and bush return 
from their summer vacations after labor day 
fitzwater said that bush has no plans to meet with the budget 
negotiators again until then but bush probably will speak out 
in the interim about the budget he said 
the president said last week he no longer felt constrained to 
hold his peace about the democrats 
brady in interviews last friday said the surge in oil prices 
could halve the us growth rate this year from 15 percent to 075 
percent he said events make it all the more important to move 
apace on budget cuts 
the administration estimates a fiscal 1991 deficit of 169 
billion not counting an estimated 62 billion more in savings and 
loan bailout costs the negotiators have been trying to cut the 
deficit by 50 billion next year and 500 billion over five years 
bush acknowledged in late june that tax revenue increases 
were necessary and word subsequently leaked that the republicans 
favored raising taxes on alcohol and limiting deductions for state 
and local taxes 
the democrats refused to come forward with a plan of their own 
bush plans to return to maine wednesday after a briefing and a 
speech at the pentagon

federal aviation administrator james busey 
announced monday a freeze on some hiring and said contingency plans 
are being made for sharp cuts if congress fails to pass a fiscal 
1991 budget 
following white house instructions for all departments to plan 
for cuts busey told 50600 faa employees they might face mandatory 
furloughs without pay for 2 days each twoweek pay period and that 
national air traffic would have to be reduced 
busey was speaking of a worstcase scenario in the event that 
automatic spending cuts of 319 percent known as 
sequestration take effect oct 15 that would occur only if 
congress and the white house fail to agree on a package of tax 
increases and spending cuts by oct 15 
the immediate hiring freeze applies only to nonsafetyrelated 
jobs busey told employees in a speech broadcast by closed circuit 
to 30 faa facilities around the country 
busey said automatic cuts affecting faa would total about 25 
billion a year if they went into effect 
he said this would lead to reductions in equipment purchases 
suspension of permanent transfers suspension of training programs 
curtailment of some contracts release of all temporary employees 
and support only for safety activities 
the faa would no longer be able to maintain safety in the skies 
at current levels and flights by airlines businesses and others 
would have to be reduced busey said

programs to help women avoid aids also must 
address other problems the women see as more immediate researchers 
said monday 
talking about condoms with someone who doesnt have a place to 
spend the night is absurd said gloria weissman of the national 
institute on drug abuse in rockville md 
she and other researchers who are studying prevention of aids in 
women discussed the topic at the annual meeting of the american 
psychological association 
aids infection is hardly a primary concern for a woman who is 
hungry without a place to spend the night or to put her children 
to bed or without clothing to keep her warm weissman said 
unless some of these basic and immediate needs can be 
addressed it seems not only hopeless but also foolish to be 
talking about risk reduction and lifesaving measures she said 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome can 
infect a person who injects drugs with a contaminated needle or has 
sex with an infected person several programs around the country 
are trying to block those routes of infection for women 
one problem is that there is no device entirely under a womans 
control that lets her protect herself from infection during 
intercourse said judith cohen of the university of california san 
francisco 
for many women at risk of infection it can be dangerous to 
insist that her male sex partner use a condom or to refuse to have 
sex she said 
they come back the next day as a medical emergency you just 
dont do that in some households she said 
leaving a sexual relationship that poses a threat of infection 
can mean giving up rent money and a food supply she said in 
comparison to those immediate threats concern about aids is kind 
of down the road she said 
prevention programs must address issues of strategies to 
persuade men to put on condoms she said 
as for drug treatment programs weissman said most require that 
a woman find somebody else to care for her children during 
treatment which few women can afford 
and if a woman gets her drugusing male sex partner into 
treatment she must then forgo his economic and emotional support 
weissman said

president bush and his top aides refuse to 
define an interdiction of shipping but the unspoken message to 
skippers is their ships could be boarded shot at or disabled if 
they trade with iraq military experts said on monday 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said no formal instructions had 
been sent to us warship commanders as of monday afternoon but 
shipping was being monitored in the tense waterways near iraq 
we are keeping an eye on all ships in the region williams 
said 
he declined to specify exactly what us commanders would be 
told to do but that the goal of the effort was to comply with the 
un mandated sanctions against trade with iraq 
williams said the pentagon was working on precise plans for 
the operations logistical legal aspects of the interdiction 
effort 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater with bush in 
kennebunkport maine said on monday we have had two or three 
ships in recent hours that have turned away or been turned away or 
at least have otherwise not landed with their cargo 
purposely bush and other administration officials avoid using 
the word blockade since that is widely considered by 
international law to be an act of war 
a former commander of the us forces in the persian gulf gen 
george crist said any interdiction mission will be easily 
accomplished by the us navy forces in the region 
dozens of american vessels have been posted in the 
mediterranean red sea persian gulf and at the mouth of that 
strategic waterway all able to monitor the comings and goings of 
shipping to and from iraq he noted 
using international radio frequencies us commanders will 
query them about their destinations and cargoes crist told cbs 
news 
if it is going to iraq then well ask them to steer clear if 
they keep going we may board to see what their papers look like 
where are they going what kind of cargoes they have crist said 
if the captain of the ship decides he wants to continue in spite 
of the questioning the us commander will move his ship in such a

a 4yearold boy got a transfusion of umbilical 
cord blood from his newborn sister monday in an attempt to cure a 
rare and deadly form of leukemia 
it was the first time such a transfusion had been attempted in 
the past bone marrow transplant has been the only treatment to 
increase survival for patients of leukeumia a cancer of the white 
blood cells 
if the transfusion works doctors said it could lead to the 
creation of a bank of such blood that could be transfused into 
children who might die before a sibling donor would be old enough 
to donate bone marrow 
the patient michael sancilio of virginia beach va was 
diagnosed in april as suffering from juvenile chronic myelogenous 
leukemia it cannot be controlled by drugs and usually kills within 
one year of diagnosis 
when michaels sister christina was born may 1 doctors 
collected blood from the cord hoping she would be a suitable donor 
they couldnt wait to use her bone marrow because such a 
transplant cant be performed on children under sixmonths old and 
doctors feared michael could die by then 
the odds were we thought he had the chance of surviving for a 
couple of months but it was unknown when the disease would 
accelerate and become lifethreatening said dr john wagner of 
the johns hopkins oncology center we decided to go ahead and 
take the chance on the cordblood rather than waiting till the 
donor was old enough 
michaels parents and his brother tony 7 werent compatible 
donors 
wagner injected three syringes of cord blood into a vessel near 
michaels heart as the boy dozed in his bed monday wagner said 
the boy had undergone eight days of chemotherapy to destroy his 
cancerous marrow the transfused cells from christina are expected 
to enter his bones and begin forming cancerfree bone marrow in 30 
days wagner said 
cord blood transplants have been performed successfully twice in 
france and once in cincinnati to treat a different disease 
fanconis anemia hopkins doctors said 
blood in the umbilical cord provides nourishment and oxygen to a 
fetus while being carried inside the mother and so differs from 
the babys or the mothers blood 
dr richard champlin chief of the bone marrow transplant 
program at md anderson cancer center in houston said the 
transplant could have longterm significance 
in the long run it could provide the potential to protect and 
store umbilical blood from every baby and create a bank of cells 
for transplantation that could be used if a patient didnt have a 
donor within the family he said 
we hope it may be able to increase the number of donors 
available for patients but it has to pass this test first 
wagner said 
the transplant carries the same risk as a bonemarrow 
transplant the recipients immunity from infection is lowered 
during the procedure and the body often rejects foreign cells 
umbilical cordblood is particularly rich in stem cells which 
the transplant recipients body uses to form marrow but the blood 
could only be transplanted to young children because it doesnt 
contain enough stem cells to build marrow in the bodies of 
adolescents or adults champlin said 
the transplant also raises ethical questions said dr jeff 
malatack a pediatrician at childrens hospital in pittsburgh 
in suburban los angeles parents conceived a baby last year to 
serve as a donor for their cancerstricken daughter anissa ayala 
18 was expected to receive a bonemarrow transplant from her baby 
sister marissa in late summer or in the fall 
is the parent in the right position to offer the procedure be 
done on a 6monthold to save a 4yearold the question will come 
up within families what if it comes up with an unrelated baby 
said malatack 
malatack posited for example that if parents found umbilical 
cord blood in a bank from a baby they thought had similar tissue to 
their sick child they might try to approach that childs parents 
about a possible bone marrow transplant 
someone could say id like to use your baby to put to sleep 
and do a bone marrow harvest so a baby in some other area of the 
country could benefit he said

iranian leaders on monday rejected iraqi 
president saddam husseins proposal linking a settlement of the 
persian gulf crisis in part with resolution of a border dispute 
with iran tehran television reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted foreign ministry 
spokesman morteza sarmadi as saying linking the withdrawal of 
iraqi troops from iran to other international issues corresponds 
neither to international norms nor to iraqs alleged commitment to 
united nations resolution 598 
the un resolution halted the bloody eightyear war between 
iran and iraq in august 1988 but subsequent peace talks have been 
deadlocked and no formal peace treaty has been signed 
in a statement sunday saddam suggested that all problems of 
occupation in the middle east be resolved together 
saddam indicated he might withdraw his forces from kuwait if 
israel withdrew from occupied arab territories and syria pulled its 
soldiers out of lebanon 
he also called for a settlement of the border dispute with iran 
including a mutual withdrawal of forces on both sides of the 
boundary 
the iraqis insist that a 1975 treaty drawing part of the mutual 
border at midstream in the shattalarab waterway is null and void 
baghdad claims sovereignty over the full strategic waterway that 
links the port of basra with the gulf 
sarmadi said iran complied with un resolution 598 by 
withdrawing its forces to internationally recognized borders 
but he said parts of iranian territory since then have 
remained under iraqi occupation in defiance of the resolutin and 
all international regulations 
he was referring to iranian territory captured in the closing 
weeks of the war that baghdad has refused to relinquish until 
tehran agrees to grant full iraqi sovereignty over the shatt

a visiting us congressman said monday 
chances were slim of forcing iraq to quit kuwait without jordanian 
sanctions the iraqi oil pipeline and road transport between jordan 
and iraq were reported operating normally 
rep stephen j solarz dny said immediately after 
conferring with crown prince hassan brother of king hussein we 
have two overriding interests at present and the first is to secure 
the effective cooperation of jordan in the implementation of 
sanctions against iraq 
the second is to preserve the stability of this country 
he spoke to the associated press on the basman royal palace 
grounds 
iraqs pipeline to jordan terminates at desert outpost h4 
about 30 miles southeast of amman tanker trucks load the petroleum 
there and drive it to the red sea port of aqaba for export some 
oil is kept for jordanian domestic use 
the line is apparently iraqs last remaining oil export outlet 
following the closure in effect earlier monday of a pipeline 
across saudi arabia 
information minister ibrahim izzeddine reiterated monday that 
jordan intends to abide by the mandatory un security resolution 
imposing sanctions on neighboring iraq for its aug 2 invasion and 
annexation of kuwait 
but it is still premature now to decide what sanctions will be 
imposed izzeddine said in view of jordans heavy economic 
dependence on iraq 
in jerusalem israeli officials warned jordan monday not to 
transfer iraqi exports through aqaba saying that would violate 
blockading of iraq binyamin beneliezer deputy chief of the 
israeli parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee 
described aqaba as iraqs lifeline 
official sources at jordans ministry of commerce speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the pipeline was continuing to operate 
normally monday 
solarz said he and hassan discussed the persian gulf crisis 
and the implication for jordanamerican relations as well as the 
peace process between israel and the arab world 
i think it is important that sanctions take effect forthwith 
because they are the last and only remaining way to bring about 
a resolution of the crisis without the use of force solarz said 
if sanctions dont work we will be confronted with the 
necessity of making a choice between capitulation and escalation 
and that is a choice very much in our interest to avoid 
he said that if jordan refuses to cooperate in the sanctions 
there will be little hope of forcing saddam hussein to withdraw 
his forces from kuwait saddam is president of iraq 
hassan said later on jordanian television that we are under 
pressure from all sides from those who want to tell us how to 
conduct our affairs 
jordan will be enormously hurt when it applies sanctions 
against iraq he added speaking in english in an interview with 
a visiting australian tv correspondent 
an iraqi tanker was turned away when it tried to load at the 
saudi pipelines red sea terminal an iraqi pipeline through turkey 
was shut earlier 
the commerce ministry sources said jordan imports nearly 300 
million worth of iraqi oil a year onesixth of it by pipeline and 
the rest overland by tankers 
they said the pipeline was used for much larger quantities 
during the eightyear iraniraq war when iraqs gulf ports were 
blockaded but were unable to give its total capacity 
ap photographer yousef allan at jordans border post of 
ruweishid 210 miles northeast of amman reported commercial 
traffic normal across the border he said a truck or tanker crossed 
into jordan every three or four minutes 
official statistics indicate that 40 percent of jordans exports 
go to iraq mainly agricultural products 
ministry officials said unemployment here now at 16 percent 
would go up 10 to 12 more percentage points if jordan imposes 
sanctions 
jordan is also used extensively as a transit point for 
iraqibound goods 
aqaba port officials reached by telephone said they received no 
instructions to stop unloading ships with iraqbound transit cargo 
and unloading of these ships was continuing normally

president bush and his top aides refuse to 
define an interdiction of shipping but the unspoken message to 
skippers is their ships could be boarded shot at or disabled if 
they trade with iraq military experts said on monday 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said no formal instructions had 
been sent to us warship commanders as of monday afternoon but 
shipping was being monitored in the tense waterways near iraq 
we are keeping an eye on all ships in the region williams 
said 
he declined to specify exactly what us commanders would be 
told to do but that the goal of the effort was to comply with the 
un mandated sanctions against trade with iraq 
williams said the pentagon was working on precise plans for 
the operations logistical legal aspects of the interdiction 
effort 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater with bush in 
kennebunkport maine said on monday we have had two or three 
ships in recent hours that have turned away or been turned away or 
at least have otherwise not landed with their cargo 
purposely bush and other administration officials avoid using 
the word blockade since that is widely considered by 
international law to be an act of war 
a former commander of the us forces in the persian gulf gen 
george crist said any interdiction mission will be easily 
accomplished by the us navy forces in the region 
dozens of american vessels have been posted in the 
mediterranean red sea persian gulf and at the mouth of that 
strategic waterway all able to monitor the comings and goings of 
shipping to and from iraq he noted 
using international radio frequencies us commanders will 
query them about their destinations and cargoes crist told cbs 
news 
if it is going to iraq then well ask them to steer clear if 
they keep going we may board to see what their papers look like 
where are they going what kind of cargoes they have crist said 
if the captain of the ship decides he wants to continue in spite 
of the questioning the us commander will move his ship in such a 
way as to prevent the further passage of the cargo ship and 
advise him nicely would he mind going to another port crist said 
if that doesnt work well probably fire a shot or two just 
to get his attention if necessary well actually land people on 
the ship and move him we also can disable the ship shoot off the 
rudder and he cant go any place the general said

one raging forest fire threatened about 
1600 homes monday in northern california and three major blazes 
remained out of control in yosemite national park 
fourteen major fires and several smaller ones burned across 
california on monday the biggest fire the campbell complex in 
tehama county had charred about 114000 acres officials said 
but firefighters top priority was a smaller tehama county fire 
the 17500acre finley lake fire east of red bluff which 
threatened 400 homes in the town of manton 200 in mineral and an 
additional 1000 in the general area officials said 
loren newman a 73yearold manton resident said he hadnt 
planned to leave his home but as firefighters cut a 30foot wide 
firebreak across his property monday he was reconsidering 
i usually dont get too excited about fires but this one has 
me hemmed in he said theres fire to the west to the south 
and to the east 
elsewhere in the west smaller fires burned in oregon alaska 
washington idaho and utah 
about 1200 soldiers from the armys 9th infantry division at 
fort lewis near tacoma wash shipped out monday to help fight 
fires in oregon maj john lundberg said they were to help dig 
fire lines and relieve fatigued crews battling two big blazes near 
burns ore 
it is the third summer in a row fort lewis troops have been used 
to battle fires they were fought fires in yellowstone national 
park in 1988 and the baker ore area last summer lundberg said 
an estimated 1200 army soldiers from the 4th infantry division 
at fort carson colo were expected to arrive in tuesday in 
northern california where a long drought has heightened fire 
danger 
firefighting in northern california was hampered by an inversion 
layer a layer of cool air holding hot air down that held in 
smoke creating hot and hazy conditions airplanes that bomb the 
fires with a mixture of fire retardant and fertilizer to encourage 
new growth were unable to fly sunday or monday officials said 
because of the thick smoke fire officials had to bring in 
helicopters with infrared sensors to identify hot spots and map 
them for ground crews 
on the finley lake fire firefighters worked monday to create a 
twomilelong defense line in manton burning out a swath that 
hopefully would counter the northbound forest fire and keep it from 
destroying several homes 
manton is our main concern this afternoon theres up to 400 
homes and 1000 people in that area said paul bertagna 
california department of forestry spokesman 
the fire also was nearing lassen national forest near mineral 
and lassen volcanic national park to the north 
manton residents hadnt been evacuated by midday but residents 
were advised to be ready to leave officials said 
manton resident sally beezley decided to leave her home 
i was really calm until last night she said but when you 
see the flames everything changes 
the tops of the trees were on fire and it was close enough so 
you could feel the waves of heat 
farther south in the sierra nevada range three major fires 
still raged monday in yosemite national park where an estimated 
17000 acres had been charred 
yosemite has been offlimits to tourists since friday 
flames in the park were within two miles of merced grove a 
stand of giant sequoia trees up to 2000 years old and also within 
two miles of the badger pass ski area the oldest ski resort in 
california the sequoias were treated with fire retardant but 
their thick bark usually protects them from fire allowing dthem to 
reach their advanced ages 
flames were about 10 miles from landmarks like el capitan half 
dome and yosemite falls 
since aug 3 more than 200000 acres of california forest has 
burned mostly as the result of 31108 lightning strikes forestry 
officials said a total of 127 structures had been lost as of 
monday including 42 from the finley fire collier said

iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz urged 
the arab league to reconsider its decision to transfer its 
headquarters to cairo egypt the official iraqi news agency said 
monday 
also iraqi news reports monitored monday in nicosia said iraq 
has started special voice of arab egypt broadcasts calling for 
an uprising against the government of president hosni mubarak and 
attacks on imperialist targets 
the broadcasts started saturday on frequencies of iraq radios 
domestic service 
a program with the same name was introduced by iraq radio after 
the late egyptian president anwar sadats visit to jerusalem in 
1977 which led to the camp david peace agreement with israel the 
program was later discontinued 
iraq and egypt have been at odds over iraqi president saddam 
husseins invasion of kuwait on aug 2 egypt has sent several 
thousand soldiers to saudi arabia as part of a panarab force to 
deter iraqi aggression 
in a statement carried by the iraqi news agency aziz said the 
arab leagues decision to move its headquarters from the tunisian 
capital of tunis to cairo must be reconsidered due to mubaraks 
biased running of last weeks emergency summit to discuss the 
iraqi invasion 
twelve of the 21 league members voted at the summit to send an 
arab force to the gulf region to protect saudi arabia and other 
threatened states from a possible attack by iraq most league 
members also supported un sanctions against iraq 
the manner in which mubarak ran the meeting was a violation of 
the prevailing methods and norms in interarab relations aziz 
said in the news agency report which was monitored in nicosia 
aziz who attended the summit accused egyptian leaders of 
violating the arab league charter particularly an article which 
requires unanimity for adopting measures against a member state 
he said the iraqi delegation would raise the issue at the next 
meeting of the arab leagues council scheduled for september in 
tunis and demand that the headquarters remain in tunisia 
the league headquarters moved from cairo to tunis in 1979 after 
egypts membership was suspended for signing the peace treaty with 
israel last year the suspension was lifted and the headquarters 
is to move back to its former building on the nile river this fall 
also monday saddam asked iraqis to treat egyptians in his 
country with kindness regardless of differences between their 
countries over the gulf crisis 
there are about 2 million egyptians in iraq mostly workers who 
immigrated during the iraniraq war 
we call on all iraqis due to the present situation to treat 
all arab citizens well regardless of their rulers stand saddam 
said in a letter addressed to the iraqi people contents of the 
letter were reported by the iraqi news agency 
all arab citizens are your brothers it is normal to say that 
not all arab rulers were of our choice part of them were chosen by 
foreigners saddam said 
we call on you specially to treat egyptian citizens with the 
level of my affection and with the level of their kindness and 
their love to iraq he said

us and un officials said monday there 
was no contradiction between the united nations resolution that 
imposed a trade embargo against iraq and president bushs statement 
that food be included in american quarantine efforts 
iraq roundly condemned internationally for its aug 2 invasion 
of neighboring kuwait imports threequarters of its food for its 
17 million residents 
both the un embargo against iraq and the us quarantine 
include all foodstuffs and grain shipments except in cases of 
distress and humanitarian aid un and us officials said monday 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the officials emphasized there was no contradiction between the 
un resolution adopted aug 6 and bushs statement sunday that 
food would be included in quarantine efforts 
the un resolution only exempts food from the embargo in 
humanitarian circumstances it bars the import of food to build 
up iraqi stocks and allows it only when there is serious need 
bush said that food would be covered in us efforts to 
interdict commercial vessels bound for iraq but added that in some 
cases of severe deprivation and need there might be exemptions 
the language in the convoluted un resolution has given rise to 
confusion about inclusion or exclusion of food and un officials 
declined to interpret the language saying the resolution stands 
for itself 
but privately they said the resolution imposes an embargo on all 
foodstuffs except in dire circumstances canada reportedly ordered 
a grain vessel bound for iraq to return recently diplomats said 
section c of the un resolution says that un member states 
should prevent 
the sale or supply by their nationals or from their 
territories or using their flag vessels of any commodities or 
products including weapons or any other military equipment 
whether or note originating in their territories but not including 
supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and in 
humanitarian circumstances foodstuffs to any person or body in 
iraq or kuwait or to any person or body for the purposes of any 
business carried on in or operated from iraq or kuwait and any 
activities by their nationals or in their territories which promote 
or are calculated to promte such saleor supply of such commodities 
or products 
the resolution also bans financial dealings with iraq except 
those intended exclusively for medical or humanitarian purposes and 
in humanitarian circumstances foodstuffs

a small tennessee company is fighting 
the pentagons plan to reduce the size of its 20 million contract 
for chemical protective suits that soldiers might need in the 
middle east 
only weeks before us troops headed to saudi arabia to counter 
iraq and its threat of chemical warfare the army notified camel 
manufacturing co its contract would be reduced from 327000 
protective suits to 81000 
the army claimed that camel one of four companies that makes 
the suits for the military was slow to start making the suits 
company officials blame the government for the delays 
rep james h quillen the senior state republican in congress 
wrote defense secretary dick cheney on monday seeking review of the 
camel case 
the letter stressed how important it is especially during the 
mideast crisis that the contract be turned around quillen said 
let them finish the number of suits that they have been awarded 
company officials are worried they wont have enough capital to 
keep the 250employee newport tenn factory open past september 
camel already has spent most of the 35 million advanced on the 
20 million order 
but company president ben bower said monday that both turkey and 
the united arab emirates were negotiating to buy suits from the 
company 
the suits resemble camouflage fatigues but are lined with 
charcoalimpregnated foam that acts as a filter to absorb poisons 
life inside the suits is roughly 10 degrees hotter than outside 
but thats a small price to pay for survival bower said 
they are not designed to be worn under normal circumstances 
he said they are totally impractical for any other use 
camel which has been producing tents field packs and similar 
goods for the military for 60 years is one of only a few companies 
supplying the army with chemical protection suits 
the others are sac amp fox of oklahoma city okla isratex of 
new york city and national apparel co of birmingham ala 
this is the first time we made these suits bower said as 
a matter of fact the government came to us and asked us to 
participate in this project 
the government had no comment monday 
normally we are very upfront about contractual matters as a 
matter of public record said linda nichols spokeswoman for the 
defense logistics agency an arm of the pentagon but the way 
things are right now we are being very careful about what we say 
in cutting the order the government cited delays in production 
at the newport plant bower said 
production was scheduled to start in july 1989 but didnt begin 
until february about 7500 suits have been made so far in full 
operation the plant is supposed to make 50000 suits a month 
camel contends it would have started production sooner except 
for delays by the armys defense personnel support center in 
philadelphia in inspecting the cloth used in the suits 
bower said his companys contract allowed the center 30 days to 
inspect the materials instead it took six months he said

more than 200 roman catholic bishops 
holding an unusually secretive meeting get their first glimpse 
tuesday of a new antiabortion campaign put together by a public 
relations firm 
an official of the company hired by the bishops hill and 
knowlton said monday they shouldnt expect anything startling 
theres nothing new in this business only new ways of 
packaging said phil armstong a hill and knowlton senior vice 
president 
the twoday meeting of the national council of catholic bishops 
is closed to the press 
church officials said they didnt plan to release a text of a 
speech that was to be delivered monday by cardinal john oconnor 
the archbishop of new york and chairman of the bishops committee 
for prolife activities 
mondays program included conferences speeches and 
antiabortion films according to a participant who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the talks included one titled abortion big business the 
film titles included living proof a visual encounter with the 
unborn and adoption the option of love 
the hill and knowlton campaign is designed to reframe the 
abortion question for both the catholic community and the general 
public said julie sly spokeswoman for the california catholic 
conference 
sly defended the meetings secrecy especially involving the 
hill and knowlton presentation 
they regard this as any other corporation that buys public 
relations services she said they wont release a working 
report to the public it could undermine their campaign 
armstrong said companys presentation would basically involve 
research into public attitudes and show them how to better 
communicate the prolife message 
the bishops also retained the wirthlin group a leading 
republican polling firm that helped ronald reagan win his 1980 
presidential campaign that firm also was expected to deliver a 
report tuesday 
the hiring of hill and knowlton drew criticism from eugene 
kennedy a professor of psychology at loyola university in chicago 
the bishops have found a way to drive the money changers back 
into the temple said kennedy who has written extensively on the 
catholic church in america they are making a terrible mistake 
they are playing in the ballpark of the prochoice people and 
abandoning their real strength which is spiritual and pastoral

about 500 americans have quietly slipped out 
of kuwait since the iraqi conquest of that country circumventing 
an iraqi attempt to prevent westerners from leaving the state 
department said monday 
the departures have lowered the official estimate of americans 
in the iraqiheld country to 2500 spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said 
other officials said the estimate is subject to change because 
precise numbers in such circumstances are hard to come by 
the officials insisting on anonymity said fleeing americans 
have been able to take advantage of lax iraqi security at the final 
check point on kuwaiti territory and enter the relative safety of 
saudi arabia 
but a briton david thomas croskery who apparently tried to 
flee by the same route was shot to death on saturday by iraqi 
troops in kuwait ms tutwiler said the administration was 
shocked and extremely concerned by the incident 
she said there were rumors on sunday that all foreigners were 
being allowed to leave but the administration has been told that 
only africans south asians and latins are being given such 
permission iraqi broadcasts indicate that arabs and east asians 
also have been allowed to depart as well 
false news reports about the opening of the kuwait border with 
saudi arabia to all foreigners prompted 40 to 50 carloads of 
americans to head for the frontier ms tutwiler said 
she urged the media to report such developments with caution 
because the carloads of americans were turned back at the border 
their disappointment aggravated by blistering heat 
the attempted exodus may have been the result of an iraqi 
broadcast on sunday saying the authorities have been instructed to 
facilitate the travel of the arabs and foreign residents in 
kuwait and other cities of southern iraq southern iraq is the 
term iraqis have used to describe what was once kuwait 
besides the americans stranded in kuwait there are an 
additional 500 to 600 who have not been given permission to leave 
iraq with airports closed in both countries and borders sealed to 
westerners the bush administration has become increasingly 
concerned that iraqi president saddam hussein may try to use the 
americans to his political advantage 
still the administration has refused to call the americans in 
the two countries hostages no demands have been made in return for 
their release 
foreigners fleeing kuwait have given mixed reports on the 
situation there some accused iraqi troops of rapes and other 
abuses but others said the iraqis were well disciplined 
on the diplomatic front assistant secretary of state john kelly 
flew to syria on sunday for additional consultations after visits 
to egypt and saudi arabia over the weekend 
ms tutwiler said the meeting with the saudi officials was 
part of our ongoing cooperative efforts with the saudi government 
to confront the threat from iraq and to work towards the immediate 
and unconditional withdrawal of iraq from kuwait and the 
restoration of the legitimate government there 
she said there are conversations almost hourly with iraqi 
officials in baghdad and washington on the situation concerning the 
americans in kuwait and iraq secretary of state james a baker iii 
has called iraqs refusal to allow the americans to leave a 
violation of norms 
baker had been scheduled to leave for his wyoming ranch late 
last week for a vacation but plans to remain here until thursday 
a full communications package will be traveling with him and 
should the need arise he can be back in washington in 
approximately four hours ms tutwiler said

us marines flew helicopters into 
rebelheld territory in liberia on monday to evacuate 97 foreign 
nationals including at least four americans fleeing heavy 
fighting in the capital monrovia 
the evacuees who included the spanish ambassador and the papal 
nuncio to liberia were airlifted during the morning from the port 
of buchanan which is controlled by rebel leader charles taylors 
national patriotic front 
in addition to the americans the evacuees included at least 16 
spaniards 15 west germans as well as smaller numbers of citizens 
of india lebanon switzerland france britain holland and guinea 
there were also 21 liberians mostly dependents of us citizens 
we are very happy to be here our trip was extremely 
difficult said manuel de luna the spanish ambassador his 
nervous face showed signs of relief as he sat in the admirals 
parlor on board the saipan moored four miles off buchanan for the 
evacuation operation 
the foreigners many of whom sought refuge in the west german 
spanish and italian embassies had been trapped on the battle line 
in monrovias eastern suburbs where heavy fighting broke out 
friday after taylors forces attacked government troops rebels 
told local residents to leave the area 
the foreigners left sunday night in a convoy bound for buchanan 
about 90 miles southeast of monrovia 
the rebels insisted that the marines arrive unarmed to carry out 
the evacuation from a beach in buchanan 
while heavily armed rebel troops patrolled the beach the 
evacuees waited in a tropical storm for the helicopters to carry 
them to safety 
among those evacuated was jeanette carter of colorado who 
lectures in anthropology at the university of liberia in monrovia 
people were petrified that the government forces would start 
using rockets to get the rebels out of the area in monrovias 
eastern suburbs she said 
we were frightened of being accused of being rebel 
sympathizers by the government that was a realy worry in case the 
rebels withdrew from an area and the government forces returned 
she said 
efforts to ferry the evacuees on by helicopter from the saipan 
to freetown sierra leone had to be abandoned because of heavy 
rain 
us public affairs officer matthew mcgrath told reporters in 
freetown that only eight of the evacuees were flown to the sierra 
leone capital on monday 
the saipan an amphibious assault helicopter carrier is one of 
four navy ships off liberia with a contingent of about 2100 
marines 
more than 200 marines were airlifted to monrovia on aug 5 to 
evacuate americans and protect the us embassy washington has 
said they would not intervene in the war in which rebels are 
seeking to oust president samuel doe 
prior to mondays operation the united states had only 
evacuated those foreign nationals who could reach the us embassy 
in monrovia the marines also rescued american employees at a voice 
of america relay station and us omega shiptracking station 
behind rebel lines after the evacuations began

opponents of a paid martin luther king holiday 
for state employees filed petitions monday seeking a statewide vote 
on the issue 
the holiday opponents needed 43350 verified voter signatures in 
order to force the referendum the petition filed with the 
secretary of states office carried 71000 names 
former gov evan mecham a leader of forces opposing a paid king 
holiday for state workers told cheering supporters that the slain 
civilrights leader was amply honored by an unpaid sunday holiday 
mecham proclaimed as governor 
i call on everyone to pledge to support the peoples right to 
make the decision and to abide peacefully by that result of the 
peoples vote regardless of which way it goes mecham said 
mechams successor democratic gov rose mofford issued a 
statement meanwhile urging that voters approve the paid holiday and 
predicting that business could suffer if the paid holiday is 
rejected 
the issue has been a sore point in arizona since 1986 when 
democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a king holiday mecham who 
took office in 1987 rescinded the holiday before it could take 
effect 
the ensuing uproar included marches tourist boycotts and 
convention cancellations the furor also fueled a petition drive 
against mecham but he was removed by impeachment on other grounds 
before the recall vote could be held 
in 1989 with backing from mofford legislators created a paid 
king day for state workers by cashing in the states paid columbus 
day holiday 
infuriated italianamerican groups joined forces with 
conservatives who believe there shouldnt be a holiday named for 
king and gathered enough signatures to force a vote on the bill in 
the novembers election 
supporters of a paid holiday the third monday in january marking 
kings birthday went back to the legislature this year and got a 
new bill passed this one would restore columbus day as a paid 
holiday and keep king day as a paid holiday it also would knock 
the referendum on the kingforcolumbus swap off the ballot 
but the 1990 bill is subject to referendum just like the 1989 
one and opponents of king day were given 90 days in which to 
gather at the 43350 signatures required to force a referendum 
some of those who worked on the 1990 referendum drive said they 
believed there shouldnt be a holiday in kings honor because he 
was too liberal and because of stories about his personal life 
others said declined to take a position on king but believed 
voters should have the chance to decide whether to create and pay 
for the holiday 
if the 1990 petitions contain enough valid signatures both the 
1989 and 1990 laws must be placed on the ballot

a federal judge was urged monday to void an 
antiobscenity pledge that artists and institutions must sign 
before they can get grants from the national endowment for the arts 
us district judge louis stanton heard oral arguments in a 
lawsuit by the new school for social research against the 
government agency 
the new school alleges that the pledge is unconstitutionally 
vague and violates free speech and due process 
stanton was to issue a written later 
new schools attorney floyd abrams argued that the requirement 
violates the constitution because grant recipients have to 
speculate as to what the endowment considers obscene 
they have to tell us what is expected of us in a 
constitutionally permissive way abrams said 
he also charged that the right to freedom of speech was 
infringed because he said the antiobscenity ban adopted by 
congress last october was designed to suppress speech the lawmakers 
found offensive 
assistant us attorney allan taffet arguing for the endowment 
made a brief presentation in which he argued that the nea was 
merely enforcing legislation adopted by congress

the kremlin intensified its diplomatic activity 
regarding the persian gulf crisis monday meeting with us 
british and chinese envoys and questioning the iraqi ambassador on 
the exodus of soviets from the region 
a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile expressed skepticism over 
the latest offer by iraqs president saddam hussein to withdraw his 
troops from kuwait 
deputy foreign minister alexander belonogov met us ambassador 
jack matlock british charge daffaires david logan and chinese 
charge daffaires zhang zhen to discuss resolving the conflict in 
the gulf region tass news agency reported no details of the 
meeting were disclosed 
igor belousov the soviet official instructed by president 
mikhail s gorbachev to oversee the evacuation of soviet citizens 
from kuwait and iraq messaged the iraqi leadership on the matter 
tass said without elaboration 
it said belousov also received iraqi ambassador ghafil jassim 
hussain and questioned him on the evacuation 
nearly 9000 soviets including military specialists are among 
the foreigners caught in the two countries following iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh told reporters the soviet 
union continues its contacts with iraq to convince it that 
the actions taken by iraq are futile and that it should pull out 
its troops 
the soviet union did not join the united states in rejecting 
saddams offer to pull his troops out of kuwait 
saddam on sunday linked any iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to an 
israeli pullout from the occupied west bank and gaza strip and a 
syrian withdrawal from lebanon israel took the territories from 
egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the united states and israel quickly rejected the offer but the 
soviet union waited a day and did not condemn it 
we have to see whether the realization of the conditions are 
realistic and its doubtful that its really possible to implement 
the conditions gremitskikh said 
saddams administration received more weapons from the soviet 
union than any other country while the kremlin has condemned his 
invasion of kuwait it is trying not to antagonize arab nations and 
for years has strongly supported their demand for israel to 
withdraw 
the soviet union has sided with the united states overall in the 
conflict jointly supporting un sanctions against iraq and 
stopping weapons supplies to its old ally 
on the growing us military presence in the gulf gremitskikh 
said it was important that the united states does not overstep 
the sensible limit which is necessary to ensure saudi arabias 
sufficient defense 
the defense ministry said in a statement monday that soviet 
military help to iraq was not to be used against third countries 
it said this country in recent times supplied only defense 
technology to iraq

crowds of hungry shantytown dwellers have 
begun raiding trucks carrying food and stripping fields of produce 
on the outskirts of lima and other peruvian cities news reports 
said monday 
the incidents occurred after the government of new president 
alberto fujimori announced harsh austerity measures last wednesday 
to control perus 3000 percent annual inflation rate and its 
debilitating fiscal deficit 
food prices have tripled and in some cases quintupled with the 
elimination of subsidies 
radioprogramas perus leading radio station reported that 
armed gangs were robbing cars and trucks traveling the central 
highway to the mantaro valley located in the andes 120 miles east 
of lima 
the valley one of the most fertile agricultural zones in peru 
is limas breadbasket maoist shining path guerrillas have been 
trying for several years to disrupt agricultural production there 
to heighten the chaos already reigning in the country 
wholesalers in lima said monday that they had halted business in 
the valley because of reports of attacks on food trucks and looting 
in jauja and huancayo the two largest cities in the area 
meanwhile radio stations in the coastal city of chiclayo 410 
miles northwest of lima reported crowds of several hundred people 
were robbing trucks carrying agricultural produce on the 
panamerican highway south of the city 
a newspaper in trujillo perus third largest city 300 miles 
north of lima said crowds were raiding farmland around the city 
stripping the fields of tubers cauliflower tomatoes carrots and 
sweet potatoes

made off with more than 100 sides of beef pork and lamb 
in lima several hundred people with picks and shivels pulled

news reports also said 40 people some with revolvers halted a 
truck before dawn sunday 12 miles north of the capital and stole 
400 chickens being taken to market

a surrogate mother on monday began a 
custody battle with the couple whose testtube fetus she is 
carrying saying they were callous about her health and wouldnt 
provide a good home for the child 
anna johnson 29 is seeking custody of the baby that she could 
deliver in one to two months attorneys on both sides of the case 
said it might establish a new legal definition of parenthood 
it is anna and her body that are responsible for this child 
it is annas position that she is the biological parent 
although she didnt provide the babys genetic material said 
johsons attorney diane marlowe 
johnson a licensed vocational nurse is on disability leave 
because of complications of the pregnancy that twice hospitalized 
her once to receive medication to stop contractions 
in the lawsuit she filed in santa ana superior court monday 
johnson also sought child support and damages for emotional 
distress 
the couple in their mid30s and identified in the lawsuit as 
mark and crispina calvert provided the sperm and egg to create the 
embryo that was then transferred from a laboratory dish to 
johnsons womb mrs calvert was unable to carry a child because 
she had a hysterectomy 
at a news conference they denied johnsons allegations they had 
ignored her medical needs and failed to make timely payments 
mrs calvert said johnson had tried to speed up payment of the 
10000 fee that she was to receive for carrying the baby which 
the couple said is a boy 
i was surprised that she did this to us she said we 
thought that we had a good relationship after all ive done for 
her 
chris and mark both feel their child is being held hostage 
said attorney christian van deusen 
this is still a miracle baby the end results will be worth 
going through what were going through calvert said 
the problem is not money the problem is fetal neglect and 
they will have to address that in court said richard gilbert 
another of johnsons attorneys 
a single parent with a 3yearold daughter johnson said she had 
seen the surrogate contract as a way to put herself through 
graduate nursing school she and mrs calvert also a nurse worked 
at the same hospital in the orange county city of santa ana 
van deusen said johnsons effort to pursue custody of a baby 
that has no biological relation to her is unprecedented 
its definitely going to be new ground turned said van 
deusen this is where the arguments will have to focus what 
constitutes parenthood 
gilbert agreed although california law presumes that the birth 
mother is the legal parent a judge has discretion in deciding a 
case he said 
im sure this will be one of the most difficult decisions the 
judge will ever have to make gilbert said 
in the highly publicized baby m custody case in new jersey the 
child was conceived by a surrogate mother mary beth whitehead 
with the sperm of a man whose wife couldnt have a baby 
whitehead decided to renege on the arrangement prompting a 
bitter custody fight it was won in 1988 by the father william 
stern and his wife elizabeth who live with the 3yearold girl 
in tenafly nj

a general testified on thursday that maj gen 
amram mitzna former army commander of the occupied west bank 
ordered palestinian rioters beaten as punishment in violation of 
army policy at the time 
brig gen benny tahan also told a military court he heard 
mitzna order demonstrators limbs broken according to israel radio 
mitzna was west bank commander when the palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule began in december 1987 
tahan was a defense witness for col yehuda meir 37 who is 
being courtmartialed on charges of ordering soldiers to break the 
bones of palestinian detainees meir faces 20 years in prison if 
convicted the trial resumed monday after a vacation recess

mitzna order beatings to deter and punish he even used the 
expression break their hands and legs 
israeli military authorities introduced beatings to deter arab 
demonstrators a month after the uprising began the practice was 
phased out after proving ineffective and drawing criticism 
as a prosecution witness mitzna testified in may that beatings 
were to be administered solely to disperse protestors and control 
detainees he described meirs actions as blacker than black 
meir swore that former defense minister yitzhak rabin gave 
orders in january 1988 to break the bones of palestinian inciters 
as punishment he said mitzna attended meetings with rabin and did 
not object to the policy of the beatings 
military prosecutors say soldiers acting on meirs orders 
arrested about 21 palestinians in two west bank villages in january 
1988 took them into nearby fields bound and gagged them and beat 
them with rifles and clubs

evidence of alcohol in the blood doesnt 
always mean a person is impaired a behavioral scientist testified 
monday at the trial of three former northwest airlines pilots 
charged with flying while intoxicated 
james wilson a psychology professor at the university of 
colorado at boulder testified for the defense that impairment by 
alcohol varies from person to person some test subjects he said 
have been unimpaired with a bloodalcohol content as high as 10 
percent he said 
everybody is different he said a lot of people dosed 
with alcohol are steadier than a lot of people sober 
wilsons testimony in the trial of capt norman lyle prouse 1st 
officer robert kirchner and flight engineer joseph balzer 
conflicted with the testimony of a prosecution witness herbert 
moskowitz also a behavioral scientist told the federal jury last 
week that all people are impaired beginning with alcohol 
concentrations as low as 01 percent 
the three pilots are accused of flying a boeing 727 on march 8 
from fargo nd to the twin cities while under the influence of 
alcohol they drank the night before at a lounge in moorhead 
bloodalcohol tests taken two hours after flight 650 landed showed 
bloodalcohol concentrations of 13 percent for prouse 08 percent 
for balzer and 06 percent for kirchner 
the pilots are being tried in us district court on charges of 
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol the 
case marks the first time that commercial pilots have been tried 
under the 1988 federal law provision prohibiting operation of a 
common carrier while under the influence of alcohol 
unlike state drunkendriving laws the federal law doesnt 
specify an illegal bloodalcohol content to find the pilots 
guilty jurors must conclude they were impaired by alcohol despite 
their apparently solid performance 
prouse has said he is an alcoholic with a builtup tolerance 
wilson testified that there are three types of tolerance to 
alcohol chronic acute and innate people who drink heavily can 
develop chronic tolerances and the children of alcoholics are 
sometimes innately tolerant of the drug he said 
in addition people can become more tolerant to alcohol during a 
single drinking session he said he said all three types of 
tolerance can be at work in the same person making it possible for 
a drinker to be unimpaired after significant doses of alcohol 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega asked wilson if he 
thought it would be safe for a pilot with a bloodalcohol content 
of 15 percent to fly a passenger jet 
very possibly wilson said 
she asked if it would be more safe if that pilot was an 
alcoholic 
quite likely he said 
thomas burr an expert on alcohol testing who also testified 
monday for the defense said alcohol impaired only about half of 
the people he has seen tested to have bloodalcohol concentrations 
between 05 percent and 08 percent

one of the founders of earth first is 
leaving the radical environmental group because he believes it is 
being pulled too far to the left he said in a report published 
monday 
dave foreman 42 told the santa rosa press democrat the group 
has been tilted beyond its environmental ethic into a leftist 
arena by yippies and hippies 
foreman who once supported republican gov barry goldwater 
said he doesnt want any hard feelings with his fellow 
environmentalists 
i just want a nofault divorce foreman said 
foremans disavowal seemed to threaten a split within earth 
first a looseknit movement that hasnt got a formal membership 
list but circulates a monthly journal to at least 15000 people 
foreman maintained that the movements emerging leaders 
including the northern california promoters of the redwood summer 
campaign to disrupt logging are more interested in the wildness 
within than the wildness out in the forests 
he said he began to pull back from his highly visible role in 
earth first a few years ago partly because of his disenchantment 
with the growing influence of activists like movement cofounder 
mike roselle of berkeley and judi bari of mendocino county 
im not feeling we share the same style foreman said we 
have very different strategies 
earth first is generally split into two factions one of which 
wants to stick to the original goal of disrupting activities seen 
as harmful to nature the other based in northern california 
prefers more traditional peaceful protests but also would broaden 
its activism to wider social issues 
several followers and key organizers including foreman are 
either under indictment or face possible criminal charges stemming 
from pipe bombings tree spikings and an alleged plot to shut down 
nuclear plants in arizona california and colorado 
in may bari and group member darryl cheney were injured when a 
pipe bomb exploded in her car 
dave foreman wants earth first to remain small pure and 
radical i want it to be big impure and radical said bari she 
said she wants to go beyond ecodefense tactics like tree 
spiking and vandalizing heavyduty logging equipment 
profound social changes dont come about without a mass 
movement she said 
roselle accused foreman of redbaiting and said he was a 
retired old man out on the lecture circuit 
we dont need foreman in earth first if hes going to be an 
unrepentant rightwing thug roselle said were going to keep 
doing what we think is best and thats raise these issues and 
confront the industries that are trying to exploit our last wild 
lands 
foreman a former lobbyist helped found earth first a decade 
ago with four other conservationists he said he may issue a public 
letter of resignation this week 
despite the leadership split roselle said the fastchanging 
earth first movement retains a formidable grassroots nationwide 
network thats intent on saving wilderness and oldgrowth forests 
thats been our priority and will remain so

the persian gulf war of wills settled into one of economic 
attrition monday as an iraqi oil tanker was unable to dock or load 
at a saudi arabian port a barricade of us warships stood ready 
to block all trade with iraq 
the purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch on them so 
the iraqis cannot maintain their war machine said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
you dont give them the essentials that enable them to carry 
on the war fitzwater said he said the embargo covers food 
imports as well as military supplies and other goods 
an international quarantine was imposed against iraq for its 
lightning conquest of kuwait and its massing of troops near saudi 
arabia which has the worlds largest oil reserves iraqi president 
saddam hussein launched the aug 2 blitzkrieg in a dispute over 
oil land and money 
the new york times in tuesdays editions reported iraq had 
transferred 3 billion to 4 billion in confiscated gold bullion 
currency and goods from kuwaiti institutions to baghdad sizeably 
increasing its financial reserves the paper quoted arab bankers in 
london and the gulf in its report 
fitzwater said the naval barricade against iraq had forced two 
or three ships to turn back at sea and the embargo is being 
maintained on shipping into and out of iraq 
pakistan voted to send troops monday to help defend saudi 
arabia joining ground forces from the united states egypt 
morocco and syria squadrons of warplanes and a multinational 
armada joined monday by warships from belgium and the netherlands 
have also massed in the region since the invasion 
i think our position grows stronger with each day that goes 
by said maj gen don l kaufman chief of the us military 
training mission to saudi arabia he said planes ferrying us 
troops and equipment were landing every 10 minutes or so at a base 
in the desert 
saddam called for a holy war against the saudi royalty and 
western forces now gathering over the weekend he asked iraqis to 
cut their meat consumption by half and refrain from hoarding food 
black marketeers will be executed he warned 
the iraqi tanker alqaddisiyah which can hold 900000 barrels 
of oil was prevented from docking at the saudi terminal at yanbu 
on the red sea because tugs necessary to guide ships did not 
appear according to saudi diplomatic sources who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
if tankers cannot load it cuts off in effect iraqs last 
major oil export outlet a pipeline across the arabian peninsula 
from iraq turkey closed two pipelines carrying iraqi oil last 
week however a smaller iraqi pipeline to jordan was reported 
operating normally monday 
earlier two other tankers voluntarily joined the boycott ships 
from norway and india were scheduled to fill up at the yanbu 
terminal but the customers did not show up after the un 
resolution 
also the iraqi oil tanker tarik ibn ziyad was denied access to 
a portuguese repair yard and cruised toward international waters 
officials said in lisbon the work was contracted before the 
crisis but portugal said it would violate a trade embargo 
economic sanctions against iraq were imposed by the united 
nations and endorsed by 12 members of the arab league besides the 
pipeline normal road transport was reported continuing between 
iraq and jordan a friendly neighbor on iraqs western border 
jordans main exports to iraq are agricultural 
iraq is heavily dependent on oil exports to buy food it 
imports about threequarters of its basic foodstuffs and supplies 
for its 17 million people an international quarantine is designed 
to hurt iraq economically and force it to withdraw from kuwait 
in an associated press poll 64 percent of the americans 
contacted supported bushs decision to commit us troops to 
protect saudi arabia 
however 86 percent said oil companies were taking advantage of 
the situation when they raised gasoline prices and 52 percent said 
they believe the gulf crisis is likely to create real oil shortages 
and long lines at service stations 
meanwhile the japanese trade ministry made some belttightening 
proposals to save oil it asked that office thermostats be set no 
lower than 82 degrees and that lighting be reduced by onethird 
about 70 percent of the countrys oil comes from the middle east 
president bush said the us navy would halt iraqi tankers to 
stop the oil from coming out britain and australia also said 
they would help interdict iraqi ships 
the united states said such action is authorized by the un 
vote condemning iraqs invasion but referred to it as an 
interdiction rather than a blockade which is a word used in time 
of war 
bush vacationing in kennebunkport maine will return to 
washington tuesday for two days of talks on the gulf crisis and the 
us budget deficit 
in a related development bush ordered defense secretary dick 
cheney to fly to saudi arabia on friday and meet with the kingdoms 
leaders the pentagon said monday it will be his second trip to 
the region since the invasion and followup blockade 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said monday only 
the security council has the right to impose a blockade 
the security council is awaiting a report from a special 
committee about compliance with the embargo before deciding whether 
to call for a blockade to enforce the embargo 
both the un embargo and the us quarantine include all 
foodstuffs and grain shipments except in cases of distress and 
humanitarian aid un and us officials at the united nations 
emphasized on monday speaking on condition of anonymity 
in jordan border officials said 30 soviets and four germans 
crossed from iraq after an overland journey through the desert 
up to 3100 americans are among the foreigners trapped inside 
iraq and kuwait the state department said monday about 500 
americans quietly slipped out of kuwait after the iraqi conquest 
lowering to 2500 the official estimate of americans still there 
up to 600 americans remain stranded in iraq 
a trickle of american diplomatic personnel was allowed to leave 
iraq but it does not appear that any nonofficial citizens are 
being allowed to leave fitzwater said 
meanwhile yemen on monday backed saddams peace initiative that 
linked a settlement of the gulf crisis to israels withdrawal from 
arab territories occupied in the 1967 war israel and the united 
states rejected the idea 
tehran tv monitored in cyprus said iranian leaders on monday 
rejected saddams proposal linking a settlement of the crisis in 
part with resolution of a border dispute with iran 
thousands marched in prosaddam rallies in the israelioccupied 
west bank and celebrated him as a national hero who would deliver 
by force what diplomacy failed to achieve 
several thousand sudanese marched monday through khartoum in 
support of saddam and demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops 
from arab lands the demonstrators marched to the american embassy 
where they chanted down down usa go away cia

real estate sign drew cheers and applause as he told town 
residents the signs are unsightly and should be banned 
the fault is with the town for 90 percent of this pollution 
anselmo said referring to the signs 
the signs are just the tip of the iceberg in the destruction 
of the towns pristine landscape he said 
they greenwich residents didnt move here to live in a sea 
of signs he said drawing loud applause

spray paint and was charged with thirddegree criminal mischief in 
the incident 
out of dozens of speakers only one supported of signs 
benjamin rowe of preferred properties said anselmo had painted 
one of his signs 
mr anselmo is probably a saint to everybody but im the guy 
whos had his sign painted on so i dont love him rowe said 
at that point someone in the crowd yelled take up a 
collection 
the towns zoning regulations say homeowners can place signs on 
their land but cannot place them on townowned property which is 
the land adjacent to the road 
anselmo who has lived in town for 23 years last year donated 
40000 to the town to plant trees and pays annually for the 
planting of flowers on town property

american journalists accompanied the troops the reporters were 
selected in advance by their employers and pledged to keep their 
movement secret to protect the security of the military operation

public interest in the middle east crisis 
boosted the ratings for the three network evening news shows by 15 
percent aug 6 through aug 8 a cbs research executive said 
the 24hour cable news network also said its coverage has 
boosted ratings with the highest daily average recorded on aug 8

double cnns audience this quarter 
that rating based on nielsen audience estimates was cnns 
highest since its coverage of the us invasion of panama last 
december said cnn spokesman john bianchi 
the american public is definitely interested in the middle 
east story said david poltrack cbs senior vice president for 
research citing preliminary overnight ratings from 24 major cities

overnight ratings compared with those for the same threeday period 
in the preceding two weeks he said 
abcs world news tonight and nbc nightly news were up 16 
percent and 8 percent respectively he said 
its conceivable that the three network news ratings will 
beat those of this weeks primetime programs when the weeks 
national ratings are averaged out and based on these numbers it 
should he said 
cbs anchorman dan rather who cut short a vacation in france 
when iraq invaded kuwait has been among cbs overseas staffers 
reporting the story with rather working from jordan

voice of america and the bbc increased their 
arabiclanguage broadcasts after the iraqi invasion of kuwait and 
iraq began jamming both services 
the broadcasts have been heavy on news about the invasion and 
international efforts to punish president saddam hussein 
the us service was trying to bypass the interruption by 
beaming its programs to iraq through satellite television 
broadcasts voa deputy director robert coonrod said iraqis can tune 
in if they have a satellite dish or access to one through a local 
tv station 
satellite transmissions too can be jammed but experts say 
iraq would need to jam the entire indian ocean satellite in order 
to block voa 
the englishlanguage programs of the voa and bbc have not been 
blocked coonrod said aug 7 
voa increased the number of hours it broadcasts in arabic to the 
middle east from 7 daily to nearly 10 and replaced music programs 
with more news 
the bbc expanded its arabiclanguage broadcasts from nine to 10 
hours 
jamming the bbc is always the last resort of those who wish to 
suppress the truth and in a way it is a tribute to the role of 
the world service at times of crisis said david witherow deputy 
managing director of the bbc world service 
jamming is never entirely effective and i am sure that 
listeners throughout the region are relying on the bbc for news

the military clampdown on information 
about the deployment of troops to the middle east is the tightest 
in years say reporters staking out this sprawling army post

generic terms scheduling briefings on the history climate and 
culture of saudi arabia and bringing in army chemical weapons 
experts

of 82nd airborne troops to the middle east leaving the news media 
to sift through rumors 
michael rouse executive editor of the fayetteville

he attributed the tense security position to irresponsible 
acts of the media 
some of these people from outside this area do something 
really stupid like film troops when theyre getting ready to move 
out when nothing has been announced he said that doesnt add 
a damn thing to any of us getting anything 
but tom lawrence a reporter for raleigh television station 
wral said the military differentiates between the general public 
and reporters 
civilians with a home camcorder could drive through the base 
and shoot anything lawrence said on the other hand the news

the houston chronicle says it will appeal a state 
appeals court ruling blocking it from seeing the college 
transcripts of local school administrators 
a threejudge panel of the 1st court of appeals held unanimously 
aug 9 that an amendment to the state open records statute exempts 
the transcripts from public scrutiny 
the amendment was enacted at the request of the houston 
independent school district that request came after the chronicle 
asked to see the records and after the state attorney general and a 
district court had agreed they were public record 
the aspect of this litigation that continues to be distressing 
is the extent and the public expense to which the district goes in 
order to operate in secret said chronicle managing editor tony 
pederson 
hisd superintendent joan raymond declined comment 
the chronicle request stemmed from an investigation that showed 
that at least 25 highranking school officials had obtained 
worthless college degrees by mail

a state supreme court justice on aug 9 
stalled an attempt by prosecutors to force a television station to 
hand over portions of an interview tape with a crime suspect that 
were not broadcast 
kevin e gendron was sentenced to three years in prison after 
pleading no contest to a charge he improperly dumped more than 200 
containers of paints and thinners 
gendron called wjartv and gave an interview before surrendering 
to authorities 
superior court judge anthony a giannini ruled earlier that the 
rhode island reporters shield law did not apply to broadcast 
portions of the videotaped interview that were not broadcast the 
judge said wjar could not claim confidentiality because gendron had 
invited the interview 
of more concern to news executives however was gianninis 
broader ruling that even if there had been confidentiality 
concerns parts of the shield law that kept such materials from 
grand juries were unconstitutional 
prosecutors have said the videotape is needed for a grand jury 
investigation 
justice donald shea delayed enforcement of gianninis order 
until the supreme court decides whether to hear the stations 
appeal sheas order provided no comment on the merits of the case 
larry price the stations news director said he was encouraged 
by sheas order because it would seem to indicate some interest 
in the supreme court in hearing the appeal so were optimistic

two city councilors blasted the new mexican 
newspaper for handing out flyers urging motorists buying papers 
from street vendors to support a fight to keep the vendors 
the citys public safety committee on aug 6 adopted a 
recommendation by the city attorney to bar vendors from santa fe 
streets because of liability concerns 
the new mexican the only santa fe newspaper that uses vendors 
contends street sales are not a traffic hazard and that a ban would 
serve only to put the vendors many of whom are homeless out of 
work 
on aug 8 vendors distributed flyers headed help us save our 
jobs and listing the home and work telephone numbers of mayor 
sam pick city manager suzanne huebner and the eight city 
councilors 
but councilor peso chavez told a council meeting that night that 
its not professional for a reputable newspaper to publish 
something without giving the public all the facts 
chavez said it was never the intent to do away with anyones 
job adding if its the new mexicans job to be humanitarian 
they should find these people jobs inside 
and councilor ouida macgregor who said she had been leaning in 
favor of the vendors until she saw the flyers said the newspaper 
knew better than to give people the scare that their jobs would 
disappear 
a secretary in the mayors office said about 125 calls were 
logged by midafternoon most in support of the vendors 
the flyers also suggested people who could not reach their 
councilor attend the council meeting to speak on the issue but

the san francisco examiner in one of the 
first prolegalization editorials by a bigcity newspaper said 
aug 12 that the sale and use of drugs should be made legal in the 
united states 
an editorial called the federal war against drugs a colossal 
waste of effort money and human resources 
all antidrug laws should be repealed it said the war on 
drugs should be called off just declare victory play 76 
trombones and march out it always gets applause 
the newspaper noted that the federal government recently 
finished a muchpublicized sweep against marijuana plantations in 
humboldt county about 200 miles north of san francisco 
the operation was termed a success by federal officials the 
examiner noted although the 1400 marijuana plants destroyed was 
not enough to put a dent in the supply of marijuana 
any way you slice it there is no denying that this 
politiciandeclared war has been just about effective as the war on 
poverty the war on crime and the war on cancer put together which 
is to say a complete defeat the editorial said 
the time has come to legalize the sale and use of drugs treat 
them all like alcohol which is legal though its sale is subject to 
controls

a federal judge aug 11 directed the state to 
dissolve a board of inquiry it convened to investigate a contract 
dispute between the daily news and 10 labor unions 
us district judge kenneth conboy in granting the newspapers 
motion for a preliminary injunction agreed it would be 
irreparably harmed if the state factfinding panel proceeded 
with its investigation 
an inquiry by the board would destroy any atmosphere of frank 
and open discussions and could force the news to divulge 
confidential or proprietary information the judge wrote 
the decision also said the newspaper was likely to succeed in 
its argument that state labor law which provides for the 
establishment of such a panel is preempted by the national labor 
relations act 
daily news spokeswoman virginia woo said the newspaper does not 
comment on ongoing litigation 
state labor commissioner thomas hartnett formed the threemember 
board in july to look into the labor talks at the news the panel 
has the power to issue subpoenas and take sworn testimony but 
cannot mandate a settlement 
the news and its unions have een negotiating for six months

a set of doonesbury comics 
containing suggestive language and showing a woman wearing nothing 
but rope and a bucket is in poor taste say two newspaper editors 
who pulled the strips 
if we had been running it on the oped page we probably would 
have thought differently about it said phil record associate 
executive editor of the fort worth texas startelegram but we 
just did not think this was suitable on a page we try to draw kids 
to 
the newspaper said aug 6 it was not publishing doonesbury 
strips that week and notified readers they could pick up copies at 
newspaper offices 
the republic in columbus ind also decided to drop the strips 
the newspaper planned to run old doonesbury comics instead 
editor john harmon said 
it just didnt meet our guidelines for taste he said if 
our photographers came back with something like that we wouldnt 
run it 
the baton rouge la statetimes and morning advocate decided 
to run the strip opposite the editorial page rather than on the 
comics page 
it contains language and art that i would be very reluctant to 
invite children to look at said jim hughes executive editor 
and children read the comics page 
the strip by garry trudeau apparently referred to the 
controversy over national endowment of the arts funding some 
politicians have tried to block government money going to art they 
consider obscene and some artists have lost grants 
in the aug 6 strip the character jj tells her husband she 
has a new concept for performance art so innovative that the nea 
will have to reconsider her grant application 
she is covered only by a strategically placed rope and her hand 
and she has a bucket over her head 
in strips for later in the week jj utters words such as 
ooze lubricate and hot juices although she makes no 
direct reference to sex acts 
lee salem editorial director at the strips distributor 
universal press syndicate said only about eight to 10 newspapers 
called with concerns the kansas city company distributes the strip 
to about 1000 newspapers

on a soundstage west of london actor 
beau bridges was ordered to keep the menace on 
otherwise the scene sags director frederic raphael told 
the 48yearold actor who was sizing up a potentially available 
elizabeth mcgovern on a train heading westward across the united 
states 
it was the 12th take of a scene that depends largely on innuendo 
and the unspoken and raphael and his actors are determined to get 
it right minutes later a satisfied beam spreads across the face 
of the lanky chicagoborn briton listening to the tape playback 
he has decided that all is well 
the results can be seen aug 19 on home box office women and 
men a 90minute film consists of three dramatized short stories 
dorothy parkers dusk before fireworks ernest hemingways 
hills like white elephants and mary mccarthys the man in 
the brooks brothers suit 
with producer david brown and 75 executives from hbo its 
the biggest production since intolerance dw griffiths epic 
1916 silent film joked raphael 59 
he was speaking at the end of a january days filming on the 
man in the brooks brothers suit which he adapted and directed 
it is his first tv work since after the war the acclaimed 
british miniseries based on his novel and aired in the united 
states at the beginning of the year 
david brown asked raphael to adapt the short story written in 
1941 for partisan review magazine 
writing tv for hbo for someone else to direct is not exactly 
my idea of heaven said raphael who was eager to take on both 
tasks 
i mean theres always some reason why i spend my life 
teaching what im afraid i now think of as kids what i meant and 
why i meant it and why their view of it is wrong he said so 
when it was put to me to do this i couldnt really refuse 
all three women and men segments have attracted topdrawer 
talent hills like white elephants filmed last december in 
spain pairs oscar nominees melanie griffith working girl and 
james woods salvador under the direction of tony richardson 
who won the 1963 academy award for tom jones 
dusk before fireworks directed by ken russell teams peter 
weller as the slickhaired gigolo hobie and molly ringwald as his 
satin doll kit 
im almost schizophrenic in it ringwald said during a break 
in shooting she was decked out in silk and satin and beads to play 
a wouldbe sophisticate 
one scene im calm and charming the next im angry i hope 
people will like kit enough or understand her enough to forgive 
her her mood changes she said 
brown said the three stories were linked only in a random 
way 
theyre all about the malefemale relationship the battle of 
the sexes if you will said brown whose credits include the hit 
films jaws and the sting as well as the current broadway 
plays a few good men and tru 
women and men has been budgeted at just under 3 
million brown said he is interested in having nora ephron and 
woody allen among others adapt stories for future telefilms 
the idea was that most of us in show business dont always get 
to do the things that interest us that much he said id like 
to do films i would personally see 
anthology films inevitably invite comparisons among the 
participants brown said though we dont wish them to be in 
competition 
frederic raphael said of such comparisons it matters to me 
because in life nearly everything matters unfortunately 
but if tony and ken turn out to be better directors than me 
my mother and i are the only people who are going to break our 
hearts about it he said my wife most certainly is not

the race between us rep denny smith and 
democratic challenger mike kopetski has turned into a namecalling 
grudge match focusing on some of this years hottest campaign 
issues taxes abortion and the savings and loan mess 
smith running for a sixth term calls kopetski a taxhappy 
extreme liberal whos been using dirty tricks to win a seat in 
congress 
kopetski says smith is the one whos been waging a dirty 
campaign in an effort to hide his own unethical conduct in 
office 
smith was shocked two years ago when kopetski came within 707 
votes of ousting him from the 5th district seat this year smith 
is under even greater pressure the staunchly antiabortion 
congressman has been targeted for defeat by national prochoice 
groups and hes been linked to the national savingsandloan 
scandal 
combined those factors make smith one of the most vulnerable 
house incumbents and that may explain why the campaigns have 
turned so nasty 
smith agrees that discussions have gone beyond the issues 
we have sensed that kopetskis campaign staff hates us the 
republican congressman said i do sense his animosity and the 
animosity of his campaign 
kopetski who served in the oregon house from 1985 to 1987 said 
he harbors no ill will against smith personally but is irritated 
by the very negative very dirty campaign smith is waging 
against him 
he really set the tone early on kopetski said hes 
broken new ground on negative campaigning 
the war of words is likely to escalate after labor day when 
kopetski plans to begin hitting hard on what could be his 
campaigns most potent issue smiths involvement in the nations 
savings and loan mess 
abortion also looms large as an issue and not just because 
national groups are interested in the race oregon voters 
generally considered prochoice will be asked to decide on two 
ballot issues that would restrict access to abortions 
the populous 5th district stretches from south of portland 
through the willamette valley and includes the state capital of 
salem there is no heavy industry and many people in the district 
work in agriculture academics and state government 
but its hard to tell how voters are reacting because there 
havent been any significant independent polls on the race 
in a series of newspaper and radio advertisements smith painted 
kopetski as a taxandspend political liberal whos soft on crime 
and who wants to lock away more old growth forests at the expense 
of timber worker jobs 
kopetski cried foul saying that the ads contained distortions 
and lies 
smith however said he intends to keep running advertisements 
that highlight kopetskis record as a twoterm state representative 
what is dirty about saying mike voted 39 out of 42 times to 
raise your taxes while he was in the legislature smith said 
he needs to be smoked out on these issues 
the more people see of mike kopetski and the more they ask of 
his record the better chance i have to get more votes he said 
the kopetski campaign has countered with the charge that smith 
has been improperly using a congressional staff employee and an 
office fax machine for his political campaign 
smith denied any wrongdoing and has challenged kopetski to put 
up or shut up by filing a complaint with the house ethics 
committee 
a more serious attack on smiths integrity could spring from 
disclosures last december that he lobbied for protection of 
directors of troubled savings and loan institutions while he was 
one such director 
the issue is a sensitive one for smith because taxpayers are 
being asked to foot the bill for 500billion bailout which 
results from wholesale failures in the savings and loan industry 
kopetski hasnt said much publicly about the savings and loan 
issue but he said that will change once the fall campaign season 
is in full swing 
starting after labor day of course were going to be talking 
about his involvement in savings and loan the keizer democrat 
said 
kopetski said his campaign would work to get the message across 
to 5th district residents that their member of congress used his 
office for private personal gain he had his own interests at 
heart 
theres a serious question of whether he violated the ethical 
standards of congress he said 
smith said he only went to bat for savings and loan directors 
who were being hounded by federal regulators and that hes ready to 
defend his conduct to district voters 
im not ashamed of anything ive done he said i didnt 
take any jet airplane rides didnt stay in anybodys condominium 
i didnt do anything wrong and i have nothing to apologize to 
my constituents for except that i didnt make more noise and get 
these regulators removed 
smith said hes also prepared to defend his longheld stand 
against abortion which he doesnt consider a major campaign issue 
i dont sense that thats the most important issue to 
people he said

editors note although still a little cloud on the horizon 
the formation of white student unions is causing concern on already 
fragmented us college campuses are they the wave of the future 
a reaction to affirmative action programs or are they just a

another hot night is closing in on mark 
wright outside his apartment at a complex for married students at 
the university of florida black parents are coaxing their children 
indoors from the swimming pool he can hear neighbors bid goodnight 
in spanish 
mark wright lives here but he is not one of them 
i guess were the last group to say were a victi said 
wright a 23yearold engineering student who is inching his way 
out of the working class apart from the worry that pinches his 
face and a stomach ache that could be the start of an ulcer wright 
looks like he has nothing to complain about but he does 
his problem he says is that he is white 
thats why he formed a white student union 
americans are notorious for their shortsightedness when we 
whites become minorities the belief systems will be entrenched 
for discriminating against whites said wright fingering a white 
and blue bumper sticker from the us senate campaign of david 
duke the former ku klux klan leader turned louisiana legislator 
a lot of whites like me dont make it here he said were 
fighting for white civil rights 
a small but persistent and growing movement white student 
unions are another sliver in the fragmenting of campus life in the 
united states 
the backdrop to the movement is a contemporary college campus no 
longer dominated by white men it reflects the nations racial and 
ethnic mix in california for instance its easy to find 
fouryear colleges where caucasian describes just half the student 
body if that the university of california at los angeles the 
university of california at berkeley and california state 
polytechnic university at pomona to name a few 
one result is an array of student unions and associations formed 
along racial and ethnic lines africanamericans native americans 
hispanics asianamericans filipinos pacific asians and the like 
find strength by banding together besides the social benefits of 
such unions students who align themselves this way find a new 
identity asking for more teachers and a curriculum that teaches 
them about their particular heritage 
its the first time for many to stop feeling like an invisible 
minority and start gaining pride in an identity 
these groups follow on an older tradition of students forming 
alliances along religious lines such as newman centers for roman 
catholics and hillel clubs for jews 
the current fragmenting alarms educators but there is good news 
on campus too many college students of all colors and backgrounds 
are finding common ground in a new enthusiasm for volunteer 
projects students are finding that in helping others they are 
helping each other scale high social walls 
though white student unions so far have raised more derision 
than members the groups are staking a claim in the collegiate 
mainstream at least two unions at the university of florida and 
at temple university in philadelphia are officially registered as 
student activities though the latter seems to have disappeared 
from that campus 
white unions are also forming at suffolk university in boston 
the university of southwestern louisiana tulane university and the 
university of new orleans the wouldbe founder at the latter is 
howie farrell jr the son of david dukes campaign manager 
their stated purpose is opposing affirmative action policies as 
unfair and unnecessary and saving what they call white culture 
whites are the new losers they say 
critics call them racist others find their claims of antiwhite 
oppression ludicrous 
but if they are chastised as bigots and laughed at for saying 
whites need defending white student unions should not be dismissed 
as some silly fringe observers and educators say since they 
express a resentment of quotas financial aid and scholarships they 
claim favor blacks and other minorities 
white student unions are indicative of a larger problem 
said leonard zeskind research director for the center for 
democratic renewal which tracks and responds to hate groups 
the real cause for concern is that certain elements of the 
next generation of young whites will not have a commitment to 
racial justice and political pluralism and democratic values he 
said 
it is worrisome zeskind added that the founders of white 
student unions are those who will be in the professional ranks 
take stephen heaslip a 20yearold junior at suffolk university 
who is considering a law career he is organizing a white student 
union at the private boston school and hopes to have an adviser 
next year 
i got the idea from reading our school newspaper which had a 
lot of racially based articles heaslip said black this black 
that id see in the paper youd have to be a minority to get 
certain scholarships that brought about feelings i was being 
discriminated against because im white 
theres been discrimination against blacks and jews and 
irish heaslip said but this is governmentmandated racism 
as a wider assortment of people go to college tensions and even 
open hostility threaten a happy picture of democracy in action 
this mutual aid and comfort has another side to it said 
reginald wilson senior scholar at the american council on 
education and expert on minorities in higher education it serves 
a purpose of raising pride and then it can reach a xenophobic 
point he said not a pride in who you are but rejecting who 
you aint 
he pointed out that the present course of equal opportunity was 
set in a time of economic optimism that is no more 
in the 60s the economy was expanding and colleges were 
opening up and more spaces were created in universities nearly 800 
campuses were built in a 20year span higher education was 
bursting all over the place wilson said 
new laws demanded an end to bias in admissions and in the hiring 
of minorities when they graduated 
today higher education costs more no one is building colleges 
and competition for existing places in college and afterward is 
fierce 
we could be heading back into an era where there would be very 
serious conflict on campus wilson said 
that conflict has sometimes evolved into violence 
a black fraternity is burned to the ground at the university of 
mississippi the native american community council president at 
macalester college in minnesota receives hate mail the university 
of michigan at ann arbor is the scene of protests and violence 
between arabs and jews over the issues of zionism antisemitism 
and palestinian rights a laundry ticket is tacked to the bulletin 
board used by a club for asian pacific law students at new york 
university blacks are mocked and assaulted at any number of 
campuses 
even at its most benign todays campus is a place of cliques 
and special interest groups 
noting this trend the carnegie foundation for the advancement 
of teaching issued a special report this year about the growing 
fragmentation on campuses along racial and ethnic lines 
communication is frequently breaking down and prejudices are 
reinforced said foundation president ernest boyer from his 
office in princeton nj this is an ominous trend in the society 
at large if the university cant define itself higher you dont 
have much hope for the city streets he said 
more

some of the white student unions still being formed are simply 
trying to find a faculty adviser others are awaiting official 
recognition come fall or to gain enough members to make their 
entrance felt 
so far they are attracting few active members wrights has 
about 10 since its founding last december a pattern for the unions 
and white supremacist efforts is that they are either squelched or 
forced underground by opponents 
the unions which are connected by an informal network keep 
their distance from white supremacists at least publicly open 
association with hate groups could cost them the credibility they 
covet 
yet the ku klux klan has shown interest and already has caused 
trouble for the florida group when a former klan leader asked 
wright for a copy of the unions constitution he got it but the 
unions faculty adviser promptly resigned the union must find a 
replacement to maintain official status 
a respected state institution the university of florida was 
once a preserve of the states white establishment now there are 
unwelcome sentiments and tensions on the campus where under shade 
trees dripping with spanish moss the 34000 students 7000 
minority members among them usually mingle with a polite civility 
the white student unions first meeting in january attracted 60 
protesters white and black who wrangled with wright and his 
supporters in emotional debate the second meeting ended early when 
a similar scene occurred 
the next month the moribund campus coalition against bigotry 
regrouped and staged an antiracist protest 
black students react with puzzlement and dismay that the bad old 
days may be coming back 
to me it was kind of funny said brian coe a 21yearold 
senior planning to teach special education but he was disappointed 
it gained official status i thought if they can let something 
like that form whats next 
up north the city of brotherly love didnt do it for michael 
spletzer 
while studying architecture at temple university a few years 
ago he assessed his opportunities as a white man and decided he 
was losing his edge and needed a platform to defend his rights 
so in 1988 he prevailed on the university to allow him to 
register the countrys first white student union 
spletzer who graduated this spring keeps in touch with kristl 
wiernicki dean of students at temple wiernicki decided that once 
the white student union met school requirements getting an adviser 
and drafting a suitable constitution she was obliged to let it 
register at temple which has 34000 students nearly 25 percent 
are racial minorities 
wiernicki said that after the white student unions initial 
stormy recruitment effort when students of all colors tangled with 
the union in loud public debate it vanished from campus 
she regards the white student union as a passing trend but says 
it was also important not to ignore what spletzer and his 
apparently few comrades were after what spletzer was saying was 
we dont want you to lose sight of us wiernicki adds 
a recent visit to the temple campus seemed to confirm 
wiernickis assessment 
freshmen had scarcely heard of the union older students said it 
hasnt been heard from in a long time 
on the urban campus where every identifiable group seems to 
have its own unofficial corner in the student activities center 
most people see the white union as part of the mosaic 
others called them troublemakers theyre racist pigs said 
josephine chiappetta 20 a business major who is white i feel 
the same way about the black students union 
those who gravitated to temples white union said junior 
michael tilghman are just disturbed that blacks get so much 
financial help and other assistance by starting a white student 
union thats a way to express their anger he said 
on one point tilghman who is black agrees with them however 
affirmative action is an insult to me give me the same as a 
white person

when tara green and barbara merz make 
sandwiches for their local soup kitchen they think theyre only 
feeding the hungry 
but the two 19yearold temple university students are also 
binding the racial and cultural fragments troubling todays college 
campuses 
tara green is black barbara merz is white volunteer projects 
like theirs at the alpha sigma alpha sorority are a new kind of 
necessary glue educators and activists say 
with the help of civil rights law and university policies 
seeking more diversity higher education is now pursued by those 
formerly kept out blacks hispanics asians native americans as 
well as the disabled and older students are taking their places in 
the classroom 
once there they also organize 
like tiny nations groups identified by race and heritage pursue 
their own interests leading to campus fragmentation but another 
kind of activism is gaining cachet on campus extracurricular 
community service this may be the way to reconnect the pieces of 
the shattered mosaic some organizations say 
what we see are signs of community activity on campuses both 
among majority students and students of color said susan stroud 
director of campus compact and the center for public service 
housed at brown university in rhode island campus compact is a 
national endeavor founded five years ago to promote volunteer 
activities as part of the college experience 
stroud adds there are some campuses that are making community 
service one of those ways that one bridges the differences at 
campuses 
mixing it up is the philosophy adopted by the campus 
outreach community league in st paul minn run mostly by recent 
college graduates and affiliated with 600 campuses the 
organization fosters the idea that altruism isnt enough when 
students arrange to build housing for the poor or tutor innercity 
children they must be sure to draw participants from assorted 
races and ethnic backgrounds 
says the leagues executive director julia scatliff 
for organizations to remain predominantly white in an age that 
is predominantly diverse its not effective anymore 
higher education needs to be shook up because there are 
really pockets of isolation on campus and what were trying to do 
is offer pragmatic solutions scatliff said in a recent interview 
its this notion of bringing people together that inspired diana 
lugo to form culture clusters last year at california state 
polytechnic university in pomona 
students from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who did 
volunteer work met weekly during lugos senior year to talk about 
their respective cultures thats the only way were going to 
learn about each other said lugo a mexicanamerican who now 
works at the california spinoff of campus compact 
in louisiana where a fledgling white student union movement 
stirs fears of old racism in a new disguise and schools are still 
identified by color 150 white and black students from eight new 
orleans campuses joined forces one day in april to spruce up a 
mission for the homeless 
that event was the work of debra thomas new orleans coordinator 
of the league and a recent graduate of southern university at new 
orleans 
like many in this new effort to integrate volunteer activities 
she said its too soon to know the longterm results 
but one of the things that have happened it has provided a 
forum in which students have a chance to change some of their old 
perceptions and thats a start

editors note the once barren wastes of northern quebec 
untamed and pristine have been transformed by the construction of 
the largest hydroelectric project on earth the government of 
quebec province says only good will result the natives think 
otherwise and are prepared to try to hold back further building

the 62 billion james bay project is the 
largest hydroelectric development on the planet cutting roads 
building dams diverting rivers and changing the face of the earth 
in an area as big as france 
for officials of the hydro quebec power company owned by the 
government of the province of quebec taming the wild rivers of 
this frigid and practically unpopulated subarctic region is the 
cleanest most economic and socially acceptable way of meeting the 
provinces growing energy needs into the next century 
for the 10000 cree indians whose ancestors lived in the 
northern quebec forest here for centuries and who make up one of 
the earths last remaining huntertrapper societies the 
15yearold project is disrupting nature poisoning the fish 
ruining traplines and threatening their traditional way of life 
and for many environmentalists the development of the james bay 
region is not only destructive to the fauna and flora it has been 
illstudied never subject to public review and may not even be 
needed 
if they dont let us develop hydroelectric power that means 
nuclear power at a much higher price both in money and in 
insecurity rejoins andre mercier an engineer and hydro quebecs 
vice president for system planning in montreal 
to us this land is sacred said matthew cooncome grand 
chief of the crees of quebec its the only thing we have left 
it is still our main economic base hunting and fishing we are 
concerned about the kind of land and environment we leave behind 
for our children 
radisson is the end of the road north after radisson you go by 
air by water or you walk from here to the northern tip of quebec 
province is 650 miles of trackless taiga and tundra until now it 
has been the domain of the cree a few inuit indians and the 
occasional hardy white hunter or fisherman 
seen from radisson a company town of about 2500 inhabitants 
650 miles north of montreal the james bay project is an awesome 
engineering accomplishment in just one phase of construction that 
began on one river la grande the company has built nine dams and 
206 dikes using 150 million hours of work by 55000 people it has 
excavated 262 million cubic meters of rock and soil and poured 
550000 tons of concrete into pristine northern rivers and it 
spent 138 billion 
one example of the herculean nature of the scheme the 
caniapiscau river which used to run north and empty into ungava 
bay now runs west into the la grande system and empties most of 
its water into james bay 
the lg2 dam just east of here on what 10 years ago was a lonely 
river in a vast silent forest of black spruce is as high as a 
53story building and is 1 miles long it required 23 million 
cubic meters of fill that as hydro quebecs onsite public 
relations officer serge marcoux likes to say is 10 times the 
volume of the cheops pyramid for all those whose minds eye 
carries a portable pyramid 
when all 16 lg2 turbine units are operating at the same time 
marcoux says it requires the equivalent of five olympic swimming 
pools full of water each second for those who think in terms of 
olympic swimming pools the reservoir contains enough water to 
supply the needs of montreal for a century 
and thats not counting lg3 and lg4 or lg1 now under 
construction downstream or the new power plant here called lg2a 
or the laforge 1 and laforge 2 plants to come on line in 1993 and 
1994 its mindboggling 
phase 1 of la grande has added 10282 megawatts of power to 
hydro quebecs capacity a megawatt is 1 million watts phase 2 is 
adding 4652 megawatts more next on hydro quebecs horizon is 
development of the great whale river 125 miles north for another 
3500 megawatts followed by the nottaway broadback and rupert 
rivers known as nbr 8000 megawatts 
the crees are determined to stop great whale and nbr development 
and have filed actions in both federal and provincial courts 
right now we are economically selfsufficient says 
cooncome but they are going to destroy it then the taxpayers 
are going to say those lazy indians now we have to pay for their 
housing their health services their alcohol abuse programs they 
are going to find their taxes going to these lazy drunken 
indians thats because they destroyed our economic base 
mercier estimated the hydroelectric potential of the james bay 
rivers at 50000 megawatts some of them more cost efficient than 
others 
there is no other province or state in north america that is 
in such a privileged situation he said it is a resource that 
is there to use 
in that mercier is echoing his boss quebec premier robert 
bourassa whose policy is to make hydroelectric development of the 
provinces vast northland the foundation of the entire economic 
development of quebec whose leaders in the past have raised the 
possibility of secession 
quebec is a vast hydroelectric plant in the bud and every day 
millions of potential kilowatt hours flow downhill and out to sea 
what a waste bourassa said in his 1985 book power from the 
north 
hydro quebec revenues represent 5 percent of the provinces 
gross national product with 52 billion in sales to quebec and 
308 million to the rest of canada and the united states it is a 
company with 34 billion in assets but also 22 billion in 
longterm debt 
the sale of electricity to the united states particularly riles 
opponents many feel quebec is being raped to run the 
airconditioners of new york 
hydro sees foreign sales as subsidizing construction now for 
meeting future canadian needs 
seen from chisasibi a cree village of 2500 about 80 miles to 
the west on the shore of james bay the development is equally 
awesome it brought the 20th century crashing down on a simple 
people 
before the project there was no road to chisasibi nobody had 
cars or trucks there was no television and little storebought 
food supplies came in summer by barge from northern ontario 
hydro quebec built the road and the modern world drove right 
down it to the james bay bringing better education and health 
care but it also brought the dark side of modern life 
alcoholism drug abuse and juvenile delinquency

health has changed said fernand filion an anthropologist 
now heading social services in chisasibi infant mortality has 
been reduced the crees live longer but now they have high blood 
pressure obesity and alcoholism 
adds charlie pepabano executive assistant to chisasibi chief 
violet pachanos the progress was too much it came too fast and 
didnt give us a chance to adapt we are trying to educate people 
that its here and that we are going to have to live with it 
another blow has been to the country and its wildlife the land 
is fragile in these northern climes it takes a tree 100 years to 
grow to the size of a mans thigh forest fires ruin areas for 
generations disrupting wildlife even affecting the quality of the 
fish according to crees 
hydro quebec says the impact on the environment has been 
minimal the company points to the hundreds of environmental 
studies and followups carried out by more than 200 scientists and 
claims there are no fewer resources no fewer animals no fewer 
fish in the region than before the project began in some cases as 
with caribou numbers are even on the increase 
cree hunters and trappers say otherwise all the best fishing 
lakes are flooded along with many beaver lodges according to 
chisasibi trapper george lameboy those beaver are gone he said 
now you never see signs of muskrat in the lg2 area he said 
their studies are geared to insure that they are in conformity 
with their plans says cooncome there were no totally 
independent studies carried out 
one of the major critics of the project is the new yorkbased 
national audubon society which says the development is a major 
threat to numerous species of shore birds and waterfowl the 
eastern shore of the james bay is a major staging area for 
migratory birds 
hydro quebec responding to electricity needs increases the 
discharge of water into the james bay in winter and decreases it in 
spring and summer reversing mother nature 
the only major impact the company will admit to is a serious 
rise in the mercury levels in fish from newly flooded reservoirs 
as a result the crees no longer can eat certain types of fish from 
certain lakes and rivers 
the mercury occurs naturally in vegetation when reservoirs are 
flooded bacteria feed on the decomposing organic matter 
transforming the harmless mercury into poisonous methyl mercury 
this in turn gets into the food system by contaminating predator 
fish such as pickerel lake trout and whitefish 
hydro quebec says the lakes and rivers eventually will return to 
normal but the estimated time it will take varies from 10 to 30 
years 
others say all of hydro quebecs studies are selfserving 
alan penn an ecologist who advises the grand council of the 
crees of quebec said it is information generated by an 
organization for its own purposes and not to understand the 
functioning of an ecosystem 
penns biggest criticism is that there is no outside control or 
direction of hydro quebecs studies and that they are producing 
largely useless data 
the crees claim they only found out about james bay development 
when it was well under way after hydro quebec began building roads 
and other infrastructure the indians went to court and won an 
injunction but hydro got a stay and work went ahead while the 
matter languished in court 
the natives saw it was too late work had progressed too far 
and decided to make the best deal they could that deal was the 
james bay and northern quebec agreement the 31chapter accord 
covers all aspects of life and development in a 410000squaremile 
area of northern quebec 
in it the crees and inuit agreed to the la grande river 
development under certain conditions the crees received an initial 
135 million in cash compensation which has been invested or used 
to create creerun businesses such as cree construction and air 
creebec and more cash in subsequent extensions of the agreement 
the crees say future development requires cree consent and 
theyre not giving it 
serge dube hydros counselor on indian affairs says the future 
development already is conceded in the james bay and northern 
quebec agreement all of the rights for all of the projects are 
covered by the agreement dube says there is no legal ground 
to stop it 
what the project did was wake everybody up says lameboy 
we used to think the government would protect us the government 
would not let this happen then we woke up to the fact that the 
government is pushing this that they can be the bad guys 
the government is saying the north is open the sky is the 
limit go help yourself

when robbie matthew leans back in a 
city armchair and talks about life out on his trapline in northern 
quebec his eyes glisten a soft smile spreads across his face 
come september hell be back out there with his family living in 
a muhtukan hunting and trapping 
city for matthew is chisasibi a cree indian village of 2500 on 
the shore of james bay a thumb of water shooting southeast off 
hudson bay he comes in from the forest for a few weeks at 
christmas then again when the ice breaks 
there im happy he says of the 100mileby40mile 
trapline he runs east of what is now known as the lg2 reservoir 
i enjoy the scenery most of all every year we go out even if 
fur prices are low what would i do here play bingo and watch 
hockey on tv myself i like to move about 
matthew calls himself an old man though he is 56 and he is a 
lucky man the massive 62 billion james bay hydroelectric 
development project did not destroy his trapline as it did some 
others when it covered the land with thousands of square 
kilometers of water 
though his trapline is not submerged he has seen the effects of 
building massive dams and dikes on the magnificent la grande river 
and the construction of hundreds of miles of roads and electric 
transmission lines 
hydro quebec the power company owned by the province of quebec 
says its environmental studies show very little permanent impact on 
the wildlife from 15 years of construction officials say there is 
just as much beaver lynx marten muskrat caribou bear and fish 
as before 
but many of the small creeks are now filled up on matthews trap 
and he says he never sees muskrat any more 
each fall matthew his wife three of his six sons and their 
families head for the trap they construct a winter home of split 
logs placed upright and swamp moss the same stuff we used to 
make baby diapers with from there in cold as much as 45 below 
zero matthew and his family hunt and trap taking just enough to 
eat and to keep the women busy preparing the furs to sell 
and you come back inside where it is so warm he says 
closing his eyes and almost smelling the fire i love that no 
matter how cold it is outside it is always warm inside there all 
winter with your children and grandchildren 
matthew is what is known as a tallyman he is responsible for 
managing the trapline inherited from his uncle that involves 
doing a yearly inventory of the beaver lodges and other animals on 
his trap 
a trapline is like a garden you have to manage it wisely 
he says that includes working some parts of it and letting other 
parts rest for two or three years but not more untrapped 
territory becomes as unproductive as overtrapped territory 
the animals also have their say 
sometimes the animals dont want to be trapped crees say so a 
trapper moves to another area there must be respect for the 
animals or the animals will respond by not letting themselves be 
caught 
matthew is worried about the caribou like all game they are 
cyclical caribou are now abundant but says matthew they are 
acting strangely 
now they are starting to decrease because of all the forest 
fires the wolves are starting to increase and he is finding 
dead caribou in the lakes with no sign of wounds or attack by 
animals 
there is something strange happening with the caribou in the 
old days if he smelled smoke or heard a shot he would run for 
miles now they are not scared anymore you can practically walk 
up and shoot them 
it used to be we really had to hunt and you really had to 
hide yourself and be careful to kill a caribou thats one thing i 
would like these biologists to do is there something wrong with 
the caribou 
he notices other things too 
i think some of that acid rain stuff must be getting here i 
had the strange feeling that trees are a slightly different color 
than usual in spring

workers are laying in the last piece of 
tile painting the last wall and putting the other finishing 
touches on the us armys largest construction project since world 
war ii 
at a time when experts foresee a major contraction in american 
defense spending due to the thaw in usussr relations the 
army has spent five years and 12 billion building a new home for 
its reactivated 10th mountain light infantry division a deployable 
light infantry division 
everything from barracks to bowling alleys and motor pools to 
minimalls has been built for the 10000 soldiers attached to the 
division and about 14000 members of their families another 6000 
people moved into the region as a direct result of the expansion 
officials estimate 
construction has gone so well at fort drum that the project will 
be completed about two months ahead of the january 1991 scheduled 
target date 
but socially and economically the influx of so many strange 
new faces has been disquieting for some in the rural insular 
communities in the region near the uscanadian border about 250 
miles northwest of new york city

atmosphere but that has changed 
men in uniform are nothing new in northern new york the army 
began staging maneuvers in the area in the early days of the 1900s 
and much of the original fort drum was constructed during the early 
1940s when the encampment became a major training area for world 
war ii troops 
national guard units from throughout the northeast have long 
used the 107000acre installation the largest in area in the 
northeastern united states for summertime training in winter the 
army sends troops to drum for training in the regions arcticlike 
snow and cold 
prior to expansion the army had based a permanent garrison at 
fort drum of about 1000 men to manage the facility 
but moving the 10th mountain division into the fort required the 
construction of what amounted to a new city 
the old fort drum looks as if it could pass for the set of 
televisions gomer pyle usmc the new base built on 1800 
acres adjacent to the quonset huts of the original installation 
looks more like a college campus or an industrial park 
much of the housing for the soldiers and their families is 
located in communities up to 25 miles away from the base 
the superintendent of one school district that had an influx of 
military children said that integration of families into the 
communities was a good idea 
we have a true mix within the communities of militaryrelated 
people along with the people of the communities themselves said 
kenneth rishel of the carthage central school district we dont 
have much them vs us between people from the fort and those from 
the villages 
maj hyram bell a public relations officer at fort drum said 
that with housing for 1900 army families scattered throughout the 
region there has been much interaction between the soldiers and 
civilians 
our kids go to schools in those areas shop in the local 
stores go to the same recreational areas and participate in 
community activities he said people get to know us 
a major worry for fort drum officials was problems that black 
and hispanic soldiers and their families could encounter in the 
overwhelmingly white region prior to the expansion of the fort 
less than 1 percent of the residents of jefferson county where the 
base is located were minorities nearly onethird of the 
divisions members are minorities 
the fort dispatched teams to local schools and chaplains were 
sent to local churches to speak about racial harmony thus far 
there have been no racial problems 
some residents feel the ethnic diversity created by the fort 
drum expansion has added something to the quality of life 
its rather nice to see a korean grocery store said steve 
lyman jefferson countys deputy commissioner of social services 
you hear some different kinds of music on the radio now its 
brought some welcome diversity this was kind of a stagnant area 
the sort of place where kids grew up and left 
but while growing up it was the sort of place where everyone 
felt safe now rishel said some people complain about having to 
lock their doors at night for the first time in their lives 
crime has increased in jefferson county during the past five 
years but lt ed simser of the sheriffs department said 
authorities dont believe the army personnel or their families are 
directly to blame 
with the fort came an increase in population from other 
avenues from workers on the fort and in other industries that have 
moved in he said weve seen a definite increase in crime no 
question about it but we believe its due more to the population 
trends and not fort drum specifically 
unemployment has dropped in jefferson county from 133 percent 
in 1984 to 6 percent as of june according to the state labor 
department lyman said that the countys welfare rolls have been 
reduced from 2400 cases before 1985 to about 1900 now 
but scordo argues that the economic benefits promised by 
expansion proponents in 1984 and 1985 havent really materialized 
he said most jobs created by the expansion are lowpaying positions 
in fastfood restaurants and mall stores not the highpaying 
bluecollar jobs that were a staple of northern new yorks economy 
for decades until a slump in the 1970s and 1980s 
defenders of the project concede that the boom the region 
experienced at the height of the construction is over 
were now settling into a plateau said mary parry of the 
greater watertown chamber of commerce 
she said economic officials want to better develop the regions 
tourism industry in light of the fort drum expansion the fort is 
not far from the northeastern shore of lake ontario and the rivers 
many filled with popular sport fish that flow into the lake 
these are young people at the fort and their families come up 
to see them she said they come as tourists we want them to 
come and see the area

editors note two years ago the tiny illinois town of ohio 
seemed to be dying the victim of an aging population and a 
shortage of jobs today it is thriving thanks to an innovative 
marketing scheme that brought a renaissance 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in an era of dying small towns ohio paid a 
price to survive the gritty community of 540 residents offered 
cash incentives up to 5000 to lure newcomers willing to trade 
bigcity amenities for smalltown charm 
the results surprised everyone 
today vacant homes are virtually nonexistent most houses 
boast fresh paint neatly mowed lawns and gardens sprouting flowers 
and vegetables theres a new subdivision with sewers water and 
electrical lines and construction is under way on new houses 
city leaders also hope to land a federally subsidized housing 
project for older residents to free up even more houses for 
prospective buyers 
the bounty money gets peoples attention but its not the 
key to getting them here says jack piper one of the programs 
architects visitors just get such a warm feeling about the 
community they see why its such a great place to live 
two years ago ohio had little to offer we were suffering 
because our kids were moving out our population was aging and we 
didnt have any new jobs piper says 
dick swanson helped organize a town meeting at which we passed 
the hat and a couple dozen people chipped in the group formed 
the ohio growth foundation to make one last attempt to generate 
some expansion 
in early 1989 the foundation launched a modest marketing 
campaign stressing friendly community life topnotch schools and 
crimefree environment with the cash incentive as the centerpiece 
the foundation offers grants of 3000 to anyone buying an 
existing house or 5000 to buyers of newly built houses the 
grants are to pay real estate taxes 
the response was much greater than we anticipated we werent 
ready for the calls we got swanson said 
ohio resembles dozens of remote towns sprinkled among the 
cornfields of rural illinois its classic business district 
includes a post office bank feed store beauty parlor insurance 
agents office attorneys office gas station coffee shop and a 
couple of taverns 
downtown is dissected by an abandoned railroad rightofway the 
tracks are long gone a sign that often signals the demise of 
farming communities that developed as rail stops where farmers 
shipped crops bought seed supplies and groceries and met friends 
what the railroad left behind in ohio is swansons huge grain 
elevator he now ships grain by truck rather than boxcar 
the hog sale barn is closed but bill sislers ice business 
thrives along with his dairy that produces rich ice cream in 
flavors like tin roof sundae 
the loss of rail service left ohio with intersecting twolane 
blacktops as the only link to chicago 105 miles east and peoria 
75 miles south 
overcoming the remote location wasnt the only obstacle to 
growth 
the transfusion generated by the cash incentive program had to 
wait for major surgery on the towns heart its classic old brick 
school where grades kindergarten through 12 study under one roof 
in classrooms overlooking a tiny gymnasium and stage 
as the towns population dropped over the years enrollment at 
schools dwindled making it harder to find teachers and 
administrators 
two years ago only 40 kids remained in high school and a budget 
deficit loomed demographic trends pointed to an aging population 
and a declining birthrate 
rather than close the school and consolidate with another 
withering town residents approved a 40 percent tax increase 
i guess were crazy but we think our kids are worth it 
piper said it costs a lot to run our school but we figure if 
we spend money on schools and send them to college maybe we wont 
have to spend a lot of money on jails 
but money alone didnt solve the problem a catalyst was needed 
to reenergize teachers and students alike and integrate new ideas 
without disrupting the communitys comfortable family environment 
frank dagne was coaxed out of retirement from nearby 
sterlingrock falls where he served as school superintendent and 
school board member he agreed to help ohio find a permanent 
administrator 
four years later hes still on the job and has relocated to 
ohio dagne has caught ohio fever and hes glad he did 
one of his first moves was to hold private fundraisers to buy a 
dozen computers for the school in two years he raised 8000 from 
ohio residents many of whom dont have children in school 
next he renovated a study hall into a library resource center 
he also hired a retired band director to help build school spirit 
we were down to eight students most of whom couldnt read 
music dagne said i hired a retired band director dick davis 
and now we have 40 kids in band they sound great and they are 
winning awards and the community really supports it 
its an example of the difference in the communal feeling of 
this town people here really are friendlier and concerned about 
the kids they really care 
tony dicarro saw a news report about what ohio calls a bounty 
while rehabilitating a house in florida i was looking for the 
peace and quiet of a small town said dicarro who has relocated 
to ohio and is gutting an old apartment house 
the cash incentive program has resulted in sales of 24 homes 
leaving just one vacant house in town and five new homes have been 
built 
the state also helped with small business loans to attract 
business including development of a high technology company a 
restaurant and insurance agency 
the new businesses created a halfdozen new jobs that doesnt 
sound like much activity in most cities but its more than has 
happened in the last 20 years in ohio piper said

editors note the key to the church of the holy sepulcher the 
shrine where christ was buried is held by moslems to prevent 
squabbles among christians however it recently has become a 
source of contention between two moslem families in jerusalem 
its joudeh vs nusseibeh 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
abdul khader joudeh held in his outstretched 
hands the rusty 10inch iron key that opens the door to the 
holiest site in christendom the church of the holy sepulcher 
this key is from the time of saladin said joudeh a moslem 
whose family has charge of the key as a way of preventing squabbles 
among rival christian sects over rights to the holy shrine 
now however the key to the shrine where christ was buried has 
set off a jealous conflict between two of jerusalems oldest moslem 
families the joudehs and nusseibehs 
more precisely the vaunted title keeper of the key is at 
issue 
like most such arab disputes this one involves tradition 
family pride and a history that may stretch back to the moslem 
conqueror saladin or even beyond 
when you are the owner of the key for 800 years no one can 
take this right from you said jawad joudeh a brother of abdul 
khader at 65 jawad is the family elder and official key custodian 
wajeeh nusseibeh of the rival clan while he grants the joudehs 
hold the key insists the nusseibehs long link to the holy 
sepulcher gives them the right to the key custodians title too 
when the caliph came to the city of jerusalem the key was 
given to a member of our family says nusseibeh referring to the 
caliph omar the first moslem conqueror of jerusalem in ad 636 
the joudehs dispute that claim and trace their own hold on the 
key to saladin who recaptured jerusalem from the christian 
crusaders in 1187 
both omar and saladin ensured christian rights to the holy 
sepulcher under moslem rule leading to todays traditions of the 
key keeper and the moslem guards in fezzes who still escort bishops 
to the shrine for ceremonies 
the current squabble began last spring when the holy sepulcher 
was closed to protest an effort by jewish settlers to take over a 
building in jerusalems christian quarter news reports at the time 
referred to nusseibeh as keeper of the key 
the joudehs were mortified 
i heard it on radio amman then on radio cairo said abdul 
khader i felt we had been deprived of our rights 
the family put statements of protest in two of jerusalems 
arabic newspapers jawad wrote letters to reporters and abdul 
khader came with documents to news agency offices 
when the family was invited to tell its story the joudeh 
delegation consisted of the two brothers a cousin a friend and 
abdul khaders 24yearold son ahab a graduate student at george 
washington university in washington dc 
the joudehs brought firmans or decrees from the ottoman 
turkish sultans who ruled palestine for 400 years to show the 
familys long possession of the key 
the familys argument explained over cups of thick arabic 
coffee is that the nusseibehs are the door keepers of the 
church not the key keepers 
the joudehs turn the key over to the nusseibehs who then must 
climb a ladder to reach the keyhole insert the key and finally do 
the physical labor of pushing open the heavy wooden door 
this tradition came about abdul khader explained because of 
the stature of his family 
they were all sheiks he said how could they open the 
church how could they push the door everyone was coming to kiss 
their hands so the nusseibeh family was assigned as doorkeepers 
abdul khader added that the nusseibehs gained some note over the 
years including in its numbers government ministers during 
jordanian rule 
they dont want to say they are doorkeepers but that is what 
they are he added 
the joudehs and the nusseibehs agree on one thing the origin of 
the key being put in moslem hands was not to stop fights among 
christians though it evolved into that 
the first reason was saladins fear that crusaders would try to 
regain the church later money got involved when taxes were levied 
on christian pilgrims with proceeds going to moslem charities and 
the families controlling the door 
at the time of the ottoman empirewe were receiving a good 
income said abdul khader 
the practice of taxing pilgrims ended in the 1800s however 
wajeeh nusseibeh says that together the two families now get about 
20 a month from the greek orthodox roman catholic and armenian 
churches 
it doesnt cover transportation or breakfast or dinner for 
even one day he added we do the job out of pride 
in fact both families pay workers actually to open the church 
at 430 am each day and close it in the evening the joudehs and 
nusseibehs only open the doors on special occasions like easter 
wajeeh nusseibeh 39 took over his church duties when his 
father died in 1982 he maintained that his family was not only 
given the key to the church by caliph omar but again by saladin 
after he drove the crusaders from jerusalem 
saladin asked for the key from the nusseibehs and he gave it 
back he said 
he added that the joudehs got involved in the process later 
nusseibeh said he accepts the joudehs job descriptions that 
they hold the key and he opens the door i believe its important 
who opens the door he added 
what bothers him is the suggestion that his family has no 
association with the key that the nusseibehs are somehow late 
arrivals in the arab history of jerusalem 
we came before the joudehs he said we are the most 
ancient family in jerusalem 
and in this battle of firmans and families who is right 
it turns out both joudehs and nusseibehs are partly right 
according to the status quo the rules on rights to jerusalems 
holy sites that were formulated by the turks cataloged under 
british rule of palestine and still used by israel 
the idea was to keep the christians from fighting among 
themselves and the turks were precise their rules say which 
candle in the holy sepulcher each christian sect may light which 
scrap of floor it must sweep 
as for the church door the status quo states the tradition 
of moslem guardians dates from the time of caliph omar but it 
makes no mention of saladins awarding of the key 
it says though that when moslems fully dislodged the crusaders 
from jerusalem in 1289 the custody of the keys was given to the 
family of el insaibi nusseibeh to prevent disputes between the 
various christian communities 
later the document says the guardianship was divided with the 
judeh family it adds 
this is the position at the present time the judeh family 
holding the keys and the insaibi having charge of the actual 
opening of the door

editors note rougham airfield may go the way of its planes 
and fliers into history but for the moment there are still 
reminders of what some american servicemen accomplished nearly 50 
years ago during the dark days of world war ii 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
silence and fog hung over what 
was left of a runway at rougham airfield where american fliers had 
roared off to raid german targets during world war ii 
the peacefulness contrasted with my grandfathers memories of 
the us 8th air force base the rumble of scores of engines in the 
air dogfights overhead a b17 landing with heavy battle damage 
every man aboard wounded every cartridge aboard fired the 
aircraft itself dripping blood 
cpl t morgan daniel had served as a mechanic here with the 
94th bomb group 331st squadron during world war ii 
he doubted anything remained of this airfield but on a side 
trip during a vacation i found remnants of runways huts used for 
storage and housing a control tower and a community that still 
identifies itself by what americans did here almost 50 years ago 
rougham is in the east anglia region of england flat farm 
country juting into the north sea its location and terrain 
tailormade for air bases designed to hit germany and occupied 
europe 
inside the flying fortress pub on the base site the walls are 
lined with photographs of men in leather jackers crouched in neat 
rows before planes painted with what was called nose art cartoons 
illustrated the planes nicknames eighth air force bombers sported 
names such as royal flush southern comfort the eagles 
wrath and rain of terror 
a wooden plaque in the pub carries the a that adorned the 
tails of the bombers that flew from here and says 94th bomb 
group 19421945 
the pub also features a print showing b17s in flight the 
painting looked familiar i had seen it before in my grandfathers 
house the handiwork of a comrade in arms 
an american accent and a mention of the 8th air force brings a 
warm welcome in bury st edmunds and at the flying fortress 
there is an awful lot of good feeling toward the americans who 
were here during the war said keith allchin the pubs owner 
the feeling is mutual my grandfather used to talk fondly about 
the hospitality of the english and dinners at their homes 
allchin said up to 400 american veterans have visited since the 
flying fortress opened in december 1988 
theyre pleased to think theyre remembered he said they 
seem to think a lot of people have forgotten all about them 
veterans and those visiting on behalf of veterans are asked to 
sign a guest book kept at the bar a bartender also gave me a map 
of rougham as it was during wartime to help identify what remains 
finding those remnants isnt easy rougham airfield originally 
a british royal air force base was camouflaged in its time 
the luftwaffe bombed all around us but they never found us 
my grandfather used to say 
and for all practical purposes rougham is still camouflaged 
a narrow twisting road leads from bury st edmunds to the 
airfield site or the aerodrome as the british call it other than 
the pubs sign nothing visible on mount road indicates that part 
of the air power that liberated europe was launched from here 
an official military account of the 8th air forces first year 
over europe quotes virgil germany heard a clashing of arms all 
over the sky the alps trembled with uncommon earthquakes never 
did lightnings fall in greater quantities from a serene sky or 
dire thunders blaze so often 
local residents confirmed that part of rougham airfield still 
existed and provided directions 
amid fields of wheat barley and sugar beets one finds part of 
the runways cracked and broken in a heavy mist they appear to 
recede into the past and a walk down one of them seems to go on 
forever instead of warplanes tractors now roll down the runways 
farmers use some of the airmens huts as storage sheds 
in a heavy british fog the kind that might have grounded a 
bombing mission the huts materialize like ghosts as one approaches 
a bumpy muddy path leads to what had been the control tower 
locals say an elderly woman made the tower her home until her death 
about 18 months ago the tower is now hidden among trees and high 
weeds 
rougham industrial estate a small industrial park has grown up 
around other buildings 
and some of those structures have found a modern use according 
to allchin 
a hanger itself is a seed storage depot allchin said he 
also said an environmental group is refurbishing the old chapel and 
gym to turn it into a village hall 
eventually rougham airfield may go the way of its planes and 
fliers into history allchin said a developer is seeking 
permission to build housing on the site 
the lightning and thunder launched against targets such as 
german aircraft factories and submarine pens have long since 
stilled but at least for now one can find a few silent reminders

larry worked on the script with bernard dilbert of mash in 
1987 it went out with a lot of other cbs projects 
in the process of doing the tv movie my father passed away i 
kept telling him youre going to get well youre going to see 
it i made a personal pact that i was going ahead with this one 
the stage musical is the life story of her father in which his 
marriage and collaboration with lucille ball on i love lucy is 
only part of an astonishing ragstoriches saga 
its the story of a cuban immigrant who lost everything at 18 
to come to a country where his race was thought of only as waiters 
and busboys she says he was a hero to the hispanic people it 
shows that you can rise above the stereotype 
meanwhile cbs is planning a movie about lucy and desi arnaz 
denies that she is opposed to the venture but says i dont want 
to be involved with telling that story on film right now

by the turn of the century american farmers 
are going to gain at least 34 million acres of cropland a 
potential surge in production capacity that already has some people 
concerned 
the additional cropland is currently tied up in the 
governments conservation reserve program under 10year contracts 
that will begin to expire in 1996 the last of the crp land will be 
freed up in 1999 
some refinements of the crp are included in 1990 farm bills 
passed by the house and senate including amendments to extend the 
enrollment period through the 1995 crop year those details will be 
worked out in conference negotiations in the coming weeks 
but the basic program authorized in the 1985 farm law remains 
pretty much the same as set up by the agriculture department 
signups began in 1986 and the last were held a year ago 
even without the uncertainties caused by federal budgetary 
pressures and the pressures on congress to tinker with the program 
its tough to make predictions about the future of crp and its 
impact on agricultural production 
a recent report by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress cited a number of factors that 
relate to the future of us crop production and therefore the 
crp 
natural conditions which could limit the available land for 
agricultural use and could influence the quality or quantity of 
production national conditions include location climate soil 
conditions and proximity to water 
economic conditions including the price and availability of 
labor and capital also it would include domestic and 
international patterns of production and consumption and exports 
and imports 
public policies including federal state and local efforts 
that directly or indirectly influence agricultural production 
local zoning regulation for the control of pesticides could 
influence yields for example 
the gao report looking at the possibilities for steppedup 
production once the longterm crp contracts have expired said much 
will depend on decisions of individual farmers on whether to 
continue idling their land or returning it to productive use 
for example about 6 percent of the crp acreage has been 
planted with trees the report said assumptions about the 
extent to which these 2 million acres of trees will be cleared and 
returned to cropland would be a consideration in determining the 
crps impact on production 
the crp is expected to cost the government about 146 billion 
over the life of its contracts 
about 13 billion comes from the annual rental payments received 
by farmers for idling and protecting their land those payments 
average about 49 per acre per year farmers also get initial 
costsharing for planting grass or trees to protect the soil 
thus the crp makes a significant contribution to farm income 
and producers faced with the end of payments will be making 
decisions on what to do next 
because farmers will not be obligated to maintain the crp 
conservation covers grass and trees after contracts expire most 
crp land is likely to revert to crop production if prices and 
commodity programs are favorable says an agriculture department 
analysis 
this will not be a wholesale acreforacre switch back to crop 
production compliance provisions of other parts of federal law 
relating to conservation will continue to be factors and lawmakers 
in the next several years may make further modifications 
meanwhile the analysis by the departments economic research 
service shows that the crp is helping boost market prices and farm 
income by reducing crop production from levels that otherwise would 
be attained 
overall that may amount to 21 billion to 63 billion over 
the life of the crp the report said this would be in addition to 
the 13 billion in total annual rental payments 
after 1995 when land initially enrolled in the crp may come 
back into production net farm income will begin to slide as crop 
prices drift down the report said 
on the consumer side the report said retail food costs are 
increasing less than 1 percent in any year because of the land 
idled under crp 
but in total the present value of crprelated increases in 
consumer costs is estimated to be 29 billion to 78 billion over 
the programs life the report said

das rheingold deutsche grammophon conducted by james 
levine played by metropolitan opera orchestra 
 
the second installment in the metropolitan operas complete 
recording of wagners ring cycle is a disappointment a distinctly 
routine rheingold 
dont fault the singing or the orchestral playing both are 
firstrate as one would expect rather the problem seems to lie 
with conductor james levine whose reading of the score too often 
falls flat it lacks the fire and energy that made soltis 
recording a classic and rarely conjures up the chambermusic 
effect that distinguished karajans interpretation 
the cast is mostly familiar to anyone who has seen the 
production at the met or who watched the recent television version 
on pbs james morris is a sturdy resonant wotan christa ludwig is 
expressive as fricka his wife siegfried jerusalem is superb as 
loge the wily demigod ekkehard wlaschiha and heinz zednik make a 
strong pair of brother dwarfs alberich and mime birgitta svenden 
is effective in erdas solo 
a couple of cast changes are improvements over the staged 
performances heikyung hongs soprano adds luster to the role of 
the lead rhinemaiden woglinde bass kurt moll sings the part of 
the giant fasolt so beautifully he makes him downright sympathetic 
the way the late martti talvela did on the karajan recording 
but the big moments in rheingold are orchestral rather than 
vocal the creationoftheworld opening measures the interludes 
before and after the nibelungen scene with the sound of hammers 
clinking on anvils the brassy entrance of the gods into valhalla 
the orchestra plays all the music flawlessly but a spark is 
missing somehow the whole adds up to less than the sum of its 
parts 
the recording of die walkuere that launched the project was 
far livelier maybe matters will improve again with siegfried 
and goetterdaemmerung

after the rain dgc nelson 
 
many critics found it hard to take the late rick nelson 
seriously because of his status as a teenybopper favorite harder 
than it should have been 
his identical twin sons matthew and gunnar nelson could face 
the same problem as they launch a career leading a fivepiece band 
with their fathers surname their looks strike you before their 
music the twins inherited their fathers classic face and add 
oceans of blond hair 
so hows the music not half bad actually this is metal lite 
the kind that appeals to teenage girls not boys its not 
terribly demanding of course and while nelson doesnt transcend 
the genre rickys boys dont embarrass themselves either 
matthew and gunnars voices mesh nicely on a string of earnestly 
sung cliches most of the record is what radio programmers call 
power ballads heavy metal love songs with the drums guitars 
and synthesizers muted a bit brett garseds guitar work is strong 
without adding too much histrionics particularly on cant live 
without your love and affection 
now if they could only write a song like their sister tracy who 
helped guns n roses pen sweet child o mine

many film stars return from faroff locations 
with tales of peril and privation now listen to mel gibson who 
spent three months in the mountainous jungles near the poppy fields 
of the golden triangle of southeast asia 
its a neat place you know its not so unpleasant the food 
is great its hard to get a bad feed there the dogs are a little 
mangy you gotta watch out for rabies and stuff dont walk around 
at night the people are absolutely charming the culture is old 
and rich and amazingly simple 
gibson went to thailand for the filming of air america a 
tristar pictures actionadventure about cia operations in laos 
during the vietnam war it looks like a physically strenuous shoot 
but you wont hear any complaint on that score either 
it wasnt too bad says gibson i think the most strenuous 
thing i did was cut out of the picture so it isnt worth talking 
about 
the stars good feelings may partly be due to his reported 
salary of 8 million plus a cut of the profits beyond that mel 
maintains a cheerful attitude about the good fortune that has 
befallen him during his unexpected movie career that makes him 
unique amid a new generation of actors who seem to suffer under the 
pressures of stardom 
air america was the name of the cias secret airline that 
operated in southeast asia from the late 1960s to the mid1970s 
the film is partly based on the book by christopher robbins who 
wrote that the cia maintained a secret mercenary army in laos 
the cargo included refugees ammunition counterfeit money as well 
as bushels of opium transported for local war lords said robbins 
gibson and robert downey jr are among the ragtag group of 
pilots flying the rugged terrain to ease into the role gibson 
took lessons in helicopters and fixedwing aircraft so i could at 
least know what to do what it felt like i enjoyed it theres a 
safer feeling when you can understand it more 
until he read the script gibson was unaware of the secret 
operations in laos the picture tells about it in a primer 
fashion and its informative but i dont think most americans did 
know about it he observed incidentally that the head of the 
cia at that time was george bush anyway he added quickly 
im not on a witch hunt 
after appearing in highenergy films like the mad max cycle 
and the two lethal weapons mel gibson surprised everyone by 
taking on the title role in franco zefferellis hamlet mel 
gibson as the gloomy dane is something offkilter in denmark 
i liked the story its a great story he explained its 
a very tragic story its all about bad timing why do it why not 
do it because it was sitting there for the taking and it was 
offered to me on nothing less than a silver plate i couldnt see 
any reason not to 
he added that he had done shakespeare as a young actor in 
australia but on the stage he didnt write for the screen did 
he thats why its a little tricky for celluloid its only two 
hours instead of four and a half 
gibson who costars with glenn close said zefferelli fixed on a 
standard english sound for the actors it required a kind of 
uniformity since you couldnt have a utah cowboy amid the likes of 
alan bates paul scofield and ian holm pretty good actors who know 
their shakespeare 
mel gibsons dual nationality along with his good looks 
contribute to the immense popularity he now enjoys after a dozen 
films he spent his first 12 years in upstate new york then moved 
with his large family he was sixth among 11 children to sydney 
after his graduation from the national institute of dramatic arts 
he was picked by director george miller to play mad max 
his first international films the bounty the river 
mrs soffel were unsuccessful but gibson made his boxoffice 
mark with lethal weapon now his choice of projects is 
unlimited 
a devout catholic gibson 34 strives to maintain a balance 
between career and family he and his wife now have six children 
including 7yearold twins he tries to take them all along 
wherever he works 
we had to suspend that because of the air america 
location he said 
i didnt want to risk going through all that business of 
inoculations and kids in the jungle and talk about the snakes 
geography and time permitting they go to school wherever we 
are theres a sense of semipermanence about their education but 
theyre getting one cultural shock they get a cultural 
smorgasbord and that cant be bad 
its rounded and educational for everyone 
the gibsons now have a base here but their principal home 
remains an australian cattle ranch mel wants it known that he is 
no mere gentleman rancher 
its all happening there genetics embryo transfers 
cryogenic tanks with liquid oxygen embryos shipped from above the 
45th parallel because of the disease problem below the 45th he 
said then theres the genetic part at the end what you end up 
with walking around on the ground a cow with a sheeps head no 
not really its not genetic engineering 
theyre really nice animals you can practically map out what 
you want and be sure of hitting fairly near the mark you can do in 
three years what took your grandfather all his life

annandaleonhudson ny ap its been a long strange trip 
for the oil painting of the nude woman and cupid now hanging in a 
bard college gallery 
the painting was found years ago in a hayloft with a modest fig 
leaf painted on cupid and the chubby prone womans breasts 
enlarged a private collector bought the painting removed the 
bogus overpainting and cleaned it over three years 
the collector who refuses to reveal his identity says hes 
convinced the painting was created in a venice studio by titian 
one of the greatest painters of the italian renaissance 
the art world isnt so sure 
that puts the purported titian in the same boat as many of the 
80 works of art exhibited at a connoisseurs quest a new 
gallery exposition at this hudson valley college 
paintings from europe carvings from africa and ancient egyptian 
pottery are coming under scrutiny for the first time as art 
detectives try to weed out bonafide masterpieces from artful 
forgeries 
art historians and others who breath the rarefied air of the art 
world have begun debating whether particular works are really 
raphaels or durers or el grecos 
some of these pieces will be shrouded in mystery for the rest 
of their existence said linda weintraub curator of the edith c 
blum gallery 
the exhibit which weintraub shepherded here is unique in that 
the pieces are being shown to the public for the first time after 
being held in a private collection for decades some for up to 50 
years 
the collector credits weintraub a longtime acquaintance with 
persuading him to share his private treasure with the public after 
all these years his identity though remains hidden so as not to 
deflect attention from the art he said 
the object of the collection is not the collector the object 
is the art he said in a telephone interview im glad to have 
it scrutinized 
the scrutiny in this case means students of art looking for 
subtle clues that would place a work in time or a technique that 
would distinguish a creation as belonging to a particular artist 
the question with the picture of the nude woman and cupid is 
whether the painting is a first version of titians danae 
which depicts the pictures namesake just after being impregnated 
by zeus 
weintraub said such aficionados as former metropolitan museum of 
art curator thomas hoving have applied their critical eye to the 
work and believe it to have come from the brush of titian 
one dissenting voice comes from artist martin canin who says 
the painting lacks the quality of execution to be a real titian 
im sure its not he said theres just too many bad 
passages 
canin said his painters eyes can see what many art historians 
cannot in danae he sees an untitianlike linear approach to 
the work and an amateurish painting of the figures feet and 
toes canin thinks the painting was a product of a contemporary 
workshop or student 
a big problem with sorting out the works of the european masters 
is that most of them trained their young students to paint just 
like them often exactly like them weintraub said many students 
were instructed to paint over the masters sketches and even copy 
their work outright 
even pieces with signatures can easily have been done by 
students she said 
also in the days before photocopiers or even photos copying 
the great contemporary works by hand for affluent buyers was a 
common practice 
unlike people who study stones or stars art sleuths usually 
rely on more esoteric means to weed out masterworks from copies 
bonnie solomon an art restorer with solomon amp mattozzi of new 
york city shined a black light on danae to determine if the 
work was fudged with overpainting 
there was some work done on it but not a lot she said 
solomon said shes pretty sure the titian is the real thing along 
with another possible masterpiece by the european master el greco 
but admitted there are some incredible fakes in existence 
the presumed el greco a palmsized painting of christ at 
calvary looking imploringly up to heaven could represent the 
finest of the painters work 
then again just like the titian it could be the work of one of 
his rivals or students or any exceptionally talented painter 
familiar with el grecos work 
this could be a students it could be a copy it could be 
from 200 years after his death weintraub said but look at his 
eyes how could it be by anyone else 
even established works of art can become suspect vincent van 
goghs selfportrait with straw hat is familiar to anyone who 
has ever flipped through an art book the painting has been in the 
metropolitan for years as one of the pearls in its collection now 
a leading scholar has raised questions about its authenticity 
theres little certainty about any work weintraub offered 
paintings for noneuropean works are less problematic in terms 
of determining the creator artisans kept a lower public profile in 
most other cultures and so works by any particular person tend to 
be less in demand in the art world 
but they do pose other problems 
some of these works we just have no idea where theyre 
from weintraub said 
works shown in the bard exhibit such as the chinese buddha and 
little icons of egyptian deities are easy to trace but others 
arent experts agree a small carved ivory spoon shown at bard is 
from africa but where when and even the why of the spoon is 
debatable 
all the scholars are bewildered weintraub said even if 
theres a consensus its never absolutely known 
still the mystery collector says hes relatively unconcerned 
that someone might soon come up with some devastating evidence his 
durer or ancient greek coins are not what they appear to be 
i bought all the work for its visual power he said it 
wouldnt change the effectiveness of the work one bit

john hiatt is basically a sentimental kind of 
fellow though youd never guess from those dust bowl eyes 5 
oclock shadow and paisley tie 
but talk about rock n roll heroes elvis presley or bob dylan 
and hiatt gets a little mistyeyed a little nostalgic isnt 
that cool he says his voice lifting slightly as he thinks about 
the days when elvis could top the pop country and rampb charts with 
just one song 
and dylan he still remembers the summer of 1965 sitting in a 
car as a teenager when like a rolling stone came on the radio 
wondering if his mother would realize her sons life had changed by 
the time of the next commercial 
hiatt is from indiana and that means the heartland with all 
the corny talk of family and the outdoors dont expect him to run 
for office but this is one rocker with plenty to say about the 
wife and kids and the music that sprang from this fair land of 
ours 
yeah you surprise yourself when you find out how really 
traditional you really are hiatt said in an interview at the 
manhattan offices of aampm records especially when you fancy 
yourself kind of a wild rebellious angryyoungman sort of guy 
a lot of it comes from the idea of coming from the midwest and 
not having a strong cultural background in a traditional melting 
pot kind of american way its almost like being a blank fill it 
in as you learn about it its kind of an adventure booting around 
like a wild hedgehog 
the jokes come easy now for hiatt no small achievement for a 
man who knows a few things about drugs and death and life on the 
road stolen moments the followup to his acclaimed slow 
turning album is his happiest most personal record with brick 
houses and sleeping babies and a tall tale about a guy leaving town 
in the back of a pickup truck 
a little encouragement goes a long way with me he said of 
the response to slow turning and the cover version of hiatts 
thing called love by bonnie raitt ive never been so at ease 
with the process of record making 
i think this records got a kind of celebratory tone to it 
im just kind of grooving on the fun of it i had a wonderful time 
in the studio and i learned a whole bunch i hung out for the 
mixes which is something ive never done thats a real step 
forward 
on stolen moments youll learn a few things about hiatts 
father robert hiatt he was a storyteller his son remembers 
whod gather the kids in the living room and imagine them on great 
adventures incredible adventures in all kinds of places 
thats what seven little indians is about but as hiatt 
tells it real life was never that way his older brother michael 
committed suicide when hiatt was nine two years later his father 
died in that old brick house it always felt like something was 
moving for the kill hiatt sings they started dropping like 
flies 
i found myself out on the road on the slow turning tour 
hiatt explained and all of a sudden it seemed like my father was 
everywhere 
i dont know why it was that way at 35 or 36 all of a sudden 
these dad things should come up but that happened a lot of 
these things came from just riding around in the back of the bus 
hiatt born in 1952 dropped out of high school and drifted he 
wrote songs in nashville tenn earning 25 a week he toured in 
44 states made albums in every style youd care to name there 
were two bad marriages his second wife committing suicide he was 
hooked on heroin kicked it and got addicted to alcohol instead 
back of my mind a country rocker tells how he survived 
and hiatt sounds amazed about it still sitting back and telling 
his tale like a soldier spinning an old war story 
its all there watching his dad at the foot of the stairs 
taking to the highway just a lookin and a hopin to find some 
solutions some answers taking a wife hitting the bottle and 
almost losing everything 
but he turns it around right in the middle of the song well 
the end of the tunnel it never came up til i came to the end of 
the line and i saw that the light id had been hoping to see was 
just a spark in the back of my mind 
in 1985 he joined alcoholics anonymous where he met his 
current wife nancy and cleaned himself up two years later he 
issued bring the family receiving some of his best reviews 
and topped it in 1988 with slow turning 
the similarity i see between myself and john cougar mellencamp 
is he seems to do his best work as he gets into his 30s hiatt 
said of his fellow indiana rocker 
i see myself as a late bloomer though i kind of consider 
myself a bit of a knucklehead my friend calls me a knucklehead 
savant a step up from idiot savant but not much 
and thats how it is for a man who never expected life to turn 
out so well it really is a stolen moment hell tell you a time 
to just take in every second when its so much easier to think 
about the past because youre feeling so good about whats going to 
happen the following day

john casey began writing spartina in 1979 at 
the worst time of his life one of his former students a talented 
author had committed suicide his father died and his marriage was 
breaking up 
the book came slowly it started as a short story called the 
mean story and was continously revised the central character 
dick pierce was a cranky rhode island fisherman about 40 years 
old like the author himself 
when he was finished nearly 10 years later pierce was still a 
pretty difficult fellow but a little more likable a middleaged 
man with a wife two kids a lover and an unfinished boat called 
spartina in his back yard 
people who are simply good or simply bad are harder to write 
about casey explained in an interview to promote spartina 
which has been released in paperback by avon books 
its not the way most of us are most of us are pretty bad 
hoping to get better sometimes if you can just observe the 
process the accidents involved in getting better thats the real 
purpose of fiction 
theres an enormous grace in nature as well as a grace to 
people 
he speaks in a voice as rough as saltwater you cant get much 
further from the life of a fisherman than the tearoom of a 
manhattan hotel but casey looks as if he just stepped off the 
dock his sleeves rolled up his hair windblown his face reddened 
by the sun 
the authors background seems more suitable to the yachting 
circuit casey born in 1939 is the son of joseph edward casey a 
democratic congressman from massachusetts in the 1930s and 40s he 
wrote poetry in high school and eventually graduated from harvard 
law school 
research was unnecessary for spartina he started sailing as 
a kid racing boats at summer camp he and his wife then purchased 
a fouracre island in narragansett bay in rhode island where casey 
lived and fished for four years 
i thought i knew something when i got to rhode island said 
casey who has also written the novel an american romance and 
a collection of stories testimony and demeanor 
boy did i learn there was a lot more to it after four years 
there i learned an awful lot of stuff he said 
it was the time of my life i was most integrated into the 
place i lived i had to work part time to make ends meet i had 
very little money but it didnt matter i caught fish every day i 
had a couple of lobster pots and there were a lot of things to eat 
almost all year round 
casey writes love scenes like adventures at sea and adventures 
at sea like love scenes dicks determination to build his own 
fishing boat has strained relations with his wife may and he 
eventually turns to elsie buttrick a freespirited richkid for 
support and affection 
she took both his hands and he floated to his feet casey 
writes of the moment when dick and elsie begin their affair he 
bumped the corner of the table when she touched his cheek they 
were clear of the table in the center of the room 
she said several things but he didnt take them in he felt 
weightless but when their bones touched he felt their weight 
against each other as though they were small boats at sea rising 
on the same swell jostling fendered by their flesh 
he had one complete sting of conscience when they drifted 
apart for an instant elsie shoved aside the red curtain and they 
floated through 
when dick finally finishes his boat he stubbornly launches 
spartina despite an oncoming hurricane he is no longer floating 
with the ship being thrown in the air like a parent tossing his 
child casey describes a man staggering on deck his only 
fortiication a can of coke and a thermos of coffee 
as he stood back up spartina suddenly slid forward as though 
she were greased she stuck her nose into a wave he felt her head 
held down caught then lifted up by the bow and spun sideways he 
leaned against the spokes of the wheel no effect she fell back on 
her beam he clung to the wheel post with one hand to keep from 
falling over for a long moment he had no idea where she was or 
which way was up 
casey landed quite smoothly spartina won the national book 
award in 1989 the same year his brotherinlaw dr harold e 
varmus shared the nobel prize in medicine a professor of english 
literature at the university of virginia he now lives in 
charlottesville va with his second wife pinchot pittman an 
artist and calligrapher 
and spartina is just the first novel of a trilogy casey 
promises with other characters telling their stories and the 
author giving them the chance as well to show their natural grace 
through the worst of times 
i knew i wanted dick to become a better person through his 
troubles casey said there was a flowering of him and elsie 
too she knows she needs to become better in some way its an 
optimistic story in a way both of them become better even though

in the first phase of her career carlene 
carter was caught in a deadening trap too rock n roll for 
country radio stations and too country for rock listeners 
this daughter of one of country musics most famous families 
leaves no doubt where she stands now in her first album in seven 
years 
she brought in heartbreaker howie epstein retrorocker dave 
edmunds and former band member levon helm to help her record an 
album as country as her tennessee home 
i just did what came naturally and felt right to me and it 
came out more country said the 34yearold carter i guess 
ive just evolved as a writer and a performer a lot more and have 
gotten a little older and wiser 
for anyone familiar with carters rocking side the new i fell 
in love comes as a bit of a shock fiddles and steel guitars 
abound and carter doesnt hide her tennessee accent on lines such 
as you burned me up like a chicken in a barbecue 
carter was more of a stranger to the country crowd during the 
late 1970s and early 80s the daughter of june carter cash and 
stepdaughter of johnny cash moved to london for eight years 
married english rock star nick lowe and was pretty wild and 
crazy she said 
her wedding to lowe was immortalized in the video to lowes hit 
cruel to be kind and can still occasionally be seen on 
latenight mtv no video chronicled the divorce however 
carter recorded five albums but none made her a star musical 
shapes with carter backed by her husbands former band 
rockpile was a favorite to the few who heard it and presaged 
country musics more extensive flirtations with rock n roll 
but with the 1983 release of cest ce bon a 
synthesizertinged album that even carter disparages now her 
recording career went on hiatus she turned briefly to musical 
theater performing in the london production of pump boys and 
dinettes 
i took a little time off and said i cant just make another 
album without really knowing what i wanted to do she said you 
can only get away with that for so long 
it was a phone call from her mother that changed her career 
june carter cash and two of carlenes aunts were performing in 
london as the carter family one night carlene recalled her aunt 
anita took sick and the carters needed an emergency fillin at 
first carlene protested she didnt know the songs but then did 
her family duty 
she loved it the songs she thought she didnt know were burned 
into her memory from family singalongs carlene who learned how to 
play guitar and poker from her grandmother maybelle soon found 
herself touring as a backup singer in the carter family band 
its something i never thought i would want to do after having 
been a rebel for so long she said i didnt think i would want 
to go back and be in a group with my mom but it was fun singing 
with them and fun remembering what it was like laughing and being a 
kid 
she helped the carter family record an album then turned to her 
own career 
she has nothing but praise for epstein who took a holiday from 
tom pettys backup group to produce carter 
it was really his first album as a producer and i felt it was 
my first album as a serious participant she said 
on past albums she said i had my mind on so many other 
things i didnt really take a lot of time my thought processes 
were often scattered and it came across on record sometimes this 
time im real focused and i think that comes across too 
carter plunders her own background for songs cuts on the new 
album include the carter familys dixie darling you are the 
one a hit for her father carl smith and easy from now on 
one of the first songs carter ever wrote that was once featured on 
an emmylou harris record 
carter has no regrets about her rock n roll days and doesnt 
feel they discredited her family tradition 
i was doing something that i believed was right at the time 
she said theres nothing written in stone that if you do one 
kind of music one day that you cant do another kind of music 
another day i was experimenting i was doing what they had taught 
me growing up to do to be yourself and to be comfortable with 
yourself 
her marriage to lowe over carter has moved into the house in 
which she grew up in madison tenn 
the woman who once couldnt turn down a party invitation crawls 
into her pajamas at 11 pm and gets real excited when i see they 
have spectravision in my hotel room 
shes rehearsing with a new band for a touring show that will 
draw heavily from musical shapes and i fell in love 
im country through and through but some people might think 
its more rock n roll she said i really dont care what 
they think

colon theater the worldrenowned 
opera house is back in business after a renovation and then labor 
disputes kept its stage almost bare for two seasons 
when the curtain belatedly went up on faust in midjuly 
moviemaker and colon director sergio renan said with relief it 
was a kind of compensation for a lot of headaches 
the modernization of the lighting system repair of the machine 
that rotates the sets and other renovations were stretched out by 
argentinas recession and inflation that nearly reached 5000 
percent in 1989 a shortlived production of aida was performed 
last year in between repairs 
the fall season normally begins in april however 1990 
subscriptions initially were refunded and faust was pushed 
back as the july 19 opening date drew near opera and dance lovers 
wondered if the 82yearold theater would be ready in time 
with special effects such as lightning and billowing smoke the 
opera also gave the colon a chance to show off its improvements 
including a computercontrolled system to move sets up down and 
sideways quickly and quietly

bureaucratic ooze has engulfed a popular daily 
calendar that for many years has informed the public where senior 
officials at the agriculture department spend their time and with 
whom 
the daily schedules of agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and 
his top aides were last published on july 19 efforts by news 
organizations that regularly cover usda to have them reinstated 
have been denied 
theres no requirement for us to produce a calendar such as 
that said kelly shipp director of the departments office of 
public affairs if you want to know who is meeting with whom 
youre more than welcome to file under the freedom of information 
act 
long before the foia the creaky old department was something of 
a model of openness glasnost which made its mark in the kremlin 
was old hat in usda 
of course there were and are secrets you are in peril of life 
and limb if an attempt is made to crack the lockup room where 
crop reports are prepared and television monitors keep track of 
visitors hanging around the secretarys office 
speaking of which the usda secretarys glasswalled outer 
office once was shrouded from the inside by heavy drapes so 
passersby couldnt identify visitors by sight 
the drapes came down during the nixon years so reporters and 
anyone else could see inside sometimes you could even go into the 
bird cage outer office and read a magazine or two while keeping 
an eye out for agricultural celebrities 
but gradually there was a tightening of the rules the old usda 
referred to as peculiarly the peoples department by creator 
abraham lincoln became perceptibly stuffier and harder to 
penetrate because of the security 
tourists once were freely able to traipse in from the rounds of 
the nearby museums and art galleries and get free usda brochures 
and booklets on virtually every subject fees are charged now and 
the booklets have to be ordered from some place out west 
so the elimination of the daily postings of schedules is only a 
small part of the changes that have occurred 
the public versions of the daily schedules of usda officials 
underwent editing to delete certain sensitive appointments from the 
calendars a practice that went back through at least several 
administrations 
shipp who was yeutters press secretary before taking over the 
top public affairs post recently is still his chief spokeswoman 
in an interview with the associated press and united press 
international shipp said the canceling of the daily appointments 
calendar was an internal matter and youre just making too much 
out of it she said yeutter did not make the decision to cancel 
it was a decision made at a lower level she said im not 
even sure hes aware of the decision it was not a press office 
decision it was not kelly shipp 
the daily calendar was canceled for three basic reasons shipp 
said it was not accurate she said and there are difficulties 
switching to a new computer system another reason is security 
daily schedules were floated all over washington allowing 
lobbyists market speculators foreign interests and intelligence 
gatherers of all sorts to note the comings and goings at usda

the nations total 1991 meat output is 
expected to increase about 3 percent from this years level 
according to agriculture department projections 
red meat mostly beef and pork is forecast to increase in 1991 
after two years of decline the departments economic research 
service said in last weeks monthly supplyanddemand report 
beef production may increase slightly next year most likely 
from fed cattle going to market nonfed beef output may drop a bit 
in 1991 
prices in 1991 probably will average the same to a little 
above the 1990 level the report said beef imports are 
forecast to increase slightly in 1991 and exports will likely show 
another gain 
looking at pork higher hog prices are expected to trigger a 3 
percent increase in 1991 production 
prices will weaken under the increased output and for all of 
1991 average a few dollars below this years expected level the 
report said pork imports in 1991 are expected to increase 
modestly and exports likely will remain near the anticipated 1990 
level 
broiler producers may boost 1991 production by about 5 percent 
despite lower prices the report said 
the 1991 average price is expected to be near to slightly 
below 1990s level it said broiler meat exports in 1990 have 
been boosted by sales to the soviet union and if these sales 
continue in 1991 exports likely will remain at this years level

domestic cookies are costing more in taiwan 
these days so the asian nation is looking toward imports 
an agriculture department report in the august issue of foreign 
agriculture magazine says cookie and cracker importers are hopeful 
they can profit from the situation 
in the past the report said imports of cookies and crackers 
were minimal because of high tariffs and ineffective marketing 
strategy 
with the tariff now reduced to 35 percent and recent increased 
domestic production costs imports of cookies and crackers are on 
the rise the report said

the middle east crisis helped drive up 
gasoline prices at the pump by more than a dime a gallon over the 
last three weeks an oil analyst says 
the nationwide lundberg survey of about 13000 stations found 
the average price for all grades of gasoline including taxes was 
12794 a gallon on friday up 102 cents from july 20 
analyst trilby lundberg on sunday said that us oil companies 
have been forced to pay inflated prices for oil and gasoline on the 
shortterm spot market to meet consumer demand during the summer 
driving months 
the refiners are more susceptible to whats happening in the 
middle east now than at any other time she said 
refiners also raised their wholesale prices quickly to prevent 
panic buying that would leave them unable to fill customer orders 
she said 
there was a bright spot for consumers dealers failed to pass on 
the full cost of wholesale price increases to their customers 
between july 20 and aug 10 their profit margins shrank by 08 
cents a gallon ms lundberg said

despite iraqi claims to the contrary the 
iraq economy is weak and illprepared to withstand an economic 
blockade the middle east economic survey reported today 
iraqs financial position was precarious before the invasion 
and the ending of new hard currency flows will impose severe 
strains on the iraqi economy very rapidly said the respected 
weekly newsletter based in nicosia 
the newsletter disclosed that payments for iraqi crude delivered 
even before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait are being frozen 
payment is normally made by 30day letters of credit 
iraqs economy depends almost entirely on oil and the three 
outlets for iraqi oil exports pipelines across turkey and saudi 
arabia and shipment by sea direct from an iraqi terminal at the 
head of the gulf have been blocked 
the blocking of oil exports is part of a total trade embargo 
decreed by a un security council resolution after iraq invaded 
and then annexed kuwait 
drawing together the available economic indicators the clear 
indication is that the iraqi economy has been deteriorating during 
the last year the newsletter said 
iraq was becoming more dependent on outside funding after an 
expensive eightyear war with iran in the second half of 1989 a 
large increase was reported in shortterm debt to western 
industrialized countries 
also last year cash aid to iraq from saudi arabia and kuwait 
estimated at 2 billion a year during the war which ended in a 
ceasefire in 1988 stopped 
in 1989 iraq had trouble borrowing from commercial banks 
according to newsletter of a total of 16 billion in loans 15 
billion was in unauthorized loans from the atlanta ga branch of 
the italian banca nazionale del lavoro 
the middle east economic survey said it is unlikely that iraq 
even before the embargo could have found significant untapped 
sources of new money 
it is clear that at the present time the iraqi economy is very 
vulnerable and that it has little leeway to withstand an economic 
blockade it said 
iraqi president saddam hussein has claimed that iraq can hold 
out against the embargo if it conserves supplies 
iraqs national wealth is abundant our supplies of 
essential needs and food stuffs is great saddam said in a 
message broadcast sunday on baghdad television victory is on our 
side and defeat is certain for the aggessors who have pinned all 
their hopes to their economic sanctions and to their forces and 
their useless fleets 
however in the same speech he indicated a concern about 
shortages he asked iraqi women not to hoard foodstuffs and to cut 
back on consumption

a tanker carrying nearly 1 
million barrels of iraqi oil that docked here does not fall under 
the trade embargo ordered by president bush the coast guard said 
mobil oil corp accepted the oil at its paulsboro refinery on 
sunday but payment for the oil was blocked by sanctions bush 
imposed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 said refinery 
spokeswoman ida walker 
the embargo does not apply to the oil because the 
bahamianregistered tanker left turkey before the middle east 
invasion ms walker said 
mobil contacted the treasury department for instructions and was 
told to accept the oil and deposit the payment due iraq into a 
frozen account she said she did not know how much the shipment 
cost 
the tanker nausicaa was docked in this port located across the 
delaware river from philadelphia it carried the first iraqi oil 
shipment into the area since the embargo was imposed said coast 
guard ltjg jonathan burton 
it was all bought before the thing started he said 
until the embargo is lifted mobil will try to obtain extra oil 
from the north sea mexico or other middle east nations ms walker 
said 
before invading kuwait iraq had been exporting 27 million 
barrels of oil a day through two pipelines across turkey and saudi 
arabia and by ship through the persian gulf

india can repay all the foreign loans it 
receives the nations top finance official said in an effort to 
refute charges that commercial banks are having misgivings about 
lending to the nation 
there has been no scrambling for loans finance secretary 
bimal jalan said in an interview this weekend adding that india is 
not facing a credit crunch 
as far as india is concerned there is still a lot of 
enthusiasm on the part of international financial institutions to 
lend it money he said 
but experts say indias credit is in danger with commercial 
banks and predict that borrowing will become more difficult as its 
oil bills multiply india spends 4 billion a year on oil and 
rising prices will strain indias finances even more 
india was approved last week for 320 million in new commercial 
loans according to a finance ministry document one loan to the 
stateowned oil and natural gas commission by a japanese syndicate 
was previously reported to have fallen through 
jalan said india is paying off 1 billion in loans this year 
and we are absolutely on schedule he admitted however that 
repayment terms were not as good as they once were two or three 
years ago we were underborrowing and we got the finest terms we 
are still getting terms as good as indonesia and better than 
china he said 
vj ravishankar a senior economist at the world bank in new 
delhi said so far india has not been rejected for a loan but its 
credit rating has fallen as it dipped deeply into its foreign 
currency reserves to finance a balance of payments deficit 
india has never had any problems but the situation is 
changing ravishankar said bankers are worried about its low 
foreign currency reserves and the increase in shortterm loans he 
said 
a diplomatic source who closely monitors indias finances agreed 
the drop in reserves to about 2 billion enough to cover one 
months imports worried the banks 
jalan said indias external debt grew to 44 billion as the 
government borrowed to bankroll major projects world bank figures 
said the external debt was actually about 65 billion as of last 
march the larger figure included 9 billion in foreign currency 
deposits by indians living abroad and loans from the international 
monetary fund 
on the positive side jalan said exports are growing at about 18 
percent aa year and keeping pace with imports indias foreign 
debt is 178 percent of the gross domestic product which he said 
is manageable 
the debt service ratio or the percentage of exports needed to 
repay loans declined to 216 percent one of the lowest ratios in 
the developing world and is still falling he said

donald trump may have to reveal some 
details of his financial bailout if the casino control commission 
rules the public has the right to the documents 
trump has requested that some of the 1000 pages of documents 
remain secret because they hold sensitive financial information and 
business plans the commission in hearings scheduled to begin this 
afternoon will decide which documents will be released the 
material outlines a 65 million bank loan made to trump in june 
the loan was designed to avoid a default on bonds issued to 
support the trump castle casino resort by the bay one of three 
atlantic city casinos owned by the manhattan developer 
the commission ruled last week that all the documents could be 
released appellate judge delayed the order the appellate division 
ruled trump should present the commission with specific requests

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states rose for the first time in three weeks jumping 
by 26 this week to 992 baker hughes inc reported 
in the two previous weeks the count had dropped by a combined 
56 rigs a year ago this week the count was 858 
ike kerridge a vice president at baker hughes who keeps track 
of the count said the increase may well be the start of a 
resurgence sparked by the iraqi oil embargo 
if this isnt the increase i would certainly expect it 
shortly kerridge said 
but he noted most of the fluctuation came from texas which last 
week dropped 16 rigs and this week gained 14 kerridge said many of 
those rigs may have been moving to other locations in south texas 
the predominant site of a surge in horizontal drilling in the past 
year 
kerridge said he expected the count to continue increasing 
throughout the remainder of the year from seasonal fluctuations 
alone 
the houstonbased oil toolmaker company has kept track of the 
rig count the widely watched index of drilling activity since 
1940 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states texas gained 14 rigs for the 
week after losing 16 last week other states with gains for the 
week included california which added six and louisiana and 
pennsylvania which each added three 
states reporting rig declines for the week include north dakota 
down three ohio and michigan each of which dropped by two and 
wyoming which lost one rig 
other states including colorado kansas new mexico and oklahoma 
reported their rig counts were unchanged for the week

the united states should be prepared to tap its 
strategic crude oil reserve in case the boycott of iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil creates an insurmountable shortage the head of an 
industry group said today 
president bush should give very serious consideration to 
releasing that oil said charles j dibona president of the 
american petroleum institute there is no immediate pressure to 
do that but that could change and we should be prepared to do 
that 
the white house said late last week that it had no plans to open 
the nations strategic petroleum reserve a vast quantity of crude 
stockpiled in response to the arab embargo oil shocks of the 1970s 
the reserve is stored in underground salt caverns in louisiana 
and is said to contain several hundred days worth of emergency 
supplies 
oil prices climbed again this morning because of the uncertainty 
in the middle east the price of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude rose 47 cents a barrel to 2670 by late 
morning on the new york mercantile exchange oil fetched 21 a 
barrel just before iraq seized kuwait aug 2 
it might take a few weeks for the government to gear up to 
auction the oil held in the strategic petroleum reserve so 
preparations for opening the reserve should be made now to avoid 
any delays dibona said the turmoil in the world oil markets 
caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait is clearly the kind of 
circumstance for which the oil reserve was designed dibona said 
he told a news conference that the immediate fate of the oil 
supply will hinge on the willingness of foreign producers to make 
up nearly 4 million barrels per day that had been exported by iraq 
and kuwait 
saudi arabia a key gulf producer has indicated a willingness 
to help dibona said so has venezuela and to the extent they 
do they will largely make up the 4 million barrel per day 
shortfall however no one can know at this point what the net 
effect on world oil supplies will be 
dibona said there are other steps the united states can take to 
lessen the effects of the higher prices 
he called on the government to open the point arguello oilfield 
off the coast of california which he said is sitting idle because 
california officials have not given oil companies permission to 
deliver their oil the field could immediately produce 90000 
barrels per day dibona said 
consumers could ease the crisis by conserving the oil they use 
and by resisting the temptation to top off their tanks or hoard 
supplies although conservation will not be enough to solve the 
problem dibona said 
asked about complaints from consumers that oil companies have 
been unfairly raising prices dibona reiterated the industrys view 
that the companies have shown restraint retail prices of gasoline 
have not risen nearly as high as spot market prices or wholesale 
prices he said 
the petroleum industry has not taken advantage of this 
international crisis in a selfserving way dibona said dibona 
declined to predict what will happen to prices in the future 
increased domestic production could also alleviate the oil 
crisis dibona said but oil companies base their plans for more 
exploration on their projections of prices over a long term the 
prices have been changing too rapidly in recent days to permit any 
such longterm planning dibona said

sears roebuck amp co chairman edward brennan was 
given an ultimatum by the board of directors last week to either 
shape up the companys sagging retail operations or ship out 
crains chicago business reported today 
sears categorically denied the report 
crains attributing the report to unidentified board members 
said brennan was told at a directors meeting last wednesday that 
he has six months to achieve marked improvement in retail profits 
the company did announce after that meeting that brennan demoted 
the head of the merchandise group and took on those 
responsibilities himself 
at the time sears said michael bozic was removed as president 
of the merchandise group because he wasnt moving fast enough to 
implement changes already under way 
but crains said there was more to bozics removal than met the 
eye 
you say you can turn this around then do it yourself a 
director told brennan according to the crains account 
sears spokesman gerald f buldack denied there was any truth to 
the crains report 
its absolutely false and misleading buldack said he 
declined to answer specific questions about the report

much of the immediate reactions in securities 
markets after the iraqi invasion of kuwait was based on fears of an 
oil shortage and a runup in the price of fuel as in 1973 and 1979 
but much has changed since then a good deal of it though not 
all for the better 
some of the conservation program has been junked for example 
but it has left a legacy of better insulated houses more efficient 
combustion engines and less reliance on oil and parts of the 
program can be resurrected 
the political situation has changed 
back then the organization of petroleum exporting nations was 
united in efforts to raise prices and the world powers were still 
antagonistic toward each others plans whatever they were 
today much of the arab world opposes iraqs actions and the 
worlds powers seem more accommodating to each others hopes for 
the future opec seems willing to allow production to rise 
stability is another widely shared goal 
oil reserves of the western world and japan today are massively 
higher than before the united states has close to a billion 
barrels in strategic and commercial oil stocks relative to usage 
japan may have more 
meanwhile the lesson of the 1970s was not entirely wasted 
philadelphia electric now relies heavily on nuclear power 
generating less than 5 percent of its electricty from oil new 
england electric has cut its reliance in half 
the economic situation has changed 
in the 1970s the us economy was effectively out of control 
with prices and interest rates high or rising as a result the 
federal reserve tightened its monetary policy hoping to slow the 
economy 
in 1990 the economy has many weak spots debt for instance 
that pose more critical dangers than a temporary increase in the 
price of oil the economy as a whole is under a tightfisted 
monetary policy 
moreover when the fed pushed up shortterm interest rates in 
the earlier crises it precipitated recessions the second one 
considered to be among the worst of the century it isnt likely to 
commit that error again 
while a prolonged shortage of oil or extreme prices could be 
debilitating to the american economy that prospect is not nearly 
so high today as it was in the 1970s when major oil producing 
countries were united in their stand 
a shortterm cut in the flow of oil from abroad still would 
affect prices but perhaps to a smaller degree than many people 
fear in the absence of panic says economist roger brinner a 
2abarrel rise seems likely in 1991 
by his calculations for drimcgrawhill an important provider 
of economic data to the private sector this would imply a 5 
percent gain in the average wholesale price of all fuel and power 
while that 2abarrel increase would be close to 10 percent he 
reasons that the significant roles of nuclear hydro and coal 
generation would dilute the effect on delivered prices 
the consumer impact would be even less he says because 
household spending on energy is 55 percent of all consumer 
purchases the direct inflation impact is about a quarter of a 
percentage point 5 percent of 55 percent 
the spillover from other product and labor markets could add to 
this impact brinner believes it might mean a total price bulge of 
05 percent but not to any material sustained increase in the 
rate of inflation 
a more optimistic scenario than many would paint of course and 
it never should be forgotten that economic projections have a 
tendency to be revised when confronted with reality

an electrical blackout disrupted new yorks 
financial district today halting the operations of many investment 
companies and the trading of some stocks and commodities 
the american stock exchange new york mercantile exchange and 
other new york commodities futures exchanges suspended trading for 
the rest of the day following the early afternoon power failure 
many financial brokers and dealers had to curtail or suspend 
operations and others simply told workers in the affected area to 
leave for the day after power failed at about 115 pm 
except for a skeleton crew everybodys heading home said 
steven faigen spokesman for shearson lehman brothers one of the 
biggest wall street investment firms 
shearson and other major brokerages still kept traders on the 
floor of the new york stock exchange which was unaffected by the 
power outage but the volume of trading slowed 
a substation fire caused the outage which affected much of 
southern manhattans wall street area the world trade center and 
world financial center headquarters of many of the nations 
biggest financial businesses con edison new yorks electrical 
utility said it wouldnt restore power for hours 
the outage also briefly disrupted operations at dow jones which 
publishes the wall street journal and operates a financial news 
wire service spokesman james ambrosio said the news wire stopped 
for about 30 minutes and the company was operating on emergency 
backup power 
the fire at con eds seaport substation began shortly after 
noon said utility spokesman dan walden 
it knocked out some high voltage cables serving the area 
walden said initially affecting 500 customers two other feeder 
cables became overloaded and were also knocked out causing the 
blackout to spread 
i cant say for sure how many now but its going to be 
substantially more than 500 walden said 
concern that continued electrical usage by other customers would 
overload feeder cables and knock out additional networks prompted 
con ed to issue an emergency plea for immediate cutbacks 
its imperative that other customers cooperate walden said 
the cause of the fire which was not under control more than an 
hour after it began was not immediately known the fire also 
affected some subway service in the area the transit authority 
said

rain fell monday in the mississippi delta region where 
drierthannormal conditions had raised concerns about the soybean 
crop 
weather forecasters predicted a continuation of beneficial crop 
weather in the midwest where the bulk of us corn and soybeans 
are grown 
the broadbased decline also reflected disappointment in the 
markets generally weak response last week to a government crop 
report that projected lower 1990 us corn and soybean production

sears roebuck amp co said monday theres no truth 
to a published report that chairman edward brennan was given six 
months to revive the companys retail operation or risk losing his 
job 
the report in this weeks edition of crains chicago business 
quoted unidentified directors as saying the board is fed up with 
sears decline as the nations biggest general retailer 
brennan is on real thin ice and he has a very short time 
period crains reported quoting a source close to the company 
he has taken over the helm of a ship that has a rotten bottom 
and he has been running around trying to patch up the holes with 
tar but he has too many gushers 
brennan reportedly was given the ultimatum during a directors 
meeting last wednesday 
after the meeting the company announced the demotion of michael 
bozic from head of the retail operation and said brennan was taking 
on those added responsibilities 
but director albert v casey former chairman of amr corp said 
he attended wednesdays meeting and there was no attack on brennan 
his job isnt in jeopardy at all casey said in a telephone 
interview monday if we didnt have him hes just the kind of 
executive wed be looking for 
sears also denied that brennan had been given an ultimatum 
its absolutely false and misleading spokesman gerald 
buldack said of the crains report he declined to answer specific 
questions about the story 
sears stock dropped 25 cents to 3050 in monday trading on the 
new york stock exchange 
before taking over the leadership of sears brennan had been in 
charge of its merchandise group and led it to its top earnings in 
1984 
but the company has struggled in recent years with rising costs 
stiff competition and a sluggish overall retail environment 
sears retailing costs are the highest in the industry expenses 
last year consumed 30 cents of every retail sales dollar compared 
with 23 cents at k mart corp and 16 cents at walmart stores inc 
net income produced by the merchandise group declined 32 percent 
during the second quarter of this year

gold prices climbed to fivemonth highs monday 
on concerns that iraqs occupation of kuwait could explode into war 
involving western forces choke off the oil flow and batter the 
economy 
the us dollar meanwhile slumped against major foreign 
currencies which are expected to strengthen as interest rates rise 
overseas while rates fall here as monetary authorities try to keep 
the economy out of a recession 
gold for current delivery was up 830 a troy ounce at 40520 
as trading was unexpectedly halted in the early afternoon on new 
yorks commodity exchange due to a power outage the gain followed 
a rise of 1110 an ounce 
the spot price for gold hasnt closed that high since early 
march traders said 
in afterhours trading at republic national bank in new york 
gold was quoted at a 40325 an ounce as of 4 pm edt up 7 from 
fridays late bid 
dealers in new york said most of the gains in gold prices 
occurred overnight in foreign markets and included reported 
purchases by mideast buyers 
they said gold prices surged in the first hour in new york to 
match the gains overseas but trading was subdued and featureless 
for the rest of the day 
the price rise reflected the continued crisis in the 
mideast said steven pepper bullion dealer for republic national 
bank 
he said investors buy gold in times of international political 
turmoil and the metal also affords protection against inflation 
that is expected to result from the oil price surge that followed 
iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 
gold rose 1335 to 40460 an ounce in london and jumped to 
404 an ounce in zurich from 39050 late friday earlier in hong 
kong gold rose 292 an ounce to close at 39767 
silver for current delivery rose to 5145 per troy ounce on the 
comex up 176 cents from fridays close silver rose to 515 a 
troy ounce in london from 495 late friday 
in the currency markets the dollar lost more ground against 
major currencies on anticipation that us interest rates will move 
lower while rates overseas rise in coming days 
the dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks because of 
weakness in the us economy and many traders expect the federal 
reserve will eventually move to lower interest rates in an effort 
to stimulate the economy to keep it from a recession 
but at the same time traders expect rates will rise in germany 
and japan as central banks there try to head off inflation due to 
rising oil prices 
the net effect would be to make the dollar less attractive for 
foreign investors 
the only thing supporting the dollar is the flight to 
quality that is traditionally involved when international events 
are in turmoil said karen gibbs a seniuor financial analyst for 
dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
the dollar is no longer perceived as quality its the swiss 
franc the dmark and the australian dollar she said 
in new york the dollar fell to 15025 japanese yen from 15040 
yen late friday earlier in tokyo the dollar rose to 15065 yen 
from 14975 yen at fridays close in london it fell to 15035 yen 
the dollar lost ground against the british pound in new york 
the pound rose to 18825 from 18735 late friday in london 
sterling rose to 18842 from 18730 late friday 
dollar rates in new york compared with late rates friday 
included 15780 german marks down from 15895 13165 swiss 
francs down from 13375 52925 french francs down from 53325 
115625 italian lire down from 116500 and 114625 canadian 
dollars down from 114705 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late rates 
friday included 15762 german marks down from 15895 13160 
swiss francs down from 13400 52915 french francs down from 
53360 17753 dutch guilders down from 17925 115600 italian

longtime us employees of chase manhattan corp 
are being offered severance payments to leave their jobs early as 
the nations secondbiggest banking company begins efforts to trim 
costs by 300 million 
the company made the offer last week to employees with at least 
10 years service a company spokesman who asked not to be 
identified said monday 
he was unable to say how many of the companys 30000 domestic 
employees are eligible for the program but estimated it is a few 
thousand 
like other major banking companies chase has been under 
pressure to cut costs because the commercial real estate market has 
left lenders with increasing levels of problem loans 
chase expects to charge about 30 million against its 
thirdquarter earnings as a result of the voluntary program 
depending on how many employees take advantage of it it expects to 
save 10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the program 
again depending on participation 
the new separation program is only part of the companys plan to 
trim costs the chase spokesman said he said the program is a 
way of giving added flexibility to the employees who have been with 
us a long time 
under the offer employees who retire with at least 10 years 
service would get two weeks pay for every year of service and 
those with at least 20 years would get three weeks pay for every 
year of service 
the offer is open until sept 10 
chase told employees in june that it intends to trim 300 
million in costs that announcement came in the wake of a 
management reorganization in which it named president thomas g 
labrecque to replace willard c butcher as chairman and chief 
executive officer effective oct 31 
for the first six months of this year chases profits have 
fallen 64 percent to 96 million or 44 cents a share 
for the third quarter of 1989 chase lost 111 billion or 
1245 a share including 126 billion of special provisions such 
as adding to the banks reserves for possible losses on loans to 
countries refinancing their debts

wheelingpittsburgh steel corp closed coke ovens and blast 
furnaces monday as the ailing steel maker braced for a strike 
thursday by 5500 union workers in ohio west virginia and 
pennsylvania 
the wheeling wvabased company said it cut production after 
the united steelworkers rejected a contract that included a 3000 
signing bonus and a raise of 2 an hour in each of the next four 
years 
workers at 13 usw locals last month authorized a strike 
beginning just after midnight wednesday 
usw spokesman dick fontana said monday the union had no comment 
on the rejection of the offer 
resumption of talks wasnt scheduled this week but 
wheelingpitt was trying to meet with the union before the strike 
deadline said company spokesman ray johnson 
wed certainly be willing to sit down with them to negotiate 
further he said 
wheelingpitt the nations 10th largest steel maker operates 
steel mills in allenport washington county pa beech bottom 
follansbee and wheeling wva and steubenville mingo junction 
canfield martins ferry and yorkville ohio 
the company sought protection from its creditors in us 
bankruptcy court in 1985 and its reorganization has been one of 
the nations longest 
wheelingpitt said in a news release monday that mills were 
preparing to stop making and shipping steel to effect an orderly 
shutdown in event of the walkout 
you dont just shut these operations down by pressing a 
button johnson said you have to gradually get them to a point 
where you can shut them down 
union officials have said they are angry about fees paid to 
accountants and lawyers in wheelingpitts reorganization and 
payment to union members of 13 cents on the dollar for stock 
compared to 74 cents on the dollar for creditors claims 
wheelingpitt said its negotiators are concerned the usw kept 
details of the rejected proposal from rankandfile members the 
company said it would keep its doors open to employees who wanted 
to work during a walkout 
the company alleged a strike would violate federal labor laws 
and accused the usw of repressive bargaining 
wheelingpitt chairman william scharffenberger told the 
companys board of directors in july that a long strike would force 
him to consider liquidating the companys assets and turning over 
proceeds to creditors

creditors overseeing the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization of the federated and allied retailing companies were 
relieved by the ouster of chairman robert campeau of campeau corp 
a creditors lawyer said monday 
torontobased campeau corp which owns federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp announced friday that the 
66yearold canadian businessman who founded the company more than 
40 years ago had been forced out as chairman and chief executive 
he remains as a company director but his future role has not been 
announced 
we obviously hope that it would have some positive although 
i doubt any immediate direct impact his involvement has not had 
any apparent effect on the administration of these cases said 
lewis rosenbloom a lawyer representing federateds unsecured 
creditors 
i think whats important is his removal reflects realization 
by his board of directors and shareholders of the financial 
destruction wrought by the administration of federated and 
allied rosenbloom said 
campeau engineered the 1986 purchase of allied and the 1988 
buyout of federated the leveraged deals saddled federated and 
allied with debt that prompted them to seek chapter 11 protection 
from creditors on jan 15 in cincinnati 
federated and allied which listed 77 billion in debts still 
have not announced when they plan to file their formal plans for 
emerging from reorganization us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug 
jr of cincinnati is overseeing their operations 
rosenbloom said the ouster reassured creditors because it 
suggests campeau will not attempt to involve himself in the 
reorganization by claiming equity in the reorganized federated and 
allied federated and allied both based in cincinnati operate 256 
stores in 28 states and employ about 100000 people 
our view was that any role he would play would be in the 
ultimate reorganization of those companies and that he would 
potentially present an impediment to the reorganization process 
rosenbloom said 
rosenbloom said the creditors he represents want federated and 
allied to survive not be liquidated because the two companies 
have demonstrated historically that they are profitable 
our constituency believes that the return of the companies to 
the marketplace as operating companies outside of chapter 11 is 
very very important to the health of the companies he said 
conrad morgenstern the us trustee helping aug administer the 
federated and allied cases said robert campeaus ouster should not 
affect the reorganizations 
carol sanger a campeau corp spokeswoman in cincinnati said 
federated and allied have been remote from robert campeau since 
januarys chapter 11 filings ultimately i think it may prove to 
be a good thing in that many of the creditors were urging that this 
be done all along ms sanger said it will have no direct 
impact as far as were concerned

gold futures prices soared in an abbreviated trading session 
monday on new yorks commodity exchange reflecting rising 
inflation fears as oil prices continue to climb 
on other commodity markets grain and soybean futures fell 
sharply and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
trading on the new york commodity exchanges ended abruptly with 
an electrical blackout early in the afternoon that affected much of 
new yorks wall street district 
on the commodity exchange trading halted with gold futures up 
720 to 11 with the contract for delivery in august at 40520 a 
troy ounce the strongest finish for a spot gold contract since 
march 1 
silver futures ended 171 cents to 209 cents higher with august 
at 5145 a troy ounce 
precious metals rose sharply for the third straight day as 
surging oil prices kept inflation fears alive gold is considered a 
good hedge against inflation 
when trading ended on the new york mercantile exchange west 
texas intermediate crude oil futures were 43 cents to 1 higher 
with september at 2666 a barrel heating oil was 148 cents to 3 
cents higher with september at 7505 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 65 cent to 345 cents higher with september at 8290 
cents a gallon 
strength in the oil markets was again linked to tensions in the 
persian gulf where a barricade of us warships stood ready to 
block all trade with iraq 
iraqs conquest of kuwait has been a powerful stimulant for 
gold which traded as low as 352 an ounce in early june some 
analysts believe the market would fall just as sharply if the 
middle east situation suddenly cooled 
but stephen gotwald vice president of goldcorp australia a 
marketer of australian precious metal coins said mondays rally 
above 405 demonstrated some real confidence in gold that had 
nothing to do with the middle east 
and as long as the united states remains a key player in the 
persian gulf war gold will find additional support there he said 
the deeper we go the less likely that a reasonable solution 
is going to be found any time soon gotwald said of the middle 
east situation 
grain and soybean futures tumbled on the chicago board of trade 
partly in reaction to improved growing conditions for the southern 
soybean crop 
rain fell monday in the mississippi delta region where 
drierthannormal conditions had raised concerns about the soybean 
crop 
weather forecasts predicted a continuation of beneficial crop 
weather in the midwest where the bulk of us corn and soybeans 
are grown 
in a sixto10day forecast released after the close the 
national weather service predicted normal to abovenormal 
temperatures and normal precipitation in the midwest for the first 
half of next week 
a 30day forecast projected warmer and drierthannormal 
conditions for the region through midseptember 
corn and soybean development continues to lag well behind the 
normal pace according to the agriculture departments weekly crop 
progress report which was also released after the close 
wheat futures settled 3 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 275 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 5 cents lower with september at 245 a bushel oats were 
3 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 116 a bushel 
soybeans were 5 cents to 14 cents lower with august at 603 a 
bushel 
strong cash markets helped lift nearterm livestock and meat 
futures on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle settled 15 cent lower to 23 cent higher with 
august at 7920 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent to 55

a wall street blackout displaced iraqs saddam 
hussein as the bogeyman of the us financial markets monday 
disrupting trading in stocks bonds currencies and commodites 
the fire at a con edison power substation forced the american 
stock exchange new york mercantile exchange and other futures 
markets in southern manhattan to close by early afternoon 
the new york stock exchange was unaffected by the outage but 
trading volume slowed at the nations biggest stock market as 
electricitystarved offices elsewhere in the financial district 
emptied 
thousands of workers from secretaries to investment bankers 
flooded into trafficsnarled streets and headed home early 
yellowtinged smoke from the substation fire billowed through the 
skyscraper canyons of southern manhattan amid the confusion oil 
prices rose gold surged stocks and bonds were mixed and the 
dollar fell 
amex spokesman robert shabazian said power was restored by late 
afternoon and it planned to reopen tuesday morning as normal he 
also said were making provisions for auxiliary power in the 
event theres another outage 
the disruptions in trading caused by the fire added to the 
pressure bearing down on the markets since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait aug 2 among the markets that were forced to close early 
was the volatile oil futures market at the new york merc 
it greatly affected us said peter stern a dealer at refco 
inc a leading new york commodities futures concern our phones 
went down our screens went down a lot of people went home 
the fire forced an evacuation of several buildings including 
parts of the world trade center and world financial center 
complexes that frame southern manhattans skyline leaving some of 
the nations biggest brokerage operations functioning with skeletal 
crews 
it briefly stalled the dow jones news service and caused a more 
serious and prolonged disruption to the telerate inc news service 
two of the principal information pipelines feeding the markets 
in addition the fire hampered trading far beyond new yorks 
borders since many key dealers based in the affected area were 
forced to curtail business this meant they could not move price 
information to the network of computer screens and telephones that 
form part of a global trading system 
to sum it up real simple the bond market more or less shut 
down said mark mccluskey who works on the bond trading desk at 
the manhattan office of bank julius baer amp co a leading swiss 
bank 
many dealers shifted their trades to offices abroad such as 
london and tokyo but others with speculative positions in the 
market were left dangerously exposed 
a number of our sources had no screens to work with or didnt 
want to say anything the picture of the market suddenly 
disappeared and a number of dealers were affected said bruce 
chalfant assistant vice president for information services at 
telerate im sure there are people who are not going to be 
sleeping well there was no close things just stopped 
on the new york merc one of three key world oil markets besides 
london and singapore the price of benchmark west texas 
intermediate crude was up 54 cents to 2677 a barrel when trading 
shut down 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale 
homeheating oil rose 244 cents to 7505 cents a gallon and 
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 335 cents to 8280 cents a gallon 
the exchange said the days trading would be reflected in the 
tally of transactions for tuesday when trading was expected to 
return to normal 
the dow jones industrial average rose 3020 points to 274678 
but the broader market for stocks was mixed and trading was light 
because of the power outage the amex market value index was down 
118 to 33814 before the outage 
prices in the bond market an important barometer of interest 
rates were mixed in light volume as well 
gold was up 830 a troy ounce at 40520 on the new york 
commodity exchange when traded halted the highest price since 
early march and a signal of growing inflation anxiety caused by the 
rise in oil 
the dollar lost value reflecting expectations that higher 
interest rates abroad will make foreign currencies such as the 
german mark and japanese yen worth more

two major airlines announced monday they would cut some domestic 
air fares for a limited time offering the promotion at a time 
major airlines have raised most ticket prices to account for 
sharply higher fuel prices 
eastern airlines announced new discount oneway fares that will 
range from 69 to 139 and cover all easterns 62 us destinations 
from sept 5 through dec 16 the tickets must be purchased by aug 
29 eastern said 
the cheaper fares which will apply only to roundtrip tickets 
with a saturday overnight stay were announced two days before 
easterns scheduled 53 percent hike in its other fares 
like other major airlines eastern is raising most of its fares 
because of the jump in jet fuel prices following the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait by iraq and subsequent speculation of a 
disruption in oil supplies

union lawyers filed an unfair 
labor practices complaint with the national labor relations board 
monday over western union corps lockout of about 2000 workers 
at the same time employees represented by the communications 
workers of america have set up informational picket lines at 
western union telephone and computer centers but said they had no 
plans to call a strike 
in its brief to the washingtonbased labor board the cwa 
accused western union of acting illegally by imposing a selective 
lockout on saturday 
about 500 service and business representatives administrative 
clerks and technicians have been asked to continue work said 
george kohl the unions director of research 
lawyers also are protesting that some temporary workers earn 
more than union employees and that the company violated the 
workers rights to bargain and strike by locking them out 
kohl said he expects the labor relations board to set a calendar 
date tuesday 
union employees have been hoisting signs and distributing 
information since the lockout was declared saturday but the 
unions chief negotiator dan j beckstead said the cwa has no 
plans to call a strike 
it is not a strike beckstead said taking pains to 
distinguish between the informational picket lines and strike 
lines no one has even suggested that we are going to strike 
union employees authorized a walkout two weeks ago but set no 
date for a strike said beckstead president of the communications 
workers of americaunited telegraph workers bargaining council 
monday both sides expressed a desire to continue the contract 
negotiations that began july 23 two weeks before a twoyear 
contract was due to expire 
talks continued after the agreement expired aug 6 but ran 
aground on the companys desire to pare down medical benefits and 
to contract union work to outside firms beckstead said 
western union served notice saturday that it would replace most 
of its union employees unless labor officials reconsidered the 
companys aug 8 offer to extend the expired contract by 90 days 
some temporary workers were on the job by 1 am saturday with 
2200 replacements reporting to work monday morning said western 
union spokesman warren bechtel 
about 300 of the workers are western union managers and the rest 
are locally hired and trained replacements he said 
union workers total nearly 75 percent of the companys 
nationwide staff of 3400 bechtel said 
operations at the giant telegram company have been slowed but 
not disrupted bechtel said 
services are being provided and the level of service is good 
and getting better he said you dont replace trained 
experienced people and overnight come up to same level of service 
but were working on it 
monday pickets were concentrated at western union centers in 
bridgeton mo and reno nev where major central phone bureaus 
and a computer center are located beckstead said

usair group inc said monday it would lay 
off about 200 pilots in a cutback that could also affect flight 
attendants and other employees a spokeswoman for the airline said 
we will not fly as much new service as originally planned in 
view of the state of the economy spokeswoman susan young said in 
explaining the layoffs she said she could not elaborate on the 
number of workers involved or when they might be let go 
earlier monday the air line pilots association announced to 
members that the arlington vabased carrier had decided to lay 
off 211 pilots around the end of the year 
the union told its members in a taperecorded telephone message 
that it learned of the plans last week in los angeles during a 
meeting with usair president seth schofield and other airline 
executives 
usair group lost 1131 million in the first half of this year 
and has not posted a profit since the second quarter of 1989 
i think its safe to say that the airlines traffic and the 
industrys traffic is flat she said 
she also said the airline may have too many pilots for its 
fleet the excess could have resulted from older aircraft and 
rescheduling of aircraft deliveries she said twelve new jets 
had been scheduled for arrival this year but usair delayed taking 
delivery in an unusual costcutting move 
it also has tried to save money by paying less overtime to 
maintenance crews 
the union message said schofield told the pilots master 
executive council that usair foresees a further decline in traffic 
and higher fuel prices 
the vice chairman of alpas master executive council chris 
beebe urged the pilots to adhere exactly to the wording in their 
contract and not to fly overtime

an angry state casino control 
commission on monday ordered donald trump to release information on 
a restructuring that puts the developers three atlantic city 
casinos up as collateral 
however the commission delayed its order for 24 hours to allow 
trumps attorneys to appeal the decision 
the panel ordered all the documents unsealed after trumps 
attorneys asked for a blanket order sealing the more than 1000 
pages of documents detailing a 65 million emergency loan for trump 
the loan was arranged in june after trump missed a date to make 
a payment on bonds sold to finance trump castle casino resort by 
the bay trump made the payment within a 10day grace period after 
receiving a bridge loan while paperwork on the 65 million deal was 
finished 
under the agreement trump for the first time is using his 
casinos as collateral for financial assistance the agreement with 
the banks will restructure about 1 billion of his 13 billion 
casino debt and 19 billion in other debts 
the commission is scheduled to review the bailout on thursday 
and members say they want the plans underpinnings available to the 
public attorneys nicholas ribis and joseph fusco said the 
sensitivity of the documents could jeopardize the negotiations 
acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong said in a 
scathing opinion that trumps attorneys again failed to prove why 
the public should not know the details of trumps restructuring 
this proposal would if approved by the commission 
collateralize mr trumps ownership of three of the largest casino 
hotels in atlantic city ms armstrong said it is indisputable 
that the economic structure and stability of trumps casino 
holdings in this state is a matter of public concern 
she rejected the argument that details of trumps problems would 
hamper his dealmaking efforts 
it is certainly no secret to the marketplace that mr trump is 
experiencing serious financial difficulties ms armstrong said 
since its april 2 opening the trump taj mahal casino resort has 
hovered around the 13 million a day in gross gaming revenues that 
analysts said it needed to show a profit however those figures 
were achieved in months skewed by the attention given the opening 
and by higher numbers traditionally recorded by the casinos during 
the summer 
trumps other casinos trump castle and trump plaza hotel and 
casino have posted faltering numbers since the taj mahals 
opening 
by a 41 vote the commission rejected attorneys requests to 
seal the documents that included a debt repayment schedule for 
trump which ms armstrong termed the key inquiry of the 
upcoming hearing 
in another development related to trumps restructuring ribis 
said first boston corp would handle the restructuring replacing 
merrill lynch corp which left last week
