the scars on hilario bustamantes 
back are a year old now reminders of the armed men who abducted 
and tortured him then left him for dead 
his story is an example of what roman catholic priests lawyers 
and civil rights workers say are continuing widespread violations 
of human rights despite president corazon aquinos oftstated 
commitment to social justice 
bustamante now 19 says he and a companion were grabbed on a 
manila street in march 1988 while putting up posters protesting 
us military bases he says they were taken to a military 
garrison tortured driven to a remote field and dumped 
his companion was found dead and police say they still have no 
leads bustamante fears for his life and has given up pursuing the 
case 
mrs aquino denies that her government sanctions such abuse the 
military says it is weeding out offenders and indoctrinating 
soldiers out of respect for human rights 
in december however the human rights organization amnesty 
international reported a pattern of torture in the philippines 
as a result of the governments intensified campaign against 
communist insurgents 
critics of mrs aquino say she is reluctant to crack down on 
abuses by the military because she needs loyal officers to remain 
in power and fulfill her pledge to crush the rebels 
some claim violations of human rights are more widespread now 
than under ferdinand e marcos who was driven into exile in 
february 1986 by the militarycivilian uprising that put mrs 
aquino in office 
task force detainees affiliated with the catholic church says 
8367 people were detained in 1987 on suspicion of links to rebel 
groups compared with 5967 reported arrested in 1985 the last 
full year marcos was in office it claims one of four arrested are 
tortured 
the organization documented 98 massacres in 1987 compared with 
54 in 1985 including 17 people slain in lupao in february 1987 and 
at least 13 protesters killed during a manila march for land reform 
in january 1987 
although the military acknowledges soldiers were responsible 
there have been no convictions in either case 
her own governments commission on human rights says only 12 
people have been convicted of human rights violations since mrs 
aquino replaced marcos 
amnestys report blamed the abuses on military and paramilitary 
units including hundreds of anticommunist vigilante groups 
organized since 1987 to help fight the rebels 
the president called the report unfair but those active in the 
human rights movement say little is done to identify and punish 
offenders victims usually keep silent for fear of reprisal 
priests and lawyers say the military frequently calls a whole 
village communist if rebels operate in the area and chooses 
civilians for arrest and torture on flimsy evidence 
leticia buenaseda a lawyer for the commission on human rights 
on samar island said she received threats from the military and 
soldiers ransacked her office after she began investigating the 
disappearances of several civilians six human rights lawyers have 
been killed since october 1987 
an irish priest in mindanao the rev michael sinnot said the 
armys conduct was driving civilians into the insurgent ranks 
he described the military as the best recruiting agency for 
the rebels 
for every abuse they commit for every one person they kill 
they recruit five people more sinnot said 
human rights activists fear the situation will get worse as the 
army deploys a new civilian militia called the citizens armed 
forces geographical unit 
military officials say the 50000 militiamen will be sent to 
remote villages to improve security but will be under tight 
control critics claim the militias and vigilante groups are 
virtual death squads 
augusto sanchez a human rights lawyer and former aquino labor 
minister said police and soldiers go after anyone with liberal or 
leftist views 
the red scare has generated feelings among the rightwing 
forces the military and the police that anybody tainted or 
communistbranded is due for liquidation he said 
the rev rafael donato chairman of the association of major 
religious superiors said he referred several cases to mrs aquino 
defense secretary fidel ramos and the chief of staff gen renato 
de villa with no results 
all of them said we will investigate we will investigate we 
will investigate but nothing happens he said 
many of mrs aquinos critics blame the influence of the 
military which grew as ramos and others put down six coup attempts 
and army activity against the insurgents increased 
ramos was chief of staff when the coups were crushed under 
marcos he commanded the philippine constabulary the national 
police force believed responsible for most of the violations but 
never was personally identified with human rights abuse 
soon after gaining power mrs aquino established the commission 
on human rights its only recourse however is to refer cases to 
military courts which have sole power to prosecute soldiers even 
when the victims are civilians 
while there were attempts to fulfill promises i believe she 
was shocked into submission by the series of coups detat said 
arnel de guzman chairman of the ecumenical movement for justice 
and peace she is a hostage of the military or some other 
forces 
hesiquio mallilin a former human rights lawyer who heads the 
human rights commission acknowledged that abuses have continued 
but said his agency is doing its best to improve the situation 
the rev brendan oconnell an irish priest on negros island 
said of mrs aquinos image abroad they see this lovely person 
and say this is not true because human rights is the policy of 
this government 
at home he said people from the slum areas they say 
this beautiful woman is like the baby jesus who will save us 
thats why i think shes part of the problem

a newspaper reported sunday that the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 was conceived during a meeting last year between 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi a palestinian group and irans 
revolutionary guards 
the sunday telegraph attributed its information to us 
intelligence sources the palestinian group the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command headed by ahmed jibril 
has been a prime suspect in the bombing 
the newspaper said us intelligence officers tracked and 
monitored the meeting early last year in libya where the 
participants discussed the coordination of their operations against 
us targets 
it said libyan officials in europe provided logistical support 
for the bombing which was planned and carried out by the 
palestinian group 
us officials believe they now have the names of members of 
the terror network the newspaper said the crisis looming 
before president bush is what he does about it 
it did not elaborate on the purported participation of the 
revolutionary guards the fanatical corps formed by ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
a bomb ripped apart the boeing 747 over the scottish town of 
lockerbie on dec 21 killing all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet 
and 11 on the ground 
another british newspaper the observer reported sunday that 
pan am has refused to disclose to us investigators details of a 
review of its own security carried out by hired consultants two 
years ago 
the weekly said it had obtained sections of the report by the 
israeli security consultants kpi which it said criticized what it 
called pan ams misguided security concept and warned the 
airline was highly vulnerable to most forms of terrorism 
the newspaper said kpi hired in 1987 at a cost of 460000 
recommended security improvements on pan am airliners but it said 
that according to the us house subcommittee on government 
activities and transportation the consultants advice had not been 
acted on before lockerbie 
the newspaper said the subcommittees investigation into pan 
ams failure to act on warnings issued before the disaster has been 
severely hampered by the refusal of the airline and the federal 
aviation administration to release vital information 
it said pan am has argued that to answer many of the committees 
questions would be detrimental to its security and would 
prejudice its position in litigation with relatives of the victims

ordered troops to guard against possible terrorist attacks at us 
military bases on the third anniversary of the american air raid in 
libya

including a us serviceman and wounded 200 
montano said last weeks attack by communist new peoples army 
rebels on a us communications station in northern benguet 
province and the discovery of a wire bomb near clark have caused 
the us embassy concern 
the rebels destroyed a giant antenna and three utility poles in 
the attack on the station rebels said the attack was a response to 
the escalating us military intervention in the country there 
were no injuries and the site remained operational rebels did not 
claim responsibility for the wire bomb 
the bombing was the first attack on a us facility or us 
personnel since october 1987 when rebels killed three americans 
and a filipino near clark

authorities searching saturday for a 
winery worker accused of killing his wife and four other people 
found the bodies of two of his daughters and a third was 
discovered alive with her throat cut 
the bodies were found near a landfill transfer station in 
californias wine country not far from where ramon salcido 28 
fled friday with his daughters teresa 1 carmina 3 and sofia 
4 authorities said 
we do know in fact they are salcidos children sonoma 
county sheriff richard michaelsen said of the victims 
investigators could identify the youngsters from photographs he 
said 
the surviving child was identified as carmina authorities said 
she was in stable condition after surgery at petaluma valley 
hospital in petaluma 
it appears her vital signs are stable and shes going to make 
it said chuck cowen a hospital administrator 
she had a cut in her throat that was 5 to 6 inches long just 
above the adams apple cowen said i dont know how deep but 
it was more than superficial 
she was crying when she came in but was able to make some 
sounds he said the girl suffered damage to her vocal cords but 
doctors believe she will recover 
she made indications to investigators that her father cut her 
throat and that it occurred sometime last night sheriffs lt 
gary zanolini said they were apparently dumped over a cliff near 
the dump 
the three girls were spotted in a ravine near the dump between 
petaluma and sonoma by a man looking for a tool to pry a camper 
shell off a truck michaelsen said the highway patrol was notified 
shortly before 3 pm 
at first he thought they were dolls the sheriff said the 
man whom he would not identify went to get a worker from the 
dump and the two found yet another horrible scene michaelsen 
said 
i tried to talk to the little girl who was still alive and i 
tried to comfort her said tim smith a landfill worker who went 
to investigate she tried to speak and she gurgled from her 
throat her throat was nearly cut from ear to ear 
sheriffs lt chuck smith said the two slain girls appeared to 
have been at the dump for some time but that it was not known 
how they died 
there was no immediate sign of salcido but smith said 
authorities were searching for a brown 1967 ford station wagon 
someone saw near the dump 
fridays attacks on salcidos two sistersinlaw 8 and 12 in 
which both were sexually assaulted and one was nearly decapitated 
had heightened fears for his daughters who vanished from the house 
where his wife was slain salcido also allegedly slew his 
motherinlaw and a coworker 
there was no evidence that salcidos daughters had been sexually 
molested michaelsen said 
police helicopters searched the pretty wine country north of san 
francisco lawmen over most of this 1000milelong state were on 
alert for salcido whose 10yearold car was discovered abandoned 
20 miles south in san rafael 
investigators received hundreds of calls from people who claimed 
to have seen the burly blackhaired salcido everywhere from sonoma 
county to los angeles 400 miles to the south 
authorities on friday found the battered and slashed bodies of 
salcidos motherinlaw marian louise richards 47 and her 
children marie 8 and ruth 12 inside their bloodsplattered 
house in cotati

sheriffs deputies went to the winery where they found 
assistant winemaker tracey toovey alongside his car dead of 
gunshot wounds 
deputies went to boyes hot springs and found salcidos wife 
angela 24 who apparently had been beaten and stabbed to death 
michaelsen said 
michaelsen said the bloodbath could have been triggered by a 
child support case that came to a head last week salcido was 
ordered to pay 511 a month to his exwife debra ann salcido and 
nearly 6000 in back payments 
ms salcido was under police protection saturday authorities

he would come home from the winery to see if someone was with his 
wife

crowds surging against a steel 
antiriot fence in a packed soccer stadium crushed 94 fans to death 
and injured at least 200 saturday in britains worst sports 
disaster police said 
most of the dead some of whom were trampled after the fence 
collapsed were teenagers and children ambulance official michael 
boyce said 
the crush appeared to be a result of overcrowding police said 
they opened a gate to admit fans from outside and witnesses said 
hundreds of fans without tickets poured through a turnstile gate 
behind one of the goals crushing those at the front 
we were like animals in a zoo said 17yearold mark meller 
we were crushed against the wiremesh barriers i survived i 
dont know how 
it seemed as if it was four deep in dead bodies with people 
climbing over them said another survivor 22yearold stuart 
mcgeagh 
the death toll of 94 was the secondhighest ever among crowds 
watching soccer the worlds favorite spectator sport and one that 
often sparks fatal accidents among its followers 
south yorkshire police inspector tom walton said the death toll 
rose by one overnight to 94 on sunday he said 17 seriously injured 
people were in intensive care 
the disaster on a sunny spring day added to the deadly image 
that has attached itself in recent years to soccer in britain 
which invented the game more than a century ago 
the disaster occurred at hillsborough stadium in sheffield 150 
miles north of london in the opening minutes of the english fa 
cup semifinal between leading english league teams liverpool and 
nottingham forest 
with the 54000capacity stadium already nearly full police 
opened the gate to admit about 4000 lastminute arrivals fearing 
that otherwise there would be trouble outside said south yorkshire 
chief constable peter wright 
inside the stadium five minutes after kickoff a surge of 
people pushed hundreds of spectators against a steel mesh antiriot 
fence that soon collapsed 
the purpose of opening the gate was to save peoples lives and 
to relieve the crush outside wright said he said he was not 
aware of any connection between the gates opening and the surge 
inside 
police and soccer authorities immediately announced 
investigations into the cause of the disaster 
wright said he believed the tickets of the lastminute arrivals 
were checked but fans said they werent 
a gateman who requested anonymity was quoted by press 
association the british news agency as saying he saw the police 
open the stadium gate 
it was a freeforall there were thousands coming in i said 
to the police what are you doing that for and a policeman said 
someone is going to die if we dont its my opinion that opening 
those gates caused the tragedy 
the 10foothigh fence has metal curved spikes facing the 
standingroom section to stop people from climbing over and a 
stadium official said those who were pressed against it would have 
been lucky to survive 
for about 30 minutes pressure mounted as people poured into the 
section reserved for liverpool fans 
the barrier behind the goalposts collapsed minutes after the 3 
pm kickoff and more spectators were trampled as the throng burst 
onto the field 
many sprawled on the grass gasping for air police and first aid 
workers pounded on the chests of suspected heart attack victims and 
gave mouthtomouth respiration weeping parents and children 
hunted for each other amid the carnage 
a police officer ran onto the field and asked the referee to 
halt the game play stopped at 306 pm and hours later soccer 
officials postponed the match 
for a while there was sporadic fighting between rival fans news 
reports said then as the extent of the injuries became clear 
fans realized crowd violence was not responsible and stopped 
brawling 
bbctv carried the scenes of pandemonium nationwide breaking 
into regular programming 
people were just crushing in there was a lad and his 
girlfriend and they were just screaming his words were please 
god help me and i believe the girl died her face was just 
blue an unidentified fan told yorkshire television 
there was a gentleman on my arm and he said youre choking 
me youre choking me and he just fell and that was the last of 
him said another youth who was close to tears 
witness mcgeagh said everything seemed to be all right until 
about two minutes before the kickoff when there was a big crush 
forward 
i was at the front and stuck up against the fence there were 
railings down either side it was like being in a cage 
i thought i was going to die i was getting short of breath i 
couldnt breathe the weight on me was tremendous 
some spectators escaped by climbing up to an overhead balcony 
others risked impaling themselves as they scrambled over the spiked 
fence 
fans and rescue workers ripped up advertising boards and used 
them as makeshift stretchers some of the firstaid attendants were 
12yearold volunteers who themselves needed treatment for shock 
i am deeply sorry that the day has ended this way said 
english football association chief executive graham kelly we had 
six minutes of football and oneandahalf hours of absolute 
bedlam 
queen elizabeth ii and prime minister margaret thatcher 
expressed their shock 
the death toll of 94 equaled that of an accident last march in 
katmandu nepal when soccer fans stampeded trying to escape a 
violent hailstorm 
the worst loss of life at a soccer match came in may 1964 when 
rioting at an argentinaperu match in lima left nearly 300 dead 
fours years ago 56 people died when fire swept a grandstand at 
a soccer field in bradford england that tragedy came just 18 days 
before 39 people most of them italians were crushed to death in 
fighting between supporters of liverpool and juventus of turin 
italy at the european champions cup final in brussels belgium 
the previous high death toll at a british sports event was 66 
people killed in a crush of fans at a soccer match between glasgow 
rivals rangers and celtic in 1971

communist rebels said sunday they 
would declare a unilateral ceasefire and enter into peace talks if 
president corazon aquino promises to close us bases here by 1991 
the offer was contained in a statement by the rebel national 
democratic front which was delivered to news organizations 
in the statement the group said the united states was using its 
six military bases here to wage war and aggression in the 
pacific and to impose and maintain the prevailing system of 
oppression in this former american colony 
the united states maintains clark air base the subic bay naval 
base and four smaller installations under an agreement that expires 
in 1991 mrs aquino has refused to say whether she will support an 
extension which would require approval of twothirds of the 
23member senate 
the rebel statement said if the government ends the agreement on 
the bases the national democratic front would not hesitate to 
immediately declare a unilateral ceasefire and enter into 
negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement and a 
peaceful end to the civil war 
the front said that if mrs aquino refused it would call upon 
the revolutionary filipino people to themselves dismantle the 
bases 
the front is a confederation of 12 outlawed organizations 
including the communist party of the philippines and its military 
wing the new peoples army the rebels have been waging a 20year

receive returns and make sure they were postmarked before midnight 
taxpayers were given an extra two days to file because the april 
15 deadline fell on saturday residents of new england and most of 
new york state have until tuesday midnight because monday is a 
legal holiday patriots day in massachusetts site of the irs 
service center that receives returns from those states 
neither the irs nor the postal service had a firm estimate on 
how many people delayed filing until the last day the irs said 
only that it expects to receive about 18 million returns this week 
which would include those filed over the weekend about 14 million 
reached the irs last week 
the tax agency projects more than 109 million returns will be 
filed this year but not all those will meet the deadline 
around 6 million couples and individuals will take fourmonth 
extensions to aug 15 by filing form 4868 along with a check for 
the taxes they estimate they owe the extension is only for filing 
not for paying 
a sizable number of the 650000 americans living and working 
abroad qualify for automatic twomonth extensions without filing 
any special form or paying estimated taxes 
some taxpayers dont operate on a calendar year and thus have 
different filing deadlines 
and some will simply miss the filing deadline despite the fact 
that such tardiness can bring a penalty for not filing on time 
even if there is no tax due and additional and more severe 
penalties for not filing and paying on time if there is tax due 
of the 109 millionplus returns anticipated this year we 
expect about 100 million will file during the regular season 
said irs spokesman frank keith 
monday midnight also is the deadline for taxpayers to file 
amended 1985 returns that is an important point for up to 15 
million people mainly pensioners who may have overpaid taxes for 
that year because they failed to claim a credit for withheld taxes 
the irs has since changed a policy that barred employees from 
pointing out such overpayments 
when the first individual returns were filed in 1914 they 
numbered only 358000 identifying as taxpayers or dependents 
considerably less than 1 percent of the population the returns 
covered taxes totaling 28 million a figure so insignificant by 
modern federal standards that it would show up as an asterisk in 
budget documents 
the returns being filed this year represent more than 90 percent 
of the population and will reflect taxes of about 425 billion 
the 1988 returns are the first filed under the threetaxrate 
structure that was enacted as the keystone of the 1986 tax 
overhaul those three rates 15 percent for all the taxable income 
of the majority of taxpayers 28 percent for most others and 33 
percent for a relatively few represent one of the few significant 
taxlaw changes from last filing season 
nevertheless an irs sampling of early returns showed taxpayers 
making the same mistakes that plagued last years filings writing 
down the wrong tax liability figure from the tax tables claiming 
the wrong standard deduction failing to check the box on form 
1040a or 1040ez that indicates whether a person may be claimed as a 
dependent by another and mathematical errors 
the irs cautioned taxpayers to make sure returns are signed and 
that the perjury oath above the signature is not altered the 
envelope in which a return is mailed must carry the correct postage 
or the postal service will not accept it 
processing of a return and of any refund due is expedited if 
taxpayers use the barcoded envelopes and the peeloff labels that 
were mailed out by the irs

security officials at soviet airports last year 
seized more than 250 guns and 900 pounds of explosives a news 
report said sunday 
last summer officials said there were at least 50 hijack 
attempts in the soviet union over the past 15 years however the 
weekly magazine ogonyok which published the new report did not 
say how many of the weapons seized in 1988 were linked to attempted 
hijackings 
the magazine claimed all soviet hijack attempts were motivated 
by a desire to leave the country or by personal greed it said in 
the west people usually commandeer planes for political reasons 
several recent hijackings and attempted hijackings in the soviet 
union have made international news 
on march 30 a man demanding 855000 and a flight to pakistan 
tried to hijack a soviet airliner carrying 75 passengers to the 
caspian seaport of baku he was subdued and no one was injured 
authorities described that wouldbe hijacker as a fugitive from 
the law 
in december four hijackers commandeered a soviet school bus 
and officials provided them with an ilyushin 76t transport plane 
that flew them to israel they were arrested there and sent back to 
the soviet union where they were given prison sentences ranging 
from 13 to 15 years 
the magazine said in its sunday report that more than 250 guns 
900 pounds of explosives and 86177 knives and other weapons were 
confiscated at soviet airports last year 
ogonyok suggested that the best way to avoid hijackings was 
simply to give a ticket to anyone who wants to leave the country 
why are we still stubbornly defending the rules that do not 
permit the uneducated idle people drug addicts and criminals to 
leave the country and go wherever they want the magazine asked

communist rebels said sunday they 
would declare a ceasefire in their 20year insurgency and hold 
peace talks if president corazon aquino vows to close us military 
bases in the philippines by 1991 
the rebel national democratic front made the proposal in a 
statement delivered to news organizations 
the statement said if the aquino government closed the bases by 
1991 and promised no further agreements for us bases the 
national democratic front would not hesitate to immediately declare 
a unilateral ceasefire and enter into negotiations for a 
comprehensive political settlement and a peaceful end to the civil 
war 
the front accused the united states of using its six military 
installations in the philippines to wage war and aggression in 
the pacific and said the bases were a major stumbling block to 
peace in this former american colony 
the united states maintains clark air base and subic bay naval 
base two of its largest facilities overseas and four smaller 
installations in the philippines 
more than 60000 filipinos are employed at the bases where 
about 40000 us troops and their dependents are stationed 
the lease on the us installations expires in 1991 under the 
philippines constitution military bases of foreign countries would 
be banned after that unless twothirds of the 23member senate 
approved a treaty allowing them opposition to such facilities is 
strong in the senate 
mrs aquino refuses to say if she will support extending the 
lease 
the united states has been pushing for early talks on a new 
bases treaty but no date has been set opponents see the bases as 
an infringement of philippine sovereignty and a vestige of american 
colonial rule 
in october the united states and the philippines signed an 
agreement allowing the bases to remain until 1991 in return for 
more than 960 million in american economic and military aid over 
two years 
the front is a confederation of 12 underground organizations 
including the communist party of the philippines and its armed 
wing the new peoples army the removal of us bases is one of 
the rallying points of their insurgency which began in 1969 
the aquino government entered into peace talks with the rebels 
in december 1986 but negotiations collapsed the following month

a state law that forces grandparents to 
support the children of their sexually active young teenagers 
should not have been applied in the case of a 12yearold who 
fathered a child by a 19yearold woman the boys angry father 
says 
the man a dairy farmer who is under court order to submit 
financial information on his ability to pay support says the law 
is unfair and that the woman should have been held responsible his 
complaints have added fuel to debate over the law which could be 
allowed to expire this year 
even a former prosecutor who decided not to press charges 
against the woman because she is slightly retarded said that now 
that she is a legislator she will support changes in the statute 
the decision by prosecutors not to pursue the case prevented the 
boys family from being exempted from the support requirement 
wisconsin was one of the first states to pass such a law holding 
parents financially responsible for children born to their 
children since then several other state have considered the issue 
and a few have passed similar laws said rep marlin schneider 
chief sponsor of the measure 
the law is due to expire dec 31 under a sunset provision 
schneider said he will continue to support it until we have 
something better but said it might need some refinement in light 
of cases like that of the boy 
no one ever thought of the bizarre circumstances like this 
he said 
figures cited by schneider show that as of last october 13 
grandparents or sets of grandparents across the state had been 
ordered to pay support the average support was 80 per month 
last week a winnebago county judge ordered the dairy farmer to 
submit financial information within 30 days for the court to decide 
whether he must pay child support 
the farmer who spoke on the condition his name not be used 
said he believes wisconsins grandparent liability law is unfair in 
his sons case because of the age of the woman 
she was an adult she should have known better said the 
grandfather his son now 15 has no contact with the child born 
in august 1987 he said 
if the woman had been convicted of firstdegree sexual assault 
the boys parents would have become exempt from the childsupport 
liability but the case was never prosecuted 
state rep peg lautenschlager who was then a district attorney 
decided against prosecuting the woman she said she believes she 
made the correct decision because the woman was mildly retarded and 
functioned at a level significantly lower than her physical age 
the woman was required to receive counseling she said 
it was a most inappropriate case for prosecution said ms 
lautenschlager 
milton schierland the winnebago county assistant corporation 
counsel who has pursued the case to try to obtain child support 
payments on behalf of the state said he has the babys best 
interests at heart 
were not bullying a poor set of grandparents he said 
on the surface i would say this sounds terrible this sounds 
like something the legislation was not designed to do schierland 
said 
but he said he believed if people knew the underlying facts of 
the case which county officials cannot discuss because the boy is 
a minor they would not feel that way at all 
robert swain an attorney for the boys parents argues that the 
boy was not a teenager and the grandparent liability law is 
directed at the conduct of teenagers 
secondly he is under the age of consent for having sexual 
relations swain said thirdly she is an adult shes the one 
who is supposed to be exercising responsibility for her conduct 
the case has drawn the attention of the wisconsin civil 
liberties union which has opposed the grandparent liability law 
since it was passed in 1985 as part of a broader wisconsin act 
aimed at preventing teenage pregnancies 
ms lautenschlager said she believes the law is based on a 
faulty premise that holding the parents of a child who has a 
child financially responsible would reduce promiscuity 
schneider said the law was never intended to punish anyone but 
was meant to urge parents to discuss sexual matters with their 
children

the searing question of apartheid has split many 
families in south africa reaching up to the highest social and 
political levels here is a report on the phenomenon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like many afrikaner families 
the de klerk brothers disagree sharply on politics 
what makes their dispute unique is that fw de klerk is 
expected to be the next president of south africa and his brother 
helps lead the antiapartheid opposition 
fw is head of the governing national party and is the oddson 
favorite to succeed president pw botha after elections to be held 
by september 
willem de klerk is chief policy adviser to the new democratic 
party which seeks to end the nationalists policy of apartheid and 
give voting rights to the black majority 
the deep political rift between them is notable because of de 
klerks prominence but it is not uncommon among south africas 3 
million afrikaners families are increasingly split by differences 
over apartheid the multifaceted system of racial segregation and 
discrimination that protects white power and privileges 
there are the breytenbach brothers breyten an exiled poet 
once jailed for aiding black nationalist guerrillas and jan an 
army general 
there is gen constand viljoen former commander in chief of the 
military and his twin brother abram a theologian who ran 
unsucessfully for parliament on an antiapartheid platform 
there is klaus von lieres the attorney general for the 
johannnesburg region and his niece bettina von lieres president 
of the militantly antiapartheid student council at the university 
of the witwatersrand 
her uncle has coordinated the prosecution of scores of 
antiapartheid activists in treason and terrorism cases 
willem de klerk 60 says he maintains a close relaxed 
relationship with his younger brother even though they argue over 
politics 
i try to influence him and he tries very hard to convert me 
again to the national party platform said willem who resigned 
as editor of the countrys major afrikaanslanguage sunday 
newspaper rapport in 1987 after botha complained to the 
publishers about editorials that questioned government policy 
there is a lot of pressure on me from national party people 
who say i am an embarrassment to my brother willem said in an 
interview but this doesnt bother me i am very firm on this one 
point as long as the national party retains race groups as the 
cornerstone for a future constitution i reject that 
the de klerks come from a prominent nationalist family their 
greatgrandfather was a senator and their father was a cabinet 
minister 
willem said he began to diverge from national party thinking in 
1973 when he became a newspaper editor he emerged as a spokesman 
for the relatively liberal wing of the party while his brother 
supported the harsh racial segregation policies formulated by prime 
minister hendrick verwoerd in the 1950s and 60s 
at one point willem wrote that south africa could not and 
should not be divided into black and white an assertion he says 
was almost blasphemy at the time 
his brother 53 also has evolved politically willem said 
hes not so conservative and apartheidoriented as he was 
maybe he will develop into a more enlightened politician moving 
away from apartheid but i dont think he will turn the corner he 
may be a transitional figure 
in his one major speech since becoming national party leader in 
february fw de klerk sought to please both conservatives and 
reformers 
our strong emphasis on group rights is based on the reality 
of south africa and not on an ideological obsession with racial 
prejudice he said there is no such thing as a nonracial 
society in a multiracial country 
willem disagrees 
for white people their only hope for survival is to go into 
the world of nonracialism he said the national party wants 
to entrench racial concepts 
the democratic party established april 8 through a merger of 
three white liberal parties has no illusions about taking power 
in the upcoming elections but willem predicted the national party 
will fare well in the elections under his brothers leadership 
forgetting that its my brother i think voters will feel they 
should give the new man a chance willem said hes a man with 
a different style than botha more relaxed more pragmatic 
despite his break with the national party willem de klerk 
remains very much a member of the afrikaner establishment 
by contrast breyten breytenbach lives in exile in paris and has 
renounced his south african citizenship he has returned to south 
africa only once since he was freed in 1982 after seven years in 
prison on a terrorism conviction for aiding the outlawed african 
national congress 
during the return visit in 1986 breytenbach was awarded an 
afrikaanslanguage literature prize he minced no words during an 
acceptance speech to a mainly afrikaner audience 
i doubt you realize the extent to which we have become 
despicable to the international human awareness he said our 
rottenness is unique 
breytenbach has said he and his brother in the army jan viewed 
each other as dangerous enemies but nonetheless still loved each 
other 
in the case of the viljoen twins it was the conservative 
constand who broke away from the familys relatively liberal 
views according to his brother abram 
we both started careers in the army in 1952 said abram 
after one year i went to university to study theology and he 
stayed in the army our ways parted rather severely as far as 
political thinking goes 
bettina von lieres 24 says her relationship with her uncle is 
cordial but distant 
being the niece of the attorney general has not hampered her 
involvement in student politics she said ive built up my 
credentials as an antiapartheid student council representative if 
anything theres a lot of curiosity about me and in some ways the 
curiosity has developed into respect

the state department of transportation 
knew of structural problems with a highway bridge well in advance 
of the spans collapse in which eight people were killed earlier 
this month records show 
a second bridge collapse meanwhile killed one teenager and 
injured two others riding with him saturday night the pickup 
landed upside down on railroad tracks 25 feet below the 40yearold 
wooden bridge near the eastern tennessee town of oliver springs 
according to trooper ray fletcher 
it was not immediately clear whether the 25foot section of the 
bridge had already collapsed or it crumbled as the truck drove over 
it police said 
the accident killed ronald w gallaher 16 of oliver springs 
his brother derwin 14 was in stable condition sunday at the 
university of tennessee medical center in knoxville timothy e 
seiber 16 of oliver springs was in serious condition at methodist 
medical center in oak ridge 
saturdays collapse in eastern tennessee came exactly two weeks 
after the failure of the hatchie river bridge 45 miles north of 
memphis in the western part of the state eight people died when 
the us 51 span gave way plunging their cars into the flooded 
river 
that accident was thought to have been caused by high water 
washing out or scouring soil away from bridge supports 
tennessee department of transportation records show the 
deficiencies were discovered during inspections in 1985 and 1987 
but bridge inspection reports at the agencys office in 
nashville showed no indication that recommended repairs were made 
maintenance reports kept at the departments regional office in 
jackson tenn have been turned over to state attorney general 
larry teague said william moore jr civil engineering director in 
jackson he declined to comment on the records friday 
as far as i know no major maintenance has been done on that 
bridge in the last several years he told a memphis newspaper 
the commercial appeal 
the transportation department will hire an illinois engineering 
company to investigate the hatchie river collapse moore said 
inspections in july 1985 and september 1987 showed evidence of 
scouring at the hatchie river bridge and recommended that steps be 
taken to protect four bridge supports 
those inspection reports should have been warnings of potential 
future problems said pk basu a civil engineer and professor at 
vanderbilt universitys school of engineering 
if scouring is happening thats a danger signal right 
there basu said right away they should have inspected under 
the water they should have looked at it and fixed it right then 
in a news conference after the hatchie river accident tennessee 
transportation commissioner jimmy evans said that after the 1987 
inspection we saw nothing that unduly concerned members of the 
bridge inspection division 
he said the span was visually inspected in february because of 
river flooding but we did not see anything that would unduly 
concern us about any movements of the bridge at all 
basu said such a visual inspection is worthless

theyre more than twice the size of baseball 
cards come four to a pack and show faces considerably older than 
the average sports hero but even without bubble gum rabbi cards 
are the rage among orthodox jewish youngsters 
i used to collect baseball cards said meyer brull 12 i 
gave them up after a while i gave them to my brother these are 
more interesting 
his brother yossi 10 agreed 
theyre something different from baseball cards my teacher 
used to give out pictures if you were good in class so i got a lot 
that way 
like their counterparts in the baseball world rabbi cards are 
collected by youngsters and some adults who buy them by the 
pack and trade to get pictures of all 36 of the orthodox religious 
leaders featured thus far 
the card back includes the rabbis place and date of birth 
schooling and other facts in both english and hebrew 
in judaism rabbis are teachers as well as spiritual leaders 
and in closely knit orthodox communities they are usually revered 
role models 
the cards produced by torah publications are the brainchild of 
arthur b shugarman more than 300000 cards from the first series 
have been sold since their introduction last august and a second 
series will be out in about a week said shugarman 34 an 
accountant who lives in baltimore and works in suburban towson 
torah publications is nonprofit and any money it makes 
probably will be used to lower costs for the next series of cards 
shugarman said 
its for the children said shugarman the father of two 
young daughters its educational 
shugarman said the next fivecard pack is expected to sell for 
99 cents the current fourcard packs cost 79 cents in most 
locations they are sold at religious goods stores throughout the 
united states and in canada and some european countries he said

hispanic and black women women with low 
incomes those living with someone they are not married to and 
those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions 
than women in general according to a private survey 
firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions 
performed each year nor on who has them moreover the survey by 
the alan guttmacher institute confirms that most abortions are 
performed on white middleclass women because they make up the 
bulk of the population of women of childbearing age 
however the extensive survey by the new yorkbased nonprofit 
group that studies reproductive issues suggests that women in 
various categories have a statistically disproportionate share of 
abortions relative to their raw numbers 
for example it found that nonwhite women make up 167 percent 
of the childbearingage population but accounted for 314 percent 
of the abortions 
white women accounted for 686 percent of those seeking 
abortions but 833 percent of the childbearingage population 
considered 15to44 for purposes of the survey 
and it found that women with family incomes below 11000 
accounted for 331 percent of those receiving abortions although 
they made up only 292 percent of all women of childbearing age 
the federal centers for disease control in atlanta estimates 
there were 1328000 abortions in the united states in 1985 the 
most recent year for which it has numbers the guttmacher institute 
estimates 1588550 that year 
no one questions that the number has increased since the supreme 
court legalized abortion in 1973 the court is hearing arguments 
april 26 in a missouri case that both sides agree could result in 
the reversal or weakening of that landmark roe vs wade decision 
the guttmacher institute surveyed 9480 women who obtained 
abortions at hospitals clinics or doctors offices during 1987 in 
an effort to find out who was obtaining the services 
it selected 103 facilities in what was intended as a 
statistically valid national sample base 21 hospitals and 82 
clinics and physicians offices and arranged for questionnaires 
to be given to the 11313 women who showed up for abortions during 
a 12day period 
although filling out and mailing in the questionnaire was 
voluntary and done anonymously and privately by the woman a large 
number 9480 returned completed questionnaires 
although no specific margin of error was given the large sample 
base lends credibility to the statistical profile of us women 
seeking abortions during that particular period in 1987 
unmarried women living with a man constituted 174 percent of 
the abortion clients although they made up only 34 of all 
childbearingage women 
women attending school constituted 311 percent of those seeking 
abortions but 205 percent of all women of childbearing age 
most women cited more than one factor in their decision to have 
an abortion among the reasons were concerns about how motherhood 
would change their lives financial problems single parenthood 
the responsibility of parenthood others knowing they were 
pregnant maturity and how many children they already had

lives extravagantly

she travels in a black limousine but she also frequents discount 
stores and says she often eats chinese takeout food

amounts of cash ended up in the bamboo thicket 35 feet off a road 
in kawasaki southwest of tokyo police suggested earlier that the 
first bag may have come from a crime

wilkesbarre pa ap a couple have pleaded innocent to 
thirddegree murder charges in the starvation of their teenage 
son who died after the family refused to buy food with money set 
aside for a church tithe 
leona and larry cottam are charged in the jan 3 death of their 
son eric 14 they and their daughter laura 12 were 
hospitalized for treatment of malnutrition laura has since been 
placed in a foster home 
the couple who have been jailed unable to make bail since 
their arrest in january entered their innocent pleas at a hearing 
friday 
according to police the cottam family went largely without food 
for six weeks refusing to spend the only money they had more 
than 3500 set aside as a religious tithe 
the family has been estranged from the seventhday adventists 
church since cottam 39 was dismissed as a minister because he and 
his 38yearold wife refused to send their two children to 
churchrun schools 
eric and laura were schooled at home after their parents won a 
twoyear court battle 
officials of the seventhday adventist church say the religion 
does not advocate fasting holding a tithe instead of buying food 
or turning down offers of help 
one of the cottams attorneys public defender al flora jr 
said he would seek to have the trial moved to another county or 
have jurors picked from another county because of the wide 
publicity given the case 
attorneys for the couple have argued in pretrial hearings that 
the cottams should not have been charged in their sons death 
because he chose not to eat out of his own religious convictions 
the cottams must be tried before july 4 or they would be 
released on 1 bail under state court rules both are jailed in 
lieu of 50000 bail 
they face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted 
of thirddegree murder

when defense secretary dick cheney 
meets for the first time with nato allies this week he will have to 
grapple with europes growing unease over plans to upgrade 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
cheney who took over as defense chief just a month ago begins 
talks wednesday with other defense ministers of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization to review their nuclear posture 
the twoday meeting of natos nuclear planning group will focus 
new attention on modernizing battlefield nuclear arms a 
potentially divisive issue for the allies at a time of warmer ties 
with the soviet union 
diplomats said no key decisions were expected at the talks 
although the united states would like the allies to signal their 
strong commitment to a modernization program 
germany belgium and some other european nations want to 
postpone for several years the politically sensitive decisions of 
production and deployment of a new generation of shortrange 
surfacetosurface missiles 
those countries also would like the alliance to show a 
willingness to negotiate reductions in those weapons with the 
sovietled warsaw pact a position the united states opposes 
warsaw pact foreign ministers recently made a new pitch for early 
arms talks on those weapons 
cheney has indicated flexibility on the modernization issue 
i think the timing is open to question he recently told 
reporters i dont think it has to be done immediately 
he said however that the united states wants the allies at a 
may 2930 summit of nato leaders to adopt a clearcut position 
that indicates that we in fact are going to maintain the 
highquality nuclear forces in europe 
he said in a later interview that the united states opposes 
eastwest negotiations on those arms we do not believe at this 
point it would be appropriate to embark on yet another round of 
arms control talks that would result in eliminating those 
shortrange forces he said 
the soviets have always tried to denuclearize europe thats 
been a major objective of theirs he said weve always 
resisted it 
at the heart of the modernization debate is a plan pressed by 
the united states and britain to upgrade the lance 
surfacetosurface missile military analysts say the lance 
introduced in 1972 will become obsolete in 1995 
the missile has a range of a little more 60 miles the new one 
would travel more than 250 miles just under the limits of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty the accord eliminates 
us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges of about 300 to 
3400 miles 
us gen john galvin natos top military commander in europe 
has drafted a report for nato officials arguing that replacing the 
aging lance will enable the west to make sharp cuts in nuclear 
artillery 
the united states wants a commitment from the allies before it 
urges congress to approve money to produce the new missile 
congress is to consider this year a request for funds to develop a 
model for test purposes but resistance in germany where most of 
the weapons would be based has raised questions about what kind of 
signal the united states will get this spring 
german chancellor helmut kohl says he wants to delay a decision 
on production of the new missile until 1991 or 1992 after 
important elections next year in germany 
a nato official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
were not to a point in the development where the alliance needs 
or it is even possible to make production or deployment 
decisions the alliance he said never planned to make those key 
decisions before 1991 or 1992 
a european diplomat who also demanded anonymity said some nato 
nations worry the modernization program would amount to development 
of a new category of nuclear arms with a vastly longer range 
they are concerned he said that such a development would 
create the impression the allies are trying to get around the 
accord eliminating mediumrange nuclear arms we want to see a 
situation where reliance on nuclear weapons is decreasing he 
said 
the west contends it maintains a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent 
countering the huge superiority the east has built up in 
conventional weapons

two bulls jumped a fence and did the old 
casanova loveemandleaveem routine with a herd of heifers a 
lawsuit going to trial in iowa county circuit court this week 
claims 
a jury will consider the 73000 lawsuit filed by michael and 
paul mieden of barneveld who claim two of their neighbors bulls 
jumped a fence and impregnated 32 meiden heifers during the summer 
of 1986 
the miedens suit alleges that neighbor lloyd vivian was 
negligent because of his failure to properly maintain and repair 
a fence on the boundary line between the two properties 
the miedens claim many of the impregnated heifers were so young 
that their careers as milk producers were diminished by their early 
pregnancies a heifer is a young cow that has not yet had a calf 
colleen martin an appraiser hired by the miedens said in court 
documents that the heifers were bred when they were too small to 
produce milk efficiently 
as a result the animals will never reach full potential in 
size and production due to this crisis ms martin said 
the case was set for a nov 28 jury trial but it was delayed 
after one expert witness was taken ill and hospitalized the trial 
was rescheduled for monday and is expected to last about a week

a judge has upheld the conviction of a ku 
klux klan backer of violating a township firecontrol ordinance by 
allowing a cross to burn on his property saying that a klan 
crossburning was not a religious ceremony 
were we to conclude on this record that kkk is a religion 
under the first amendment we would have to so qualify every group 
who came into court with a bible a lighted match and a claim to be 
a christian carbon county judge john p lavelle said in his 
ruling last week 
according to the court joseph a lower jr and his wife leased 
their property for 1 to the invisible empire knights of the ku 
klux klan for a july 4 rally last summer 
before the rally township police chief richard gross informed 
lower that an ordinance prohibited fires after dark 
however 36 whitesheeted kkk members gathered on lowers 
property for a rally including speeches and marches and ignited a 
large wooden cross which burned for about half an hour lavelle 
said 
district justice bruce appleton of palmerton convicted lower on 
aug 1 and ordered him to pay 325 for a fine and court costs 
lower appealed to lavelle 
lower admitted he violated the burning ordinance but tried to 
get the citation dismissed by arguing the ceremony was religious in 
nature 
at an appeal hearing feb 16 mark w thomas a state chaplain 
with the kkk chapter in reading testified the crossburning 
ceremony was a necessary and integral part of the religious rituals 
of the klan he said the kkk had no ordained ministers but that 
everyone was ordained by god to speak the word of god 
the judge ruled the kkk was not a religion under federal court 
rulings he also found that lower was not a victim of selective 
prosecution by the township because of his membership with the kkk

administration and congressional leaders 
defended themselves sunday against charges that their deal to cut 
the 1990 budget deficit to 994 billion was unrealistic and based 
on accounting gimmicks 
this was the best that could be done said the chairman of 
the senate budget committee sen jim sasser dtenn 
the white house chief of staff john sununu said the agreement 
achieved a very significant reduction of the deficit 
the most prominent critic has been the chairman of the senate 
finance committee sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who refused to 
attend the white house ceremony last friday announcing the deal 
bentsen questioned a provision in the agreement which forecast 
an additional 53 billion in revenues the source of that money 
has not been negotiated and president bush has refused to boost 
taxes to cut the deficit 
critics of the agreement were angered said sununu because 
there is not a big tax package in there 
the extra 53 billion he said would come almost entirely 
from the increased revenue that comes when you reduce the capital 
gains tax 48 billion a proposal that i think in the past 
senator bentsen has been in favor of 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and sununu said the 
administration would not agree to raise revenue next year by 
increasing the federal tax on gasoline but they refused to discuss 
whether such a tax as possible for 1991 
administration and congressional leaders described the agreement 
as an 8year highwater mark in budget cooperation between democrats 
and republicans 
i think that what this bipartisanship means is that we put 
behind us eight years of confrontation and gridlock that occurred 
with the reagan administration and produced absolutely monumental 
peacetime deficits for this agreement said sasser it sets the 
stage for some significant budget reductions in 1991 and beyond 
the chairman of the house budget committee rep leon panetta 
dcalif said the alternative to not working together frankly 
is chaos congress would not be able to put together a budget 
resolution and congress is not going to do anything about tax 
increases without the support of the president that limited our 
choices 
panetta described the agreement as a first step there isnt 
anybody either from the white house or from capitol hill that 
doesnt believe more has to be done 
panetta predicted that the budget deficit would fall below the 
ceiling of 100 billion set by the grammrudman law but sasser 
said i think the deficit will be above 99 billion possibly 
as high as 110 billion 
sasser called the deal a minimalist agreement i would like to 
have done much more 
sasser appeared on the abctv interview program this week 
with david brinkley sununu and panetta on cbstvs face the 
nation brady on nbctvs meet the press

thousands of solidarity supporters marched 
in this baltic port city sunday to pay homage to polish army 
officers massacred at katyn in the soviet union during world war ii 
behind a banner with the word katyn painted in black more 
than 5000 marchers carried urns of soil brought from the graves to 
a workers monument in front of the shipyard where solidarity was 
founded 
the rev henryk jankowski an adviser to solidarity leader lech 
walesa celebrated mass before the march 
he demanded that everything be revealed about the massacre 
we demand this in the name of arranging finally normal 
relations with our eastern neighbor jankowski said nothing 
cures better than truth and honesty 
polish officials have long supported the soviet account that the 
more than 4000 officers were killed in 1941 by the nazis after the 
germans invaded the soviet union but the government recently 
indicated it may change its position to that of most poles and 
western historians who say the soviet secret police carried out 
the massacre on the orders of soviet leader josef stalin in april 
1940 when the soviet union and nazi germany were still allied 
the polish side of a joint commission studying the massacre and 
other historical blank spots with the soviets recently 
presented what officials call circumstantial evidence of soviet 
responsibility there has been no conclusion from the soviet side 
jankowski also called for the truth about the fate of 10000 
polish officers interned at two soviet camps who disappeared at 
about the same time presumed dead their graves have never been 
found 
officials gave permission for the march in gdanks which 
dispersed peacefully except for a delegation of about 150 
supporters of a walesa rival who briefly confronted police 
witnesses reported some stones were thrown at police but the group 
then dispersed and there were no detentions

the crush of humanity that killed 94 
people at a british soccer stadium began in an impatient throng 
outside then swept through a tunnel and pummeled fans trapped 
against a metal antiriot fence 
the immense power generated by shoving struggling crowds pulled 
burly youths off their feet suffocated the strong and left people 
helpless as their friends died in front of them 
survivors many speaking from hospital beds described 
saturdays disaster and the terrible minutes when people died 
unnoticed by those out on hillsborough field 
ive never seen so many fans outside a ground 18yearold 
kevin mulvaney told the sheffield star newspaper there must have 
been 4000 we couldnt move they were desperate to see the 
game 
one policeman said it would take an hour to get everybody in 
and asked people with tickets to wave them in the air then the 
police opened the gate in front of me and that was it they must 
have thought there was going to be trouble mulvaney said 
tom bailey 28 was standing outside the gate and said 
everyone was just pushing then when the match kicked off there 
was a massive shove and we just got jammed 
stephen dooling 34 said the police had to open the door 
because the lads at the front were screaming he said they 
would have died there at the turnstiles instead of in the ground 
after entering many fans were trapped in a tunnel leading to a 
center standingroom area 
the crowd carried dooling into the tunnel 
there was nothing you could do there were bodies 
everywhere and we all went on the floor 
there were fellow scousers liverpool residents who were just 
picking us up and getting us on our feet i loved them for it 
dooling said some of them were big strong dockers and they were 
brilliant they used their strength to get everyone up 
alan mcnab 43 said there was one kid right in front of my 
face his lungs must have collapsed he just turned blue and his 
lips were purple he did not go down the crowd held him up as the 
crush was so tight but he was dead 
the police could do nothing at that time mcnab said they 
were in danger of being crushed to death themselves but they 
should never have opened the gate 
ian turner 21 told the sheffield star i was crushed and was 
dangling two feet off the ground i wriggled free and saw this 
bloke with his face all purple i slapped him and slapped him but 
he was dead 
tony delaney 25 was caught in the tunnel and collapsed he 
regained consciousness as medical workers placed him against a wall 
there was an old bloke next to me delaney said he asked 
me to hold his head in my arms he said to me help me and then 
he just died in my arms 
seventeenyearold wayne adams said he was about five rows from 
the front of the crowd 
there were two youngsters standing near me about 5 or 6 years 
old one of them was bleeding because his face had been crushed 
against the front barrier i think their father was lying near 
them i think he was dead he said 
i helped the little ones climb over the barrier and that was 
all i could do adams said 
the police were as much help as they could be when they 
realized what was happening they just began trying to pull the 
barriers down adams said 
soccer officials halted play six minutes into the game but it 
was many minutes before the extent of the disaster became clear and 
the game was called off 
thomas byrne 37 said people were walking on other peoples 
heads to get out from the crush people were collapsing and 
people were trying to push others out of the way to help those on 
the floor 
people were shouting for help to those at the front to open 
the gates to let them be dragged out but it seemed so slow in 
opening the gates 
steve ellis a photographer said he could hear and see kids 
screaming against the fence 
more were coming in from the back pushing forward at 
first the police were trying to stop the fans climbing over but 
when they realized how serious it was they could not get to them 
because of the fencing 
i can still see the young lads behind the fence shouting 
save me ill never forget it until the day i die

very traditional thing a terribly emotive issue 
for someone used to the polished newness of professional 
stadiums and arenas in the united states the top sports facilities 
in britain come as a shock 
the newest stadium among the 20 clubs in division 1 was built in 
1935 at least 10 teams including sheffield have played in their 
stadiums since the 1890s 
entrance generally is through a turnstile that squeezes a man of 
normal height and weight concessions are few and lines are long 
there is no pregame or halftime entertainment nor even a 
scoreboard clock at most fields 
seats are jammed together and posts supporting the upper deck 
block the view 
there are no posts in the terraces but fans there having paid 
a general admission fee of about 680 stand on bare concrete 
ledges that ascend from the edge of the field to about 10 feet 
above ground level to watch the game they must peer through a 
steel mesh fence 
these perimeter fences were installed in most division 1 
stadiums earlier this decade to cut down on crowd violence and keep 
rowdy fans off the field the bright blue fences at sheffields 
hillsborough stadium where saturdays tragedy occurred did that 
job too well 
some of the measures we took to combat hooliganism may now 
have turned on us said williamson 
hillsborough was built in 1899 it is counted as one of 
englands top facilities however and williamson said sheffield 
and many other firstdivision fields had undergone renovation since 
world war ii 
but updating is one thing tearing down an old field and moving 
a club to a modern venue is another and such changes have not yet 
found support 
sometimes it was lack of money sometimes the council has not 
given approval but the fans have never gotten behind the new 
stadiums ms smith said they have an emotional attachment to 
the old ones 
efforts to draw fans to stadiums early to avoid the type of 
lastminute rush that caused saturdays disaster also have not 
worked williamson said 
the public has been seen to be unexcited by any of the 
entertainment that might be offered before the game he said 
they find their own form of entertainment whether thats 
going to a pub or whatever

late sen joseph mccarthy 
theres absolutely no truth to it downey told the milwaukee 
journal i have no plans to attend 
milwaukee lawyer thomas bergen president of the senator joseph 
mccarthy educational fund said last week downey would speak at the 
may 7 event in appleton it honors the republican senator who 
gained notoriety for accusing a variety of public figures in the 
1950s of promoting communism often without substantiation 
downey said friday that he did not know anything about the 
mccarthy group 
bergen was quoted as describing downey as a longtime supporter 
of the senators beliefs but downey though a hotly opinionated 
conservative said he did not agree with the way mccarthy went 
about his business

bergen said he advertised the dinner as featuring downey after 
telling the tv hosts staff he would settle for a tape of downey

the government sunday announced steep price 
increases on items ranging from gasoline to longdistance telephone 
calls as part of an economic reconstruction program for the 
financially troubled kingdom 
under an agreement with the international monetary fund 
announced friday jordan also plans to slash its budget deficit to 
help solve its debt crisis 
the agreement paves the way for jordan to seek rescheduling or 
refinancing of its 6 billion debt it has already fallen behind on 
some of the 12 billion repayments scheduled for this year 
the price increases announced by the official jordan news 
agency do not affect subsidies on bread milk rice and other 
staples 
the price of regular gasoline was raised by 25 percent to 41 
cents a liter from 33 cents a 20pound bottle of cooking gas will 
cost 370 up from 333 
the price of imported cigarettes went from 120 to 157 the 
cost of international phone calls and annual telephone rental fees 
went up 10 percent 
the government also raised the tax on alcoholic drinks from 20 
percent to 50 percent for imported beverages and to 40 percent for 
local beverages 
many workers in this country of 3 million people earn between 
185 and 370 a month families often have as many as seven to 10 
children 
the increases follow austerity measures imposed last year when 
jordan devalued the dinar by 40 percent and banned imports of many 
luxury goods 
per capita income for jordanians reached nearly 2000 a year in 
the early 1980s but it has since declined to less than 1200 a 
year that happened because jordan is a small country that must 
import many essential goods whose local prices rose because as the 
value of the dinar declined 
the country ran into balance of payments problems when arab aid 
and remittances sent home by jordanians in the persian gulf slumped 
along with oil prices in the mid1980s and jordan continued to 
borrow heavily 
the kingdom which produces little oil has blamed its problems 
in part on the failure of arab oil states to pay it the bulk of the 
1 billion yearly they pledged for a decade at a 1978 arab summit

christine keeler recalled explaining events more 
than a quartercentury old to her teenage son seymour 
years ago i did say to seymour you know when i was 
younger i was more beautiful and i did some naughty things 
occasionally if i wanted to and i let somebody manipulate me if 
i wanted them to but i knew that was wrong and i didnt do it for 
very long 
but history has a tenacious memory and keeler is once again big 
news the former british showgirl whose liaisons with war minister 
john profumo and a soviet naval attache rocked harold macmillans 
government in 1963 is at the center of a new movie and book both 
called scandal 
ive finally got the truth out which ive been trying to do 
for a long time said keeler who was 19 when osteopath stephen 
ward then her friend and mentor introduced her to profumo at a 
party at lord astors cliveden estate in july 1961 
a short affair ensued as did a complex scenario mixing sex 
race spies and politics that made the workingclass keeler an 
enduring household name 
twentyeight years later keelers notoriety is undimmed even 
if her black hair has started going gray and her skin now looks dry 
and parched she went unrecognized during a lunch interview with 
the associated press and requested that no photographer be present 
the film scandal directed by michael catonjones closes 
the american film institutelos angeles 1989 festival on april 27 
and opens commercially across the united states the following day 
joanne whalleykilmer plays keeler opposite john hurt as the 
doomed ward who died of a drug overdose in 1963 that was the same 
year profumo played by ian mckellen resigned from macmillans 
conservative cabinet helping to ensure the partys subsequent loss 
in the 1964 elections 
keelers book scandal has its american publication in late 
may or early june by st martins press 
in conversation the day prior to a twoweek promotional tour of 
the united states keeler expressed mixed feelings about living off 
her past 
i dont want it to come across that i did it all for the 
money the film and everything im right in the middle of the 
story arent i i cant just suddenly stop 
but minutes later bitterness set in 
ive had it here in britain i tell you i seem to have 
taken all the shame and the blame she said picking at her 
avocado and bacon salad and smoking cigarettes i owe this 
country nothing for one reason what have they ever done for me 
keeler was once a darling of high society watched over by ward 
and adored not only by profumo but by soviet navy capt eugene 
ivanov and two rival lovers johnnie edgecombe and aloysius 
lucky gordon 
now she lives in lowincome highrise housing she is 
desperate to move perhaps to australia 
she has one son by each of her yearlong marriages seymour 17 
a student and wouldbe actor and jimmy 23 a computer engineer 
who lives with keelers 65yearold mother in wokingham west of 
london 
keeler said she was glad about the movie scandal because it 
provided a platform for her book 
id never have gotten the book out if there hadnt been a film 
being made to me its an umbrella to be able to come out with the 
truth it protects me that film it has put me up the social 
ladder a couple of rungs 
she spoke admiringly of 25 yearold joanne whalleykilmer i 
couldnt take my eyes off joanne not because she was playing me 
ive heard other people say that but because shes so brilliant 
she was so good 
but keeler said she was just a bit disappointed by john 
hurts widely acclaimed performance as ward he was too 
goodlooking stephen was more pompous 
she rejected claims that ward was a scapegoat a victim of the 
establishment that resented his pretensions 
stephen shouldnt have died in such a terrible way he should 
have gone to prison for being a spy she said he was up to no 
good he was a very dangerous man 
and she dismissed sentimental notions of the swinging 1960s 
its rubbish my mother in the war world war ii had a ball 
my son seymour he has a ball it really makes me laugh the way 
people say the swinging 60s 
its still going on she said

chemicals derailed near the central rail station of this northern 
city and forced the evacuation of more than 1000 residents sunday 
no one was injured in the accident late saturday but 22 cars 
derailed including the tankers carrying propylene oxide and 
tolylene diisocyanate poisonous explosive chemicals used in making 
dyes and solvents 
police said the first attempt to lift three overturned tankers 
carrying the chemicals failed because the cars were crushed 
together like an accordion 
a larger crane was brought in and removed the three tankers late 
sunday police reported 
regional government director gerhard blume said there appeared 
to have been no leaks from the overturned tankers which are owned 
by the dow chemical co based in midland mich 
police said more than 1000 residents of the area were roused 
from their homes and evacuated to city hall early sunday because of 
the danger of explosions during the sensitive operation to right 
the overturned tankers 
juergen erdmann of the federal railroad office said the evacuees 
were told they could return home later in the day and the busy 
bremenhamburg line was reopened

the increasing numbers of couch potatoes 
enlisting in the army are getting injured so often that the brass 
has instructed drill sergeants to add some lowimpact exercise 
to basic training 
its our opinion that the young people coming into the 
military now have spent more time in front of the tv than on the 
tennis court or a softball field said lt col john anderson an 
army podiatrist who says he cant remember recruits being in worse 
condition in his 20year career 
a new army directive says the third week of boot camp when 
outofshape recruits apparently become particularly vulnerable 
will consist of lowimpact aerobics which are exercises that 
involve constant movement but not running and jumping 
the third week was standing out as the place where most of 
those avoidable injuries were showing up said richard dowling a 
spokesman for fort dix one of the armys eight basic training 
posts 
ill say that naturally everyone had sore muscles beginning 
with day 2 but the accumulation over two weeks and especially the 
accumulation into the third week would lead to relatively more 
serious injuries he said 
anderson stationed at fort dixs walson army hospital 
attributed the injuries to inactivity among the armys prime pool 
for recruits high school students 
they really are in poor condition he said nationally 
many school systems are not making physical education a mandatory 
course or its being dropped back to once a week that certainly 
has had an impact on the general condition of the incoming 
trainee 
only new jersey and illinois require four full years of high 
school gym class and new jersey gov thomas h kean has proposed 
eliminating the mandate 
besides fort dix the army posts affected by the directive are 
fort jackson sc fort leonard wood mo fort knox ky fort 
benning ga fort sill okla fort bliss texas and fort 
mcclelland ala 
the directive was issued by lt gen john crosby from fort 
monroe va 
col margarete dibenedetto a physician whose recommendations 
led to the directive said research shows stress fractures affected 
as many as 10 percent of the recruits at some posts although most 
posts showed fracture rates ranging between 2 and 4 percent 
no matter what study or which post in the third week and 
again in the fifth or sixth weeks two peaks there was an 
increase in stress fractures she said she added that even a 1 
percent sick call by recruits is too costly 
dibenedetto said research within the last year show that 
reducing running and jumping in the third week lessened associated 
injuries the studies also showed better physical conditioning and 
faster running times for a group whose workouts were reduced in the 
third week compared with a control group 
under the new policy male recruits in special cases may be 
required to run but no more than two miles with at least three 
days rest in between workouts female recruits are barred from any 
running in the third week instead recruits will perform aerobic 
exercises such as swimming or bicycling 
and should it be called boot camp anymore with new soldiers 
required to wear armyapproved running shoes when they run 
they used to years ago wear from the time they arrived until 
the time they left combat boots anderson said but running shoes 
have made some difference in the number of foot injuries the army 
is treating anderson said 
anderson said the drill sergeants were not soured by the 
reduction in pushing young recruits but dibenedetto said there was 
a backlash to her recommendation 
with the good old macho army concept there is a lot of 
opposition to this she said

when popes and presidents have something 
to say to polishamericans they reach for a map of detroit and put 
their finger on this 21squaremile community nestled in the heart 
of the motor city 
hamtramcks heartbeat lately has fallen somewhat out of synch 
with the polka but the vitality of a community built early this 
century by immigrants still pulses in its streets 
on monday a limousine will roll down joseph campau avenue 
passing the malsija bar restauracja pod orlem under the 
eagle kowalski sausage the john paul ii book store and an 
elevated 12foot bronze statue of the polish pope to take george 
bush to city hall 
there the president is scheduled to deliver a speech outlining 
steps to aid the economy of poland whose communist government has 
agreed to hold partly free elections and restore legal status to 
the independent trade union solidarity 
all 10000 free tickets to the speech were snapped up by sunday 
afternoon said paul odrobina president of both the city council 
and the michigan division of the polish american congress where 
the tickets were distributed 
never mind that democrat michael dukakis took hamtramck by a 
2to1 margin last november never mind that chicago and the 
outlying detroit suburbs of warren and sterling heights each have 
greater numbers of polishamericans 
bush will be only the latest to pay homage to the enclave of 
21000 which has welcomed franklin d roosevelt harry truman 
john f kennedy ronald reagan and in september 1987 john paul ii 
hamtramck is like a magnet said polandborn frank 
pawlowski 73 a resident who came to the united states in 1952 
it brings in dignitaries like no other city in the us 
its a great town when you live here said dave uchalik 34 
a hamtramck native and lead singer with the polish muslims which 
for seven years has crossbred polka and punkrock music in local 
clubs 
but people in all frankness are a little bit awed by it 
uchalik said of the citys latest celebrity visit surprisingly 
i guess we have a nationwide reputation 
i guess basically its the identification as a polish 
community said the rev stanley ulmon pastor of st ladislaus 
church one of three roman catholic parishes in hamtramck it 
still embodies a lot of the traditions that the immigrants brought 
over 
between 50 percent and 60 percent of hamtramcks residents are 
of polish extraction odrobina said but blacks ukrainians and 
yugoslavs also have made hamtramck their home for years followed 
more recently by pakistanis albanians arabs and others 
its an ethnic mix reminiscent of detroit at the height of its 
auto industrydriven might several decades ago and still alive in 
smaller scale 
its got a background and a history that wont get lost in a 
bigger setting ulmon said its a smaller part of the world 
small enough to make bushs visit big enough 
maybe another factor about hamtramck is its survival he 
said even while the city of detroit has slipped and fallen in 
hamtramck crime remains low theres a feeling of community 
but the average st ladislaus members age has risen to 65 
ulmon said 
there arent a lot of young people in hamtramck he said 
i think right now the issue is economic the people who can 
afford to move to the suburbs will do so 
but you have two types of groups coming up the new 
immigrants and a third generation of poles who are just discovering 
these traditions and roots the priest said theres a 
richness a color a feeling that people want to recapture 
its still alive pawlowski said after picking up four 
tickets for bushs speech its more alive than five years ago

ten years after the khmer rouges 
brutal reign in cambodia 1000 survivors of its labor camps and 
torture chambers are urging adoption of human rights treaties in 
their nation 
we are aware that the international community may go along 
with those who want to dump the khmer rouge back on to the 
cambodian people said kassie s neou who survived the koch ro 
teh execution center in battambang province 
fears of a khmer rouge return heightened after vietnam announced 
it will withdraw its 50000 troops from cambodia by sept 30 
vietnams 1978 invasion ended the communist groups nearly 
fouryear attempt to turn cambodia into a primitive communal 
agriculture society 
the survivors living in exile sent the appeal letter dated 
monday to hun sen premier of the vietnameseinstalled government 
in cambodia and to guerrilla leaders opposing him prince norodom 
sihanouk and son sann of the khmer peoples national liberation 
front 
the cambodian adversaries have engaged in unprecedented peace 
negotiations in the past year and sihanouk and hun sen are to meet 
again next month in indonesia 
no letter was sent to the khmer rouge the third partner in the 
guerrilla coalition and blamed in the death of more than 2 million 
of the 8 million population during their 197479 rule 
the appeal was spearheaded by dith pran a new york times 
photographer whose escape to thailand was depicted in the 1984 
movie the killing fields and haing s ngor the academy 
awardwinning actor who portrayed him 
fourteen years ago today cambodia entered the darkest period 
of our 2000year history said the letter we are not yet free 
from the memory the loss and the tragic chain of events that has 
befallen cambodia since april 17 1975 
on that day victorious over the usbacked lon nol government 
the khmer rouge entered the capital of phnom penh executed 
opponents and drove the citys residents including bedridden 
hospital patients to the countryside 
the letter asked the cambodian leaders to abide by the 
international convention on the prevention and punishment of the 
crime of genocide the international human rights convenants and 
other internationally approved declarations 
it asked all parties to facilitate human rights monitoring and 
education by cambodian and international agencies after the 
vietnamese withdraw 
our hopes for peace are tinged with fear because we do not 
believe the tiger has changed its stripes said the letter which 
noted that the khmer rouge recently forcibly relocated refugees in 
its camps in thailand 
there have been reports that the khmer rouge has hidden arms 
caches for an allout offensive after the vietnamese pullout 
the survivors urged the international community to bring the 
khmer rouge atrocities before the international court of justice at 
the hague 
the un general assembly in november added to its annual 
resolution on cambodia an unprecedented condemnation of the 
policies of the khmer rouge era the us congress also adopted an 
antikhmer rouge resolution signed into law in october

daniel webster would not have understood the 
jim wright affair 
when webster was in the senate 182850 a fellow lawmaker 
charged that he was bound hand and foot to wealthy backers who 
had come up with a fund to support his extravagant life style 
what asked rep william yancey of alabama was the 
massachusetts senator being paid for 
webster although he had accepted such a fund didnt bother to 
answer 
things have changed between the 1840s and the 1980s 
house speaker wright a texas democrat expected to be formally 
charged by the house ethics committee monday with several dozen 
rules violations including accepting free use of a condominium and 
car from a texas businessman has asked for a chance to answer as 
soon as possible 
webster gave no indication of being embarrassed when the 
matter of the fund came up in congress biographer irving h 
bartlett has written that the public might interpret such a 
transaction as evidence of the corruption of an elected 
representative of the people seems not to have occurred to him 
since websters day however members of congress periodically 
have been investigated for accepting financial or sexual favors and 
for other misdeeds 
four representatives and 15 senators have been expelled in the 
200year history of congress beginning in 1797 when sen william 
blount of tennessee was accused of conspiring with the british and 
the indian tribes to conquer west florida 
the most recent member to be expelled and the first in 126 
years was rep michael myers a pennsylvania democrat convicted in 
the abscam bribery scandal in 1980 
last year rep mario biaggi dny convicted in the wedtech 
scandal resigned after the house scheduled a vote on an ethics 
committee recommendation to expel him 
censure the stiffest punishment short of expulsion has been 
voted for seven senators including wisconsin republican joseph 
mccarthy in 1954 and sen thomas j dodd dconn in 1967 
mccarthy was censured for actions contrary to senatorial 
traditions in his investigations of alleged communism and dodd on 
financial grounds 
it is more than a slap on the wrist 
i think it must be hard for anyone who has not served in the 
senate of the united states to comprehend how devastating censure 
can be to a senator sen robert c byrd dwva the former 
senate majority leader has said censure does not remove a 
members right to vote or speak or serve on committees but in as 
collegial a body as this censure is an awesome punishment and 
from all accounts senator mccarthy suffered mightily as a result 
twentythree members have been censured by the house most 
recently reps daniel b crane rill and gerry e studds 
dmass in 1983 for sexual misconduct with congressional pages 
crane was defeated for reelection the next year but studds is 
still in congress 
the mildest form of punishment a reprimand was instituted in 
1975 and has been meted out to a half dozen members of the house 
the most recent was rep austin murphy a fiveterm pennyslvania 
democrat rebuked in 1987 for having someone else cast votes for 
him on the house floor murphy was reelected last year 
rep george v hansen ridaho was reprimanded in 1984 after 
being convicted by a federal court jury of filing false financial 
disclosure forms he was defeated for reelection after his 
conviction but before going to prison where he served just over a 
year 
one of the most sensational cases in recent years involved rep 
wayne l hays dohio who admitted a personal relationship 
with staff member elizabeth ray but denied hiring her to be his 
mistress hays resigned in 1976 after the ethics panel voted to 
hold public hearings on his case 
although the house ethics committee was formed in 1969 it did 
not conduct a formal investigation until 1976 when it reprimanded 
rep robert sikes of florida for a conflict of interest 
even before the committee and its procedures however the house 
was disciplining its members 
one of the first big scandals came in the 1870s when rep 
oakes ames of massachusetts was censured for accepting shares of 
stock at bargain prices from credit mobilier a construction 
company seeking to obtain favors and block an investigation of its 
corrupt practices

the end of the homer spit normally stacked 
high with crab pots and crowded with fishing boats has become a 
bustling yard where floating booms are built to stand guard against 
a massive oil slick 
what started as a fourman volunteer crew monday has turned into 
an operation employing nearly 100 people turning out four or five 
miles of log barriers daily in hopes of keeping away the remnants 
of the nations worst oil spill 
ive been working construction crews for 20 years and this is 
the hardestworking one ive ever seen said ed schofield as he 
strode through the chaotic log yard saturday theyre not doing 
it for the money theyre working from the heart 
hammers clattered and chain saws made a guttural drone as oil 
from the tanker exxon valdez edged closer to kachemak bay a busy 
fishing port on the southern end of the kenai peninsula 
the bays icy blue water wraps around glaciertopped mountains 
cut by ginclear streams its coves and harbors are home to salmon 
halibut clams crab and an abundance of marine mammals and birds 
the thought of losing it all to the oil blackening the southern 
alaska coast prompted schofield and three friends to begin 
scrounging materials for makeshift booms 
we wanted to protect our bay he said nobody else would 
do it if we didnt do something wed be buying our clams from 
someplace in the lower 48 
by tuesday 20 volunteers had shown up forty were on hand 
wednesday when exxon gave the project its blessing and the work 
force swelled steadily through the week with the oil company paying 
wages starting at 1669 an hour 
the boom building was halted temporarily sunday strong wind and 
high seas prevented boats from picking up the completed logs 
creating a backup in the yard ray springer local boss for a 
subcontractor working for exxon said work would resume monday 
the floating booms are makeshift but effective barriers 
one side of a 30foot sitka spruce log is shaved and plastic 
sheeting is nailed down beneath a twobyfour links of chain or 
cable are inserted as ballast in a sleeve at the bottom of the 
plastic so the curtain will hang vertically in the water to keep 
oil from seeping under the logs 
cable is threated through holes bored in the ends of the logs to 
tie the sections of boom together 
while a southerly wind threatens to bring the oil slick closer 
15hour days apparently arent tiring the eager crew all from the 
homer area 
its no good to ask them because theyll tell you theyre not 
tired schofield said the energy here is just unbelievable 
as his crew grew and the pace quickened schofield sought help 
feeding everyone at the site and his plea on the local public radio 
station drew a quick response 
about an hour later i had stew hot chili soup cases of 
apples everything he said the people here see an opportunity 
to do something about the spill 
material is another story the logs from the anchor point area 
of the kenai peninsula probably will last another week but 
halfinch chain and cable clamps are dwindling fast and no more are 
to be found in alaska he said 
with exxon expediting orders some shipments have started 
arriving from the lower 48 schofield said 
despite the enthusisasm with which everyone was attacking the 
job one worker called the scene sad and wondered aloud if it 
was accomplishing much 
it looks like a big effort but a lot of us feel were just 
wasting our time said the worker who asked to remain 
unidentified in the face of an oil industry threat to fire any 
employee who talks to reporters without prior written approval 
i just kind of hope its a worthwhile effort he said 
schofield said no one told him he couldnt talk to reporters 
it wouldnt do any good if they did he muttered were just 
not going to let anybody stop us

the federal government is dipping into 
research money and other accounts for millions of dollars to buy 
azt for needy aids patients because congress reauthorized the free 
drug program without appropriating money to pay for it 
the program was to expire last september but was extended 
without an appropriation congressional leaders subsequently made 
clear they expected health and human services officials to tap 
other aids accounts as necessary to find the money 
although the program is authorized at 15 million for the 
current fiscal year the company that makes the drug burroughs 
wellcome is picking up 5 million of the cost by making that much 
of the drug available free 
the remaining 10 million had to be found elsewhere in the hhs 
budget 
because the national institutes of health receives almost half 
of hhss total aids budget about 607 million of the 13 billion 
budget the largest share of the amount shifted to azt purchases 
is coming from nih research funds 
the nih contribution in all is 74 million with about 6 
million of that coming from research funds 
based on the average nih research grant level of 162000 the 
cut would mean 37 projects would not get federal backing that 
otherwise would if the money had not been diverted 
the agencies required to shift funds are overseen by a panel of 
the senate appropriations committee which directed the action 
the centers for disease control was hit for about 3 million 
other hhs agencies tapped include the alcohol drug abuse and 
mental health administration the office of the assistant secretary 
of health and the health resources and services administration 
azt is the only drug approved for treatment of aids which costs 
about 8000 per year per patient 
about 7000 of the estimated 30000 aids patients taking azt are 
receiving the drug through the federal program which is partially 
financed by the states

the house decides this week whether to accept 
or reject a federal commissions recommendations to shut down 86 
military installations and partly close five more 
a vote on a resolution to disapprove the report of the 
commission on base realignment and closure is scheduled for 
tuesday and the full house is expected to follow the lead of its 
armed services committee the panel voted 434 last month to 
support the commissions report 
savings from the plan which also includes substantial changes 
at 54 other facilities were estimated at 694 million a year 
initially and 56 billion over 20 years 
the senate meanwhile takes up president bushs 90 billion 
plan to bail out and reform the savings and loan industry with 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine promising to 
resolve the issue by weeks end 
the federal sampl insurance fund is now more than 25 billion in 
debt because of bad loans and in some cases fraudulent lending 
and accounting practices using governmentinsured deposits 
in house debate last week over base closings representatives 
from new jersey illinois and california pleaded with their 
colleagues to pass the disapproval resolution claiming the 
commissions report was tragically flawed 
rep jim courter rnj who is opposed to the recommendation 
to close new jerseys fort dix said the data used by the panel was 
based on incorrect information and clerical error 
rep ed madigan rill said no member of the commission 
visited chanute air force base in his state and charged that 
closing the facility will not achieve the alleged cost savings 
but according to law the commissions recommendations must be 
accepted in their entirety if the resolution of disapproval fails 
the plan will go into effect next month with base closings to 
begin in 1990 
rep pat schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed 
services committee said i hear the pain of many members whose 
bases will be closed in their districts but reminded her 
colleagues that the house voted for legislation creating the 
commission 
the senate is continuing to hold hearings on the issue 
the sampl bailout plan is gaining momentum in congress after 
surviving its biggest challenge as democrats agreed last week to 
bushs financing plan which is designed to keep the 50 billion 
taxpayer cost from showing up in the federal deficit 
while the senate considers the bill the house banking committee 
also takes up the measure tougher capital and regulatory 
requirements that bush backed but were lost in subcommittee action 
may be reinstated 
by the time its all over he bush may get 90 to 95 percent 
of what he wants said rep charles schumer dny a 
subcommittee member

the soviets lifted the veil sunday on the worst 
disaster of their space program with a magazine article that blamed 
a 1960 launchpad explosion on the race to catch up with the 
americans 
the weekly ogonyok said program workers flouted safety rules in 
their haste to develop the first soviet intercontinental ballistic 
missile the r16 
the magazines article came as the soviet union was reeling from 
setbacks in its space program and some citizens were calling for 
cutbacks in research funds 
the tass news agency said saturday that soviet scientists have 
abandoned efforts to reestablish contact with an unmanned probe 
sent to mars meaning they have lost touch with both phobos 
spacecraft launched at a cost of 480 million 
it said the decision to discontinue attempts to reach phobos2 
was taken by a commission investigating why contact was originally 
lost march 27 contact with the other mars probe phobos1 was 
lost in september because an erroneous command was beamed to the 
spacecraft from earth 
sundays ogonyok article said the 1960 accident incinerated 
victims on the launchpad including the director of its rocket 
program 
chief artillery marshal mitrofan i nedelin a world war ii 
veteran serving as the first commander of the newly created soviet 
rocket forces was about 60 feet from the missile when it exploded 
the article said 
the magazine said a significant number of people died in the 
explosion and fireball at the secret launch pad at turatam near 
the aral sea it said practically nothing was left only some 
metal change keys etc 
thenpremier nikita s khrushchev said in memoirs published in 
the west that dozens of soldiers and workers perished 
a stream of fire burst out of the rocket inundating 
everything around it the article said people tried to escape 
by running to the covered area where cars and other equipment were 
but the road literally melted in front of them blocking the escape 
route a survivor recalled according to ogonyok 
james e oberg a us space consultant knowledgeable about the 
soviet space program has written that a million pounds of 
kerosene and liquid oxygen flared up in a pyre which must have been 
visible for hundreds of miles 
in terms of human lives lost it was probably the greatest 
disaster of the space age he said 
accounts of the disaster on oct 24 1960 have circulated 
abroad but ogonyoks report was the first in official soviet media 
it differed from obergs description in his 1988 book 
uncovering soviet disasters exploring the limits of glasnost 
by saying nedelin and his men died while preparing for the maiden 
flight of the soviets first intercontinental ballistic missile 
oberg said they were preparing to launch an unmanned probe of 
mars 
ogonyok said launch of the r16 had been scheduled for oct 23 
but was postponed because of an electrical defect in the engine it 
said the problem was causing a fuel leak 
hatches were removed and welding work undertaken on the fully 
fueled rocket ogonyok said it called the move one of the 
gravest violations of safety precautions 
late the next day the r16s launch was scheduled in 30 
minutes the magazine said but workers were still installing an 
electrical distributor which somehow gave a command to ignite the 
rockets second stage the magazine said 
the flames from the ignition burned through the fuel tanks of 
the first stage touching off the fire and explosion the article 
said 
failures and deaths in the soviet space program were once a 
taboo subject in the soviet press the magazine said it is now 
possible to report the circumstances of the accident because of the 
greater openness permitted under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
glasnost campaign 
tass says the soviet space program which has concentrated on 
the mir space station and unmanned planetary probes costed about 
2 billion in 1988

corsiersurvevey switzerland ap festooned streets 
overflowed with people wearing bowler hats and baggy trousers as 
thousands joined to commemorate the 100th birthday of charlie 
chaplin who died in 1977 
the english comedian spent the last 25 years of his life in 
corsier and was the most famous resident of this wineproducing 
village overlooking lake geneva 
his films leave us a poignant message of justice and 
equality said swiss president jeanpascal delamuraz who spoke at 
a ceremony dedicating a park to chaplin at nearby vevey 
also attending the ceremony was british ambassador christopher 
long who praised chaplin as a unique and extraordinary 
phenomenon 
the solemn tributes were of little interest to the costumed 
children assembled in the park they were entertained by david lee 
parsons an american impersonator of chaplin who has performed as 
the little tramp in many countries 
the chaplin family was represented by the comedians son 
michael michaels wife and two of their children 
chaplins wife lady oona remained home at the manoir de ban 
the 18th century manor that chaplin bought in 1953 a spokesman for 
the organizers of the centennial celebration jeancharles kollros 
said mrs chaplin was not feeling well enough to attend 
thousands of people watched the hourlong procession from vevey 
to corsier despite a continuous rain that didnt dampen the spirits 
of children in the parade their costumes covered by plastic 
raincoats 
other events of the day included showings of chaplins films 
concerts featuring music he composed and an exhibition of documents

cocaine abusers especially those who use the 
drugs purer crack form are more likely than others to suffer 
strokes or cerebral hemorrhages researchers said sunday 
dr patti peterson chief of neurology at detroit receiving 
hospital said a threeyear study found that 3 percent of cocaine 
abusers admitted to the hospital suffered strokes or hemorrhages 
the rupture or clogging of a blood vessel in the brain 
most of the abusers were young adults with an average age of 
35 she said 
i dont think the coke abusers know what theyre getting 
into ms peterson said three out of a hundred i dont like 
those odds 
she said the abusers had a much higher rate of strokes than 
others theres no way that 3 percent of the 35yearolds who are 
admitted to the hospital have strokes she said 
the rate of stroke in the general population of similar age is 
about 005 percent she said 
ms peterson and dr patricia moore a neurologist at the 
hospital presented their conclusions at the annual meeting of the 
american academy of neurology 
from july 1985 to june 1988 they studied 979 cocaine abusers 
admitted to the hospital for various reasons of those patients 33 
suffered strokes or cerebral hemorrhages six of those 33 patients 
died and only 17 recovered well enough to be sent home the others 
remain in longterm care ms peterson said 
cocaine increases a patients blood pressure which ms peterson 
said probably causes the strokes and with the arrival of the 
stronger crack form of cocaine the problem has gotten worse 
crack is a purer compound and gets into the bloodstream in 
much higher quantities much faster she said 
i think were going to see a heck of a lot more of this and 
its something we need to look at she said most people dont 
think cocaine when they see people coming in with a stroke

students put up posters at universities sunday 
demanding that communist officials clear the name of hu yaobang a 
reformer who died two years after he was ejected as party chief 
it was the first largescale expression of campus discontent 
with the government since the winter of 198687 when students 
marched for democracy in protests that led to hus expulsion 
the 73yearold hu died saturday he had suffered a heart attack 
a week earlier during a meeting of the politburo the ruling body 
that forced him out as party general secretary two years before he 
remained a politburo member 
hu resigned after charges he failed to put down the nationwide 
student marches hu was also accused of promoting dangerously high 
growth rates through marketoriented reforms and pushing too hard 
for westernization 
dozens of posters went up saturday and sunday at beijing 
university the countrys leading institution and at qinghua and 
the peoples universities students also placed several wreaths at 
a monument to chinas revolutionary martyrs in central beijings 
tiananmen square 
the posters praised hu obliquely criticized his opponents and 
called for his remains to lie in the mausoleum of legendary leader 
and revolutionary hero mao tsetung 
sincere men have died while hypocrites live on declared one 
poster without naming any official is there any hope left for 
our country 
several students at beijing university and the peoples 
university said the aim of praising hu was actually to criticize 
those who helped expel him including conservative party elders and 
even senior leader deng xiaoping deng originally promoted hu to 
party chief but reportedly felt irritated afterward by hus 
outspokenness 
at beijing university security guards checked identification 
papers of everyone entering campus and turned away students from 
other schools in an apparent effort to prevent protests however 
authorities left the posters up 
officials are especially intent on maintaining calm on campuses 
in the weeks leading up to may 4 the anniversary of the day in 
1919 when beijing universitys students began a campaign for 
democratic reform in china 
the campaign which became known as the may fourth movement was 
a training ground for an entire generation of intellectuals 
including many famous writers politicians and marxist 
revolutionaries 
beijing university students who gathered sunday to mourn hu 
complained that china had made little progress toward reform since 
1919 
there is still no individual freedom said one student 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
however some students looked tense when asked if they would 
again take to the streets to demand democracy maybe we can gain 
democracy without marches one said 
hundreds crowded around the posted sheets of pink blue and 
white paper covered with huge black characters demanding hus 
rehabilitation 
one poster signed by 18 people called for a public 
clarification of hus forced resignation a popular reevaluation 
of his historical achievements permission for activities to 
mourn him and placement of his remains in maos mausoleum 
many other students later added their signatures to show support 
another poster urged students to turn their grief to strength 
and carry out democratization to the end 
a university lecturer watched the students and said on condition 
of anonymity this is good it reflects what is in peoples 
hearts

the tass news agency said sunday that guerrillas 
in afghanistan shot civilians including children fleeing the 
besieged city of jalalabad 
there was no independent confirmation of the report 
tass quoting people it said were witnesses said victims were 
in a convoy of refugees from the city it said the number of dead 
and date of the alleged massacre were unknown 
tass the official soviet news agency called the purported 
attack a crime by opponents of afghanistans communist government 
akin to those perpetrated by the american military in vietnam 
against the peaceful vietnamese population 
tass said the convoy was carrying dozens of elderly people 
women and children from jalalabad toward kabul when the buses and 
trucks were stopped by guerrillas the anticommunist rebels 
reportedly lined up the drivers shot them then set fire to the 
vehicles tass said 
little children were seized and lifted by the hair they were 
shot and thrown into the kabul river tass said pretty women 
were led into the mountains the rest were killed on the spot

the federal aviation administrations system of 
tracking malfunctions on commercial airliners is inconsistent and 
rarely accomplishes its goal of predicting and preventing 
accidents a newspaper reported sunday 
the report in the seattle times included analysis of more than 
24000 service difficulty reports filed by us passenger and 
freight air carriers operating large jetliners during the past two 
years 
the newspaper found drastic inconsistencies in the reporting of 
aircraft malfunctions and defects by the 17 largest passenger 
airlines under an faa program the programs purpose is to 
promote aviation safety through analysis and detection of 
mechanical reliability problems 
a service difficulty report is a onepage document the faa 
requires airlines to file whenever an aircraft experiences 
problems ranging from cracks found during inspections to engine 
shutdowns during flight 
the faa acknowledges problems with the sdr program and is 
gearing up to overhaul it later this year 
youre into a part of our data that before you even started 
analyzing it somebody like me wouldve told you dont spend a 
lot of time with it because its incomplete inconsistent from 
airline to airline we have nonuniform reporting we need to 
review the items that are required to be reported we have 
timeliness problems and on and on and on said anthony 
broderick the faas associate administrator for regulation and 
certification 
the faa does not consider the service report system a critical 
safety data base broderick said but aviation experts say sdrs 
can and should be an integral part of a warning system for 
detecting and fixing airplane defects 
industry observers also say if the program were not so 
haphazard it might have prevented a corroded chunk of an aloha 737 
fuselage from ripping away in flight a year ago or an apparently 
mislatched cargo door from tearing a hole in the side of a united 
747 two months ago one person died in the aloha airlines mishap 
and nine died in the united accident 
there was information held by certain people within the 
industry that could have prevented both of those accidents if the 
information had been acted on properly beforehand instead of 
afterward said john obrien engineering and safety director for 
the air line pilots association 
lawmakers passengers and industry experts including the air 
line pilots association have been questioning the reliability of 
the system that is supposed to make us air travel safe 
the way it stands now theres absolutely no uniform 
enforcement of criteria used to monitor these airplanes said dan 
labriola a seattle pilot aeronautical engineer and aviation 
consultant 
one example of the lack of uniformity is that of the more than 
24000 reports checked by the newspaper nearly 1700 failed to 
include the name of the airline submitting the report 
in addition dozens of reports omitted vital information such 
as what caused a malfunction or what the airline did to fix a 
defect 
the times also reported that airlines have a great deal of 
discretion in deciding when to file sdrs atlantabased delta 
airlines for example filed an average of 16 reports for each of 
its 372 jets over the past two years and st paulbased northwest 
airlines with 314 jets and comparable operations filed 96 
reports per jet in the same period 
we do know that some airlines are more generous than others in 
submitting things to us said faa spokeswoman bobbie mardis we 
do know that there are discrepancies 
the air line pilots association would like to see a 
comprehensive sdr system put in place with consistent detailed 
reporting by the airlines made mandatory obrien said

the steamer portland which disappeared in a storm 
91 years ago with as many as 200 passengers aboard has been found 
on the bottom of the atlantic off the massachusetts coast an 
oceanographer said sunday 
theres no doubt weve got it said john fish of the 
historical maritime group of new england who worked with arnold 
carr and william mcelroy for 13 years to solve the mystery of the 
portland 
the old sidewheelers hull was discovered wednesday in 300 feet 
of water east of boston fish said refusing to be more specific 
about the location 
the find is particularly significant not only because the 
portland was one of the worst maritime disasters in the northeast 
but because it remained shrouded in mystery said paul johnston 
of the smithsonian institution 
indications were that the hull was cut lengthwise when it went 
down in 1898 we expected something weatherbeaten fish said 
we found something that appeared to have exploded 
the group will not salvage the wreck fish said were 
considering it to be a memorial and we feel its a grave where 
between 150 and 200 people lost their lives he said there were 
no survivors 
the ship left boston at 7 pm on the saturday after 
thanksgiving 1898 bound for portland maine the storm hit about 
three hours later 
by the time it ended a total of 141 vessels and 456 lives had 
been lost because of the missing sidewheeler it came to be 
called the portland storm bodies and flotsam from the ship washed 
ashore on cape cod 
the shiphunters narrowed the search area by running the dates 
times and places where debris from the portland washed ashore 
through a computer program to trace it to its origin the flotsam 
included three victims watches that stopped at 9 pm fish said 
the scientists then used sonar to find the wreck 
the group wants to learn why the ship went down and plans to 
continue surveying the wreck with television cameras and 
remotecontrol devices this spring and summer

housing secretary jack kemp said sunday his 
department will make illegal drug use or sales a specific violation 
of public housing leases as a way to ease the eviction process for 
local authorities 
kemp announced the step as he released a report describing 
actions public housing authorities around the country are already 
taking to solve drugrelated problems 
in a prepared statement the secretary of housing and urban 
development said hud would inform local housing authorities of ways 
they can use already appropriated federal funds to make physical 
and management improvements aimed at improving security against 
drug crimes 
he said hud would publish a notice informing local housing 
authorities that leases must include explicit provisions that allow 
termination of the lease if any member of a household or person 
under the tenants control engages in drugrelated criminal 
activity 
although evictions that are instigated because of drugrelated 
activity are already possible the process is often cumbersome 
because there is no direct provision in a lease relating to drug 
violations inclusion of such a clause would simplify and shorten 
the process in much the same way it is easier to evict a tenant 
for failure to meet specific rent obligations spelled out in a 
lease than it is to evict an undesirable tenant on some more vague 
ground such as making too much noise 
the hud statement did not say whether a person had to be 
convicted of drugrelated criminal activity before being evicted 
hud said public housing authorities in reports to the federal 
agency generally said that when tenants are caught with drugs they 
are evicted but the housing authorities did not clarify whether a 
conviction was required before eviction 
in february kemp asked the managers of the some 3000 public 
housing authorities which run federally subsidized public housing 
projects to report to him on how they are fighting drugs in the 
projects 
hud said it had received responses from more than 1000 housing 
agencies so far it said drugrelated problems were reported by 70 
percent of the medium and large public housing authorities 
managing 500 or more units responding 
one third of the small housing agencies reported drug problems 
the responses i have received make it clear that lawabiding 
residents in public housing want to be freed from the plague of 
drug dealers and drug abusers and the criminal activities they 
create and spread he said 
kemp last week proposed a series of steps for fighting drugs in 
washington dc public housing projects and said he would 
recommend them as well to all public housing agencies around the 
nation 
he suggested authorities put fences around projects establish 
guarded entrances require photo identification cards of residents 
and take other steps to increase security 
he also said he would waive hud requirements for hearings in 
eviction cases provided state laws accord tenants due process in 
the courts dropping the hud hearings was welcomed by some housing 
authorities but others said it would do little to speed up 
evictions for drugrelated crimes 
kemp said he would inform housing authorities that existing hud 
subsidies through its comprehensive improvement assistance program 
may be used for drugrelated security such as lighting and other 
means of securing areas the money can also be used to improve 
screening of prospective tenants hiring staff to run drug 
programs and organization of neighborhood watch patrols the 
department said

concentration of territorial police and soldiers in those areas 
un spokesman fred eckhard said sunday that any swapo 
guerrillas captured by the territorial security forces should be 
turned over immediately to un forces in namibia to oversee the 
transition to independence

guerrillas captured by the security forces 
he said that since april 1 278 guerrillas and 27 members of the 
security forces have been killed

guerrilla was killed in a clash with territorial soldiers southeast 
of swartbooisdrift the second was tracked and killed by police 
near okandjera he said 
he said the government forces suffered no casualties 
there was no independent confirmation of rouxs reports

on the first anniversary of the slaying of a plo military chief 
in jerusalem leaders of prime minister yitzhak shamirs

despite army curfews in the occupied territories ordering 
700000 palestinians to remain in their homes more than a dozen 
protests were reported sunday over the death of khalil wazir in

site of violence assailants believed to be palestinians set a gas 
balloon ablaze at a pub entrance and painted graffiti calling on 
arabs to avenge wazirs death israel television said 
tenyearold mohammed suleiman rabai was killed in the west bank 
village of sumou when soldiers opened fire during a stonethrowing

to negotiate with israel on a fiveyear period of autonomy talks 
would be held in the third year on the final status of the 
territories occupied by israel since the 1967 middle east war 
several likud ministers reportedly expressed fears that the plan 
would lead to the election of plo supporters and to indirect 
negotiations with the plo through the united states 
but finance minister shimon peres head of the centerleft labor 
party voiced strong support for elections and said palestinians 
must be allowed some form of political activity defense minister 
yitzhak rabin also of labor told reporters he thought the

libyas official jana news agency in a dispatch monitored in 
rome said libya has reaffirmed repeatedly its condemnation of 
terrorism in general and the disaster suffered by the pan am jumbo

twisting of facts conducted by zionist and imperialist circles 
hostile to great jamahiriya libya

participated in the alleged meeting was the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command the group headed by ahmed 
jibril has been a prime suspect in the bombing 
flight 103 exploded over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing 
270 people 
the sunday telegraph said us intelligence officers monitored 
the meeting early last year in libya and the participants discussed 
the coordination of operations against us targets

for the bombing which was planned and carried out by the 
palestinian group

people here are fed up with a fire thats 
been smoldering in a pile of sawdust bigger than a football field 
after all it hasnt stopped for two years 
state fire investigator jim wallace said the state may have to 
go to court to get the owner of the pile desert mountain forest 
products to put out the blaze 
you can negotiate and be a nice guy only so long wallace 
said recentlyif it takes swearing out a warrant we will 
when the wind blows the hidden fire spouts sparks and smoke 
like a volcano neighbors say 
desert mountain which makes posts and sticks for california 
vineyards has accumulated a pile 100 yards long 30 to 50 yards 
wide and two stories high in places the company lies just south of 
glacier national park 
wallace said he suspects spontaneous combustion as the cause of 
the fire but the companys owners blame lightning 
a similar blaze at a nearby mill wasnt extinguished until the 
sawdust pile was bulldozed and clumps of burning material were 
blasted apart with fire hoses wallace said

a suspicious fire gutted a 104yearold building 
that housed several art galleries destroying works valued at up to 
50 million authorities said 
the spectacular blaze saturday left the sixstory blocksquare 
building in ruins with only a few walls standing 
oh my god cried roberta lieberman partowner of one of the 
eight galleries consumed in the blaze when she saw the 
destruction its devastating 
william van straaten whose van straaten gallery was among those 
destroyed estimated the combined loss at 50 million 
battalion chief harold corrigan said the blaze began in four 
sections of the building leading fire officials to suspect arson 
flames were seen coming from opposite sides of the structure and 
construction workers who fled the building reported fire on the 
upper stories and in the basement 
fire department spokesman tom sheppard blamed the severity of 
the blaze on contractors who disconnected systems designed to bring 
firefighting water into the building he noted that firefighters 
were called to the building on thursday for a fire that took an 
hour to put out 
this wouldnt have happened if they hadnt cut corners he 
said its so foolish now they have nothing 
a sprinkler system in the building did not work and fire doors 
were open in the building which was being rehabilitated by the 
owners mesirow realty management inc into a mixture of 
residential lofts galleries and shops officials said 
gerald levin president of the real estate division of mesirow 
said saturday the contractor had done good work on the building 
my understanding was that there were hookups for water in 
the building levin said our design has been at every stage 
approved and inspected by the fire department 
the fire occurred one day after a cook county circuit judge 
refused van straatens request to halt construction in the building 
because of an alleged fire hazard 
circuit judge david shields said he issued an order prohibiting 
work around van straatens gallery but allowing work in the rest of 
the building 
the fact that there were incidents in the past didnt lead me 
to conclude that there were going to be incidents in the future 
shields said 
the fire couldnt have come at a worse time for those 
dealers said leslie hindman owner of a gallery four blocks from 
the building 
she said dealers were preparing for art expo an annual spring 
event at chicagos navy pierfor a lot of galleries that is 
tantamount to the christmas shopping season ms hindman said 
its one of the most important art fairs in the world and most 
of those dealers do a good part of their business during the show 
the building erected in 1885 became the linchpin of the 
burgeoning art scene in the citys river north area in recent years 
the eight galleries dealt mostly with modern american artists 
and buyers from around the world came to buy works officials said

more than half of the members of irans 
parliament on sunday called for amendments to the islamic 
republics constitution to correct major flaws tehran radio 
reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia reported that 166 members 
of the 270seat majlis or parliament said in a letter to 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini that articles concerning the future 
leadership of the country and the powers of the executive branch 
must be changed 
the move came as revolutionary hardliners led by interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi appeared to tighten their control of 
irans leadership 
it is believed the letter reflects an effort by hashemi 
rafsanjani the speaker of parliament to counter the hardliners by 
strengthening the power of the presidency 
the letter urged khomeini irans 88yearold spiritual leader 
to create a commission to redraft the constitution proposed 
amendments would be put before the nation in a referendum the 
letter said 
rafsanjani once considered the most powerful figure in iran 
after khomeini wants to eliminate the post of prime minister now 
held by hardliner hussein musavi and give the presidency more 
executive powers 
he has said he will run for the presidency in elections expected 
in august when the second fouryear term of president ali khamenei 
expires the constitution bans khamenei from running for a third 
term 
one indication that the hardliners are threatening rafsanjanis 
power came last month when khomeini appointed hojatoleslam abdallah 
nouri as his personal representative within the revolutionary 
guards 
khomeini named rafsanjani acting commanderinchief of the 
military forces last june but nouri will outrank all commanders 
also last month khomeinis designated successor ayatollah 
husseinali montazeri was dismissed and two key figures in the 
foreign ministry resigned during the furor caused by salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verses 
khomeini said the novel blasphemed islam and called on moslems 
to kill rushdie the action led to a diplomatic confrontation with 
the west and disputes among iranian officials 
montazeri had questioned the achievements of the islamic 
revolution since it toppled the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 
1979 and had called for more freedom and a halt to the executions 
of dissidents

a winery worker accused of brutally 
murdering seven people including his wife and two daughters was 
depicted by those who knew him as a simple smiling man who adored 
his wife too much 
he never caused any problems for anybody said warren 
brunhagen a regular at mcneillys bar in boyes hot springs where 
winery worker ramon salcido 28 was a regular customer 
authorities on sunday continued the nationwide hunt for salcido 
that began friday when authorities discovered the bodies of his 
24yearold wife angela at their boyes hot springs home his 
motherinlaw and her two young daughters at their home in cotati 
and a coworker at the grand cru winery 
salcidos three daughters were found with their throats cut 
saturday at a dump between petaluma and sonoma one lived and was 
recovering at petaluma valley hospital on sunday 
salcido a mexican native behaved well and smiled often but 
was overly possessive of his wife said john mcneilly owner of 
the tavern about 15 miles from where salcido worked 
what i saw was not jealousy he recalled he always had 
his hands on her and hed never leave her by herself 
richard clark salcidos nextdoor neighbor and friend has said 
salcido was intensely jealous and often drove home several times a 
day to spy on her 
clark said he once heard mrs salcido an aspiring model cry 
out living with you is like living in jail you wont let me go 
out 
the couple recently began arguing loudly clark said 
i could hear them yelling i guess i knew the murders 
were coming he said i heard him say im going to blow your 
head off 
mrs salcidos modeling career was just beginning to take off 
clark said 
salcido was really jealous the neighbor said anybody who 
was higher up than him or if he had a nicer car than he did he 
didnt like that he wanted to be no 1 
salcido also was upset recently because he was served papers 
ordering him to pay nearly 6000 dollars in overdue child support 
and make monthly payments of 511 for a 4yearold daughter in 
fresno clark said 
in addition salcido was having increasing problems at the grand 
cru winery where he often failed to show up for his job as a 
forklift operator and would call in sick when he wasnt 
salcidos inlaws bent over backwards for this guy clark 
said they gave him money for his apartment and still he didnt 
like them he didnt appreciate nothing 
meanwhile many residents of this picturesque region tried to 
cope with the mass slayings by treating it as an isolated incident 
in santa rosa the areas biggest city with a population of 
about 103000 residents were alarmed by the killings and followed 
news reports closely but few said they felt vulnerable enough to 
change plans or take unusual safety precautions while salcido was 
still at large 
people arent going to go in their houses and hide because of 
it said martin coletti 33 it heightens your sensitivity to 
violent crime the worst crime and maybe santa rosa is becoming 
more vulnerable to that 
several downtown merchants reported normal business friday and 
saturday night strollers frequently pointed out that salcidos 
rage appeared to have been aimed only at family members and 
acquaintances 
it seems like its a family situation said gary lee 49 
i dont think hes out to hurt normal people 
still sonoma county sheriffs deputy dan ramseier said worried 
residents were calling at the rate of two or three an hour 
you name it theyre worried about it theyre worried about 
everything he said to reassure callers ramseier said he urged 
residents to avoid strangers report suspicious vehicles in the 
neighborhood and keep a close eye on children

lawmakers sunday demanded changes in 
stadium designs including a ban on antiriot fences after a mad 
rush at a soccer match trapped thousands of fans behind one of the 
steel barriers at least 94 people died 
prime minister margaret thatcher visited hillsborough stadium 
and promised a public inquiry into saturdays disaster which 
turned a soccer cup semifinal between liverpool and nottingham 
forest into a nightmare 
the investigation was expected to focus on why so many fans were 
still outside as the match began and on allegations that many 
entered the soldout stadium which has a capacity of 54000 
without tickets or with forged tickets 
in liverpool the roman catholic cathedral was filled to 
overflowing for a requiem mass for the victims most of them from 
the northwest port city the anglican cathedrals bell tolled 94 
times to mark the deaths 
survivors broke down in tears as they described watching 
children die and people hit each other in the frenzied fight to 
survive britains worst sports disaster 
steve ellis a photographer said he could hear and see children 
screaming as they were pressed into the fence 
more were coming in from the back pushing forward i can 
still see the young lads behind the fence shouting save me ill 
never forget it until the day i die he said 
seventeenyearold wayne adams said he was about five rows from 
the front of the crowd i realized it was serious when i saw one 
of the lasses standing near me just turn blue in the face she went 
down she was dead that was it he said 
police defended the decision to open 16footwide steel gates 
outside the stadium just as the match began lastminute arrivals 
then poured into a central standingroomonly section pressing 
those already inside against the steel mesh fence 
the sturdy 10foothigh fence angled in at the top to stop 
people from scaling it prevented them from escaping over the top 
to the field some were crushed to death others suffocated or were 
trampled trying to fight their way out of the crowd or when the 
barrier finally collapsed 
south yorkshires chief constable peter wright said a senior 
officer decided to open the gates to save peoples lives and to 
relieve the crush outside 
survivor stephen dooling 34 defended the action the police 
had to open the door because the lads at the front were screaming 
they would have died there at the turnstiles instead of in the 
ground dooling said from his hospital bed 
outside the stadium people lay flowers and team scarves in 
memory of the dead 
many victims were teenagers and children because the cheap 
standingroomonly section is favored by young fans 
pratt said 170 people were injured seventyone people were 
hospitalized many in extremely critical condition 
it was the third major soccer tragedy in four years involving 
english teams which have been barred from european soccer 
competition since a may 1985 rampage by liverpool fans at heysel 
stadium in brussels that killed 39 people 
eighteen days earlier 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at 
bradford stadium in england 
lawmakers sports officials and survivors demanded changes in 
stadium designs and elimination of antiriot fences and 
standingroom sections known as terraces 
in the terraces fans pay about 680 and stand on bare concrete 
ledges that ascend from the edge of the field to about 10 feet 
above ground level to watch the game they must peer through the 
steel mesh fence 
people were caged in yesterday people who should have been 
able to escape off those terraces who were killed needlessly 
said liverpool liberal lawmaker david alton 
he said the fences should come down immediately a demand echoed 
by sheffield labor lawmaker joe ashton and denis howell a former 
labor sports minister 
bert millichip president of the english football association 
said regulations require fences in part to prevent rowdiness 
andy williams spokesman for the english football league told 
reporters some of the measures we took to combat hooliganism may 
now have turned on us 
all of liverpools remaining games this season were suspended 
for the time being team chairman john smith said 
officials of the international soccer federation fifa and the 
european counterpart the union of european football associations 
said that standingroom sections should be abolished officials 
said it wasnt that easy 
clubs have tried to change the way fans watch matches by 
eliminating terraces and making their stadiums allseating but the 
public in england demands the right to stand said jill smith an 
administrator for the english football association 
she said coventry one of the nations biggest clubs was the 
latest to try to eliminate standing sections 
people wound up standing on the seats she said its a 
very traditional thing a terribly emotive issue 
in amsterdam meanwhile soccer fans smashed store windows 
hurled bricks at police and fought with rival spectators sunday 
and 27 people were injured and 24 arrested police said 
the violence occurred before and after a match between the ajax 
team of amsterdam and a team from rotterdam

police are investigating links between 
the cult gang responsible for at least 13 ritual killings on the 
usmexico border and several slayings in mexico city a newspaper 
reported sunday 
police and residents said the gang maintained a highsecurity 
safe house in this suburb of the capital drove luxury cars and 
planted a garden to spruce up the neighborhood 
on friday police raided the suburban house and two apartments 
in downtown mexico city four days after police in matamoros 550 
miles to the north found 13 bodies buried on a ranch 
on sunday evening authorities discovered two more bodies buried 
on a collective farm two miles south of the ranch investigators 
said it was possible the victims were killed by the same cult but 
it was too early to be sure 
the government newspaper el nacional said the mexico city 
killings took place in the past two years but it did not say how 
many people died police have asked the attorney generals office 
which is responsible for mexicos antinarcotics efforts to assist 
in the investigation it said 
we are investigating everything but dont have any results 
yet alejandro dominguez a duty officer at the attorney 
generals office told the associated press 
officials said the group trafficked in drugs and believed the 
human sacrifice would protect them from police four men have been 
arrested police in mexico and the united states are seeking 
alleged ringleader adolfo constanzo and three others 
the house that federal judicial police say belonged to constanzo 
is surrounded by 10foot walls in a middle class neighborhood 13 
miles northwest of the center of mexico city neighbors said 
saturday that four to six young men had been living there about 
four months 
they left suddenly on april 10 said rosa musa i saw them 
carrying boxes out into the cars and then they all went away 
the house was guarded by five closedcircuit television cameras 
and a radarcontrolled spotlight system that lit up the street 
whenever a car drove by at night a pockmarked pistol target sat in 
the garage 
police guarding the house said that inside they found two marble 
altars 
it makes you feel creepy said one officer who identified 
himself only as rene 
in matamoros authorities found altars covered with black 
chicken feathers burned turtles cigars and other occult 
offerings the bodies had been mutilated some with their hearts or 
brains ripped out 
in mexico city police sealed off a condominium thought to 
belong to alleged constanzo associate omar ochoa and a building 
where another alleged associate martin quintana reportedly lived 
ochoa and quintana are fugitives 
luis mazon a resident of quintanas building said ochoa 
quintana and constanzo had moved out of quintanas apartment about 
eight months ago after a dispute with the buildings owner 
you cant believe the gossip and the terror in the building 
right now mazon said 
he said he had heard that constanzo dabbled in the occult 
reading cards and conducting limpias or removal of spells 
but it was the normal type of witchcraft we have here in mexico 
nothing satanic 
neighbors in mexico city and atizapan said the young men drove 
expensive cars they said the men had many visitors but seldom 
spoke to neighbors

state and federal officials examined 
exxons plan to clean hundreds of miles of shoreline as an 
environmentally risky steamcleaning method was tested sunday on 
rocks blackened by americas worst oil spill 
oil from the 101 milliongallon spill mostly in the form of 
tar balls and mousselike foam threatened homer and other ports on 
fishrich cook inlet 
boats from kodiak the nations no 1 fishing port were forced 
to avoid part of a herring grounds closed late saturday due to oil 
nearby 
state wildlife biologist dave prokopowich said he believed no 
potentially tainted fish were taken in the closed area at the 
northern tip of the kodiak islands 
they fishermen seemed to have stayed away from those areas 
where they feared there might be contamination prokopowich said 
with winds mainly from the south there was no sign of oil 
advancing toward kodiak and rich crab waters nearby said coast 
guard lt jim madden 
homer residents complained of delays in placing log booms they 
have built to protect their town exxon officials say the booms are 
being stockpiled at nearby port graham to make them easier to 
deploy when the oil strikes 
people here in homer are being jerked around said lee 
mccabe a resident who was building booms if the fishermen in 
this town fished like exxon deploys boom youd never see a fish on 
the dock 
exxonpaid workers tested cleanup methods on blackened rocks at 
block island including highpressure hotwater sprayers the 
company has about 200 of the sprayers but they have not been used 
previously with salt water 
adm paul yost the coast guard commandant sent by president 
bush to hasten the operations watched the steaming streams of 
water blast ankledeep muck from a beach about 20 miles from where 
the exxon valdez ran aground 
coldwater techniques even those using high pressure have 
little impact on microorganisms and small marine life but the jets 
of highpressure steam upend rocks strip away sand and gravel and 
kill beach life scientists say it takes up to two years for life 
to return to the sterilized shore 
yost however said he believes the steam method is the only one 
that can cleanse the sounds shoreline 
the admiral also said the logistics of keeping enough equipment 
and workers on the beaches of prince william sound during the brief 
summer would be enormous asked if the task could be completed by 
september when alaska begins bracing for winter he said i 
dont know its going to be very very tough 
yost said he was unlikely to make public exxons shore cleanup 
plan which he received saturday he said it was the companys 
plan and it was up to exxon whether to release it and let 
everybody in the us secondguess them 
it appears to be a piece of work thats well thought out 
scientifically and operationally and im very encouraged yost 
said adding that he and his advisers would meet monday with exxon 
officials in valdez 
he said that it might take three weeks to get exxons cleanup 
plan completely under way 
i wish it was two or three weeks ago said dennis kelso 
alaskas environmental chief 
kelso who has accused exxon of dragging its feet after the 
wreck of the exxon valdez on march 24 indicated he would 
scrutinize the plan over the weekend and brief gov steve cowper on 
it before discussing it in public 
exxon spokesman don cornett said the company would not discuss 
its plan until after yost had fully reviewed it 
efforts to contain the oil at sea have been largely ineffective 
exxon the coast guard and the oil pipeline consortium alyeska all 
have been accused of moving too slowly in the face of a staggering 
logistical task 
elsewhere saturday state wildlife and environmental officials 
in a coast guard helicopter searched the coast of remote katmai 
national park but were unable to confirm national park service 
reports of oil on shore said coast guard lt jim madden 
even if no oil washes up rangers fear the tainted carcasses of 
sea mammals and birds killed by the spill will be eaten by bears 
foraging on the beach 
about 3000 rocky beaches were tainted by oil in prince william 
sound the 44 beaches targeted by the state for immediate cleanup 
have at least 240 miles of often rugged shoreline

hispanic and black women women with low 
incomes those living with someone they are not married to and 
those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions 
than women in general according to a private survey 
firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions 
performed each year nor on who has them moreover the survey by 
the alan guttmacher institute confirms that most abortions are 
performed on white middleclass women because they make up the 
bulk of the population of women of childbearing age 
however the extensive survey by the new yorkbased nonprofit 
group that studies reproductive issues suggests that women in 
various categories have a statistically disproportionate share of 
abortions relative to their raw numbers 
for example it found that nonwhite women make up 167 percent 
of the childbearingage population but accounted for 314 percent 
of the abortions

frustrated by federal inaction at least a dozen states are 
debating bills that would force companies to provide health 
insurance to the millions of workers who earn too little to afford 
coverage and too much to be eligible for medicaid 
the 24 million members of working families are at the center of 
a growing legislative battle between hospitals seeking to cut 
billions of dollars in losses and small businesses that say they 
are unable to insure their employees 
the war over the uninsured working poor has been fought and lost 
in congress and was renewed again last week by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass 
it is time to make health care a basic right for all not just 
an expensive privilege for the few kennedy said as he and rep 
henry waxman dcalif introduced legislation that would require 
employers to buy health insurance for all fulltime employees 
similar legislation failed last year

the exxon oil spill in alaska has focused new 
attention on a tough question for shapers of americas energy 
future how much environmental risk will the public accept to 
continue refilling the nations oil cupboard 
few would argue for shutting down the existing oil production in 
alaska but environmentalists are using the march 24 spill in 
prince william sound to press their view that us energy needs 
dont justify an allout push for new oil development most of 
which would take place in environmentally sensitive areas 
if we want to prospect for oil we should do it in detroit

calm 
republican rep vin weber of minnesota meanwhile was

more substantive questions than the kind of technical violations

a legal struggle to decide who is 
the wife of the slain heroecologist francisco chico mendes 
could thwart efforts of international filmmakers to make a movie of 
his life 
eunice feitosa de menezes who claims to be mendes first and 
only legal wife has asked a court in acre his home state to 
confirm her marital status so she can contest any film rights 
allotted the recognized widow ilzamar mendes 
mendes 44 a rubber tappers union leader who fought to save the 
amazon from deforestation was killed by the son of a cattle 
rancher dec 22 outside his modest wooden house in xapuri 2666 
miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
mendes had won a united nations award for his struggle against 
amazon ranchers wanting to clear the rain forests for grazing 
hollywood producers seeing dramatic value in a story about a 
confrontation between powerful amazon landowners and humble rubber 
tree tappers have been turning up in brazil to see about shooting 
a movie about mendes regarded by many as the worlds first 
environmental martyr 
gilson pescador a member of the chico mendes foundation said 
offers have come from robert redford representing 20th century 
fox from united artists paramount pictures warner bros inc 
ted turner from atlanta and a number of british and brazilian film 
companies 
for the moment the decision on who will get the authorized film 
rights along with cooperation from mendes brazilian colleagues 
lies with a fourmember panel from the foundation an organization 
made up of ecologists rubber tappers and mendes family members 
but panel members are concerned that a court battle pitting 
eunice menezes against ilzamar mendes could discourage film 
producers and scuttle the project said pescador 
he and other foundation members say menezes and her lawyer are 
backed by the rightwing rural democratic union a powerful group 
of landowners that rubber tappers and local roman catholic leaders 
allege took part in the mendes shooting 
this is an underhanded attempt by the rural union to descredit 
chico and demoralize our movement to save the forest pescador 
said in an interview the rural union fears the movie will make 
chico an even greater hero than he is now 
the rural union denies the accusations 
also at stake is the money the project would bring to the rubber 
tappers estimated at more than 300000 pescador said 
we need economic resources to continue our work he added 
the movement is in a delicate stage after chicos death and our 
opponents know it 
the rural union which spent millions of dollars in a successful 
lobby effort to water down land reform clauses in brazils new 
constitution says it doesnt oppose a chico mendes movie 
if the film shows what really happened with dignity and is 
backed up with official evidence presented in court we would 
welcome such a production roosevelt dos santos president of the 
rural union said by telephone from brasilia the capital 
but mary helena alegretti a member of the mendes foundation 
panel charged that the landowners group had sought out menezes 
and her daughter with other motives 
the rural union is trying to show the world that chico wasnt 
such a good innocent boy after all she said 
all i know is that i was married to chico ilzamar mendes 
told the associated press maintaining that she married him in acre 
in 1983 
but menezes lawyer norival valadao who has defended rural 
union cattle ranchers in numerous cases against squatters 
ecologists and the rubber tappers said mendes never divorced 
menezes thus invalidating his marriage to ilzamar 
valadao said he had the certificate from mendes church wedding 
to menezes the baptism certificate of his first child by menezes 
and the index of a town hall register documenting the marriage 
the page listing mendes wedding was torn out he said 
but i still have enough evidence to serve justice and annul his 
second marriage 
pescador said there is not one document proving that this 
woman was married to chico but he conceded that menezes was the 
mother of mendes 20yearold daughter angela maria 
alegretti said angela maria would be considered a mendes family 
member when it came time to divide the familys share of film 
rights 
ilzamar mendes her two children and mendes brother and sisters 
would receive 15 percent of the royalties another 15 percent would 
be donated to the rubber tappers union and other such organizations 
in acre the remainder would go to education and health projects 
for indians and rubber tappers throughout the amazon alegretti 
said 
no one here is trying to get rich on these projects she 
said were doing it to get chicos message out thats what he 
would have wanted
