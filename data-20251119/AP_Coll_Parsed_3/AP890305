the military chief plans a major 
restructuring of senior echelons of the army in the wake of 
allegations of widespread corruption and inefficiency newspapers 
reported sunday 
several major newspapers quoted unnamed sources as saying chief 
of staff gen renato de villa announced the impending changes last 
friday during a closeddoor session of the senates defense 
committee 
the manila bulletin the manila times and the philippine daily 
inquirer quoted de villa as saying the shakeup would effect 
regional and division commanders no date was given for the shakeup 
but the papers said it was expected to be announced in a few weeks 
the inquirer quoted the defense committee chairman sen ernesto 
maceda as telling his colleagues that if de villa did not move 
soon he himself would open formal investigations into the 
allegations of corruption 
the calls for a shakeup in the senior ranks have increased 
following a series of embarassing incidents they include the 
november escape of communist rebel commander romulo kintanar from a 
manila stockade the takeover of a military headquarters by renegade 
policemen last january and the recent arrest of several police and 
military officers on car theft charges in manila 
last week maceda charged that unidentified generals and colonels 
were receiving thousands of dollars annually from criminal 
syndicates in return for shielding them from arrest 
maceda also challenged military claims that government forces 
have gained the upper hand in the 20year war against the communist 
new peoples army 
ten senior officers including army commander maj gen mariano 
adalem are scheduled to retire this year but the newspapers said 
the shakeup will affect many senior officers not scheduled for 
retirement

a federal judge on 
saturday doubled the bail of an accused cocaine trafficker who is a 
key figure in the federal investigation of washington mayor marion 
barry 
chief us district court judge david v obrien said new 
information provided saturday by the us attorneys office in st 
thomas prompted the increase in bail from 100000 set late friday 
to 200000 
obrien said authorities had more than tripled their estimates of 
the amount of cocaine involved in two sales allegedly made last week 
by charles lewis 
earlier w douglas gow an fbi spokesman in washington said 
lewis allegedly sold six to seven grams of the drug to agents on st 
thomas and would be charged with two counts of distributing cocaine 
lewis remained jailed in st thomas on saturday and was to appear 
in court there monday for a bail hearing 
the judge said federal prosecutors have 30 days to file charges 
an fbi statement said lewis was arrested friday after allegedly 
attempting to sell agents the cocaine derivative crack twice 
last week on st thomas 
the 48yearold st thomas resident allegedly sold five rocks 
to agents thursday and another 20 on friday just prior to his 
arrest according to court reports and the fbi release 
obrien said he had set bail at 100000 over the telephone 
friday on the barebones statement that both transactions 
involved a total 25 pieces of crack 
but he said the us attorneys office informed him saturday the 
transaction actually involved 20 envelopes containing 85 pieces of 
crack 
the fbi report said that during the alleged buys which it said 
were recorded on video and audio tape lewis told agents he could 
sell them pure cocaine that could be converted into crack 
lewis was the target of a washington police investigation in 
december when a maid at a local hotel claimed that he offered her 
drugs in exchange for sex two district police officers went to the 
hotel to try to buy drugs from lewis but the drug buy was called 
off when the officers realized that barry was visiting lewis at the 
time 
a federal grand jury is now looking into the circumstances 
surrounding barrys visit to the hotel a second investigation 
involving both lewis and barry focuses on possible fraud in the 
citys 260000 joint personnel project with the virgin islands

a moderate earthquake that shook grand 
canyon national park on saturday was followed by a moderate 
aftershock about nine hours later but neither caused any damage or 
injury officials said 
also late saturday an earthquake centered 40 miles northwest of 
seattle was felt over a large area of western washington state 
the arizona aftershock was recorded at a preliminary magnitude of 
39 on the richter scale of ground motion at 218 am said us 
geological survey spokeswoman pat jorgenson in menlo park calif 
the epicenter of the quake was near grand canyon village about 
60 miles northwest of flagstaff she said 
saturdays temblor at 541 pm had a preliminary magnitude of 
40 said don finley a geological survey spokesman in washington 
dc 
it was very quick park service spokesman chuck lundy said of 
the saturday quake it probably lasted only five or six seconds 
we could hear the glasses rattling in the cupboard and you could 
feel the ground rumble and shudder 
in washington state a moderate earthquake that shook the region 
at 1042 pm was felt as far north as vancouver british columbia 
ms jorgenson said 
that temblor with an epicenter in the olympic peninsula 40 miles 
northwest of seattle was recorded with a preliminary magnitude of 
44 on the richter scale she said 
no damage or injuries were reported as a result of the quake she 
added 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs each increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 
severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

the head of chinas official womens organization 
denounced sex discrimination in the work place and politics and 
urged new efforts to fight it an official report said sunday 
chen muhua former head of the bank of china and head of the 
allchina womens federation used unusually strong language in her 
remarks 
she said the federation should justly and forcefully call out 
to fight for womens legal rights and interests the peoples 
daily said 
to meet the new demands of the historical era the womens 
federation should reform its work and raise the womens liberation 
movement to a new level the communist party newspaper quoted ms 
chen as saying in an interview with the magazine party building 
officials generally argue there is no need for a womens 
liberation movement in china they say the entire population women 
included was liberated in 1949 when the communists took power 
however the womens federation has become increasingly outspoken 
in recent months during that time growing economic competition 
encouraged by senior leader deng xiaoping has been used as a reason 
for firing or not hiring women or denying them scarce university 
seats 
many women workers have been fired as industries form 
highquality labor groups or sign contracts with their workers 
the paper quoted ms chen as saying there are economic reasons 
for this but it also has to do with attitude 
the labor groups are one of the recent reform moves involving 
reorganizing work forces into more efficient units and firing the 
unqualified official statistics indicate a majority of those fired 
are women 
ms chen said one reason for that problem is that factories dont 
want to pay maternity leave 
she was also quoted as saying womens representation in 
government is extremely low with women making up only onefifth 
of the 2976 delegates to the national peoples congress the 
legislature 
according to ms chen discrimination often begins at birth and 
is reflected in a growing gap between boys and girls in officially 
registered births 
recent figures indicate more than 110 boy babies are registered 
for every 100 girls 
she did not say whether she believed girl babies were not being 
registered or if they were being aborted or killed after birth 
chinese families traditionally have preferred boys to girls 
believing boys are more valuable as farm laborers and as supporters 
of their parents in old age 
the government limits most families to only one child in an 
effort to limit the countrys population but some local 
authorities bowing to popular pressure allow families to have a 
second child if the first one is a girl

leaving deskbound bureaucrats behind larry 
morrison has risen high in his government career a man you can 
really look up to 
hes the guy who changes light bulbs at the top of the washington 
monument 
every week or so morrison climbs a ladder about 515 feet above 
ground to install a fresh bulb in the set of eight red airplane 
warning lights that blink unceasingly at the apex of the popular 
tourist attraction 
nothing to it says morrison a 23year veteran electrician for 
the national park service 
after all morrison works inside the monument behind 
18inchthick walls of granite and marble he perches 15 feet above 
the observation deck atop an aluminum extension ladder held steady 
by an assistant 
when he demonstrated his lofty job late last week morrison had 
raymond hall master park service electrician for the washington 
region as his supervisor 
although the washington monument sways slightly in a stiff wind 
morrison says the only time he feels queasy is when he climbs 
outdoor scaffolding with the weebles and wobbles to change light 
bulbs above the columns of the lincoln memorial 
the bulbs that morrison replaces at the washington monument are 
500watt spotlights that cost 70 apiece and last about a week or 
two they flash on and off continually from four pairs of holes on 
each side of the pyramidshaped monument peak 
no airplane has ever struck the 555foot washington monument 
which occupies airspace that is offlimits to planes landing or 
taking off at nearby national airport 
however seven people have died in suicides or accidental falls 
down the monuments observation windows or elevator shaft since it 
was opened to the public on oct 9 1888 
bars were installed in the narrow windows on the 500foot level 
after they were used for the last two suicide leaps in 1926 thick 
safety glass was installed later a high metal grill was erected 
above the guard rail alongside the monuments 897 steps after the 
last suicide down the shaft occurred in 1949 
the inner stairway was closed to the public in 1976 except for 
escorted tours downs the steps because of vandalism and growing 
congestion 
an eighth death occurred at the monument in december 1982 when 
police shot and killed norman mayer an antinuclear demonstrator 
who held the monument hostage for 10 hours claiming he would blow it 
up with dynamite 
ironically no one was killed during the entire 36 years it took 
to build the monument

the soviet leadership preparing for an important 
meeting on agriculture has given short shrift to president mikhail 
s gorbachevs campaign to lease more stateowned farmland to 
private groups 
in last weeks twoday poliburo meeting the 12member ruling 
body referred to leasing as only one of many forms of management it 
said were necessary to ease chronic soviet food shortages pravda 
reported saturday 
and in a speech in the siberian city of omsk the head of the 
communist partys commission for agriculture yegor k ligachev 
also made only one mention of leasing his speech was carried friday 
by pravda the communist party daily 
ligachev reputedly a conservative force on the politburo opted 
instead for more traditional formulas calling for increased 
investment to better life in villages and to modernize farm 
machinery and technology 
gorbachev in october said the kremlin leadership had decided to 
extend to the whole of agriculture an experiment that leased 
collective farmland to small groups and families who would choose 
their crops and keep most of the profits 
farmers he said in a speech must again become complete 
masters of the land 
with the exception of small garden plots tilled by individual 
citizens all farmland is stateowned in the soviet union since the 
bloody drive launched by dictator josef v stalin in 1929 to 
eliminate the independent peasantry the mainstays of the soviet 
agricultural system have been the kolkhozes or collective 
farms and the sovkhozes or stateowned farms 
a leasing system runs counter to marxistleninist theory which 
holds that a socialist form of ownership such as the collective 
farms is a higher and more efficient form of organization than 
private farming 
any changes would threaten the entrenched bureaucracy that runs 
the collective and stateowned farms and the sprawling superministry 
of agriculture 
gorbachev the son of a russian peasant has not called for the 
dismantlement of collective or state farms which have been run for 
decades like factories with orders from moscow on what and when to 
plant handed down to the wage earners who work the fields but he 
said in october the practice of paying them unearned money had 
to stop 
in the past 20 years he said capital investment in the 
agriculture sector rose 140 percent but production increased only 
41 percent in contrast gorbachev said dairy farms run on the 
leasing system produce more milk per cow than ordinary farms 
but gorbachev acknowledged in january that the leasing campaign 
ran into opposition from bureaucrats and collective farmers who 
view those who enroll in it as latterday descendants of the 
kulaks or rich peasants 
leasing is proceeding with difficulty and thus many people 
the innovators are being called kulaks and rockefellers he said 
many people especially the lazy dont like the fact that leasing 
is destroying the habits of the years of stagnation when you 
could get a good salary no matter how you worked 
gorbachev said a law was being drafted to prepare the interests 
of farmers who entered into longterm leases 
the politburo preparing for a meeting of the partys 
policymaking central committee on agriculture later this month 
said it supported the creation of multiple forms of ownership and 
types of management of kolkhozes sovkhozes agroindustrial 
amalgamations processing enterprises leasees members of 
cooperatives leasing collectives farmsteads personal farmplots of 
citizens pravda said 
in omsk ligachev used similar language calling for the spread 
of different organizational forms of production based on 
selfaccounting the brigade and lease relations cooperatives and 
also the democratization of management on all levels pravda said 
the politburo report did not say when the central committee would 
meet again but at its last plenum in january the 300plus member 
body announced it would hold a plenary session march 1516

the bloody riots in venezuela this week 
highlight a question that has puzzled political analysts since the 
oil price spirals of the 1970s what did the billions in oil income 
buy for the poorer exporting countries 
the full answer is not yet clear but a new study by a world bank 
economist concludes that for some countries including venezuela 
the wealth was wasted 
venezuela and its fellow opec members were the chief 
beneficiaries at least temporarily of the oil supply disruptions 
of 1973 and 1979 that pushed prices from less than 2 a barrel to 
nearly 40 the immediate losers were the united states and other 
oilimporting nations which suffered a prolonged economic slump 
a decade after the last oil price shock that was triggered by the 
1979 iranian revolution economists and political scientists are 
still trying to determine what happened to the mountains of oil 
income earned by the exporters 
so too in a less academic way are people in the slums of 
caracas the venezuelan capital riots that began there on monday 
claimed at least 200 lives in a crisis triggered by new government 
austerity measures including increases in gasoline prices and 
transit fares martial law was imposed on tuesday 
a few analysts have been saying for years that the oil exporters 
wealth was squandered and that most members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries may be worse off today than before 
they began reaping the richest trade returns in history but their 
judgments lacked a longer perspective on how the opec economies have 
performed 
now the world banks alan gelb in his new book oil windfalls 
blessing or curse has provided a comprehensive and detailed 
analysis of the oil boom fallout 
his conclusion most of the oil exporting nations are worse off 
now than before the boom making the decade of oil windfalls a 
massive net loss for the whole world 
the troubles for the oil exporters have been made much worse of 
course by the steep fall in oil prices since 1986 from 30 a 
barrel to roughly 15 a barrel now during the 1970s it was widely 
believed worldwide that prices would keep rising 
gelb a senior financial economist at the world bank focuses on 
five opec members venezuela nigeria indonesia algeria and 
ecuador plus nonopec member trinidad and tobago 
he says that of these six only indonesia succeeded in using its 
1970s oil wealth to strengthen its overall economy mainly by 
improving its agricultural sector 
nigeria probably fared the worst gelb says by the mid1980s 
nigerians overall standard of living was lower than before the 
boom he concludes 
as a measure of nigerias failures gelb writes that in 197284 
the economy grew at an average annual rate of 25 percent despite 
the largest investment boom in the nations history by contrast in 
the six years prior to the 1973 oil price spiral nigerian economic 
growth averaged 92 percent a year 
gelb adds however that despite the massive waste of oil income 
on such failed projects as steel factories nigeria did spend wisely 
to improve primary education 
one of the chief reasons for the economic problems resulting from 
the oil boom in these six countries gelb says was the speed at 
which oil wealth grew in indonesia for example oil export income 
soared more than fourfold at the start of the boom from 641 
million in 1973 to 264 billion the following year 
the governments which own the national oil monopolies felt 
compelled to spend the money rapidly in order to demonstrate to 
their publics that it was not being hoarded or extorted gelb says 
this often led to overly risky investments and too little attention 
to the need for basic economic changes such as tax reform 
oil exporters ended the period worse off than they would have 
been with a far lower more predictable rate of increase in oil 
prices or indeed with constant real oil prices gelb writes 
venezuela unlike many of the other oil exporters was more 
cautious in spending its oil windfall perhaps out of respect for 
the views of juan pablo perez alfonso who helped create opec in 
1960 he once called oil the devils excrement and said it 
brings trouble 
in the early years after the 1973 price boom which was triggered 
by the arab oil embargo the venezuelan government created the 
venezuelan investment fund to manage the money it saved abroad by 
1978 the nations accounts with the rest of the world were in

eastern airlines pilots who have virtually shut 
down the carrier by honoring the picket lines of striking 
machinists are risking not only their careers but the existence of 
the airline a company spokesman said sunday 
by continuing to stay out the pilots are committing economic 
suicide spokesman robin matell said at a latemorning news 
briefing discussing the effects of the machinists union strike in 
its second day sunday 
this is a pilots strike there should be no mistake about 
that and its a pontentially tragic mistake matell said 
it places 3600 pilot careers in jeopardy and it risks the very 
existance of a great airline he said but maybe just maybe 
its not too late 
matell said that about 150 pilots had crossed the picket lines 
saturday and said there were indications more would work sunday 
eastern was able to get only 85 of its normal 1000 saturday 
flights into the air because the pilots couldnt be matched with 
available aircraft quickly enough matell said 
eastern expected to fly 125 flights sunday and had managed to 
get 12 up by 10 am he said 
eastern managers thought they had prepared for the stike by 
hiring nonunionists and slashing the weekend schedule by up to 75 
percent but those plans ripped apart when most pilots and flight 
attendants honored picket lines 
ron cole a spokesman for the pilots union had said saturday 
that its very clear the airline isnt going to fly without us 
meanwhile sympathizers across the country were mobilizing for 
massive pickets monday that threatened rushhour nightmares 
especially in the congested new york metropolitan area strikers 
planned picketing at commuter railroads and received assurances that 
no rail workers would cross their lines 
the walkout that began at 1201 am saturday by 8500 mechanics 
bag handlers and ground crews escalated a 17month unionmanagement 
battle at the nations seventhlargest airline which ordinarily 
schedules more than 1000 flights with 100000 passengers daily 
both sides were deadlocked on 150 million in wage concessions 
that company boss frank lorenzo demanded talks collapsed in 
washington at midnight friday and no new discussions were planned 
the main target of the striker hostility was lorenzo head of 
texas air corp which bought eastern in 1986 
he is widely mistrusted by eastern workers because of what they 
call his triumphant unioncrushing campaign at sister carrier 
continental airlines in 1983 many accuse him of provoking the 
strike to do the same at eastern 
battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in the 
deregulated airline business eastern has racked up nearly 25 
billion in debt and claims to be losing more than 1 million a day

if the senate rejects john tower as defense 
secretary the white house is expected to move quickly to name a 
replacement even though it isnt acknowledging the possibility of 
defeat 
the president has told his staff and has told the nation that 
hes not talking about successors hes talking about getting his 
nomination confirmed said white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
still administration aides and congressional sources say 
privately that the president is mindful of the odds against winning 
towers confirmation and that the white house is determined not to 
be caught off balance 
the speculation is that bushs would select a candidate who could 
be confirmed quickly either someone now in government or someone 
who in the recent past had been a cabinet or subcabinet official 
some republicans in congress have been pressing bush to give the 
job to his national security adviser brent scowcroft who is widely 
respected on both sides of the aisle 
in fact if bush was determined to keep tower as part of his 
administration he could do a job swap giving him scowcrofts 
present job which does not require senate confirmation and which 
is not in the military line of command 
although scowcrofts name has been heard most frequently in 
recent white house speculation there is no shortage of candidates 
among them 
sen john warner of virginia senior republican on the senate 
armed services committee a former secretary of the navy warner 
would sail through the senate if nominated however a big political 
minus to republicans would be the loss of a senate seat since 
democratic virginia gov gerald baliles would surely fill the 
vacancy with a member of his own party 
former defense secretary donald rumsfeld now a corporate 
executive rumsfeld was former president fords defense secretary in 
197577 he is mentioned frequently as a likely contender for the 
post but his support of sen bob dole of kansas against bush in 
last years republican primaries could work against him 
former rep jack edwards of alabama he was the senior 
republican on the appropriations defense subcommittee for many years 
and was highly regarded for his knowledge of the defense budget and 
for his skill in arguing defense issues 
drew lewis former transportation secretary the president of 
union pacific corp has become a gop workhorse with a string of 
highlevel assignments and would bring a management perspective to 
the job he was in president reagans first cabinet and most 
recently was cochairman of the federal economic commission which 
tried to tackle the problem of the budget deficit 
norman augustine chief executive officer of martinmarietta 
corp he reportedly was offered and turned down the chance to be 
deputy defense secretary but might view the no 1 spot differently 
he has been involved in developing various proposals for defense 
modernization however his lack of previous government service 
could be a liability 
when asked whether bush has considered alternatives whether 
anyone on his staff has considered alternatives or whether the 
white house personnel office has done any preliminary work in such a 
direction fitzwater is emphatic 
to my knowledge and under every instruction that ive been 
given by everybody of any authority the answer to that no no no 
and no says the presidential spokesman 
but analysts and leading republicans in congress suggest 
otherwise 
if there hasnt been at least one session in the oval office to 
bat around alternatives to tower then theyre nuts theyve got to 
have a contingency plan said norman ornstein of the conservative 
american enterprise institute 
george bush has to come forward with someone very quickly who 
can be confirmed quickly if tower loses ornstein said 
suggesting that additional delays in getting his defense team in 
place are the last thing he wants to do 
sen phil gramm dtexas an outspoken tower defender said he 
believed several people might be considered as backup candidates 
for tower but that the white house has given no signal it is 
wavering in its support for tower 
rep lynn martin rill a former member of the house armed 
services committee who was a top bush campaign adviser said she 
assumes the presidents senior staff has given consideration to a 
successor to tower even if bush has not 
of course theyll have alternatives ready thats what staff 
is for she said in an interview you always plan to the 
possibility of losing 
mrs martin said bush was entirely proper in forbidding his staff 
to talk about possible backup candidates it is not the 
appropriate time she said

the fledgling 101st congress with no major 
legislation to consider will be dominated this week by highly 
partisan squabbles one behind tightly sealed doors and the other 
in the glare of television 
the only significant legislative activity will come in the senate 
labor and human resources committee which will begin writing a bill 
to raise the 335 minimum wage to at least 425 and perhaps as 
much as 465 an hour 
the bush administration supports an increase to no more than 
425 and only then if workers are exempted until they have been 
on the job for at least six months 
with the nation looking on the democraticcontrolled senate will 
resume debate monday on the nomination of former sen john g tower 
a republican to be secretary of defense a final vote is likely 
this week and despite president bushs pleas no democrat has 
announced support for tower no republican has come out against him 
on the other side of the capitol a 12member committee evenly 
divided between the two parties will attempt to wrap up its 
investigation of house speaker jim wright of texas the most 
powerful democrat in government the ethics committee has been 
looking into wrights behavior for nine months and has diligently 
guarded against news leaks of its private discussions 
the panel is considering six allegations against wright most of 
the attention has centered on assertions that he improperly used his 
office to produce and sell a book on which he made 55000 in part 
by selling the book to special interests he also is accused of 
having lobbied improperly on behalf of texas savings institutions 
the speaker says he is confident that he will be vindicated 
a finding that wright violated house ethics standards would send 
the matter to the full house regardless of the outcome republicans 
already have vowed that wright will be their chief target in the 
1990 elections 
a senate vote against tower would make history never before has 
the senate rejected the cabinet nominee of a president entering his 
first term 
tower an acknowledged expert on military matters is under fire 
for what some senators view as a drinking problem and because be 
sold his advice to the defense industry after leaving government as 
a senior arms negotiator 
tower a former chairman of the senate armed services committee 
served 23 years in the senate the depth of his problem became 
clear when all 11 democrats on the panel opposed him and only the 9 
republicans voted for him 
another bush nominee former education secretary william bennett 
is likely to have a much easier time 
the senate judiciary committee is expected to vote thursday to 
recommend confirmation of bennett to head the federal governments 
battle against illegal drugs 
bennett who has the warm endorsement of sen joseph biden jr 
ddel chairman of the committee told the panel he plans to target 
casual drug users as well as drug distributors 
the senate will vote tuesday on confirming career diplomat thomas 
pickering to be us ambassador to the united nations 
pickering has faced some criticism because while serving as 
ambassador to israel he received a document from a central american 
leader offering 1 million worth of military equipment to the rebels 
fighting the leftist government in nicaragua the letter received 
at a time when the law barred us military aid to the rebels was 
delivered directly by pickering to national security council aide 
oliver north 
until committees begin churning out legislation congress has 
little to do except nominations and housekeeping measures 
leaders of congress and the bush administration may begin 
negotiations late in the week aimed at producing a budget for the 12 
months that begin next oct 1 
bush has proposed a 116 trillion spending plan that he says 
would reduce the budget deficit below the 100 billion maximum 
allowed by law democrats complain that the presidents plan leaves 
to congress the tough decisions on which programs to cut to meet 
that deficit target 
hanging over the budget discussions is bushs pledge not to raise 
taxes democratic leaders say any workable plan must include some 
tax increases but they are not about to take the first step unless 
they are joined by the president

british rock star sting who has 
said he will lead a campaign to preserve the amazon rain forest 
says the destruction of the jungle is tied to brazils 121 billion 
foreign debt 
the brazilian government claims it must develop the amazon to pay 
off its huge debt but development equals environmental destruction 
critics say 
the truth is that the world is in debt to brazil not the 
contrary sting said in an interview published sunday in rios 
jornal do brasil newspaper the united states and europe produce 
more dollars and brazil produces more air its a question of how 
you value things i personally value air more 
he said that the foreign debt and rain forest destruction are 
linked because the countrys debtinduced poverty forces people 
who live at the margins of existence to go to the forests out of 
necessity 
sting said he believed the foundation he established to help save 
the amazon will be useful in influencing public opinion in the 
united states and europe to reduce the paying back of the debt

the frontrunner for next months mayoral election 
is a democrat his closest pursuer was a democrat as recently as 
december and the no 3 man in the race was democratic county 
chairman just 18 months ago 
an outoftowner might ask what these guys richard m daley 
alderman tim evans and former county chairmanturned republican 
edward vrdolyak are fighting about 
but chicagoans arent surprised 
when you have only one functioning party choosing one 
candidate the other guys get blocked then frustrated then go off 
on their own and call themselves something else explains mike 
royko a veteran political observer and columnist for the chicago 
tribune 
evans a black ran as a democrat when he was elected alderman 
and is now running for mayor as an independent vrdolyak entered the 
gop primary at the last minute as a writein candidate and even 
though he got 80 percent of the white vote in his unsuccessful 
independent mayoral challenge in 1987 he is regarded as third in 
the race now 
the citys last republican mayor was william hale big bill 
thompson a threeterm mayor so brazen about his alliance with 
gangsters that his portrait hung in the headquarters of the al 
capone gang 
thompson was eased out in 1931 by anton pushcart tony cermak 
credited with bringing to chicago the modern political machine a 
coalition of ethnic voters bound by the principle of selfinterest 
everybody gets something 
what followed was a succession of politicians as diverse as 
daleys father the late richard j daley the last of the bigcity 
bosses who died in 1976 and harold washington a reformer 
whose 1983 election as the citys first black mayor and whose death 
just months into his second term in 1987 altered the course of 
chicagos democratic party 
if the old man richard j daley were alive theres a lot 
about the party he wouldnt recognize even if his son winds up at 
the top of it said eugene kennedy a loyola university professor 
and author of himself a biography of the elder daley 
in his day a democrat was a democrat first and whatever else 
he was came second 
washington changed that by winning with little more than a single 
racial bloc kennedy said the town is about 40 percent white 40 
percent black and 20 percent hispanic and other minorities 
and what you see now essentially are three men two white 
and one black relying on the same strategy trying to do 
essentially the same thing he added 
washingtons 1983 election came after a racially charged 
campaign but his ability to govern fairly eased the fears of many 
whites who opposed him and he was reelected in 1987 with 
significantly less strife 
the younger daley last week became the first white to oust an 
incumbent black mayor in a major us city by defeating eugene 
sawyer who filled in after washingtons death but their primary 
campaign was surprisely free of rancor and appeals to race 
considering the racially split voting 
daley 46 threeterm cook county states attorney received 
significant support from liberals and an emerging hispanic bloc 
though the lions share of his support came from many of the same 
white ethnics who made his father mayor for 21 years 
black voter turnout was depressed according to some estimates 
by as much as 20 percent in wards that had proved crucial to 
washingtons victories 
most political observers laid the blame for that at the feet of 
evans 45 who waged a long and oftenbitter battle with sawyer to 
be recognized among blacks as washingtons righful heir sawyer was 
elected acting mayor after washingtons death largely because of the 
support of white aldermen 
that split still exists and thats the reason daley likely 
will win april 4 said lu palmer an influential black political 
activist and radio commentator many many sawyer supporters are 
saying that evans and his allies are the reason for sawyers loss 
and many are saying they will not vote for evans 
people are saying vrdolyak will split the white vote with daley 
but i say vrdolyak wont have much of an impact why should 
white democrats cross over and vote for vrdolyak theyve already 
got their candidate 
paul kleppner a political science professor and author put it 
this way almost everybody in the city may still think of 
themselves as democrats but now most of them are black democrats 
or white democrats

dye said peri returned to his unit in civilian clothes and 
appeared to be in good health peri disappeared feb 21 from the 
11th armored cavalry regiment in fulda

a suicide pact by four girls who took 
rat poison so their parents could lavish everything on their brother 
has shocked koreans and raised questions about male chauvinism and 
the plight of the poor 
the girls aged 6 to 13 were found unconscious feb 27 after 
they took the poison the youngest died immediately but doctors 
said the other three would recover 
yang soonmi the eldest daughter told police the girls made the 
suicide pact because they wanted to save their parents money and 
ensure their 3yearold brother would have the best education 
possible 
the incident has shocked south koreans who have sent toys dolls 
and more than 15000 worth of donations to the hospital where the 
three surviving girls were taken 
a social organization vowed to pay the girls school expenses 
through college and kim oksook the wife of president roh taewoo 
sent a letter asking the girls not to lose hope 
newspaper editorials blamed public policies they said do too 
little for the poor in a nation of growing prosperity 
education in south korea is free up until the end of the sixth 
grade and the oldest daughter was due to enter seventh grade 
educating four daughters would have been a major expense especially 
since most korean women have little hope of finding good jobs in the 
maledominated society 
its regrettable and shocking that the malefirst idea was 
planted deep inside the minds of such young girls said lee 
kyekyung publisher of the weekly womens news a leading advocate 
of womens rights

a high school cheerleader was acquitted of 
murdering her newborn boy by slashing his throat after she 
testified that he was not breathing and she tried to give him a 
tracheotomy to help him breath 
im just glad its finally over and i can see all my friends 
again the 15yearold from the valders area said after her 
acquittal saturday on the most serious charge against her 
a manitowoc county circuit court jury deliberated more than four 
hours before ruling the girl was innocent of the juvenile code 
murder charge but guilty of trying to conceal the infants body in a 
plastic bag 
when the verdict was announced the defendant slumped onto her 
attorneys shoulder and said thank you 
judge fred hazelwood said the court must decide within 30 days 
what action to take on the concealment conviction the state 
childrens code which keeps the girls name officially 
confidential allows several options including counseling and 
community confinement 
until that decision hazelwood ordered her to remain in a foster 
home but he lifted an order that prevented her from having contact 
with friends 
the defendant a sophomore at valders high school and a member of 
its cheerleading squad said she found testifying at the sixday 
trial difficult 
i was nervous but i actually got a chance to say for myself 
what happened she told reporters outside the courtroom 
the girl testified she gave birth in a basement bathroom dec 28 
but the infant was not breathing 
after trying to revive him with mouthtomouth resuscitation 
which she learned in a class on cardiopulmonary respiration she 
attempted a tracheotomy an incision in the throat to open the 
infants windpipe but that also failed 
she said she then placed the body in a plastic bag and dropped it 
in the yard of a neighbor 
district attorney e james fitzgerald said in his closing 
arguments that the physical evidence including other cut and stab 
marks on the infants body showed the girl really was trying to 
kill the baby 
nice people do bad things sometimes they do crimes 
fitzgerald said 
but defense attorney ron kaminski said the prosecution managed to 
prove only that the girl had a baby 
where is the evidence of death after life he asked as 
horrible as it is this is not a murder 
he conceded that everything she did was bad news but added 
his client did not intend to kill the boy he said prosecution 
testimony had glaring ommissions and that the entire prosecution 
was based on manipulation and speculation

the state university that has played host 
to a communist convention cia protests and a building takeover by 
angry minorities is facing student unrest from an unusual corner 
these days archconservatives 
the rightwingers on the campus that they like to describe as 
so far left its falling off have accused the university of 
massachusetts of violating their right of free assembly for 
stripping them of the privilege of renting meeting rooms because of 
a brawl with a leftwing group which lost the same privilege 
this is a leftist institution said republican club president 
ted maravelias a 20yearold sophomore who said he will file suit 
unless the 27000student school relents this administration does 
not want to hear the conservative viewpoint 
club members brawled with members of the spartacus youth club 
feb 9 when the republicans refused to leave a meeting of the 
marxist group one person was injured 
the scuffle was just the latest skirmish in the threeyear 
history of confrontations between political extremists at the campus 
100 miles west of boston among other incidents 
the conservative student newspaper the minuteman was the 
subject of a meeting between students and administrators last month 
because of disparaging comments about homosexuals university 
spokeswoman stacey chase said the school is investigating ways to 
distance ourselves from the paper such as banning the use of 
the university name on the banner 
the republican club was ousted from its campus office in may 
after a member pounded the wall separating the office from the 
headquarters of the lesbian bisexual and gay alliance and broke a 
tape player belonging to the homosexual group 
another campus group the distinguished visitors program which 
had shared space with the club before its ouster complained of 
frequent harassment and griped that a republican club member 
answered its phones hello young communist league 
republican club members yelled the words to god bless 
america at demonstrators who tried to stop cia recruiting at the 
university in november 1986 five months later club members tossed 
bars of soap at a small crowd that rallied in support of amy carter 
abbie hoffman and a dozen other activists on trial for charges 
stemming from the demonstration 
the republican club president contends that conservatives are a 
persecuted minority on campus basically this is not even a 
liberal campus its a socialist one maravelias said 
the strong words of the small group of young conservatives have 
aroused the ire of many on a campus that is notable for its turmoil 
after the cia protests of 1986 the university gained more 
notoriety in november 1987 with a racial scuffle that injured 10 
students and in february 1988 with a weeklong building takeover by 
minority students a month later the school made headlines with the 
election of a communist as copresident of the student body 
jason rabinowitz a founding member of the young communist 
league has become a frequent target of the minuteman 
certainly its a progressive campus for that reason it is a 
target for farright groups rabinowitz said 
the conservative group first emerged in early 1986 with the 
minuteman started with a 740 contribution from the us industrial 
councils educational foundation which also gave a boost to 
conservative papers at yale and harvard universities 
the republican club now claims about 200 members although school 
spokeswoman jeanne hopkins said a cadre of a few leaders and a score 
of followers runs the club and the minuteman 
more moderate student leaders say the campus is polarized between 
political extremes and few in the middle take part or even vote 
to them its a sideshow its a callingallcharacters type of 
deal said john dunlop copresident of the schools northeast 
area government he pointed out that only about 3000 of the 
schools 19000 undergraduates voted in last years election

foreign ministers from 35 countries meet 
monday for eastwest conventional arms control talks that may bring 
sweeping reductions in troops and military hardware from the 
atlantic to the urals 
during a threeday conference at viennas former hofburg imperial 
palace the ministers also will review prospects for a conference to 
build confidence and security between east and west bloc nations of 
europe 
the ministers were in vienna in january to wrap up the helsinki 
followup conference on security and cooperation in europe which 
agreed on the new arms control talks and landmark human rights 
provisions for the soviet bloc 
a new man on the scene this time is secretary of state james a 
baker iii who will meet tuesday with his soviet counterpart eduard 
a shevardnadze 
they are to use their vienna sojourn to hold bilateral talks both 
sides hope will lay the groundwork for successful discussions in 
coming months 
negotiations on reducing conventional troops and arms in europe 
will be conducted between the 16 nato countries and seven members of 
the warsaw pact 
talks on new confidence and security building measures involve 
all 35 countries including the soviet union the united states 
canada and all european countries except selfisolated albania the 
talks start thursday 
western hopes are based on reduced eastwest tensions and the 
successful conclusion of intermediate nuclear forces talks leading 
to the destruction of the superpowers intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles 
the soviets and most of their allies also are showing a 
willingness to reduce military spending in favor of more and better 
consumer goods 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in december gave the new 
talks a boost when he announced a unilateral reduction of half a 
million soviet troops in 198990 50000 of them in east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary 
since then all warsaw pact nations except romania have announced 
plans to trim their militaries 
the arms talks will cover conventional armed forces and armaments 
and equipment based on land 
naval forces and chemical and nuclear weapons will not be 
negotiated 
the western alliance is seeking reductions of more than 50 
percent from the soviets and their allies to offset what it says is 
the soviet blocs 21 superiority in tanks and artillery a nato 
source said in brussels this week 
in return nato offers to cut its artillery tanks and some other 
mobile weapons by 5 percent to 10 percent in europe the source said 
since we are convinced that we are pretty much at the 
minimum of our defense this means for our military people a 
significant sacrifice the source told reporters at nato 
headquarters 
in moscow deputy foreign minister viktor karpov said on friday 
the soviet union wants to eliminate imbalances especially in 
offensive weapons to restructure the armed forces of the warsaw 
pact and nato so as to give an absolutely defensive character to 
troops and armaments during cutbacks 
he also said verification a chief obstacle to the failed 15year 
talks on cutting troops and tanks in central europe could be 
surmounted because of better monitoring abilities and more exchange 
of information 
under new nato proposals to be submitted in vienna there should 
be no more than 40000 main battle tanks 20000 for each side 
artillery pieces should be kept to 33000 and armored troop 
carriers to 55000 equally shared between the two sides 
the other talks are a continuation of the 35nation stockholm 
conference which in 1986 formally adopted the first eastwest 
security agreement of the decade an accord designed to reduce the 
risk of an accidental war in europe 
the nato source said the western alliance will propose an annual 
exchange of information concerning military organization manpower 
and equipment involving all participants improved observation and 
improved access for accredited personnel dealing with military 
matters and media

john tower on sunday reiterated his pledge to 
stop drinking if confirmed as secretary of defense but said he saw 
no reason to do so otherwise and accused his detractors of 
hypocrisy 
tower also drew a distinction between the past excessive 
drinking he has admitted to and an alcohol abuse problem that 
would disqualify him for sensitive military positions 
at any rate tower maintained that such judgments are made by a 
military persons commanding officer and that in his case 
president bush is his commanding officer 
appearing on the cbstv interview program tower also restated 
his determination not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn 
arguing that bush did not want him to and that the controversy over 
his selection has escalated beyond consideration of his own personal 
qualifications 
i still have sip of wine now and again tower responded when 
asked whether he had stopped drinking since pledging a week ago to 
do so if confirmed once confirmed i will give it up altogether 
asked why he did not stop drinking immediately as an act of 
good faith tower responded 
well why should i why should i it is so little that it 
doesnt really matter one reason i can give it up and give it up 
easily is because it doesnt really matter that much 
a few minutes earlier tower had been asked about arguments by 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn and others that he 
would fail to qualify for a sensitive military position because of a 
history of alcohol abuse 
does this not disqualify you he was asked 
no i would be disqualified if you could prove alcohol 
dependency or chronic alcoholism in the final analysis it is a 
decision to be made by the commanding officer that should be based 
on hard evidence in my particular instance the president of the 
united states is the commanding officer 
the fact is i am not alcoholdependent continued tower 
there is no conclusive proof to the effect as a matter of fact 
the weight of proof seems to indicate otherwise 
youve admitted to alcohol abuse yourself the questioner 
persisted 
ive admitted to excessive drinking in the 1970s tower 
replied ive said excessive drinking not alcohol abuse 
theres a difference 
tower said he had no plans to withdraw his name from nomination 
and would relish a chance to appear on the senate floor to defend 
himself as suggested by the senate republican leader sen bob dole 
of kansas 
i think it would be damaging to the president if he withdrew my 
name or if i withdrew because it would mean that the president had 
finally been pressured into pulling down a nominee that he believes 
to be eminently qualified tower said 
the decision on allowing tower to appear in the senate rests with 
the newly chosen senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
mitchell has said he opposed towers nomination but has not ruled 
on doles suggestion 
dole appearing on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley vowed to fight this to the end 
john tower is the best suited man in america president bush 
has said so said dole and he has the right to make the 
nomination because he won the election 
the tower nomination has dominated politics in the nations 
capital since the senate armed services committee voted 119 against 
tower on feb 23 splitting on partisan lines with democrats in 
favor and republicans against 
controversy over the nomination threatens to undermine relations 
between the white house and congress at the outset of the bush 
administration 
democrats led by nunn have said they were troubled by reports 
of towers excessive drinking extramarital affairs and his ties to 
defense and aerospace contractors 
one democrat sen dennis deconcini of arizona said on cnntv 
that although many of the accusations against tower had proved to be 
untrue he decided to vote against the nomination because its 
risky to have someone with his background and the problems he has 
had in that office 
tower said that the real issue was politics not his personality 
senators are quite capable of changing their minds i think 
there is an imminent possibility that minds will be changed as this 
situation plays out and as the arguments against me appear to be 
more thin said tower who served 24 years in the senate 
including a 198184 stint as chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
tower discounted the results of a poll released sunday by the los 
angeles times that 44 percent thought the senate should reject 
tower 35 percent though he should be confirmed and 21 percent were 
unsure 
the survey taken of 1046 adults last wednesday and thursday 
was based on perceptions before tower advocates began their 
counterattack the nominee argued the poll had a margin of error of 
4 percentage points 
i think the debate is hurting the senate and will cast 
some doubt on the credibility of the senate because of the inherent 
hypocrisy involved in a lot of this tower said 
in an effort to turn the tide tower vowed a week ago sunday to 
abstain from alcoholic beverages if confirmed by the senate 
tower said he had told his second wife from whom he is now 
divorced that he would stop drinking hard liquor 
i did for the most part express my intent to her and 
since that time ive been essentially a wine drinker not a spirits 
drinker only occasionally drinking of spirits tower said 
drawing a distinction between distilled alcohol and wine and beer 
which have a lower alcoholic content per ounce 
i had never pledged to give up drinking absolutely said 
tower 
moreover tower drew a distinction between a promise to a spouse 
and a public pledge 
this pledge that im taking now i regard as having the 
same standing as my pledge to defend the constitution of the united 
states he said now if you say that everybody who has broken a 
marriage vow or a promise to his wife cant be trusted to take this 
oath to defend the constitution of the united states that he would 
treat that lightly and break it too then thats going to narrow 
considerably the number of people who are qualified to be in public 
life

an inmate on a day pass from a state 
prison beat his exwife to death with a shotgun while her neighbors 
watched authorities said she apparently was unaware that he was 
being temporarily released 
alan matheney 38 was arrested about two hours after the beating 
saturday and charged with murdering his exwife lisa marie bianco 
29 said cpl kevin lockhart of the mishawaka police department 
matheney who wa serving time in prison for assaulting bianco two 
years ago was being held sunday at the st joseph county jail in 
south bend 
prison officials said matheney was released saturday on his first 
pass since being sentenced to an eightyear term in nov 1987 for 
assaulting bianco the pass limited his travel to the indianapolis 
area 40 miles southwest of the correctional industrial complex in 
pendleton where he was being housed 
authorities said matheney instead traveled 120 miles north to 
mishawaka where police received reports saturday afternoon of a 
beating at his exwifes home 
there were several witnesses said lockhart its kind of 
the lowrent district so nobody probably wanted to get involved 
theres a lot of elderly people 
when officers arrived they found bianco lying in a yard police 
said she was bludgeoned to death with the butt of a rifle 
she was struck several times while standing and several times 
when she fell lockhart said the force of the beating broke the 
shotgun in half 
matheney was seen leaving in a vehicle and was apprehended 
unarmed about five or 10 miles away lockhart said 
charles miller superintendent of the prison complex where 
matheney was held and mishawaka police cpl rick hurley said that 
as far as they knew bianco was not notified her exhusband would be 
released for a day and that such notification was not required 
it is required only when a crime victim or other citizen makes a 
specific request to be notified before a inmate gets out of prison 
for good not just on a temporary pass officials said 
matheney was eligible for up to a 48hour pass correction 
officials granted the shorter pass to gradually expose him to 
freedom to ensure he could handle it miller said 
he said he had no idea if there would be any policy changes 
following the incident policy is something thats set by the 
department of correction not individual institutions he said 
police cpl eugene trippel said an autopsy on bianco was planned 
he had no information sunday on when she was married to matheney or 
whether the couple had children

seventeen palestinians were reported shot and 
wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied territories sunday 
as moslem fundamentalists declared a week of increased resistance to 
mark an islamic holiday 
palestinians erected barricades and burned tires in gaza city 
shouting god is great there is no god but one god and pelting 
israeli troops with rocks an arab reporter said 
youths burned an israeli flag and a threefoot wooden statue of 
an israeli soldier the reporter said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
hospital officials said 12 palestinians were shot and wounded in 
stonethrowing clashes in gaza city khan yunis rafah and the 
jabaliya refugee camp where the palestinian rebellion began nearly 
15 months ago all are in the occupied gaza strip 
the wounded included two boys from khan yunis aged 12 and 13 
who were shot in the stomach and a 12yearold from rafah hit in 
the shoulder the doctors said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
arab reports said a 50yearold palestinian was wounded in the 
leg in the west bank city of nablus and a 25yearold from nearby 
askar refugee camp was shot in the hand 
the army could not confirm the reports but said another 
palestinian was shot after he stabbed and lightly wounded an israeli 
soldier in the arm and that two other arabs were shot and wounded in 
a clash in ramallah 
in nablus the army maintained the 10th straight day of a curfew 
requiring the 120000 residents to remain in their homes 
troops also raided homes and forced hundreds of people to sit in 
the street while their homes were searched an arab reporter said 
adding that some area residents were hysterical 
the curfew followed the feb 24 death of an israeli paratrooper 
who was killed by a cement block dropped from a rooftop 
at least 388 palestinians and 17 israelis have been killed in the 
palestinian uprising against the 21year israeli rule of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the clashes came after the moslem hamas movement called for 
strikes to mark al israa wal meraj holiday which was sunday 
the holiday celebrates the prophet mohammeds journey to 
jerusalem during which moslems believe he ascended to heaven from 
the site marked by the dome of the rock in the walled old city 
hamas urged strikes tuesday thursday and friday challenging the 
proplo unified national leadership of the uprising which called 
for strikes monday wednesday and friday the hamas move announced 
in leaflets distributed sunday indicated a rift between the groups 
while the palestine liberation organization appears ready for 
accept separate arab and jewish states to end the middle east 
conflict moslem fundamentalists have declared they want an islamic 
state made up of israel and the occupied territories 
arab reports suggested hamas also was upset that plo chief yasser 
arafat reportedly gave the unites states information on radical 
palestinian groups in europe some of these such as ahmed jibrils 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command are 
known to have links with hamas palestinian reports said 
in jerusalem a government official said plo chief yasser arafat 
has proposed talks with prime minister yitzhak shamir and indicated 
a willingness to have un or multinational forces in the occupied 
lands if they became an indpendent palestinian state 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said arafat 
made the proposal in a meeting last month in tunisia with rep wayne 
owens dutah and that news of the meeting was part of routine 
reports on the 3monthold us dialogue with the plo 
several telephone calls to owens homes in utah and washington 
were not answered

tim mccord has logged more than 1 
million miles in the air in 17 years as an eastern airlines 
copilot and now hes walking his first picket line in sympathy 
with striking mechanics and ramp service workers 
at one time eastern was it it had the best people and the 
brightest future mccord said saturday night i dont think i 
have a future with eastern anymore i may have flown my last flight 
as an eastern pilot 
at the air line pilots association offices in the miami suburb of 
coral gables pilots say their decision to back the 2dayold 
machinists union strike could force the carrier into bankruptcy 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns owner texas air corp has 
predicted a widespread job action by the 3500 union pilots would 
drive the airline under 
we called his bluff said alpa spokesman jb stokes he 
thought hed get enough pilots to keep a quarter of the flights 
where are those pilots theyre on the picket lines 
stokes said fewer than 1 percent of the apla members 20 or 30 
pilots decided to fly he said replacing pilots may be near 
impossible since relatively few available pilots are licensed to 
operate commercial jetliners and alpa last year won a court order 
prohibiting texas air from training nonunion crews for strike 
contingencies 
i dont want to sound elitist but in time they can replace the 
machinists said stokes its a far more difficult task to find 
people to fly the aircraft 
stokes said he believes other airlines will quickly hire most of 
alpa members if they lose their jobs at eastern there is a 
nationwide shortage of airline pilots but some stay with eastern 
because they have built up seniority 
the unusual alliance between alpa and the 8500 machinists at 
eastern was prompted more by pilots dissatisfaction with management 
practices and promises than by unity with machinists who 
traditionally have had strained relations with the pilots union 
said stokes pilots did not participate in eastern strikes in 1958 
and 1966 
stokes and other pilots say their grievances center on 
managements pressures on flight crews since texas air acquired the 
60yearold airline in 1986 allegations include allowing planes to 
fly without making needed repairs or removing captains from flights 
for deciding to ground a plane deemed unsafe said stokes 
the alpa walkout was assured when a lastminute contract offered 
friday by lorenzo sought more than 64 million in wage concessions 
from pilots and did not include a jobprotection clause in the event 
of bankruptcy said stokes who claims alpa members have already 
given up nearly 500 million in salaries and benefits currently an 
eastern 727 captain earns about 90000 a year nearly 30 percent 
below the industry standard he said 
we had to figure out what was in the best interest of the 
pilots stokes said trying to keep eastern flying was not the 
answer 
it breaks my heart to walk the picket lines and see what has 
become of the airline i once loved said flight engineer bill 
hodgson who has worked for the airline for 18 years the second 
definition of trust is assured hope do i have assured hope i will 
fly again for eastern at this point i have to say no

they camped out in the hallway of their housing project ducking 
the bullets as soldiers battled with snipers in the mud and brick 
homes and rundown apartment complexes in the hills west of caracas 
i want my son back i dont agree with what theyve done 
said marina hernandez inside her apartment saturday after a week of 
nationwide unrest that left at least 246 people dead by government

is wait 
officials put the number of detentions at 1000 but news reports

fares part of a government austerity plan the violence began in 
caracas but spread quickly to other cities 
on tuesday the government imposed martial law across the 
country giving the military the right to detain anyone on sight it 
eliminated rights to access to a lawyer or contact with family 
members

theyre going to be in there for a good long while said 
jesus regalado a member of an intelligence police unit disip 
many arrests came from the winding streets of neighborhoods such 
as the hernandezs where chickens and babies run through dirt 
courtyards past graffiticovered walls 
thank god my other brother miguel wasnt here they were just 
taking anybody they could they took away good boys from this 
building said norma hernandez 22 sitting on a bed with her

the ratecutting ax that voters dropped 
on the auto insurance industry four months ago has produced a 
confusion of government hearings and legal counterattacks by 
insurers but no relief for consumers 
in fact millions of californians have seen their rates go up 
while voterapproved rate rollbacks remain frozen by the state 
supreme court pending review of legal challenges filed by insurers 
this week the state supreme court will begin considering whether 
to unleash proposition 103 the court is scheduled to hear arguments 
tuesday but has 90 days to rule 
the measure if upheld as constitutional would lower property 
and auto insurance rates by an immediate 20 percent below november 
1987 rates in california it would require an additional 20 percent 
cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers next november 
david fountain spokesman for the association of california 
insurance companies said the industry believes that the court 
ultimately will find that proposition 103 is unconstitutional and 
that it will overturn the complete initiative 
if so fountain predicted lawmakers would launch into a flurry 
of proposals to establish reasonable rates and cost controls 
with the guidance of the industry we have learned that you cannot 
ignore the voters 
insurers assessment of what will happen if the court upholds the 
measure hasnt changed much since preelection days when they 
predicted many companies would just pull out of the california 
market said fountain 
proposition 103 author harvey rosenfield said that if the measure 
is upheld the insurance market will remain calm if insurers 
cooperate 
if it is overturned well be back on the ballot with son of 
103 he said 
were glad the court is moving toward a decision he said 
its extremely important to decide quickly because we have all 
these insurance companies out there taking advantage of the stay by 
increasing rates at unconscionable levels 
drivers who expected their rates to go down following passage of 
the measure have had an unwelcome surprise 
for example the largest auto insurer in the state state farm 
said it is raising rates an average 96 percent this year because of 
underwriting losses not entirely offset by investment income the 
action has been challenged by the state 
in other cases drivers are just now paying as their policies 
come up for renewal rate increases that went into effect last year 
about 70 of some 400 companies selling auto insurance in california 
raised rates more than 10 percent in 1988 state officials say 
californias insurance war erupted as rates skyrocketed 
particularly in the cities insurers in part blamed trial attorneys 
for waging lengthy court battles in an attempt to win big 
settlements in turn attorneys said insurers were just seeking 
bigger profits 
californias legislature torn by the powerful lobbies of the 
insurers and lawyers was virtually paralyzed 
rosenfield a disciple of consumer advocate ralph nader led a 
citizen campaign that placed proposition 103 on the november ballot 
the insurance industry poured more than 60 million into the 
battle against the measure though outgunned financially the 
naderbacked measure won a slim victory with 51 percent of the vote 
consumer advocates in other states hailed the passage of 
proposition 103 as an indication that the issue already simmering 
in many areas could come to a boil elsewhere 
reacting to the lawsuits filed by the insurance industry the 
state supreme court suspended all provisions of proposition 103 
pending its review later it let all provisions but the rate 
rollbacks go into effect while it considered the measure 
despite the court suspension of proposition 103 provisions there 
has been no ceasefire in the insurance war 
state sen alan robbins chairman of the senate insurance 
committee has accused several insurance companies of violating the 
spirit of the proposition he joined other lawmakers in introducing 
bills designed to make insurers live under the spirit of proposition 
103 until all its provisions become effective 
after the state insurance department challenged a plan to refer 
new customers to a higherpriced subsidiary state farm which 
insures 28 million drivers in california announced it would boost 
its rates instead 
the insurance department has set hearings this month for both 
state farms earlier policyswitching plan and its subsequent 
ratehike proposal 
the department has prohibited 11 companies with smaller customer 
rosters from refusing to renew auto insurance policies after 
proposition 103 passed 
insurance commissioner roxani gillespie said the companies 
violated provisions of proposition 103 that restrict insurers 
authority to refuse to renew auto policies

a coalition of two dozen consumer advocacy 
groups medical associations insurance companies and trade 
associations on sunday outlined an ambitious agenda of safety and 
health proposals extending to regulation of bunk beds and garage 
door openers 
the coalition for consumer health and safety said in a report on 
its yearlong agenda project that injuries were the fourth leading 
cause of death in 1987 behind heart disease cancer and strokes 
and that when products broadly such as food cigarettes and 
alcohol are considered then they also play a part in nearly all 
of the 10 leading causes of death in the united states 
the statistical abstract of the united states says that accidents 
in 1983 killed about 92500 people out of slightly more than 2 
million deaths 
insurance companies and their customers must pay many costs of 
accidents the report said drug and alcohol abuse cost auto 
insurers 12 billion a year life insurers 4 billion and health 
insurers 27 billion 
the group made recommendations many of them familiar in seven 
areas motor vehicles home products food indoor air pollution 
cigarettes alcohol and aids 
among them 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the group called for all states to pass mandatory seat belt laws 
stronger auto side impact standards rearseat shoulder belts 
encouragement of fullwidth frontseat airbags and the extension of 
federal auto safety standards to the increasingly popular vans and 
utility vehicles which currently meet the less stringent truck 
standards it said antilock brakes should be required on trucks and 
strongly considered for cars 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
new powers were urged for the consumer product safety commission 
and the centers for disease control in specifics the coalition 
called for putting amusement parks under jurisdiction of the 
commission which now may regulate only traveling carnivals for 
congress to require development of a cigarette fire safety standard 
for development of childresistant disposable cigarette lighters 
for a ban on the sale of fireworks and for extension of requirements 
for smoke detectors and sprinkler systems 
garage door openers have killed 34 children since 1982 typically 
by pinning the child to the ground when the child activates the 
doorclosing mechanism and tries to get out of the garage before the 
door closes the group said it urged development of a standard 
requiring an automatic reversing mechanism that would prevent such 
accidents 
bunk beds killed 72 children between 1972 and 1987 often by 
entrapment and strangulation the coalition said in arguing for a 
mandatory standard to replace the current illobserved voluntary 
standard

about 5000 ukrainians on sunday marked the 
36th anniversary of dictator josef stalins death by forming a group 
to expose his crimes but they saved much of their energy for what 
they see as current repression 
our aim is to fight against modern stalinism villan 
ochakievsky a ukrainian activist freed from imprisonment in a 
mental hospital last summer told the crowd 
stalinism lives shouted volodimir solopenko he told the 
crowd four activists were arrested in this ukrainian capital 10 days 
ago for organizing a legal demonstration one of the four was beaten 
in jail and sent to a hospital where he has begun a hunger strike 
solopenko alleged 
more than 2000 people heard speakers express similar sentiments 
in moscow in a rally organized by memorial the parent group of the 
one founded sunday in kiev the moscow crowd huddling under a 
canopy in gorky park applauded vigorously when literary critic yuri 
koryakin linked politburo member yegor k ligachev to stalinism and 
demanded his resignation 
democracy yes stalinism no one banner at the moscow meeting 
read for a society without executioners and victims read 
another 
more than 100 groups nationwide are campaigning for construction 
of monuments to stalins victims but they also take up a wide range 
of issues 
the 5000 people gathered in front of kievs republic stadium 
formed the new group the meeting ended with adoption of resolutions 
calling for a national day of mourning for the victims of stalin and 
opening of secret police archives 
the group also demanded legalization of the ukrainian catholic 
church rehabilitation and compensation of dissidents and the 
release of ukrainian human rights activist anatoly ilchenko from 
imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital 
stalin who ruled from 1924 until his death on march 5 1953 has 
been blamed for the arrests killings or other repression of 40 
million soviets 
president mikhail s gorbachev resumed a campaign begun by 
premier nikita s khrushchev to clear the names of stalins victims 
and acknowledge the extent of the dictators crimes 
security agents did not interfere with the fourhour meeting 
kievs prosecutor vladimir i shevchenko made a reference at 
the rally to a mass grave at bykovnia a village outside kiev 
activists say as many as 300000 bodies were dumped in the mass 
grave three government commissions had blamed the nazis who 
occupied the village from 1941 to 1943 but villagers say the 
killers were stalins secret police 
shevchenko said investigators had found evidence that people 
buried at bykovnia disappeared in 193738 but he said officials 
still believe the site may also contain victims of the nazis 
another speaker alleged that sand and bones from another 
suspected mass grave of stalins victims at poltava in the ukraine 
are being processed into concrete for apartment buildings 
the deputy chief of the kiev communist party stanislav 
martinyuk won applause for joining the call to open government 
archives but the audience was less receptive when he said the party 
was a victim of stalin martinyuk said 94 of the 120 members of the 
ukrainian central committee of stalins time were repressed 
in answer to questions from the crowd shevchenko claimed to have 
no power to free the four activists arrested 10 days ago but 
promised to investigate and protest if the charge hooliganism 
proves false 
we have a soviet society of laws he said using a favorite 
phrase of reformers when the prosecutor said ukrainian officials 
already abide by the law some crowd members laughed

prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan said 
sunday that moslems should have ignored the satanic verses 
because controversy has brought the novel publicity but she also 
said the book should be banned 
a radical palestinian leader ahmed jibril vowed every effort to 
kill rushdie in defense of relgion god and his prophet 
iranian media hinted a compromise was possible in irans 
diplomatic standstill with britain over the book which some say 
insults islam 
ms bhutto speaking on the british broadcasting corp phonein 
show its your world said i do feel that the fundamentalists 
have spread rushdies blasphemy 
because what somebody writes that is not known who cares 
about that blasphemy perhaps it would have been more 
appropriate to ignore such a book to condemn it she said 
ms bhutto came to power three months ago she noted that the 
previous pakistani government had banned rushdies book but added 
i dont think it has so much to do with rushdie or the book but 
i think they just wanted a pretext to create a law and order 
situation and to create anarchy 
however she agreed that the book should be outlawed her country 
is one of at least nine that have banned the satanic verses 
i to think there are rare exceptions when the state has to 
intervene balancing the freedom of expression and balancing the 
security and the lives of the citizens ms bhutto said of the ban 
demonstrations against the book have killed 19 people in pakistan 
and india 
rushdie a british citizen who was born into a moslem family in 
india has been in hiding since feb 14 when irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini sentenced him to death 
in damascus syria jibril said his popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command will make every effort to 
carry out the death order 
although a staunch marxist jibril said rushdies book was a 
new conspiracy a desperate attempt to defame god and his 
prophet 
jibril a former syrian army capital leads about 1000 fighters 
based in syria and syriancontrolled provinces in neighboring 
lebanon jibrils statement was distributed to syrian news offices 
the tehran times irans main english publication suggested in 
an editorial sunday a change was possible in the deteriorating 
relations between britain and iran 
it referred to statements by british prime minister margaret 
thatcher and her foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe acknowledging 
the the satanic verses was insulting to moslems 
it may still be possible for a change to occur in view of the 
new attitude which the british leaders are beginning to adopt even 
though slowly and late the newspaper said in an editorial 
reported by irans official islamic republic news agency 
whether the changes in the air from the british side will be 
enough to satisfy the iranian government is yet to be seen the 
paper said 
in its own commentary however irna said the statements from 
mrs thatcher and howe are far from meeting the conditions set by 
the majlis parliament 
the withdrawal of all copies of the satanic verses and 
banning of its reprinting by the british government would certainly 
bring london closer to implentation of the iranian conditions the 
news service said 
the iranian parliament voted tuesday to break relations with 
britain unless britain within a week reversed its decision to 
withdraw diplomats from iran britain has protested khomeinis death 
call and demanded it be rescinded

the way state sen kay cornaby tells it 
the lastminute call from a mormon church official about a pending 
liquor bill was no more than a mild suggestion that the measure 
needed further study 
but that and similar calls to other state senators at the hectic 
finale of the 1989 legislature last month apparently doomed the 
bill prompting accusations of illegal interference and forcing the 
temperanceminded church to defend its right to speak out on what it 
views as moral issues 
the measure which easily won house approval and was pending in 
the senate would have formally legalized a decadesold practice of 
allowing adult passengers in limousines and charter buses to drink 
alcoholic beverages 
the request that i got was if it hit the senate to take a 
close look and evaluate what effect it might have said cornaby 
but rusty andersen owner of image limousines contends the calls 
amounted to an unconstitutional mingling of church and state and 
illegal contact by unregistered lobbyists 
hes threatened lawsuits on both issues 
senators are duly elected officials they are of the people and 
for the people he said this is a case of of the church and 
for the church 
that view prompted the utah chapter of the american civil 
liberties union to defend utahs predominant religion saying its 
representatives have a right to express opinions on legislative 
matters 
cornaby and several other republicans were called by richard p 
lindsay and bill evans of the churchs public communications 
department 
lindsay said friday that church officials had recommended to 
legislative leaders during a routine presession briefing that any 
measure involving liquor undergo detailed study 
the lastminute calls he said merely reiterated that position 
in an editorial wednesday the salt lake tribune labeled the 
calls an inappropriate end run of the statutory process for 
influencing legislation the newspaper said the church already had a 
registered lobbyist oscar mcconkie and that such contacts were 
within his province 
lindsay denied the calls constituted lobbying and said mcconkie 
was ill and unavailable at the time 
the utah lobbyist law holds that anyone who receives 
contributions or compensation for the purpose of attempting to 
influence the passage or defeat of any legislation must register 
with the state 
but associate chief deputy attorney general david thomas said 
last week that lindsay and evans were technically within the law 
because neither received additional compensation beyond their normal 
church salaries 
it is by no means the first time officials of the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints which strongly discourages use of 
alcohol tobacco coffee or tea have tendered opinions on liquor 
legislation 
indeed lawmakers frequently have sought the churchs opinion on 
proposed changes in utahs strict drinking laws 
this case involved a tradition in which limo and bus operators 
especially those running gambler specials to wendover nev 
have allowed patrons to take along beer or spirits 
the practice was halted last summer when the utah attorney 
generals office decided it violated a law banning open containers 
in motor vehicles 
the measure to legalize the practice was approved by a 5320 
house vote after supporters argued that it would keep drunken 
drivers off the road and that defeat would hurt tourism by 
bolstering outsiders beliefs that utah is an inhospitable place 
the bill had the support of the state department of public safety 
and gov norm bangerter a mormon 
the measure was never debated because senate president arnold 
christensen who also was called would not recognize the sponsor 
sen omar bunnell 
this is a bit of a tempest in a teapot i think said bunnell 
later i just think the church could have done a better job of 
it

prime minister sadek mahdi bowed to 
political and military pressure sunday and said he is forming a new 
government in hopes of ending the nearly 6yearold civil war 
mahdi made the announcement after signing a national peace 
declaration with other political leaders that endorses a tentative 
peace agreement with the rebel sudan peoples liberation army of 
john garang 
at a news conference mahdi also announced the fundamentalist 
national islamic front had expressed a willingness to join the new 
government it had refused to sign the peace declaration 
there was no immediate reaction from the rebels who are mainly 
christian and animist and are demanding political and economic 
reforms from the mainly moslem government 
the military had demanded mahdi sign the ceasefire agreement 
the armed forces did not say what they would do if mahdi did not 
sign but mahdi had threatened to resign unless the army promised 
not to overthrow him and union leaders pledged not to strike 
the announcment came on the deadline mahdi gave for his 
resignation 
earlier the middle east news agency in cairo quoted mahdi as 
saying he would stay in office because the military and the 
professional and trade unions had assured him of their support 
he said his cabinet ministers offered him their resignations and 
that the new broadbased government would be announced in the 
shortest time possible 
the new government will be formed with the aim of establishing 
the largest amount of unity on the internal front mahdi said 
he also promised a general election but did not say when it would 
be held the next scheduled election is in 1992 
he said the new government would concentrate on the quick 
support of the armed forces which in recent months have lost 
several towns to the rebels 
mahdi said the armed forces sent him a memo sunday supporting the 
constitution and the democratic process 
he said ongoing contacts were under way to organize a meeting 
to resolve the peace issue he did not elaborate 
on saturday night mahdi and 60 political and union leaders 
signed a program for the new government and the national peace 
declaration 
under the agreement the new government must endorse a tentative 
peace plan signed nov 16 between the rebels and the democratic 
unionist party the secondlargest party after mahdis umma party 
the peace plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and end to the 
state of emergency and a conference with all political parties and 
the rebels to negotiate a new government 
mahdis failure to endorse it prompted the democratic unionists 
to quit the coalition government in december mahdi then formed a 
new government with the islamic front which rejected peace talks 
because the rebels are mainly christian and animist 
the rebels have fought since 1983 and won several victories in 
recent months last month they captured torit the second largest 
garrison in the south

help you in reconstruction

300 billion to 500 billion

the military chief and head of the 
christian cabinet moved to reduce the power of private armies sunday 
by ordering a ban on foreign ships in ports run by militias 
gen michel aoun the commander of lebanons fragmented army 
said the order is an attempt to restore government authority eroded 
by 14 years of civil war said an official statement the ban takes 
effect monday it said 
acting prime minister salim hoss leader of the rival moslem 
cabinet warned aouns move could trigger new tensions because of 
unilateral decisions taken without prior coordination 
but hoss did not say whether his cabinet would seek to counter 
the generals order 
aoun reactivated a maritime office paralyzed since the civil war 
broke out in 1975 to supervise lebanons 160milelong 
mediterranean coastline and ordered the navy of four patrol boats to 
help enforce the ban 
moslem and christian militias have been running their own ports 
to get arms and supplies as well as all other imported goods for 
areas under their control 
that has robbed the state treasury of an estimated 100 million a 
year in customs levies 
the new order follows aouns february crackdown on the rightwing 
lebanese forces the christians main militia and his governments 
chief rival in the christian heartland north and northeast of beirut 
police said 82 people were killed and at least 200 wounded in a 
threeday confrontation between aouns 20000 predominantly 
christian troops and the 6000strong militia led by samir geagea 
aoun has driven the lebanese forces out of the socalled fifth 
basin of beiruts port which the militia operated and has taken 
over inland customs posts depriving the militia of income worth 
400000 a day 
he also ordered no taxes be paid to the lebanese forces in areas 
under army control stripping the militia of another 30 percent of 
its revenue 
aouns sunday announcement is aimed at closing down illegal ports 
run by other christian and moslem militias 
the generals forces may be able to enforce the shipping ban in 
militia ports in the christian sector but he probably will have 
more difficulty doing so in ports held by moslem militias south of 
beirut where his writ does not run 
his success against the lebanese forces has done much to restore 
government authority in the christian sector aoun has urged his 
moslem rivals to reassert state authority in territory they control 
and take similar action against moslem militias 
lebanon has had rival moslem and christian governments since 
sept 22 when outgoing president amin gemayel appointed aoun to 
head an interim military cabinet until parliament elected a new 
president 
moslems refused to accept aouns appointment they pledged 
loyalty to hoss who served as prime minister in the gemayel 
administration

the army called in reinforcements to 
tighten security in the troubled province of kosovo where a state 
of emergency has been in effect to quell ethnic tensions belgrade 
newspapers reported sunday 
the newspapers quoted maj gen andrija silic commander of the 
provincial capital of pristina military corps as saying that some 
military reservists in the area have been activated in the province 
emergency measures including a ban on mass gatherings and an 
increase of military and police strength were introduced in kosovo 
on feb 27 to prevent clashes between the ethnic albanian majority 
and the slav minority 
the measures came after protests by ethnic albanians against 
planned constitutional changes they fear will limit the autonomy of 
the region which administratively belongs to the republic of serbia 
serbian leaders claim tighter control over kosovo is necessary to 
protect the slavs in the region who allege constant persecution and 
harassment by the albanians majority 
ninety percent of kosovos 2 million population is ethnic 
albanian the province in southern yugoslavia borders albania 
armed force units have been placed in an increased state of 
combat readiness and part of military reservists have been 
mobilized in the province silic was quoted as saying by state 
media 
the high state of our combat readiness is our great 
contribution to the stabilization of the situation in kosovo and 
the best barrier against aggressive forces silic reportedly said 
national television saturday night showed several tanks and 
armored vehicles on training exercises or on patrol in the province 
about 20 leading ethnic albanian company directors or party 
officials including kosovos former communist party chief azem 
vlasi have been arrested in the province since thursday in a 
crackdown on ethnic albanian dissent 
most of them allegedly belonged to an illegal group that 
reportedly detailed plans to destabilize the province by strikes and 
protests and then carry out an armed uprising in which the region 
would secede from yugoslavia in order to join albania 
belgrade newspapers said sunday that 250 ethnic albanian shop 
owners who closed their stores last week to protest the planned 
changes of the constitution now face fines for violating working 
hours regulations

a snakevenom researcher bitten by a deadly 
viper rested comfortably sunday while doctors considered whether to 
treat him with antivenins from iran england and the soviet union a 
hospital spokesman said 
william e haast 78 remained in serious but stable condition at 
the university of utah health sciences center after being bitten on 
the left hand tuesday by a pakistani pit viper also known as a 
sawscaled viper said hospital spokesman john dwan 
mr haast is resting very comfortably eating and chatting with 
friends dwan said hes just in danger if you will 
haast director of the miami serpentarium laboratories at the 
universitys research park has been bitten 148 times by snakes and 
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles but he had no immunity 
to the vipers bite and checked himself into the hospital wednesday 
the sawscaled vipers venom attacks its victims ability to 
produce fibrinogen an element of blood that regulates coagulation 
a lack of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding 
dwan said the level of haasts fibrinogen had been improving 
slightly although it remained dangerously low sunday 
doctors were replacing haasts fibrinogen with transfusions and 
it appeared his system had begun to produce it again dwan said 
he said haasts blood was being analyzed every four hours and 
that by late saturday his fibrogen level was about onethird of 
normal on wednesday he said for all intents and purposes it 
was at zero 
haasts plight prompted an effort by stephen studdernt special 
assistant to president bush to coordinate the acquisition of 
antivenins from the three nations and expedite shipment to utah 
dwan said antivenins from iran and england had arrived but he 
did not know if the one from the soviet union had the antivenin 
from iran was more specifically made to counteract venom from the 
species of viper that bit haast he said 
however he said doctors were very leery about giving 
medication to someone from a source about which we know very little 
about 
antivenins are made from horse serum and can cause negative side 
effects such as lung and kidney problems he said 
we want to emphasize the fact that were grateful to everyone 
who went to such great lengths to get the antivenin dwan said 
the decision on whether to use them or not will be based on mr 
haasts condition hopefully we wont have to use them 
haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from californias 
san diego zoo and from a lab in los angeles but dwan said saturday 
he had not been given antivenins for about 24 hours 
he said doctors also had contacted scientists and physicans in 
europe across the united states and australia to discuss treatment 
its a special kind of snake with a special kind of poison 
and the immunology is complicated dwan said our physicians 
arent just winging it on their own 
studdert said the iranian government apparently did not interfere 
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations 
between the two nations iranian leader ayatolla khomeini has often 
called the united states the great satan 
the pakistani pit viper is one of 1000 exotic poisonous snakes 
haast keeps at the laboratory where their venom is extracted for 
sale to universities and health organizations for research and the 
manufacture of antivenins

operators of a rattlesnake rodeo rattled by 
criticism that they could be driving the eastern diamondback to 
extinction returned their catch to the wild sunday 
because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the twoday 
event no rattlesnake meat was on sale at opps 30th rattlesnake 
rodeo for the thousands of people who attended the meat had been 
one of the better drawing cards over the years 
in previous years most of the 150 to 300 snakes that were 
rounded up were either killed for their meat or sold to researchers 
or snake exhibitors 
weve been getting criticism for years from environmentalists 
animal rights groups and others about the way we did some things 
said jerry hartzog head snake handler for the opp jaycees they 
say we could be putting the eastern diamondback in danger of 
extinction or something so weve started working with them 
but the move brought criticism from residents who are upset at 
the prospect of the snakes being turned loose in their southern 
alabama community hartzog said 
i reckon some people think were going to just dump all of them 
in one place he added thats not the case at all were going 
to release the snakes back into the wild as close to where each was 
caught as possible 
others like veteran snake hunter jp jones think the snakes 
should be killed because they are a danger to hunters and others 
if they environmentalists could see a little child die from a 
rattlesnake bite like happened down here once theyd change their 
tune i think said jones the 68yearold founder of the 
rattlesnake roundup 
the snakes originally were caught to make the woods safer for 
hunters he said 
before this year the rodeo has raised more than 21000 for 
charity

congress needs to restore military aid to 
the rebels battling nicaraguras leftist government a congressman 
said sunday following a visit with 15000 contra troops in honduras 
congress should not only continue giving humanitarian aid to 
the contras who are fighting the communists but should also 
restore military funding rep gv montgomery dmiss said in a 
telephone interview from washington 
montgomery led a sixmember bipartisan house delegation that 
spent two days on the nicaraguranhondouran border last week meeting 
with the contras at their base camps 
congress has created a real problem by not approving more 
military aid to the freedom figthers montgomery said 
congress voted in february 1988 to cut off military aid but 
agreed to continue 27 million in humanitarian aid for food and 
medicine until april 
they are a fine fighting force but it is a whole new ball game 
for them now because of the lack of military aid montgomery said 
of the contras they just dont have the means to keep fighting 
the fight is at a standstill they lack ammunition to keep 
fighting something has got to be done he said their spirits 
are excellent and their numbers havent decreased in fact they 
are gaining more troops 
but in may when the food stops coming who knows what will 
happen 
montgomery said the delegation discussed options including 
bringing the contras to the united states or joining the honduran 
government in forcing them back into nicaragua to survive the best 
way they can 
he said the group agreed that the best option is to push for 
continuing humanitarian aid and to ask congress for new military aid 
we created the contras to overthrow the communists in 
nicaragua and i dont think we should walk away from that 
commitment montgomery said 
joining montgomery on the trip were reps bob stump rariz 
john paul hammerschmidt rark floyd harris dala earl hutto

president saddam hussein said sunday that 
iraq is ready to repatriate all of its iranian prisoners of war if 
tehran agrees to free the iraqis it holds baghdad radio reported 
the staterun radio quoted saddam as saying that the pow swap 
could be carried out independently of the stalled talks over ending 
the 8yearold persian gulf war 
baghdad radio quoted saddam as saying at a meeting with hans 
coshler president of the viennabased international progress 
organization a human rights group that iraq for humanitarian 
and legal reasons is fully ready to start a total exchange of 
prisoners with iran 
a comprehensive pow exchange would be a major breakthrough that 
could break the deadlock in implementing a un resolution that is 
the basis for the current ceasefire 
iran and iraq have been bickering since the peace talks began 
aug 25 over how to implement the ceasefire resolution which calls 
for each nation to withdraw to their prewar borders an exchange of 
prisoners of war and forming a special panel to assess blame for the 
war 
the two sides have released a few hundred ailing and disabled 
prisoners since the unsponsored ceasefire took effect aug 20 
but a full exchange has been held up because of the deadlock in 
the peace talks 
the international committee of the red cross has registered 
50812 prisoners held by iran and 19284 iranians in iraqi hands 
but un and other officials estimate the total number of pows to be 
about 100000 
iran which claims the iraqis still occupy border areas insists 
that a troop withdrawals to the prewar border should be the next 
step in the peace process 
but iraq maintains that iran must abandon its right to search 
iraqbound ships in international waters of the gulf for war cargo 
iran has not stopped any ships since the ceasefire took effect but 
reserves the right to do so

he added that morgan was hospitalized and obviously injured and 
in shock 
the safety of our signaling system does obviously depend on 
drivers stopping at red lights it did not stop pettitt said 
we have a system of multiple signaling where a driver gets an 
indication of a red light three sections back 
we have quite a lot of evidence that a severe brake application 
was made prior to the collision and long before the signal 
pettitt said 
he said the braking system of the littlehampton train was being 
examined 
british rails board has accepted responsibility for the 
accident pettitt said and any claims will be sympathetically 
dealt with as soon as possible 
it is right that we should say this to people because i am 
satisfied there has been nothing going on externally such as 
sabotage which might be involved in this accident 
crews worked through the night to repair the tracks and remove 
six coaches that rolled down a 60foot embankment after the crash 
many came to rest in the yards of homes 
area residents attended an evening service at christ church near 
the crash scene to remember the dead and to give thanks that so 
many survived 
prime minister margaret thatcher promised a full investigation 
into the crash the second serious accident on british rail in the 
last three months 
thirtyfive people were killed in december in a threetrain 
collision at clapham in south london that crash was blamed on 
malfunctioning signaling equipment but an inquiry is still going on

signatures

last few days we have had very intensive meetings he said 
we are in the middle he said i hope that in the second 
half of this week we will have a much more clear picture of what 
really can be achieved in this process

hungary and poland told secretary of state 
james a baker iii on sunday that the west should play a bigger role 
in encouraging reform in the soviet bloc us officials said 
also sunday the bush administration offered the plo the prospect 
of substantive talks but stressed displeasure with raids against 
israel 
clarification of the us stance seemed designed to assuage the 
plo which last week complained the united states is not involved in 
serious negotiations on setting up a middle east peace conference 
baker met the foreign ministers of the two soviet bloc nations 
after arriving in vienna to launch new eastwest arms negotiations 
this week and hold his first talks with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
hungarys foreign minister peter varkonyi and polands tadeusz 
olechowski told baker in separate meetings sunday about their recent 
political and economic reforms said us officials speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
there was a very strong general sense of an invitation for 
further involvement from the west a us official said 
neither side agreed on specifics but topics included improved 
us trade terms and less restrictions on importing western 
technology for hungary and restructuring of polands burgeoning 
foreign debt the officials said 
before meeting with varkonyi and olechowski baker spoke with 
austrian foreign minister alois mock who welcomed him at the vienna 
airport sunday morning 
on the palestine liberation organization a senior us official 
said there are no plans to end the talks that began in december 
after a 13year ban 
the real dialogue depends on the arabs and israelis staking 
out their positions first the official said speaking on condition 
he not be identified 
on monday baker meets the foreign ministers of spain greece and 
france the countries that have taken the lead within the 12nation 
european community to bring arabisraeli peace 
during a trip to europe three weeks ago baker was urged to seize 
on what the three governments see as a moderation in plo policy 
toward israel 
robert pelletreau the us ambassador to tunisia has had five 
meetings with the plo since december talks have been dominated by 
us criticism of raids by palestinian guerrillas on israeli 
positions in southern lebanon 
the talks were launched after plo chairman yasser arafat 
renounced terrorism and recognized israel 
on friday the state department publicly questioned arafats 
ability and willingness to control factions opposed to what it 
termed the positive evolution in his attitude on israel 
arafat and other plo officials have defended the plos right to 
attack israeli positions in southern lebanon saying attacks on 
military targets do not constitute terrorism 
a kuwaiti newspaper saturday quoted the plos information 
department chief yasser abdrabboo as saying the plo told 
washington it was time to resume a serious and indepth dialogue 
to prepare for an international conference 
bakers meeting with shevardnadze on tuesday is likely to produce 
an agreement for baker to visit moscow in late april on his first 
trip to the soviet union 
the bush administration is moving slowly on making a policy 
toward the soviet union it has not set a date to resume 
negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear weapons talks were 
suspended late last year and were supposed to resume in midfebruary 
eastwest talks in vienna this week involve two dialogues 
natowarsaw pact talks on reducing conventional arms and troops 
across europe and a bigger 35nation forum to increase trust 
between the blocs 
the nato alliance is pushing for sharp reductions to what it says 
is a warsaw pact edge of nearly 2to1 in tanks and artillery 
the threeday meeting that begins monday involving the 35 foreign 
ministers from the superpowers canada and european states will 
concentrate on enhancing european security 
thursdays talks involving the 23 warsaw pact and nato nations 
will focus on reducing trooops and nonnuclear weapons from the 
atlantic to the urals

sunday after an illegal buddhist parade erupted into a riot 
witnesses said and at least 11 were reported killed and more than 
100 injured 
hundreds of tibetans demanding freedom from chinese rule smashed 
windows looted shops restaurants and hotels and vandalized police 
cars in the capital of the disputed region the official xinhua news

xinhua said protesters began the shooting by firing on police 
foreign travelers in lhasa interviewed by telephone said they saw 
tibetans throwing stones and looting but saw no tibetans with 
weapons 
they said police used tear gas to try to break up the crowds 
before opening fire 
the violence came on the first anniversary of another 
antichinese demonstration in which 24 people were reported killed 
it also came five days before the 30th anniversary of a failed 
uprising against chinese rule that led to the exile of tibets 
spiritual leader the dalai lama 
xinhua reporting from the lhasa said early monday that one 
policeman and 10 other people were killed in the riots among the 
injured were 40 policemen and more than 60 rioters 
it said separatists fired at policemen and the police were 
forced to fire shots as no other means could stop the rioters 
the report said the disturbance began at noon when 13 buddhist 
monks and nuns began an illegal parade in the barkhor marketplace 
area of central lhasa it said they waved banners and shouted 
independence for tibet 
they were joined by several hundred people who began throwing 
stones at a police station in barkhor xinhua said 
about 3 pm 2 am est about 600 rioters emerged on east 
beijing street smashing windows robbing more than 20 restaurants 
hotels and shops 
xinhua said the rioters made four attacks on government and 
communist party office buildings smashed traffic control posts and 
lights and damaged more than 20 police vehicles 
a canadian tourist roch berphiaume 33 of quebec said police 
first used tear gas to try to disperse the crowds and fired into the 
air before aiming their weapons at the crowds 
berphiaume said that before seeking safety he saw groups of 
tibetan women and young men singing others threw rocks he said 
and ransacked chineseowned stores and restaurants he did not see 
tibetans with guns 
there was a lot of firing he said he said he saw security 
forces running with machine guns and rifles a stray bullet hit 
his third floor hotel window he said 
berphiaume said the firing stopped around 7 pm then resumed 
about 30 minutes later when rioting broke out again for about an 
hour 
no more shooting could be heard monday morning he said its 
pretty calm now 
there were no reports of foreigners injured in the clashes 
although one swedish tourist ceijo iskojaanta said several 
foreigners had had their cameras confiscated

banners but the protest quickly broke down into stonethrowing he 
estimated the crowd at about 1000 at its peak 
a japanese student yuichiro tanaka said he saw tibetans 
demonstrating in front of the government building across the street

at least 14 people died in rioting in september and october 1987 
the most recent violent protest occurred dec 10 when chinese

was canceled this year 
xinhua said there have been four illegal parades in lhasa since 
feb 13 on feb 22 several buddhist nuns were detained by police 
after staging a demonstration against chinese rule 
china claims tibet has been an integral part of it for seven 
centuries many tibetans say the communists usurped control when the 
red army moved into tibet in 1950 and call for independence under 
their former godking the dalai lama who now lives in exile in 
india 
the proindependence uprisings have been led by buddhist monks 
loyal to the dalai lama although china now claims to guarantee 
religious freedom in the remote mountain region devout buddhists in 
this former theocracy hold bitter memories of communist chinas past 
efforts to suppress their religion and destroy their places of 
worship

a roving band of women that uses sad stories to 
gain access to homes may be responsible for at least 180 robberies 
in which elderly montreal residents lost cash jewelry and other 
property police say 
police have named the marauding thieves the sobandrob gang 
because they use sob stories to get into homes they plan to rob 
one woman and two teenage girls carrying danish and swedish 
passports are being held in connection with the montreal robberies 
lt det daniel bissette was quoted by canadian press on sunday 
as saying detectives doubt the girls claims they are juveniles 
he was quoted by cp as saying this is first time this type of 
ploy has been used in the montreal area although he has heard 
similar cases reported in toronto and vancouver similar reports 
come from some us cities 
montreal police say at least 90 elderly people have been robbed 
by the female con artists and another 90 reported thefts but refused 
to file formal complaints cp said 
police in the united states say families of nomadic thieves are 
using political refugee status language barriers and aliases to 
avoid prosecution 
women often accompanied by teenage girls use a variety of 
pretexts such as asking for a glass of water or use of a toilet or 
telephone to gain entry into a home 
based in new york and chicago the gangs travel from city to city 
to prey on elderly homeowners once inside someone distracts the 
homeowner while the others quietly steal any valuables in sight 
officials said according to the news agency 
before moving on police say the thieves ship stolen cash 
jewelry furs and oriental rugs to their home base by courier or 
parcel post 
george sunderland manager of criminal justice services for the 
american association of retired persons says it often takes weeks 
before victims realize items are missing according to canadian 
press

the 18 billion merger agreement between time 
inc and warner communications inc will create the worlds largest 
media and entertainment empire but film industry executives are 
divided over its impact on independent filmmakers and the creative 
end of the business 
the deal announced saturday would result in the worlds largest 
publishing film and music conglomerate with estimated annual 
revenue of 10 billion the companies said 
the deal has raised some concern about the prospective union of a 
major movie studio warner bros with times home box office cable 
television subsidiary hbo has often relied on independent studios 
for its product 
in the short term as these corporations get larger and larger 
you wonder if theres going to be any room at all for independent 
product said ira deutschman a board member of the independent 
features project west which promotes the interests of smaller 
filmmakers but longer term theyll have to depend on the 
independents to fuel these big machines theyre building 
warners not suddenly going to make 60 movies a year just 
because they have more money and im sure hbo is going to keep 
making deals just the way they always did said alan ladd jr 
chairman of newly formed pathe entertainment inc 
the merger agreement is part of a series of consolidations under 
way for several years in the media and entertainment fields but 
executives doubted it would force other studios to join the trend 
is this going to put pressure on us to grow no larger is 
sometimes better and sometimes not said michael eisner chairman 
and chief executive officer of walt disney co 
the merger probably will not affect the number of studios able to 
mount a film project and will thus have little impact on producers 
writers actors and directors said james wiatt president of the 
international creative management talent agency 
you wont lose a player in this it just creates a remarkable 
empire he said

a federal judge sunday barred sympathy strikes by new yorkarea 
railroad workers and striking eastern airlines machinists pledged 
not to picket any rail lines easing fears of monday morning 
commuting disruptions nationwide 
us district judge robert patterson issued a temporary 
restraining order against three major rail lines that carry 320000 
commuters daily between new york city and new jersey long island 
and northern suburbs 
the threat of confrontations with rail workers and commuter 
snarls evaporated when the international association of machinists 
then said it would not picket any of the nations 12 commuter 
railroads or amtrak 
the iam will not set up picket lines at any rail carriers 
property at this time union vice president john peterpaul said 
we dont want any iam member or members of other unions to violate 
the courts order or put themselves in a position that could 
jeopardize their jobs 
but peterpaul he said the machinists will file an emergency 
appeal of the judges order monday 
when the court upholds our position we are prepared to 
establish appropriate picket lines he said 
secondary boycotts on air and rail travel are legal under the 
1926 national railway labor act but injunctions may be sought on the 
grounds the actions would widely disrupt public transportation 
service 
there should be no problems were not going to violate the 
order said ed yule general chairman of the united transportation 
union which represents conductors and train workers on the long 
island rail road and metronorth commuter railroad in new york 
the 41000member air line pilots association on sunday 
reiterated a pledge to begin a rulebook slowdown at 6 am tuesday 
that could delay every flight in the country 
we see major disruptions and major changes in the whole air 
system as a result of the eastern shutdown association president 
henry duffy said in washington 
the move by the machinists came after officials in major cities 
set up contingency plans to brace for possible secondary strikes 
in boston officials had readied 150 public and private buses in 
case of a sympathy strike that would affect service to 35000 
suburban commuters 
the massachusetts bay transit authority asked commuters to 
carpool stagger work hours and rely on the buses only as a last 
resort because they could not accommodate the full load 
amtrak which carries 33000 passengers daily in the 
bostonwashington corridor and 28000 elsewhere said it would add 
12 highspeed trains between washington and new york daily if no 
sympathy strikes occurred tohelp compensate for reduced service on 
easterns northeast shuttle 
in philadelphia a transport union official said members would 
obey an injunction against a sympathy strike in the city local 
police had been asked to enforce the order in case of pickets in 
philadelphia and its suburbs 
in baltimore a computerized telephone operator for marc the 
communter rail between baltimore and washington had warned callers 
of delays because of possible secondary strikes 
greyhound lines inc said 200 additional buses were on standby 
on the the eastern seaboard greyhound said it was planning special 
nonstop shuttle service between boston and new york new york and 
washington and philadelphia and washington 
the order signed by the federal judge in new york covers the 
lirr metronorth and new jersey transit it lasts until a hearing 
wednesday 
lirr spokesman al cannizzaro said we expect our employees to 
report to work so that we can provide normal service to our 
passengers

the new york post fired the latest salvo in the 
big apples fourway newspaper war trying to lure both the brainy 
and the brawny in a new sunday edition combining savvy with sports 
the tabloid which has a thirdplace circulation of about 
600000 pushed its eclectic new image with a frontpage article on 
george steinbrenner by literary journalist nora ephron 
if sophistication was not a draw there was dennis the menace and 
uncle arts funland in color the cartoons formerly ran in black 
and white on saturdays 
for those hooked on the weekday posts fare of politics and 
crime the front page headlined an exclusive in threeinch letters 
koch hit men booted on the secret deportation of two 
colombians believed to have been sent to kill mayor edward i koch 
and there were sports sports and more sports 
post president peter kalikow pushed the button that started the 
presses for the sunday edition of the nations oldest continuously 
published daily at 755 pm saturday 
the tuxedoclad kalikow uncorked a bottle of new york champagne 
and poured glasses for cheering pressmen in inkstained coveralls 
and paper hats later kalikow led them into the area where 575000 
sunday papers were bundled and packed off for delivery 
publisher peter price handed out free copies of the paper sunday 
to travelers arriving at la guardia airport 
a year ago kalikow a developer saved the 188yearold 
newspaper from extinction by buying it from media mogul rupert 
murdoch for 37 million murdoch threatened to close the 
moneylosing paper if he couldnt find a buyer 
the post now competes seven days a week for readers and 
advertisers with the daily news the new york times and the new york 
edition of newsday the long island daily 
the post is third in the city circulation race trailing the news 
1281706 and the times 1038829 and leading new york newsday 
176043 in the city and 706440 overall according to the audit 
bureau of circulations 
kalikow is trying to lure the more than 300000 people who read 
both the daily post and the new york times but who may not want to 
carry home the slicker sunday version of his paper said george 
lois who created an advertising campaign for the post 
the post which like many newspapers expects to obtain most of 
its advertising revenue from its sunday edition is fully booked 
with ads for the next four weeks said kalikow 
kalikow said he expects to spend 22 million to 25 million on 
the sunday post in the first year he said it would be months before 
he knows if the move has paid off 
many media analysts have said they are skeptical that the new 
york market can support a fourth sunday newspaper

the earths fragile ozone layer will continue to 
deteriorate until the end of the century even if all 
ozonedestroying chemicals are banned immediately an american 
expert said sunday 
sherry rowland one of the scientists who discovered the dangers 
of compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons said it would take 
centuries to repair the shield that filters the suns cancercausing 
ultraviolet rays 
even if we had a total ban tomorrow and there were no further 
emissions we would expect things to get worse until about the end 
of the century and then gradually recover over two centuries 
said rowland professor of atmospheric chemistry at the university 
of california at irvine 
rowlands comments came during a 120nation ozone conference that 
began sunday 
rowland told reporters many of the compounds already released in 
the atmosphere have not reached the stratosphere 1525 miles above 
the earth at that altitude they are broken apart and the liberated 
chlorine atoms destroy the ozone 
the compounds also trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to 
the greenhouse effect which could cause major climatic changes 
scientists say 
some of the compounds can last as long as 100 years they are 
widely used in aerosols refrigeration air conditioning and 
fastfood packaging 
chlorine levels in the atmosphere would not return to the levels 
of the 1960s until the 22nd or 23rd century rowland said 
robert watson of nasa agreed it will take many many decades 
possibly even several centuries to restore the ozone layer 
soviet delegate vladimir zhakarov said the timetable for 
eliminating cholorofluorocarbons should not be on the basis of 
emotions 
zhakarov also said soviet data indicated the ozone layer over 
parts of europe and the western soviet union had been depleted by up 
to 25 percent in winter but that it was partly due to natural 
causes 
this depletion occurs every 10 to 15 days he said it 
moves from west to east it coincides with the movement of cyclones 
during this time 
president daniel arap moi of kenya who opened the conference 
said all countries had an obligation to protect the atmosphere but 
that developing countries would need help from the industrial 
nations 
moi urged all countries that have not yet signed the 1987 
montreal protocol calling for the compound emissions to be halved 
by the year 2000 to join us in the endeavor to protect our 
planet 
britains environment secretary nicholas ridley told the 
conference six more countries austria hungary the malaysia the 
philippines trinidad and zambia agreed to join the 40 that have 
signed it 
some countries have gone further including the united states 
which plans to eliminate all chlorofluorocarbons and similar 
compounds known as halons by 1999 
the 12member european economic community agreed to a similar 
target last week and commissioner ripa di meana told the conference 
he hoped for a total european ban well before the end of the 
century 
william reilly head of the us environmental protection agency 
said whether that target is possible remains to be seen and 
depends largely on how soon alternatives can be developed 
archie dunham a vice president for the du pont chemical company 
said it hopes to begin selling chlorofluorocarbon alternatives by 
the mid1990s 
there is no single compound that has the complete range of 
properties offered by the chlorofluorocarbon it is targeted to 
replace dunham said all will represent a compromise whether 
it be in flammability toxicity energy efficiency suitability for 
existing equipment or performance in use 
reilly said he brought with him a letter from president bush to 
prime minister margaret thatcher saying the united states attaches 
the highest priority to the international environment 
mrs thatcher said countries which produce and use the compounds 
have a heavier responsibility than others to resolve the problem 
the united states is the leading producer of the compounds 
followed by western europe and japan 
in dhaka bangladesh president hussain muhammad ershad opened a 
conference on the greenhouse effect saying his country could suffer 
most from global warming because most of the population lives in 
floodprone regions 
rm stewart a canadian scientist presenting the conferences 
main report said recent research showed higher temperatures 
increase water vapor which could lead to heavier rainfall
