partisan disputes over jim wrights ethics and 
republican opposition to a key reform threaten president bushs plan 
to protect depositors from 100 billion in losses by failed savings 
and loans 
the debate is taking on a more political tinge as the full house 
prepares to deal with the bill next week 
house gop leaders threatened on thursday to blame the financial 
crisis the largest in the nation since the depression on 
influence peddling for sampls by the fallen house speaker and fellow 
democratic leader tony coelho both wright and coelho are leaving 
the house under fire on ethics issues 
democrats meanwhile began making an issue of gop house members 
opposition to the reforms that bush has requested the republicans 
are trying to weaken a key reform that bush says is needed to 
prevent a similar debacle in the future requiring sampl owners to 
put up more of their own money when making speculative loans 
bushs proposal calls for total spending and borrowing including 
interest over the next 30 years of 285 billion the money would 
guarantee that depositors will not lose any money because of risky 
and often fraudulent lending by sampl operators in recent years 
of that bailout total about 157 billion or 55 percent will 
come from taxpayers about 600 for every man woman and child in 
this country according to the general accounting office 
through four months of congressional action including senate 
passage of bushs proposal democrats and republicans studiously 
avoided blaming the other 
nobody wanted to point a finger because there would be three 
pointed right back at him said rep richard lehman dcalif a 
member of the house banking committee 
but there were several signs of fingerpointing thursday 
rep marcy kaptur dohio using a cartoon of bush as a prop on 
the house floor called his bailout proposal the biggest tax 
increase in recent memory 
the cartoon was captioned read my fslic and portrayed bush as 
talking out of both sides of his mouth in promising no new taxes 
while committing taxpayers to more than 150 billion in interest 
costs 
fslic stands for the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
the agency that insures depositors against losses up to 100000 
each it now has an estimated deficit of 55 billion that is growing 
by 10 million a day 
gop whip newt gingrich of georgia warned democrats to be very 
very cautious in trying to blame bush for the costs of the bailout 
he threatened to use next weeks debate to rehash charges in a 
report by the house ethics committee on wright dtexas and a book 
by wall street journal reporter brooks jackson on coelho dcalif 
i am prepared to go through all next week and say nothing about 
any of that he added but if theres going to be any bashing of 
george bush and the republican party i want democrats to understand 
we are fully prepared to talk about how the mess got so big and who 
was responsible 
more than onethird of the ethics committee report on wright was 
devoted to his intervention in 1986 and 1987 on behalf of now 
insolvent texas sampls that the fslic was trying to close 
jacksons book honest graft deals with how coelho raised 
money from sampl operators for democratic candidates in the 1986 and 
1988 elections while leading the fight against making the industry 
pay higher insurance premiums to cover the mounting losses 
wright stepped down tuesday as the houses speaker and announced 
he would give up his seat in congress by the end of the month rather 
than face a hearing before the ethics committee on charges unrelated 
to the sampl crisis 
coelho announced two weeks ago that he would resign june 15 from 
his seat and as whip the no 3 democratic office in the house 
after a 50000 loan from a california sampl to him for buying junk 
bonds was exposed 
according to government auditors more than 60 percent of the 
estimated 100 billion in sampl losses that the government is expected 
to have to cover stem from thrift banks in texas and california 
many house republicans are bucking bush by trying to weaken the 
key industry reform in his package making sampl operators put more 
of their own money at risk to prevent overly risky lending 
gop reps henry hyde of illinois james quillen of tennessee and 
tom ridge of pennsylvania are spearheading a movement to exempt 240 
to 750 of the nations 2949 thrifts from new capital standards that 
would require them to raise 6 billion by 1995 as a shield against 
the need for another taxpayer bailout 
so far it look like the republicans are more interested in 
weakening the presidents own bill and the democrats more interested 
in helping him said rep dennis eckart dohio if president 
bush wants a strong savings and loan bill then he very clearly is 
going to have to deliver republican votes to help make that a 
reality

president bush that old china hand summed up 
a large part of his frustration over the chaos in china i feel a 
certain sense of personal disappointment 
even his phone calls arent getting through these days 
bush us envoy to beijing in the mid1970s and proud of his 
knowledge of china repeatedly voiced feelings of hopelessness 
even despair as he fielded questions thursday night at his first 
primetime news conference 
in terms of trying to figure out their internal order it is 
extraordinarily difficult bush conceded 
when bush served in china for 16 months in the ford 
administration it was a lot easier to tell who was in and who was 
out of power 
wed send people out around town to count the red flag 
limousines and then theyd say oh theres 30 of them gathered 
here there must be an important meeting 
and everybody would hover around trying to see who emerged or 
who stood next to somebody on a parade on festival day 
things now are infinitely more complex bush conceded 
asked to clarify a remark suggesting that senior chinese leader 
deng xiaoping may not necessarily have been responsible for last 
weekends bloody military crackdown bush showed a trace of 
exasperation 
i was trying to say that i dont know and im trying to say 
that you dont know 
pointing around the east room to different reporters at random 
he added and he doesnt know and she doesnt know and nobody 
knows outside 
still bushs remarks thursday night showed he was staying the 
cautious course he outlined earlier despite the continued 
repression in china and in the face of calls by some conservatives 
in congress for sharper action 
bush said he was sticking by his decision to suspend arms sales 
to china and not to escalate the us response further by imposing 
trade or other economic sanctions 
i am one who lived in china i understand the importance of the 
relationship with the chinese people and with the government it is 
in the interest of the united states to have good relations he 
said 
bush who visited china four months ago and met with the 
countrys leaders in the first overseas trip of his presidency was 
asked whether he felt personally let down by the brutal events of 
the past week 
i feel a certain sense of personal disappointment he said 
he said the chinese government had violated internationally accepted 
norms of behavior armed people dont shoot down unarmed 
students 
he said the united states couldnt have totally normal 
relations again unless the government whichever government is 
running things recognizes the validity of the students 
aspirations 
and why given his good past relations with deng and other 
chinese leaders didnt he just pick up the phone and try to talk to 
them 
the answer was almost sheepish i tried today the line was 
busy i couldnt get through 
if bush was voicing frustration in deciding how to deal with the 
political situation in china he showed no such hesitation on the 
human rights issue 
after drawing criticism from some quarters when he failed to 
speak up for human rights during that february trip to china bush 
sounded a much stronger note on that score during thursdays news 
conference 
we have to speak out in favor of human rights we arent going 
to remake the world but we should stand for something and theres 
no question in the minds of these students that the united states is 
standing in their corners he said 
bush added that the united states must stand wherever in 
whatever country universally for human rights he also mentioned 
south africa declaring appalling apartheid must end 
the president also gave the human rights theme a personal 
dimension when he defended the us decision to harbor chinese 
dissident fang lizhi in the us embassy in beijing 
fang the outspoken astrophysicist who was barred by police from 
attending a barbecue thrown by bush in beijing in february wound up 
as the embassys uninvited but welcome house guest 
it is awful hard for the united states when a man presents 
himself a person who is a dissident and says that his life is 
threatened to turn him back bush said 
that isnt one of the premises upon which the united states was 
founded he added

when marie hartley whistles people cant help 
listening 
it was her piercing blast with right thumb and forefinger 
pinched in front of her teeth that won ms hartley a leading role 
in the national symphony orchestras current performances of sergei 
prokofievs ivan the terrible in the kennedy center concert hall 
it was at the first rehearsal of the music that prokofiev 
originally wrote for sergei eisensteins 1940s film classic that ms 
hartley an alto with the 180voice choral arts society of 
washington attracted the attention of conductor mstislav 
rostropovich 
the orchestra and singers had begun practicing the song of 
fyodor basmanov and the tsars men the rowdy chorus of drunken 
soldiers in a tavern courtyard when rostropovich tapped his baton 
and announced that he need a whistler 
a few male singers whistled unimpressively then i thought oh 
they need a whistler ms hartley said so i really let it go 
he stopped and said who did that i raised my hand and he said 
you youre the whistler 
later in the week another five singers had been judged loud 
enough to make up a chorus of whistlers but ms hartley remained 
the virtuoso 
her whistle is not for gently summoning the family dog its more 
appropriate for hailing a taxi three blocks away in rushhour 
traffic or overcoming the hellish racket at a rock concert 
the athletic ms hartley a 26yearold massage therapist 
special education teacher and champion frisbee player from suburban 
bethesda md is at a loss to remember how or why she began 
whistling so expertly 
i dont know she said ive always been able to do it 
it just came to her probably about the time she also taught herself 
to juggle softballs while waiting for the referees to show up for a 
high school game 
the other whistlers in the chorus practicing informally before a 
recent backstage rehearsal with the orchestra demonstrated that 
theres more than one way to split an eardrum 
while ms hartley whistles by forming a circle with thumb and 
forefinger on one hand freelance writer kandy stroud tucks an 
extended finger from each hand into her mouth just as she learned 
from a childhood chum on a backyard swing 
lawyer toni lebel uses a different technique to stop taxis on 
downtown streets she shoves four fingers into her mouth two from 
each hand but psychologist richard plies doesnt use any fingers 
he merely whistles with his lips and tongue which is the way he 
answered his fathers call to the dinner table as a boy 
ms hartleys championship womens frisbee team is called 
satori a zen buddhist term meaning enlightenment or in her 
liberal translation being at one with the frisbee 
thats the way i whistle she said im at one with my 
whistling

senate majority leader george mitchell says 
congress should set aside its concern about starting another public 
furor and consider gradually raising its salaries while phasing out 
speaking fees 
mitchell said the voter resentment toward congressional salary 
raises that derailed a 50 percent increase earlier this year 
complicates efforts to reform ethics on capitol hill but he said 
lawmakers must confront the issue anyway 
members of congress must find the proper balance between being 
responsive to the wishes of the electorate and applying ones best 
conscience and judgment as to what is best for the nation or the 
state as a whole he said 
we are caught in a vise between tremendous attention devoted to 
honoraria in the press and a public wholly disinterested in 
honoraria 
mitchells comments in an interview thursday echoed statements 
made earlier in the week by new house speaker tom foley dwash 
foley said he hopes the house will act before years end on a new 
ethics package and that the proposals probably will have to address 
the honoraria issue 
mitchell voiced interest in a bill introduced by sen 
christopher dodd dconn which would phase out speaking fees while 
gradually phasing in increases in lawmakers salaries 
several senators both democrat and republican have expressed 
to me that thats the only reasonable approach which some feel 
is the way out of a difficult situation he said 
members of the house and senate are paid 89500 a year although 
the top leaders make more than that both the house and senate by 
overwhelming margins defeated the proposed 50 percent pay raise 
early this year after a public outcry greeted the proposal 
we do have a problem we have to act we will act mitchell 
said he added that while skepticism about public officials is 
healthy a danger occurs when skepticism becomes cynicism and 
mistrust 
the senator said one option would be to gradually lower limits on 
speech fees known as honoraria while gradually increasing 
congressional salaries 
mitchell did not allude to the announced resignations of house 
speaker jim wright dtexas and democratic whip tony coelho of 
california some of the allegations against wright concerned rules 
on honoraria while coelho has been criticized for a private 
investment deal 
democratic and republican task forces in the senate are studying 
proposals for ethics reform he said 
mitchell said lawmakers cannot wait for a goahead from their 
constituents 
if prevailing public sentiment were the sole determining 
factor the pay of members of congress today would be exactly what 
it was 200 years ago he said 
mitchell said he would not set any arbitrary deadline for 
recommending ethics changes saying it is more important to find 
agreement on rules that provide more precise and definite 
standards for lawmakers he said a review also is needed of rules 
concerning acceptance of gifts a central issue in the ethics case 
against wright

the justice department says a senate committee 
is demanding some 200000 pages of documents on william lucas 
nominated to head the departments civil rights division 
it seems to me it would take years for the senate staff to 
review all this material justice department spokesman david 
runkel said thursday adding that the amount of paperwork requested 
was unusual 
however a source with the senate judiciary committee denied that 
the staff is seeking that many documents 
we have not asked for something broad but for something pretty 
narrow but apparently the way the records are kept theyre in a 
much broader category said the source who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity we might want perhaps 10 pages out of 100 
but theyll give us 100 
among the requested items are unpublished decisions in michigan 
state courts the source said adding the only way to get them is 
to have him lucas find them 
attorney general dick thornburgh questioned judiciary committee 
chairman joseph r biden jr ddel about the requests wednesday 
night when thornburgh spoke to the delaware state bar association 
he said something like theyre asking for a lot of stuff 
and he urged biden to schedule lucas confirmation hearings as soon 
as possible runkel said 
the committee source said the department has assured the 
committee that it will cooperate in providing documents and said 
biden has said repeatedly that he has no interest in delaying the 
hearing and hopes it can be held before the july 4 holiday 
runkel said the committee is seeking such things as employment 
records and court documents on cases that may have been filed in 
which he as a public official may have been a defendant 
lucas who is working for the justice department as a 284aday 
consultant while awaiting senate confirmation did not respond to 
phone calls seeking comment 
some civil rights groups have opposed his nomination saying he 
lacks legal experience particularly on civil rights on his senate 
questionnaire lucas said he has never tried a case in court since 
he entered private legal practice in detroit two years ago 
prior to private practice lucas had served as sheriff and chief 
executive of wayne county mich 
a black republican who ran unsuccessfully for michigan governor 
in 1986 lucas had been a lifelong democrat before joining the gop 
in 1985

a sailboat that sank here 
2400 years ago may be the first vessel ever found that was built by 
the phoenicians an ancient people famed for their sophisticated 
ships and mastery of the sea 
the craft about the size of a modern racing yacht sank about 75 
yards off this communal agricultural farm in northern israel 
archaeologists said 
among the items aboard the vessel were a master craftsmans 
toolbox with a drill a carpenters square a heartshaped jewelry 
box and a cooking pot still covered with soot they said 
jay rosloff the projects field director told reporters this 
week it was too soon to establish the vessels origin with certainty 
but he added if i had to put money on it id say it was 
phoenician 
during these times in this area phoenicians had a virtual 
franchise on shipping he said 
he said no phoenician shipwreck has previously been found 
the phoenicians were the most famous seafarers of the ancient 
world and dominated the mediterranean with their trade they emerged 
about 1000 bc and survived until roman times 
rosloff said another early boat a greek vessel was discovered 
off the turkishcypriot port of kyrenia although it was built 150 
year later than the sailboat found here it was not as sophisticated 
the shipwright who built the vessel used iron instead of copper 
nails common in greek vessels and employed an elaborate technique 
called scarfing in which wooden pieces are fitted together 
this craft has so many quirks that are different from the 
greek vessel that it indicates a different cultural milieu said 
rosloff as he stood on the beach next to an actualsize outline of 
the hull built with sandbags 
the vessel is 10 yards long three yards wide and about two yards 
high from keel to deck most of the hull has been preserved but the 
masts sails and cabin have been lost 
the boat was built around 450 bc and was in its first season 
possibly on its maiden voyage when it sank said elisha linder who 
heads the project run by haifa universitys center for maritime 
studies he said the hull showed little wear 
he speculated that the sailors got too close to shore than was 
safe because they were hiding from pirates or seeking shelter from a 
storm a large chunk is missing from the hull indicating the boat 
sank after hitting a rock or reef 
for 2400 years the vessel was covered by sand and hidden from 
view but in 1985 currents briefly washed away some of the sand 
and kibbutz member avi eshel caught a glimpse of pottery scraps and 
ballast stones while diving with his daughter 
linder had just completed his fifth fruitless summer hunting for 
phoenician shipwrecks in italy when he got word about the find in 
magan michael where he lives 
it was like a present said linder but he cautioned that 
more evidence such as a seal or coins was needed to conclusively 
link the vessel to the phoenicians 
since the dig began last year divers have brought up small 
pieces of the wreck which is under about two yards of water on 
land the pieces are treated with chemicals and the parts will 
eventually be reassembled rosloff said 
through model work and graphics we will extrapolate the rest 
of the boat said rosloff a lecturer at haifa university and 
originally came from kendall park nj 
the delicate excavation work is limited to just a few weeks a 
year because of a heavy surf and strong currents that keep covering 
the wreck with sand 
even if the vessel turns out not to be phoenician the wreck will 
reveal many details about ancient seafarers said rosloff 
the hull is the oldest and most complete to be discovered and may 
reveal clues about ancient shipbuilding techniques 
the wood that is left is in beautiful condition because the 
sand covered it so quickly rosloff said 
we dont know how ancient boats were built added linder 
we will learn a lot from this

a system used by federal agencies significantly 
underestimates the number of americans with aids and distorts the 
proportion of whites and minorities who have the disease a 
university of chicago study concludes 
in a study published today in the journal science a survey 
conducted by the national opinion research center at the university 
of chicago says estimates by the federal centers for disease control 
do not accurately reflect racial distribution of aids nor the true 
extent of the epidemic in the midwest 
edward o laumann of the university of chicago said the 
distortion occurs because affluent whites can afford to be treated 
discreetly by physicians who do not officially report the disease 
also he said some data collection agencies are slow to compile 
reports and misfile others 
the cdc makes its estimate based on cases reported to official 
agencies an undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously 
affect the cdc estimate laumann said in a telephone interview on 
thursday 
we are contending that there is an undercount but we dont 
know the scale of it said laumann who coauthored the report in 
science we can estimate the demographic composition but not the 
gross numbers themselves the reason were being cautious is that 
this is too small a sample 
to gather data for the study laumann and his associates 
conducted interviews with members of 1481 households around the 
country the households were selected to reflect a crosssection of 
the population 
respondents were asked if they knew an acquaintance who had aids 
to validate the accuracy of the answers the respondents also were 
asked if they had an acquaintance who had been murdered 
using earlier studies on the number of people likely to have 
known a murder victim the researchers concluded that answers to the 
homicide question were statistically accurate this suggested that 
answers to the aids question would be equally accurate 
the results of the aids question suggest that the white 
proportion of aids cases is substantially higher than cdc reports 
and that a substantially greater share of the cases is in the 
midwestern region 
according to cdc figures from march 7 whites account for about 
60 percent of the nations aids cases the university of chicago 
study put the number at 72 percent 
the cdc said 26 percent of all victims so far are black and 14 
percent are hispanic the chicago results put these totals at 18 
percent for blacks and 6 percent for hispanics 
cases in the midwest according to the cdc make up only 8 
percent of the national total the chicago study said midwest cases 
actually comprise 20 percent of the national total 
the comparative figures for other regions 
east cdc 39 percent of the national total chicago 19 percent 
south cdc 26 percent chicago 25 percent 
west cdc 27 percent chicago 36 percent 
laumann said logic alone suggested something was wrong with 
the cdc figures for the midwest chicago he said has all of the 
aids risk factors such as a population of injection drug users 
and yet the city was said to have only 31 cases of aids per 10000 
residents compared to a national total of 37 cases per 10000 
also he said according to the cdc figures colorado at the 
time of the 1988 survey had an absolute number of aids cases that 
was equal to or even exceeded that of michigan and colorado has 38 
percent of the population of michigan laumann said michigan also 
has big cities where the aids risk factors are common 
that just doesnt make sense he said 
laumann submitted the chicago study to officials at the cdc for 
comment and he said these results dont surprise them 
they know that sexually transmitted diseases are generally 
undercounted for the white population because people go to personal 
physicians and one of the things they are doing is buying some 
discretion about it he said 
he said cases were undercounted in the midwest because of a 
flawed system of data collection by official agencies 
gayle lloyd a spokewoman for the centers for disease control in 
atlanta said no officials were available to comment on the new 
study attempts to reach cdc officials at an aids conference in 
montreal were not successful 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease 
caused by a virus that is spread most frequently by sexual 
intercourse or by the sharing of needles among intravenous drug 
users 
through april the cdc reported that aids had been diagnosed in 
94280 americans of whom more than half or 53544 had died no 
one is known to have recovered from aids 
science which reported the chicago study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

the justice department already planning to 
give 20000 apiece to about 60000 japaneseamericans as reparation 
for their world war ii internment wants to add their nonjapanese 
family members to the list of recipients 
the nonjapanese spouses or parents who went to internment camps 
to be with their families were not included in the civil liberties 
act of 1988 that authorized the reparations so the justice 
department has begun work on new legislation that would allow 
payments to them 
there were approximately 80 such nonjapanese interned the 
department estimates 40 are still alive 
in reality these nonjapanese spouses and parents were 
confronted by a horrifying choice the department said thursday in 
its proposed regulations for distribution of money to the 60000 
japaneseamericans 
they could either elect to accompany their spouses or 
children throughout the removal and internment process or choose to 
be separated from them the regulations said 
about 120000 american citizens and permanent resident aliens of 
japanese ancestry were affected by the evacuations from the west 
coast the department said only about 60000 people are eligible for 
the payments that will cost a total of about 125 billion congress 
has not yet appropriated funds 
the oldest survivors must be paid first 
under the law payments go to those confined held in custody 
relocated or otherwise deprived of liberty or property from dec 
7 1941 to june 30 1946 because of us actions based on their 
japanese ancestry 
to be eligible said robert bratt of the departments office of 
redress administration you had to be living when thenpresident 
reagan signed the law aug 10 1988 
but people are dying at a rate of about 200 people per month 
if your parent died after aug 10 1988 then youre eligible as a 
survivor said bratt 
the first recipient would be the surviving spouse followed by 
children and parents if there are any he said adding that the 
department is responsible for dividing the 20000 equally among 
several children 
each member of a family evacuated and interned will be 
compensated so a family of four still surviving would receive 
80000 bratt said 
compensation also will go to japaneseamerican soldiers who lost 
property or were unable to visit with their interned families 
according to the proposed regulations 
groups not entitled to compensation the regulations say include 
those who evacuated voluntarily and those who relocated to japan 
during the war in addition minors who were us citizens but who 
moved to japan with their parents during the war will not receive 
payments 
the proposed regulations to be published in the federal 
register will be open for 30 days of public comment the department 
would not say when it expects final regulations to be issued

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
proposes to increase access to the national driving register to help 
the coast guard weed out drunken mariners 
faced with ships captains pilots and other operators of 
critical transportation vehicles who couldnt qualify for a motor 
vehicle drivers license skinner sent a bill to congress on 
thursday to screen out unfit mariners 
the measure would add to laws that already allow access to the 
driving register in the aviation rail truck and bus industries 
skinner cited the history of drunken driving violations by the 
exxon valdez captain who has been charged in the spill of 11 million 
gallons of crude oil into alaskas prince william sound 
the captain joseph hazelwood tested positive for alcohol use 
after the march 24 oil spill and authorities found he had twice 
been convicted of drunken driving in recent years and his new york 
drivers license had been revoked three times he had turned over 
the helm of the ship to his third mate who was not licensed to 
negotiate the sound when the vessel ran aground 
hazelwood is charged in alaska with operating the vessel while 
intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of 
pollution into the water all misdemeanors 
we cannot allow the safety of the traveling public or the 
quality of our environment to be jeopardized by persons in 
safetycritical jobs who are drug or alcohol abusers skinner said 
in sending the legislation to congress 
the bill would allow the coast guard to examine the driving 
records of men and women who are in the merchant marines or applying 
for positions on merchant vessels 
the proposed bill reflects a careful balancing of the privacy 
rights of employees with the important public safety need to screen

the national register has been kept since 1960 to help states 
exchange information about drivers with poor records it includes 
information about drivers whose licenses have been revoked or 
suspended for drunken driving or other traffic law violations 
a 1982 law which skinner wants to expand allows truck bus and 
other motor vehicle companies to request driving records of 
individual employees or applicants but limits access to the previous 
three years 
congress in 1987 and 1988 extended access to the register for 
employees in the aviation and rail industries the federal aviation 
administration has drawn up regulations that would permit it to 
suspend or revoke pilot certificates based on records of driving 
motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol or drugs

president bush says his administration wants to 
improve relations with iran but awaits help from tehran in freeing 
american hostages held in lebanon 
i stated the other day what it would take to have improved 
relationships and that would a renunciation of terror bush said 
thursday night at a news conference repeating a statement he made 
shortly after the death of iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
the united states he said wants a change in relations 
we like the iranian people bush said but we cant have 
normalized relations with a state that is branded a terrorist state 
and secondly they must facilitate the release of american 
hostages that is what it would take 
the president noted that the speaker of the iranian parliament 
hashemi rafsanjani has said iran would use its influence to help 
free nine american hostages held by proiranian shiite lebanese if 
the united states helped free shiites taken by christian militiamen 
in beirut the iranians made a similar proposal previously 
secretary of state james a baker iii said earlier in the day 
that he was not impressed by rafsanjanis offer he said the united 
states provided information on the iranian hostages to iran in 1982 
bush said an improvement in relations is going to take a change 
in behavior 
i dont see so far any sign of change he said adding that 
he had held out the olive branch in his inaugural speech on jan 
20 
his message to iranian leaders then as now was you want 
better relations do whats right do whats right by people who are

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference thursday night 
bush welcome to the east room please be seated and we shall 
proceed 
helen 
q mr president cutting off military sales to china does not 
seem to have made an impression on the rulers there and theyve 
become more repressive what else are you going to do to express 
this nations outrage and do you have any other plans 
a helen i think that the position we took aiming not at the 
chinese people but at the military arrangements was wellreceived 
around the world and was followed by many countries right after we 
did that 
many of the european countries followed suit 
the events in china are such that we obviously deplore the 
violence and the loss of life urge restoration of order with 
recognition of the rights of the people 
and im still hopeful that china will come together respecting 
the urge for democracy on the part of the people 
and what we will do in the future i will announce at appropriate 
times 
but right now we are engaged in diplomatic efforts and other 
countries are doing the same thing 
and lets hope that it does have an ameliorating effect on the 
situation 
q does your support of human rights and democracy extend to 
other places in the world like south africa the west bank where 
theyve been fighting a lot longer than in china 
a yes it does 
q against repression 
a it certainly does 
the concern is universal 
and thats what i want the chinese leaders to understand 
you see weve taken this action 
i am one who lived in china

i understand the importance of the relationship with the chinese 
people and with the government 
it is in the interest of the united states to have good 
relations but because of what you the question that you properly 
raised we have to speak out in favor of human rights 
and we arent going to remake the world but we should stand for 
something 
and theres no question in the minds of these students that the 
united states is standing in their corners 
ill tell you a little anecdote 
when our cars went out to the university to pick up some of the 
students and bring them out they were met by universal applause 
and then the students in this country have been quite supportive 
of the steps that i have taken 
we had a few into the oval office the other day and i must say 
my heart goes out to them 
they cant they cannot talk to their families 
and its very difficult 
but yes the united states must stand wherever in whatever 
country universally for human rights 
and let me say you mentioned south africa absolutely abhor 
you know appalling apartheid must end 
yeah terry 
q mr president can the united states ever have normal 
relations with china as long as the hardliners believed responsible 
for the massacre such as deng xiaoping and premier li peng remain 
in power in other words what will it take to get uschinese 
relations back to normal 
a it will take a recognition of the rights of individuals and 
respect for the rights of those who disagree 
and you have cited two leaders one of whom i might tell you is 
since you mentioned deng xiaoping im not sure the american people 
know this 
he was thrown out in a by the cultural revolution crowd back in 
the late 60s came back in 1976 was put out again because he was 
seen as too forwardlooking 
and all im saying from that experience is lets not jump to 
conclusions as to how individual leaders in china feel when we 
arent sure of that 
but the broad question that you asked we cant have totally 
normal relations unless theres a recognition that the of the 
validity of the students aspirations and i think that that will 
happen 
we had a visit right here upstairs in the white house with mr 
wan li 
now i dont know whether hes in or out but he said something 
to me that i think the american people would be interested in 
he said the army loves the people

and then youve seen soldiers from the 27th army coming in from 
outside of beijing and clearly shooting people 
but i dont think and having said that i dont think we ought 
to judge the whole peoples liberation army of china by that 
terrible incident 
and so lets what i want to do is preserve this relationship 
as best i can and i hope the conditions that lie ahead will permit 
me to preserve this relationship 
i dont want to pass judgment on individual leaders but i want 
to make very clear to those leaders and to the rest of the world 
that the united states denounces the kind of brutality that all of 
us have seen on our television 
right here brit 
q mr president i want to ask you about the nowinfamous 
memorandum that the republican national committee distributed 
concerning speaker foley first do you think its credible that 
this memorandum which you called disgusting was not known 
about by anybody above the level of the staffer who wrote it and 
second do you think its enough sir for this staffer to resign 
and for everyone then to simply say that the matter is closed 
a well in the first place i have great respect for tom foley 
and hes the one that says the matter should be closed and hes 
right 
and let me just repeat it was disgusting 
and i hope its against everything that i have tried to stand 
for in political life 
but i discussed that matter with lee atwater 
he looked me right in the eye and said he did not know about it 
he moved promptly to to remove the person that did know about 
it 
and so i accept that 
but i think that speaker foley a most honorable man who 
obviously was done a terrible illservice to by this is correct 
when he says lets get it behind us 
and id like to shift the shift the gears and move into ethics 
legislation all the time being sure we try to avoid this kind of 
ugliness on either side 
just a followup question 
q just to follow up speaker foley has indicated that hed like 
to change the atmosphere which has been somewhat poisonous on 
capitol hill this year some democrats have said that you as the 
leader of your party here in town should do something to try to get 
the republicans to join in that effort what do you say to that 
call sir 
a i dont think the atmosphere is caused by one party or another 
i expressed the same kind of outrage about that ive just 
expressed about speaker foley about john tower

i think any fairminded person no matter how the situation 
worked out but you know and i know that he was vilified by rumor 
and innuendo 
vilified and i dont like it there 
and i didnt like this what happened to mr foley and yes 
brit i hope i can find a way to elevate it and keep it on the 
issues and this you know im a realist ive been around this 
track for a long time but weve got to do better 
the ugliness of this climate is bad 
and i dont like it and id like to think that i could help 
maybe this itself will help 
well work right across here 
q yes mr president id like to return to china for a moment 
you mentioned that your goal is to preserve our relationship with 
the chinese government but what do you say to the american people 
who might wonder why we are not more forceful in being the worlds 
leading advocate of democracy and are we not living up to that 
responsibility in this situation 
a well some have suggested for example to show our 
forcefulness that i bring the american ambassador back 
i disagree with that 180 degrees 
and weve seen in the last few days a very good reason to have 
him there 
in fact one of your colleagues richard roth of cbs was 
released partially because of the work of our embassy of jim 
lilley our very able ambassador 
some have suggested well youve got to go full sanctions on 
economic side 
i dont want to cut off grain and weve just sold grain to the 
peoples republic of china 
i think that would be counterproductive and would hurt the people 
what i do want to do is take whatever steps are most likely to 
demonstrate the concern that america feels and i think ive done 
that and ill be looking for other ways to do it if we possibly 
can 
yes 
q mr president chinese dissident fang lizhi has taken refuge 
in the us embassy apparently fearing for his own safety the 
chinese government has called that a wanton interference in internal 
affairs and a violation of international law what is your reaction 
to that and will the united states grant fang political asylum in 
the united states 
a first let me remind the audience here that we do not discuss 
asylum 
its almost like a public discussion of intelligence matters 
but in terms of your question we have acted in compliance with 
the international law as an extraordinary measure for humanitarian 
reasons 
his personal safety was involved here he felt 
andthen we try historically to work these things out in 
consultation with the sovereign state 
so we are not violating international law in the opinion of our 
attorneys and its awful hard it is awful hard for the united 
states when a man presents himself a person who is a dissident and 
says that his life is threatened to turn turn him back 
and that isnt one of the premises upon which the united states 
was founded 
so we have a difference with them on that youre right

but i hope it can be resolved 
yeah 
q mr president this week the supreme court reversed an 18year 
standard for fair employment decisions now under the old standard 
employers had to justify as legitimate practices that excluded women 
and minorities the courts decision now puts the burden of proof on 
plaintiffs to show that the practices theyre challenging are not 
legitimate civil rights advocates say that the decision makes it 
much more difficult for women and minorities to challenge practices 
that exclude them do you support efforts to restore the old 
standard 
a i have not yet received the memo from the general counsel on 
this decision and thus i really have to defer 
i wish i could tell you 
but i am one who when a civil when the supreme court makes a 
ruling figures that the president of the united states must adhere 
by the law as determined 
but were getting that analyzed 
and then sometimes you can take remedy in suggested legislation 
right there in the middle 
q mr president the iranian government of course has changed 
and the question to you is is there hope that there might be 
restored some kind of relations with that country as you know 
today the iranians set forth informally an offer for some kind of a 
deal that if the americans would help free some iranians held by the 
phalangists that they might help us free some of our prisoners as 
well or our hostages is there any hope for any change in the near 
future 
a for a change in relationship 
i stated the other day what it would take to have improved 
relationships and that would be a renunciation of terror 
we do not need we cant have normalized relations with a state 
thats branded a terrorist state 
and secondly they must facilitate the release of american 
hostages 
and so that was is what it would take 
and there was a case a while back on where iran asked for 
information regarding their hostages never accused us properly so 
of holding people hostage or in any way condoning that 
we condemn it 
and so and weve supplied them information 
but its going to take a change in behavior 
we dont mind namecalling 
they keep calling us the great satan that doesnt bother us 
sticks and stones remember the old adage will hurt your 
bones and names dont hurt you 
but performance is what were looking for 
and i dont see so far any sign of change 
i held out the olive branch at the my speech inauguration 
speech and i said look we want better relations with iran 
i remember when we had good relations 
we like the iranian people 
we have a lot of iranians living in this country 
but we cant and i said look you want better relations do 
whats right do whats right by people that are held against their 
will 
and we see no movement 
i would repeat that offer tonight 
yeah 
q mr president the other day you picked up the phone and 
talked to richard nixon about china im wondering since you know 
some of the chinese leaders personally why you dont pick up the 
phone and talk to them 
a i tried today 
isnt that a coincidence that youd ask that question laughter 
q and what did you learn 
a the line was busy laughter 
i couldnt get through 
theyre out 
q mr president 
a oh yeah you get a followup go ahead 
q well im wondering if you learned anything from those phone 
calls about whos really running china 
a no because i couldnt get through 
and i talked to our ambassador knowing that wed get some 
understandably get questions on china tonight and the situation is 
still very very murky 
and thats the way its been 
i remember johanna i remember being in china when the way wed 
tell who was winning and who was losing who was up and who was 
down wed send people out around town to count the redflagged 
limousines 
and then theyd say oh theres 30 of them gathered here 
there must be an important meeting 
and everybodyd hover around trying to see who emerged or who 
stood next to somebody on a parade on festival day 
and its opened up much more than that 
there have been dramatic changes since then

but in terms of our trying to figure out their internal order it 
is extraordinarily difficult 
and i did try to contact a chinese leader today and it didnt 
work 
but im going to keep on trying 
i want them to know that i view this relationship as important 
and yet i view the life of every single student as important 
david 
q mr president during the 1988 campaign the republicans ran 
ads featuring chuck yeager saying that thousands of defense jobs 
would be lost with the election of michael dukakis yet your 
defense budget would cut several thousand jobs in your home state of 
texas including the elimination of the v22 osprey is there an 
inconsistency or conflict with your campaign 
a none whatsoever none whatsoever 
do you want to follow up laughter 
q yes sir 
a go ahead 
q is there any is there any hope for revitalizing those 
programs that are going to be cut 
a well not programs that the secretary of defense in 
consultation with the white house had felt were less than priority 
and you know when you go to assign priorities it isnt easy 
and we had a program on to facilitate a way to close bases and 
lo and behold everybody in whose district there was no base thought 
it was a wonderful idea 
and everybody in whose district there was a base or whose state 
felt well we ought to fine tune this one they dont seem to 
understand 
it is hard to do this dave 
and i know theres some people who are thrown out of work 
but our defense budget is in my view ample for the national 
security needs of this country 
but the defense secretary has had to make certain tough calls on 
systems and yes some people have been thrown out of work 
but if this economy keeps moving i expect theyll find work 
because we do have a strong level of defense spending 
charle 
and then well these three across here 
q earlier sir you made reference to deng xiaoping suggesting 
that he may if i read you right not necessarily have been 
responsible for the actions you said that he was a reformer twice 
out back in what were you trying to say do you have information 
that 
a i was trying to say that i dont know 
and im trying to say you dont know and he doesnt know and 
she doesnt know and nobody knows outside and thats the way the 
chinese system works 
so for us to read every day some new name out there it just 
isnt right 
and i dont want to misrepresent this to the american people 
but what i do know is that theres events over there that it 
doesnt matter whos in charge we condemn 
and theres a relationship over there that is fundamentally 
important to the united states that i want to see preserved 
and so im trying to find a proper prudent balance not 
listening to the extremes that say take your ambassador out cut 
off all food to the chinese people so you show that youre 
concerned 
and i think weve found a proper avenue there but i cannot and 
you ask a good question i simply cannot tell you with authority 
who is calling the shots there today

q let me follow by asking you this then when you were in china 
earlier in the year you met with li peng and i believe you told 
him that china was exempted from your policy review because you knew 
china you understood china have you been let down personally have 
you been misled in any way 
a i feel a certain sense of personal disappointment but they 
werent exempt from the norms of behavior that are accepted 
internationally in terms of armed people dont shoot down unarmed 
students 
nobody suggested that 
there was an interesting point in there and i dont want to 
delve into the detail of private conversations but one of the 
chinese leaders a very prominent name told me we want change 
but people have to understand its very complicated here how fast 
we move on these reforms weve come a long way 
and indeed they did move dramatically faster on economic reforms 
than i think any of us in this room would have thought possible 
what hasnt caught up is the political reforms and reforms in 
terms of freedom of expression 
the freedom of press caught up a little bit but it hadnt gone 
obviously near far enough and now theres martial law and 
censorship 
but we were cautioned on that visit about how fast china could 
move 
some of it was economic and clearly some of the message had to 
do with how fast they could move politically 
yeah 
q mr president turning your attention to a matter thats 
devastating here at home and all over the world the question of 
aids respected experts are now starting to suggest that instead of 
the anonymous testing that has existed in the past there should be 
mandatory reporting of new cases by name and vigorous followups on 
sexual partners and needlesharing partners do you favor such an 
approach sir 
a i have spoken at an international aids conference at which i 
was roundly booed two years ago or so advocating certain kinds of 
testing 
and i dont want to have you said mandatory for everybody 
q yeah or at least an end to the anonymity of it 
a no i dont favor that 
i think there is a certain right to privacy that we should 
respect 
so in terms of anonymity i would like to suggest that records of 
that nature should be kept private 
theres a lot of suffering for aids victims 
theres a lot of human tragedy that we havent really focused on 
too much and i think of something less than very discreet handling 
of that information would not be helpful 
but do i encourage people to come forward and talk to their 
doctors and all about partners that may affect others 
yes 
i do think you do need that kind of frankness and i do favor 
certain kinds of testing 
lesley 
q mr president back to china there are reports tonight that 
the government there has begun rounding up the student leaders who 
face at the very least persecution at the most possibly charges 
of treason and whatever punishment that will bring you have talked 
tonight about your strong desire to keep this relationship going 
and to keep the dialogue and all our business as usual but moving 
forward if the 
a not at all excuse the interruption 
q well except for the military if we find out that the people 
who perpetrated the killings in tiananmen square and who are 
rounding up these students are running the government can the 
united states maintain fairly normal relationships with them given 
our aim to foster human rights and promote democracy 
a it would make it extraordinarily difficult but the question 
is so hypothetical that im going to avoid answering it directly 
but anything that codifies the acceptance of brutality or lack of 
respect for human rights will make things much more difficult 
theres no question about that 
q one followup there are 20000 chinese students in the united 
states 
a yes 
q many of them have spoken out are you prepared to grant them 
political asylum in this country 
a theyre not seeking asylum 
ill tell you what ill tell you why i answer the question that 
way 
theyre not seeking asylum 
we had four of them in the other day and the first thing that 
one of them jao wa said i love my country and he wants to go 
back to his country 
but what i have done is extend the visas so that people are not 
compelled to go back to our country 
hes not seeking asylum 
this man is not going to turn his back on his own country 
he wants to change things but he also wants to know that hes 
going to be safe and i dont blame him for that 
so its not a question of all these people asylum is kind of a 
is a legal status and thats not what theyre looking for 
q in light of the student roundups i mean if they face 
a its appalling and so i would simply say that what weve 
already done would say to these people you dont have to go 
back but im not going to ask them to turn down the flag that 
they love and turn their back on china 
these are patriotic young people who fear because of seeing 
their own brothers and sisters gunned down

washn gunned down but theyre not seeking asylum they dont 
want to flee china they want to help change china yeah these two 
in here yes sir q mr president if we can discuss another communist 
giant for a while your attitude towards the soviet union seems to have 
shifted a bit since you became president from deep skepticism to seeming 
acceptance of their intentions do you now accept mr gorbachevs sincerity 
in regard to his pledge of new thinking and can you tell us a little 
bit about why you changed a i dont think its shifted as much 
as you think michael i dont think its shifted as much what i did was 
to say we need time to make some prudent discovery investigation and 
discovery and then to go forward with a proposal and ive weve done 
exactly that the proposal we made at nato was has has unified 
the alliance and some of the leaders told me that its more unified than 
its been in history weve made a good proposal now and i hope the 
soviets will take it on good faith and i am encouraged by the response 
so far having said that in dealing with the soviet union i am going 
to continue to keep my eyes wide up wide open i will also say i want 
to see perestroika succeed i want to see it succeed not fail and i told 
mr gorbachev that oneonone last fall at governors island so i 
dont think he believes that i view this as some kind of a cold war relationship 
or that i want to see perestroika fail he did say that he felt there 
were some elements in this country that did but i dont think i hope 
that now he knows that i dont look at it that way q if i could just 
follow up a yeah q do you accept that he is sincere in terms 
of are you operating on the assumption that he is sincere when he says 
hes interested in new thinking in international affairs a hes 
already demonstrated that hes interesting interested in new thinking 
who would have thought that we would sit here and on television see a 
relatively lively debate its nothing like our congress but and so 
it had some similar similar aspects to it and so i think he has already 
demonstrated his commitment to change and to reform but theres ways now 
to solidify these changes they have 600000 troops and we have 305000 
and i made an offer to him i said the best way to guarantee stability 
and a less warlike attitude is to go to equal numbers and they are being 
asked to take out many many more troops than we are but ive said 
whats wrong with being equal the united states will have 275000 troops 
deployed and you sir will have 275000 so heres a test now 
nobody can argue the inequity of that particularly since weve put aircraft 
and helicopters and these other categories on the table so and i am inclined 
to think that if i do my work properly and we keep nato moving forward 
on this quick timetable that we can succeed and if we do he will 
once again have demonstrated his desire to for change yes sir 
q mr president first at the great risk of appearing to be trying 
to make points please convey birthday wishes to mrs bush

a youve made them thats she asked not to be reminded of her 
birthday but shes doing very well and thank you 
and if i could editorialize here one minute there have been a 
lot of expressions unrelated to her birthday about her health and 
may i say that we have been very moved by that and that she is 
doing just fine and i think her doctors would say the same thing 
shes got this graves disease under control please excuse the 
personal interruption there 
q mr president some of your critics say that despite your 
rhetoric general noriega can sit in panama for as long as he 
wishes in effect laughing at you sir laughing at the united 
states 
can you do anything about it should you 
a you know as you look around the world and you see change 
respect for the election process panama i would simply say panama 
is not immune and what were all traumatized improperly by some 
of the terrible excesses by the terrible excesses in tiananmen 
square 
but i havent forgotten the brutal beating of guillermo ford in 
panama and the world hasnt forgotten it and a european public 
opinion has changed dramatically as they look at as they look at 
mr noriega now 
and i it is my fervent hope that the oas will stay with the 
organization of american states will stay with their mission and 
will keep working on their mandate until mr noriega leaves 
and let me repeat an important point here i think there is some 
feeling in panama that we are against the pdf the panama defense 
forces we have no argument with the pdf many of their people have 
trained in the united states 
we respect the panamanian people and so the problem is noriega 
and if he gets out and they recognize the results of a freely held 
election and certifiably freely held i will say they would have 
instant improved relations with the united states 
so i am not going to give up on this i think we are proper to 
use the use multilateral diplomacy in this instance as well as 
doing what we can bilaterally and i intend to protect our treaty 
rights for example and certainly do the best i can to guarantee 
the safety of americans 
trude 
q turning to nato 
a cant hear you trude 
q the agreement between bonn and washington on the nuclear issue 
only temporarily bridges the differences at what point do you 
visualize the last missile going into germany can any german 
government expect it 
a well that matter has been properly deferred under the 
agreement at nato research can go forward but the deployment 
matter has been properly deferred and let us just go forward on the 
nato arrangements that were announced in brussels 
and yes there are differences youre absolutely right there 
are differences in germany on this whole question and not just of 
the lance followon but of the whole difference there on the 
question of snf shortrange nuclear forces 
and it is our it is in our interest to quickly move forward 
because if we can get implemented within our timeframe the 
agreement on conventional forces that will take a tremendous amount 
of pressure off the germans on shortrange forces 
q thank you 
a time flies when youre having fun 
q can i just follow that up on 
a all right this is a followup and then if its 30 minutes 
 
q theres no question about poland im a polish reporter maybe 
you will answer a question about what do what are you expecting 
from your visit to poland 
a shes got a followup youve misunderstood shes got a 
followup question 
q with regard to because of your initiative there but 
isnt this isnt the west german challenge just the first of many 
now that the soviet threat is diminishing in western europe 
a well but let me use this question to reply to a question 
about poland too there will be new challenges for nato as the 
level of concern about armed conflict reduces 
i will keep reminding our friends and they will keep reminding 
me that we must keep whatever force is required to deter war but 
part of whats happening and i am glad the gentleman raised poland 
is this quest for democracy in poland 
and it will if that goes forward i can see a much better 
relationship for the united states with poland in one that will in 
poland itself convince the people that they have less of a stake in 
military confrontation or in a bloc east bloc confrontation with 
the west 
so it is fascinating the change that is going on there it is 
absolutely fascinating and we should be positioned and im going 
there to tell this to the leaders we want to work with you 
youve got to reform your economy we dont feel that you have any 
bad intentions toward the united states but we want to see this 
policy of differentiation continue 
when a country moves like poland did down democracys path the 
united states should respond as best it could 
helen thank you very much

hemophilia the family later moved from kokomo to cicero and he now 
is a junior in hamilton heights high school

screenwriter tom schulman who wrote the 
script for the dead poets society starring robin williams says 
the motion picture is not drawn from his own experiences as a 
private school student 
schulman attended nashvilles montgomery bell academy and then 
vanderbilt university here 
the movie which opens today across the country is about a 
fictitious boys prep school in vermont called welton academy the 
harmony of the straitlaced conformist school is disturbed when 
williams arrives to teach english 
since i did go to a good private prep school i guess it 
would be natural to assume that much of the story is based on my 
experience there schulman said that just isnt true 
i have a very positive memory of my years at mba he added

secretary of veterans affairs edward derwinski 
says he is hoping for early resolution of a housesenate conflict 
that has bogged down a bill containing 12 billion for veterans 
programs 
speaking to reporters thursday derwinski said that with a 
little luck the measure should emerge from a conference committee 
of the two houses and be sent to president bush about june 23 or 24 
the measure which had passed the house earlier was approved by 
a voice vote in the senate wednesday night 
before it passed however it had been amended to provide for 
such things as repairing a radio telescope in west virginia 
ordering the army to buy coldweather clothing made in 10 specified 
states and studying last years fires in yellowstone national park 
because of delay in passage of the bill the department of 
veterans affairs issued orders may 26 ordering a freeze on hiring of 
nonmedical personnel a halt in purchases of new equipment and 
curtailment of treatment for claimants with a specified amount of 
income who have nonservice related disabilities 
we are going to keep that in effect just as directed 
derwinski said 
every house and senate member expresses total devotion to the 
va but in the meantime they keep loading up the bill with 
amendments which are either unacceptable to the other body or 
unacceptable to the white house he said 
the secretary who served 24 years as a republican congressman 
from illinois said i know thats the congress and i served 
there long enough to know how its done but its a little 
frustrating when youre the hostage 
the 12 billion for veterans programs is part of 33 billion 
in the bill which would supply several agencies for the remaining 
four months of the 1989 fiscal year 
rep silvio conte of massachusetts the ranking republican on the 
house appropriations committee said at a news conference wednesday 
that it might be late july before the differences are resolved

hong kong chinese students and profesionals are 
concerned not only at the fate of friends and relatives in 
strifetorn beijing but also at the implications of the crisis for 
the reunification of hong kong and china 
hong kong residents have accepted that reunification with 
china by 1997 is inevitable said the federation of overseas hong 
kong chinese a group of more than 2000 students and professionals 
linked across the world by computer 
however this gradually builtup sense of belonging to the 
peoples republic of china is seriously being threatened by the 
beijing massacre 
the federation called thursday for a peaceful general strike 
of all workers across china and demanded that the british government 
take immediate action to fulfill obligations to protect all hong 
kong residents in china 
hong kong is a british crown colony london and beijing signed a 
joint declaration in 1984 calling for transfer of control of hong 
kong to china in 1997 
wingwah chan federation coordinator said that scores of 
hong kong residents in china holding hong kongbritish passports 
have been denied protection by the british embassy the situation 
has become worse since the weekend massacre in tiananmen square he 
said 
the people of hong kong of course heard the message of 
tiananmen square louder than anyone else in the world said rep 
john porter rill who is cochairman of the congressional human 
rights caucus 
with only eight years before hong kong comes under the peoples 
republic of chinas control porter said great britain it seems 
to us in the congressional human rights caucus has not been 
forceful enough in protecting the basic human rights of the people 
of hong kong 
porter said he will introduce legislation next week to expand the 
number of hong kong immigrants allowed in the united states from 
5000 to as many as 50000 he added that 45000 hong kong citizens 
left beijing last year mainly for canada australia taiwan and 
america 
chikwan ho a doctorate student at the university of maryland 
who is associate coordinator of the federation said we are 
psychologically preparing for more crackdown and arrests 
what the people can do now is be calm and think of strategy 
of how they can sustain this prodemocracy protest but not in 
a way that would endanger their lives immediately

reform i want to see perestroika succeed not fail 
but theres ways now to solidify these changes said the 
president urging gorbachev to accept the us offer to cut its 
305000 troops in central europe to 275000 if the soviets cut their 
600000man force to the lower uslevel

communist government

will tell its leaders we want to work with you 
the quest for democracy in poland if it goes forward will 
mean a much better relationship for poland with the united states

between the united states and west germany over whether to modernize 
lance shortrange nuclear missiles but he said a conventional force 
agreement could solve that problem 
it is in our interests to quickly move forward because if we 
can get implemented within our timeframe the agreement on 
conventional forces that will take a tremendous amount of pressure 
off the germans on shortrange forces bush said 
baker said that soviet acceptance of the us proposal to reduce 
nato and warsaw pact forces to the same level would substantially 
reduce the threat of surprise military attack and the danger of 
largescale offensive operations against western europe 
the time is ripe for mr gorbachev to respond positively to the 
opportunities presented by natos initiatives said baker 
the secretary of state said the us proposals offer the soviets 
the opportunity both to channel resources from the military to the 
civilian sector and to accelerate the process of political reform in

small amounts of alcohol may help older people 
but a government workshop says alcohol abuse can worsen diseases of 
the aging particularly heart disease 
more research is needed into the relationship between alcohol and 
cardiovascular disease especially as the population ages the 
workshop said in a report heart disease is the most common killer 
of americans 65 and older 
the recommendations from the surgeon generals workshop on health 
promotion and aging were published thursday by the federal centers 
for disease control 
it noted that between 1950 and 1980 the number of americans 65 
and older increased from 125 million to 255 million with the 
largest increase in the 85andolder group the percentage of 
americans older than 65 is 12 percent now and will be 211 percent 
by the year 2030 the report said 
the effects of alcohol abuse on the elderly range from physical 
and mental impairment to a worsening of some chronic illnesses the 
report said these problems may be offset partly by benefits from 
limited alcohol use it said 
researchers at stanford university reported in 1985 that people 
who drink in moderation may reduce risk of heart disease possibly 
by increasing blood levels of certain proteins 
the report said the apparent conflicting effects of large and 
small doses of alcohol are most notable in cases of coronary artery 
disease which affects about 36 million americans older than 65 
studies have confirmed that hypertension a major contributor to 
cardiovascular disease and stroke increases in the elderly as 
alcohol use increases the report noted that hypertension is 
especially common among the elderly in minority groups 
gregory heath of the cdcs epidemiology section who edited the 
report said the potential for harm is well established among heavy 
drinkers he said cdc studies define that as more than two drinks a 
day but other studies go as high as five a day 
other studies have demonstrated a possible beneficial link 
between moderate levels of alcohol intake and coronary artery 
disease although this relationship is controversial the report 
said 
the report said that although aging americans report they drink 
less their level of alcohol abuse appears to be about equal to the 
8 percent found in the rest of the adult population 
heath said that the elderly tend to underreport their drinking 
and that it is unclear whether the apparent decline in drinking as 
americans grow older is because drinkers become nondrinkers or 
because the drinkers tend to die earlier 
researchers are on both sides of the fence on that one and i 
dont feel its fair to comment one way or the other he said 
heath said the physiological effects of alcohol on the elderly 
still are being investigated as is the interaction between alcohol 
and medication 
the elderly he said are more likely to be taking medication for 
chronic diseases and may not know how alcohol interacts with that 
medicine 
they need to be advised by their physicians he said

dr jonas salks report that an experimental 
vaccine eliminated aids infection in two chimpanzees demonstrates 
treatment for the deadly disease is possible but scientists say it 
is only one of several promising findings 
these are the beginnings of progress we didnt have a year 
ago said dani bolognesi of duke university a leading authority 
on aids vaccine research 
speaking thursday at the fifth international conference on aids 
bolognesi said researchers at the new england primate research 
center had blocked an aidslike infection in monkeys 
and researchers at repligen in cambridge mass working with 
bolognesi and others showed that antibodies to a tiny portion of 
the aids viruss outer surface could prevent infection in 
chimpanzees 
much of the attention at the conference focused on salk 
developer of the first polio vaccine in the 1950s salk himself 
said however that his research did not constitute a breakthrough 
were on a path we think is worth pursuing salk said we 
havent reached the end of it were still in the exploratory 
phase 
dr robert gallo of the national cancer institute one of the 
discoverers of the aids virus said salks vaccine could probably 
never be given to people who had not already been infected by the 
aids virus 
the reason he said is that the vaccine is made of killed but 
mostly intact aids virus 
who would take it whos going to guarantee that every virus 
particle is dead gallo said he noted that the salk polio 
vaccine also made of killed virus did in some cases give people 
polio when it was processed incorrectly 
he said it was unlikely the us food and drug administration 
would ever approve such a vaccine for use in uninfected people to 
prevent acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
there is no salk aids vaccine here gallo said 
bolognesi who summed up vaccine research at the aids conference 
did say however that salk had made several intriguing and 
surprising findings 
in one study salk and clarence gibbs of the us national 
institutes of health injected four chimpanzees with high doses of 
the aids virus called the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv two 
had already been infected with aids and then vaccinated 
a third had been vaccinated but not previously infected with 
aids a fourth was not vaccinated or infected 
the two that had been infected and vaccinated fought off the new 
infection the vaccine worked 
this in itself is a remarkable finding bolognesi said 
before that the consensus had been that once you are infected 
with hiv you are infected for life he said 
im encouraged by what appears to be a rather powerful effect 
on an existing infection 
the chimp that was vaccinated but not previously infected 
developed an infection when given a high dose of aids virus but 
that infection is slowly subsiding salk said 
the fourth chimp which was not vaccinated developed an ongoing 
aids infection after being injected with hiv 
salk also tested his vaccine on 19 patients with aidsrelated 
complex or arc a condition that often precedes aids the results 
were less encouraging than those in the chimpanzees 
the 19 patients have remained stable for a year without taking 
azt or other drugs said one of salks collaborators dr alexandra 
levine of the university of southern california 
the studies showed the vaccine was not toxic and that it could 
boost the patients immune reponse to the aids virus 
injections of bits of the aids virus under the patients skins 
showed that they had developed whats called cellular immunity 
to aids that is not only did they fight it with antibodies they 
also fought it with certain white blood cells intended to defend 
against infections 
after the third boosters more than half of the subjects 
demonstrated this cellular immunity levine said but the vaccine 
did not eliminate infection in any of them as it did in the 
chimpanzees 
salk said he hoped the vaccine might protect against illness by 
limiting the infection even if it doesnt prevent it 
gallo said chimpanzees are naturally more resistant to the aids 
virus than are humans success with them therefore might not 
translate to humans

veterans of the pioneering 
x15 program gathered to swap right stuff tales about 
edgeofspace flight before the breakthroughs of space shots and 
space shuttles 
three decades ago the rocketpowered x15 spaceplane first 
soared 67 miles over the desert and helped usher in a new era in 
aeronautics fifty miles above earth was considered the edge of 
space earning coveted astronaut wings for air force fliers in the 
x15 program 
the three x15 hypersonic research aircraft flew 199 flights in 
one of the most successful aeronautical programs ever conducted 
neil armstrong the first man to set foot on the moon was among 
the dozen or so military and civilian test pilots who flew the x15 
during the program operated jointly by the air force navy and 
national aeronautics and space administration 
the pilots recalled their adventures thursday at a reunion 
honoring them 
this is kind of our last hurrah said milt thompson 63 an 
x15 veteran 
others attending included scott crossfield whose exploits were 
chronicled in tom wolfes saga of the space age the right 
stuff and retired air force col pete knight who went on to 
become mayor of the nearby desert community of palmdale 
another was joe engle the only x15 pilot to go on to command a 
space shuttle he made 16 x15 flights and two orbital missions in 
the shuttle 
i like being around pilots engle said in a telephone 
interview on thursday night 
when i grow up im going to be one he quipped 
he said his experiences in the x15 were among the most 
professionally rewarding of a highflying career 
every time you flew the x15 you knew you were logging data 
for designs of aircraft and spacecraft that hadnt even been 
thought of yet he said 
the wickedlooking black needlenosed rocket plane would arc 
across the sky so quickly that the pilot feared he was aiming 
straight for the pacific ocean said thompson now chief engineer 
for nasa at the amesdryden research facility 
that was the geometry of it he said it was just flying 
that fast 
the first x15 flight was on june 8 1959 and the final flight on 
oct 24 1968 a 300 million program that was the last in a 
venerable line of research rocket planes chuck yeager broke the 
sound barrier in 1947 in the bell x1 that he dubbed glamorous 
glennis in honor of his wife 
after flying the x15 thompson said he moved away from flight 
test because everything was winding down there would not be 
another research plane as rewarding to pilot he lamented 
a total of three x15 rocket planes were built and one was 
destroyed in an accident in 1967 air force maj michael adams died 
in that crash when the x15 broke up while diving from an altitude 
of 265000 feet 
the original design goal for the x15 was 4000 mph but the 
aircraft eventually flew at more than six times the speed of sound 
which is 760 mph in addition to reaching a maximum 4520 mph it 
soared to 345200 feet 
the flights allowed researchers to perform many experiments on a 
repeated basis that aided in developing space technology the 
capabilities and limitations of the human pilot in flying space 
trajectories and reentry maneuvers and conditions were thoroughly 
explored 
the success of the x15 design development and flight program 
allowed the mercury gemini and apollo spaceflight programs to 
accelerate 
when it became clear that the space age was upon us and the 
need to put a human into earth orbit became a matter of national 
urgency a massive backlog of aerospace technology was already at 
hand in the x15 program said john v becker of nasas langley 
research center in hampton va 
years later the space shuttles landing characteristics would be 
designed to emulate the x15

the 20000 tons of trash generated annually by capitol buildings 
boschwitz has asked the rules committee to consider a recycling 
program for the entire capitol complex which includes the supreme 
court library of congress and six congressional office buildings 
if we dont set the example certainly it wont be set 
elsewhere boschwitz said thursday during a news conference 
the capitol architects office has suggested the government begin 
recycling garbage from the russell senate office building and the

use of advertising rather than cash bonuses or 
more recruiters is the best way to save money for the military 
according to studies 
the reports were issued by the rand corp a pentagonsupported 
think tank based in santa monica calif one focused on army 
advertising efforts and the other assessing whether the services 
should do their own ads or joint ads with the other armed forces 
the army study concluded that advertising does make a difference 
in an era of the allvolunteer military and cuts in the ad budget 
will hurt 
as for individual service advertisements compared to 
joint ads the second study concluded both types appear to be 
very powerful tools and in general can produce a new recruit for 
roughly the same outlay of cash

gone from tiananmen square are the prodemocracy 
banners and the tents of chinas freedom movement replaced by 
tanks armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers 
the army on thursday allowed the people of beijing their first 
glance of the 100acre expanse since the military swept into the 
capital six days ago leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement 
for political change 
troops moved back their barricades making it possible for city 
residents to walk to the edge of the square which for seven weeks 
stood at the heart of the movement buses and bicyclists today were 
allowed to pass by changan avenue which borders the north edge of 
the square 
the spot once occupied by the goddess of democracy a 
33foothigh replica of the statue of liberty was taken by a 
treadwheeled armored personnel carrier when students built the 
statue last week for a few days it became a symbol of the movement 
for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption on sunday 
morning a tank crushed it 
in all 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined the 
northern part of the square 
the monument to revolutionary martyrs where the students took a 
final stand early sunday was swept clean poems and posters calling 
for a more open china have disappeared from its sides 
chinese red cross officials estimate 3600 people were killed and 
60000 injured over the weekend citing a chinese students 
organization the union of chinese students in west germany the 
government says nearly 300 people mostly soldiers were killed 
diplomats and chinese say up to 3000 died 
soldiers drilled in tiananmens center their cadenced shouting 
echoing around the vast expanse a crowd of officials stood on the 
roof of the great hall of the people overlooking the square from 
this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant 
mass of demonstrators enveloped 5000 troops and blocked their entry 
to the square 
inside the square soldiers could be seen shuffling about their 
uniformed jackets stripped off wash basins in hand there was a 
relaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troops 
carried food and walked slowly together talking and laughing in 
groups 
the area once housing students tents has become a holding area 
for a huge fleet of troop trucks 
on the southern perimeter a single line of tanks and a cordon of 
soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who 
pedaled slowly by peering into tiananmen 
near the square troops placed barbed wire in front of one 
street soldiers were billeted in a construction site their 
laundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding next door troops 
their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders stood 
and chatted outside a discotheque 
they look like they said one local resident i hope they 
know that we still dont want them here

he may leap tall buildings but motor 
vehicles pose a problem for superboy and straight shooting with the 
law doesnt appear to be a strong suit either 
john newton 23 who plays the lead in the syndicated television 
series superboy persuaded a local sheriff and a judge in march 
to withdraw a 52 careless driving ticket saying his image would be 
hurt by the citation and claiming he had no previous tickets 
the tv stars rental car had nearly hit a deputys patrol car in 
a shopping center in january 
but records show newton since 1982 had at least four other 
traffic tickets three in north carolina and one in new york and 
had his drivers license suspended twice one of the citations was 
issued in new york city the others in north carolina 
i cant believe the guy did this we took the man at his word 
i guess a man is only as good as his word orange country 
sheriffs spokesman jim solomons said thursday 
no further action against the actor is planned solomons said 
you cant reissue a ticket thats been dismissed he said 
superboy is syndicated by viacom enterprises and produced at 
disneymgm studios in the orlando area 
filming was suspended for the summer and newton could not be

some chinese army officers favor the goals of the 
democracy movement but the military as a whole is still largely 
sympathetic to hardliners who ordered the recent crackdown 
academic experts on china say 
any conflicts within the military over the handling of student 
unrest are unlikely to flare into major confrontations among army 
units they say 
the army has always opted for unity the instinct of most 
chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy instead of breaking 
up said harvey jencks a research associate at the university of 
california at berkeley and an expert on the chinese military 
economic reforms have increased inflation in china eroding the 
value of military wages and making the army sympathetic to hardline 
policies many experts said 
the military leadership has more to gain from a conservative 
economic policy because their wages are hurting from inflation 
said june teufel dreyer an expert on the peoples liberation army 
who teaches political science at the university of miami 
these kids in the army are there grudgingly and are not 
sophisticated they will protect themselves first she said 
the chinese experts also said many army officers have their 
careers tied to the communist party and the privileges of rank and 
are unlikely to rebel 
the officer corps of the pla is made up almost exclusively of 
chinese communist party members said jurgen domes a west german 
professor who is a visiting scholar at the center for chinese 
studies at berkeley 
a sizeable majority are secondgeneration military members of 
a privileged class whose privilege is bound to their position in the 
military 
domes said these secondgeneration officers have fewer options 
and therefore a higher stake in the status quo than student 
dissidents who are sons and daughters of party cadres 
the intellectuals have had the opportunity to go abroad or seek a 
variety of posts in the civilian sector domes said 
even those who see support in the army for the student movement 
dont see it leading to open conflict in the ranks 
some middlerank officers have been infected with the virus of 
democracy but the life of the chinese soldier has not been a 
redhot one under the economic reforms said harvey nelsen a 
professor at the university of south florida the average soldier 
is an illeducated peasant with little understanding of the issues 
domes agreed saying that 40 percent of the armys rankandfile 
are illiterate peasants with no understanding or even awareness 
of the principles for which prodemocracy activists are striving 
unlike others jencks saw widespread army support for the student 
protesters but he predicted the desire for unity would prevail 
probably a majority of the army sympathizes with the students 
but they wont shoot each other over it he said 
nelsen was the only academician interviewed by the associated 
press who saw substantial political divisions between the 27th army 
and other army units the 27th army is believed to have carried out 
the brunt of attacks against demonstrators in beijing since june 3 
nelsen who traveled to china last month and has written a book 
on the chinese military said the divisions were unlikely to lead to 
serious fighting but could help reformers win the battle within the 
countrys leadership 
if the 27th remains isolated they are likely to do a lot of 
posturing and intimidation but finally they will surrender and the 
reformers will win he said 
domes said he agreed with usbased chinese student leader pei 
minxin who said in a television interview wednesday that rumors of 
military infighting and imminent civil war were a ruse by the 
chinese leadership 
domes speculated that troops had been moved in and out of beijing 
to create an illusion of dissension and frighten foreigners into 
fleeing then domes predicted few would remain to witness the 
arrest or execution of many more dissidents 
he said at least 15 million to 18 million chinese have been 
killed for political reasons since the communists took power in 1949 
the only difference this time is that it was captured by 
television cameras he said

not to be outdone by cbs whose dan rather 
reported from the scene in beijing during the student uprising nbc 
has sent anchorman tom brokaw there and abcs ted koppel plans to 
depart for china this weekend 
koppel will report beginning next week on world news 
tonight and nightline and will complete a koppel report 
news special on the unrest in china 
rather and cnns bernard shaw were the only two us anchormen in 
china when the student demonstrations for democracy exploded into a 
big story last month 
both got primetime exposure rather in the middle of the season 
finale of dallas with live coverage of their negotiations to 
keep chinese officials from shutting off satellite transmissions 
brokaw and abc anchorman peter jennings while praising their own 
networks coverage in china expressed disappointment that they had 
not been there themselves for one of the biggest stories of the year 
cbs had sent rather and company to beijing for the visit of 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but the student demonstrations 
became the big story rather returned from china two weeks ago 
before the military began firing on beijing citizens 
brokaw was going as most americans were leaving china on the 
state departments advice because of the threat of continued 
violence 
there have been numerous reports of journalists and camera crews 
being roughed up by the military camera coverage has had to be 
surreptitious and film and videotape is handcarried out of the 
country 
nbc news had announced that correspondent garrick utley would be 
sent to help cover the china story but a spokeswoman said thursday 
that brokaw went instead because he had already obtained a visa and 
utley didnt have one 
because there is no live transmission capability out of china 
utley will anchor nbc nightly news from new york with brokaw 
providing live telephone reports during the broadcast

after 36 hours on and off the phone liu 
yuan still snaps to attention when the telephone rings its flashing 
red light a possible harbinger of news from beijing 
for nearly a week liu and his friends at the 24hour hot line in 
this boston suburb have ferried information in and out of china on 
three phone lines and a borrowed fax machine dodging a government 
blackout with the hightech tools of the information age 
we send the materials by fax machine and now were finding out 
thats like a weapon liu said thursday 
in china the statecontrolled media initially informed viewers 
that not one person had died in tiananmen square but the government 
later said 300 people had died the chinese red cross said about 
3600 died in the violence 
bit by bit horrifying stories of bloodshed and bravery are being 
beamed across the world by computer by fax and by phone 
networks are invisible the only thing that will bring a halt 
to this is stopping the chinese phone system said jessica 
lipnack a researcher with the newtonbased networking institute 
in a particularly defiant gesture the newton group sent 
newspaper articles by fax to a company managed by the son of deng 
xiaoping liu said 
we believe that people who work for that company they 
should hear the truth he said 
we just feel like thats a victory he added flashing a rare 
grin 
early thursday liu spoke with student activists in shanghai who 
told him demonstrators packed the streets and workers were virtually 
on strike 
chinese students many of them studying technology and science 
went to their terminals early in the tense standoff beaming out 
messages through international networks 
from east berlin to canada to princeton nj dispatches moved 
expressing solidarity relaying information phoned out of china and 
bringing the informal network of chinese students together 
xu ruiming whos studying physics at brandeis university has 
made it part of his routine to constantly check his computer for 
electronic mail 
there are a lot of messages ive received but the problem is 
its hard to tell if its a rumor or real news he said 
keeping control of the wildly flying rumors is one of the hardest 
parts of the unofficial news service liu said leading students to 
shy away from all but verified facts and photographed evidence 
they plan to keep the phone lines open as long as their money 
holds out their phone bill is approaching 30000

most successful film directors would no more 
make a tv show than lee iacocca would drive a yugo but a takeoff 
from a creepy comic book series has lured three bigscreen hotshots 
hollywood directors walter hill richard donner and robert 
zemeckis made the first three segments of tales from the crypt 
which debut on home box office saturday and play throughout the 
month 
obviously we are doing this for fun said hill the director 
of 48hrs the warriors and red heat this is an art 
form these ec comics are a unique contribution to the art 
tradition in this country 
the original 1950s comic book series created by william gaines 
was lambasted by a variety of public officials for its violence and 
macabre themes a santa claus wielding an ax was at home in the 
crypt comics the comics became the subject of a senate 
subcommittee hearing on juvenile delinquency 
gaines eventually lost interest in entertaining comics to devote 
time to his next creation mad magazine 
the highpriced directors each made one 30minute episode 
other film directors mary pet sematary lambert and howard 
pretty in pink deutch will make other episodes 
while most of the movies the three directors make cost upwards of 
30 million apiece the tales from the crypt episodes averaged 
850000 
zemeckis who filmed his episode between making who framed 
roger rabbit and tackling two sequels for back to the future 
said a small project was a relief 
i didnt want extras i didnt want exteriors i didnt want 
cars i wanted to try and do something suspenseful he said i 
didnt want to scout locations and build 20 sets and do all that 
hill described his episode as not so much a horror story as it 
is an examination of the horrible 
his chapter follows an outofwork executioner who cant seem to 
shake his old work habits after the death penalty is outlawed he 
insists on electrocuting the guilty on a freelance basis 
the episode by donner director of the omen superman and 
lethal weapon chronicles the exploits of a deathdefying 
carnival star who may have tempted fate once too often the story 
is presented with cartoonish editing and exaggerated acting 
zemeckis crypt episode features a suddenly single mother 
defending her home on christmas eve from a santa claus who studied 
toy making at the local insane asylum 
i wanted it to have humor and obviously the humor is very 
black he said i wanted it to be true to the comic book why do 
tales from the crypt if you cant do it the right way and those 
were the ground rules

the crazed fan who knifed actress theresa 
saldana may never be freed to pursue his death mission but she 
still fears the man will someday get out and try to kill her 
i am so grateful he will not be walking out next week it is 
buying some time miss saldana said thursday after learning arthur 
jacksons death threats from a prison cell may keep him behind bars 
indefinitely 
one week before his parole date district attorney ira reiner 
charged jackson with eight counts of threatening the actress and her 
rescuer in 1987 and 1988 
the new charges carry a total of seven years and eight months in 
prison but because of jacksons mental history the 53yearold 
scottish drifter could be kept in prison or in a psychiatric 
facility for many years 
he could receive a life term for this given his deranged 
mental state because the laws have been changed reiner said 
our objective quite simply is to keep him off the street 
jackson whose obsession with the raging bull actress led to 
the 1982 attack had been given a june 15 goodbehavior parole date 
after serving seven years of a 12year sentence for the stabbing 
miss saldana was attacked outside her west hollywood apartment 
and stabbed 10 times by jackson whose thrusts bent the blade of his 
kitchen knife it was water deliveryman jeff fenn now a county 
sheriffs deputy who pulled jackson off the actress 
in letters to her and fenn over the years jackson vowed to carry 
out his death mission the eight counts involve five letters sent to 
miss saldana and three to fenn 
i swear on the ashes of my dead mother and on the scars of 
theresa saldana that neither god nor i will rest in peace until the 
special request in my solemn petition has been granted he said in 
one letter 
in that same letter jackson said he regretted using a knife 
because a gun would have given me a better chance of reunion with 
you in heaven 
jackson will serve additional years for as long as he continues 
to terrorize miss saldana said assemblyman richard katz who 
drafted the 1986 law that would keep jackson incarcerated 
under katz law additional years can be added to an inmates 
sentence for each threat of violence committed by the felon 
the actress said she is unconvinced he will never be turned loose 
this nightmare is far from being resolved and there is a long 
road ahead this is only a stopgap it gives us time to work for 
legislation preventing him and others like him from ever being 
released she said

three polls released in the final week of 
the highstakes republican gubernatorial primary in virginia show 
former sen paul s trible jr in a tight race with two rivals 
the candidates have raised 98 million for tuesdays primary 
the first held by the state gop in 40 years 
that matches the entire budget for both sides of the 1985 
governors race won by democrat gerald l baliles who by law 
cannot run for a second term 
a masondixon opinion research inc poll thursday of 800 probable 
voters showed trible with 31 percent support to 30 percent for 
former attorney general j marshall coleman and 27 percent for 8th 
district rep stanford e parris 
on wednesday a washington post poll showed trible and coleman 
dead even 31 percent each among 602 likely voters with parris 
trailing at 24 percent 
trible previously was the frontrunner in the race and earlier 
polls showed that he alone would be favored in a headtohead 
contest with the democratic contender lt gov l douglas wilder 
who would be the nations first elected black governor 
the third poll released wednesday by state house minority leader 
raymond r andy guest jr who earlier dropped out of the race 
questioned that assessment 
it showed trible leading wilder 49 percent to 42 percent coleman 
leading wilder 46 percent to 43 percent and parris leading wilder 
45 percent to 42 percent 
the poll did not evaluate the three candidates against each other 
trible spokesman john miller questioned the validity of the 
surveys we havent seen anything that looks like these numbers in 
any other poll he said 
dennis peterson an aide to coleman said the polls show tribles 
support has slipped we felt that the momentum always has been 
away from paul peterson said 
the sampling error in the polls ranged from 3 percent to 5 
percent 
coleman 46 lost the 1981 governors race to charles robb

together with a honeymoon they will never forget 
ms james 24 met her 26yearold husband while she was teaching 
at the beijing forestry university in the northwestern university 
district of the chinese capital 
when the student prodemocracy movement ignited after the death 
of ousted communist party chief hu yaobang on april 15 the couple 
decided to marry and prepared to leave the country 
but when troops stormed tiananmen square in central beijing last 
weekend wu was thousands of miles away in the southern city of 
canton obtaining a us immigration visa 
we were really afraid something like this was going to 
happen ms james said after arriving in tokyo on thursday aboard 
a flight chartered by the us state department 
events overtook their planning and when beijing erupted in 
violence the woman from liberty city texas was in beijing with 
the couples airplane tickets while her husband was stuck in canton 
with the passports 
i was hearing firing at night and seeing dead bodies piled 
inside the gates of the university at least 300 students at our 
school died and more are missing she said 
while wu was away ms james spend time with his mother a nurse 
at the university she saw her treat the wounds of hundreds of 
students hurt in troop attacks 
in the streets the next day soldiers were stripping bodies of 
identification and burning them there were scavengers burnt trucks 
were smoldering and trees were scorched she said 
the soldiers were growing increasingly antiamerican ms james 
said theyre blaming what happened on western influence

despite scattered reports of skirmishes between 
soldiers the threat appears to be fading that rival military 
factions would fight over the attack on demonstrators on tiananmen 
square 
the 27th army sickened the citizens of beijing with its bloody 
suppression of a prodemocracy movement the weekend attack left 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people dead in the city center 
other units of the peoples liberation army soon entered the 
capital to the cheers of the people who believed the new soldiers 
had orders to crush the hated 27th which had remained lodged in 
tiananmen square 
a military confrontation seemed imminent earlier this week with 
scattered reports of soldiers fighting soldiers inside beijing and 
artillery fire 
different units were said to be loyal to rival politicians with 
the 27th supporting hardline president yang shangkun and others 
favoring moderate leaders who opposed the crackdown 
in addition the 27th armys withering gunfire and tank advance 
not only killed civilians but also took its toll on soldiers from 
other military units that got in the way according to a western 
diplomat 
but the recent arrivals have not taken up positions of battle 
instead they have brandished brooms to sweep the streets clean 
they have chatted amiably with curious citizens 
the new forces were deployed to win propaganda points for the 
peoples liberation army by providing an acceptable face to 
beijing citizens not to fight their fellow soldiers one western 
diplomat said 
the introduction of friendly troops clearly has helped pacify 
the beijing residents who no longer are gathering in the streets in 
large numbers to protest the weekend massacre 
the likelihood that some or all of the 27th army have left 
tiananmen square without battling other troops also suggests units 
are not about to fight each other 
tanks of the 27th army that took up positions on strategic 
bridges leading downtown were formed not to defend against a rival 
military force but to deter a people power uprising the 
diplomat said 
one would like to think they were factionalized but there 
is no evidence he said 
other experts doubt that differences within the military over the 
imposition of martial law on beijing to end the prodemocracy 
movement and the use of force against unarmed citizens will lead to 
major factional fighting 
probably a majority of the army sympathizes with the students 
but they wont shoot each other over it said harvey jencks a 
research associate at the university of california at berkeley who 
is an expert on the chinese military 
the army has always opted for unity jencks said the 
instinct of most chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy 
instead of breaking up 
the latest government policy is an intensified crackdown against 
the prodemocracy activists new martial law edicts issued thursday 
order movement leaders to give themselves up and urged residents to 
turn in fellow citizens who took party in hooliganism and 
destruction 
it is not yet clear to what degree the army will help enforce 
those martial law orders

maine winters notwithstanding spies who 
come in from the cold seem drawn to the kennebunks 
this coastal town and neighboring kennebunkport are home to a 
cluster of former intelligence operatives analysts and 
administrators who have chosen the area as a good place to retire or 
to build a second career 
the bestknown former spy master is of course president bush a 
lifelong summer resident of kennebunkport who was appointed director 
of the central intelligence agency in 1976 
but many of those once involved in clandestine activities have 
settled here yearround creating a small and notsosecretive 
community of retired spies 
this weekend several of the worlds leading writers on 
intelligence will be among 130 people expected to gather in 
kennebunkport for the fifth anniversary meeting of the new england 
chapter of the association of former intelligence officers 
the keynote speaker will be james mccargar a 16year 
intelligence veteran who under the pen name christopher felix 
wrote a short course in the secret war hailed as a classic in 
the history of intelligence another speaker will be rupert allason 
a member of parliament who as nigel west has written extensively 
about british intelligence 
bush an afio life member will be out of town and unable to 
attend the meeting near his vacation compound 
four of the chapters 11 directors are from kennebunk or 
kennebunkport its believed that at least a dozen former 
intelligence officers make their homes in the two towns 
after a 30year cia career that took him to places like china and 
iran ernest weidul retired to kennebunkport where his wife is an 
artist another cia veteran barbara storer is in the real estate 
business 
retired maj gen edmund r thompson president of the regional 
chapter and former army assistant chief of staff for intelligence 
lives in kennebunk and attributes the cluster to coincidence and to 
the areas attractiveness as a retirement community 
but others suggest social dynamics of intelligence work played a 
role in attracting them to the area 
at the onset of the cold war the cia targeted its recruiting 
efforts toward prep school and ivy league college graduates often 
picking members of oldline boston new york and philadelphia 
families 
many of those families spent summers along the maine coast said 
allan a swenson of kennebunk an afio chapter director who was 
involved in military and civilian intelligence 
swenson now a book publishing executive said those summer 
connections drew many looking for a place to retire 
he also said those involved in intelligence work often are part 
of a closeknit group that made few friends on the outside you 
cant talk to many people because people are not supposed to know 
what youre doing swenson said 
the group which has 150 members in new england tries to dispel 
the james bond image and provide a more realistic understanding of 
the nature of intelligence work 
the guy jumping behind enemy lines sneaking and peeking 
thats all tv thats lecarre swenson said 
its the details of intelligence work that excite many 
in a tour sponsored by the group last year former spy masters 
went to world war ii intelligence sites in england a highlight was 
visiting the development site of the enigma machine that deceived 
nazi cryptologists

some leading scientists think the soviet 
unions chernobyl nuclear plant exploded like a nuclear bomb 
something the nuclear industry has said could not happen 
in an article in todays technology review scientists gave 
conflicting views on whether the april 1986 chernobyl accident 
which killed 31 people and spread radiation thousands of miles was 
caused by a nuclear explosion 
the article in the journal published by the massachusetts 
institute of technology said similar accidents could happen at 13 
other reactors in the soviet union but the possibility of such an 
accident in a us reactor is vanishingly small 
william sweet the articles author interviewed scientists and 
specialists at the nuclear regulatory commission and the department 
of energy in an effort to reach a consensus on the accident 
a runaway nuclear reaction set off a chain of events that 
severely damaged the reactor core and surrounding structures 
sweet wrote this damage set the stage for a second explosion 
which was much more violent than the first and almost certainly was 
a fullfledged nuclear explosion 
but themis speis deputy research chief at the nrc said it was 
very misleading to call the accident a nuclear explosion 
the reactor went out of control but the time it took to raise 
the temperature and pressure is many orders of magnitude smaller 
than it takes to get an atomic bomb going he said 
john ahearne former nrc chairman said i wouldnt call it a 
nuclear explosion 
but harvard university physics professor richard wilson said 
it was a nuclear explosion theres no doubt because the ultimate 
source of energy was nuclear 
the argument is one of semantics said gregory van tuyle a 
nuclear engineer at the brookhaven national laboratory 
the plant was not destroyed by a steam explosion as scientists 
had believed but power grew to very large levels very rapidly 
he said the phrase nuclear explosion is not inappropriate 
sweet said the reaction at chernobyl was unlike a bomb in that it 
gave off less energy and produced it more slowly than a bomb 
but reports suggest the reactors fuel formed a critical mass 
reacted uncontrollably melted and vaporized he said 
it would be deeply misleading to say that the plant did not 
blow up like an atomic bomb he said 
ever since the first nuclear power plants were built in the 
1950s the industry has insisted they cant explode like bombs 
sweet said chernobyl casts doubt on whether that is true of all 
power reactors 
sweet is a reporter at physics today which is published by the 
american institute of physics

two simultaneous explosions today shook 
west beiruts seaside boulevard near a syrian army checkpoint 
police said at least one person was killed and two wounded 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the two 
blasts which a police spokesman said devastated two vans and hurled 
the body of a coffee vendor into the mediterranean sea 
rescuers jumped into the water and swam toward the corpse which 
was last seen off the rocky beach in the raouche district 
the blasts shattered the vans and scattered their gutted parts 
across a 300foot radius vendors had sold refreshments to 
passersby from the vans 
civil defense rescuers doused a fire that blazed in one of the 
vans 
helmeted syrian soldiers fired their ak47 assault rifles into 
the air so ambulances could get through the crowd that rushed to the 
blast scene 
ambulances their sirens wailing were dispatched to the 
explosion site from civil defense centers in syrianpoliced west 
beirut 
private cars evacuated two wounded men said traffic police 
sgt kamel abdallah who waved cars off the main boulevard at 
raouche minutes after the blasts 
a barefoot woman wearing a light green dress pleaded with 
syrian soldiers to let her cross a checkpoint to the blast scene to 
inquire about her husband 
he likes to have his morning coffee here he surely was here 
please let me pass the woman said she sobbed repeatedly while 
talking to the syrian soldier 
go away woman the soldier yelled back only the coffee 
vendor was killed 
the police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
rules said explosives experts were examining the gutted wreckage of 
the two vans to determine the exact nature of the blasts 
as the explosions were reported a nearby syrian artillery 
battery fired three 130mm howitzer shells into the christianheld 
coast north of beirut 
shelling the christian coast has been a daily practice by syrian 
artillery batteries since may 26 when arab leaders called a 
ceasefire in the 12week confrontation between christian army 
commander michel aouns units and their moslem and syrian foes 
the syrians say it is to prevent gen aoun from obtaining war 
materiel by sea 
the police spokesman said the three shells exploded around the 
port of jounieh no casualties were reported 
the latest fighting in lebanons 14year civil war began on march 
8 not counting todays fatalities 363 people have been killed and 
1432 wounded since then 
it began after aoun ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by 
syrianbacked militias south of beirut because they deprive the 
state treasury of about 100 million in customs dues annually 
syrian troops and allied militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatts militia retaliated by blockading the christian enclave 
where about 1 million people live

an eighthgrader is petitioning berke 
breathed to keep drawing his bloom county comic strip but the 
cartoonists editor says its probably a lost cause 
breathed plans to substitute a sundayonly strip for the daily 
bloom county which was introduced in december 1980 and in 1987 
won a pulitzer prize 
al leeds who edits the strip for the washington post writers 
group has already had a peek at the new cartoon which he said is 
being kept under wraps for now 
but he revealed one secret opus isnt saying farewell after all 
opus the penguin will eventually appear in the new strip 
leeds promised but he will only be a supporting character and 
certainly not the protagonist 
eric gustafson 13 has launched a grassroots effort to convince 
breathed to keep alive opus along with steve dallas milo bloom and 
the rest of the strips characters and gustafson isnt alone 
the warmth of those characters was really something and its 
been an exceptional show of regret that berkes ending it said 
leeds who signed breathed to a contract in 1980 and watched the 
strip spread to about 800 daily and college newspapers nationwide 
breatheds mail has more than doubled lately to as many as 250 
letters a week said suzanne whelton an editorial assistant at the 
washington post writers group 
there are some pretty distraught people out there she said 
gustafson counts himself among them 
im sure bloom county has a lot of fans nationally who are 
upset so were trying to get something started locally and hope it 
will spread said the northboro middle school student whos so 
far collected about 100 petition signatures 
the cartoonist was out of the country and unavailable for comment 
thursday but leeds rated slimtonone the chances breathed would 
reconsider his decision to terminate the comic strip

mobs in soviet uzbekistan are growing bolder 
escalating their attacks on police stations despite the presence of 
thousands of soldiers izvestia reported today 
the official government newspaper said the death toll from the 
last six days of ethnic violence in the fergana region of the 
central asian republic was nearing 80 and more than 800 people have 
been hurt 
the regions party chief has called for more decisive 
measures to stem the wave of arson and murder izvestia said 
without identifying them 
i think that taking into account the serious nature of the 
situation we dont have enough force yet for its stabilization 
shavkat yuldashev told the newspaper apparently more decisive 
measures are needed 
alexi yastrebov a deputy to the soviet congress of peoples 
deputies said in an interview thursday that the parliament was 
asked by communist party officials in a closed session to approve 
tougher action in uzbekistan 
a group of deputies including some from uzbekistan were 
scheduled to report on the latest developments to the congress today 
before a decision was taken 
the government has brought in more than 9000 interior ministry 
soldiers and given them the authority to open fire to protect 
themselves but held back on sending in regular army soldiers 
official media say 
reporting on recent attacks on police and the interior ministry 
building in the troubled regions city of kokand 1500 miles 
southeast of moscow the newspaper said a crowd of thousands managed 
to seize three pistols and force police to release 12 detainees from 
jail 
the actions of the uncontrolled elements are becoming more 
aggressive izvestia said more and more often attacks are being 
made on buildings of the interior ministry and police the goal is 
to sieze weapons the population is extremely agitated 
rioters have torched more than 550 houses and nearly 300 
vehicles and 300 people are now detained it said 
the killing started june 3 in a rampage between ethnic uzbeks and 
the meskhi turk minority who were forcibly resettled in the fergana 
valley of uzbekistan by josef stalin in 1944 
yuldashev proposed addressing the problem of returning them to 
their homeland in southern georgia as quickly as possible 
more than 10000 of the meskhi turks have been evacuated to the 
safety of army camps after the recent attacks on the police station 
in kokand the mob invaded a meskhi neighborhood and set more than 
80 houses and six cars on fire izvestia reported 
an uzbek deputy who spoke at parliament this morning did not 
comment directly on the violence but he described harsh living 
conditions in the cottongrowing southern republic 
adil yakubov head of the uzbekistan writers union painted a 
grim picture of the men and women laboring in the cotton fields 
under hot sun and among poisonous chemicals 
he compared workers in uzbekistans cotton fields to slaves 
brought to america to work on plantations but said the slaves were 
better fed and their descendants now make up the best of american 
sports and arts 
uzbek children he said are so underfed they are often not 
accepted into army combat units 
yakubov echoed claims by uzbek activists that cotton production 
imposed by moscow has forced uzbekistan to neglect feeding itself 
if cotton is so important yakubov complained why is our price 
for cotton the lowest in the world 
meanwhile he said the campaign to boost cotton production has 
forced farms to poison the environment with chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides our region is on the verge of ecological disaster 
he said 
the current violence began according to uzbek reports with a 
marketplace dispute over the price of strawberries that ignited 
smouldering resentment among uzbeks over what they see as 
preferential treatment of the minority

a new round of elections will be held june 
18 for 33 lower house seats left open after voters rejected the 
communist leaders who were the sole candidates 
holding the new elections could smooth over the delicate 
situation that resulted from the opposition solidarity movements 
victory in the voting on sunday for the current lower house the 
sejm and a new senate 
solidarity union leader lech walesa met with government officials 
to work out a solution and the two sides agreed to hold the new 
elections to fill 33 of the 35 seats reserved for communist 
partybacked candidates the communists took a majority vote for 
only two of the seats 
politburo member janusz reykowski said the elections would be 
held a week from sunday he made the announcement late thursday 
hours after official election returns showed the breadth of 
solidaritys victory in polands most open balloting in 42 years 
in the voting for the new 100seat senate solidarity won 92 
seats and the other eight were undecided all seats in that chamber 
were openly contested by opposition and communistbacked candidates 
independent candidates were also allowed to run for 161 seats in 
the 460seat sejm and won 160 of them one will be decided in a 
runoff 
of the remaining 299 seats in the sejm 264 were contested among 
candidates from the communist coalition because of the large number 
of candidates only three seats were won outright and the other 261 
will be filled in the runoffs also june 18 
reykowski said it was not known yet who would run for the seats 
in his first comments since the balloting polish leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski was quoted as saying the party would be willing 
to give up power completely if it loses the next elections in 1993 
which he said should be completely free 
this years election limited how many seats solidarity could seek 
i would like to see totally free elections because i think a 
state of political solutions and social relations would make them 
possible the british daily the independent quoted him as saying 
asked about party willingness to yield power if defeated he was 
quoted as saying it is logical that if you talk about free 
elections one assumes any outcome is possible 
the solidarity victory of almost all the seats in the newly 
created senate gives the opposition power to veto sejm legislation 
and its representation in the sejm can keep that body from mustering 
the twothirds necessary to override a veto 
a joint communique thursday night said solidarity realizing 
the seriousness of the situation decided not to voice resistance 
to the proposal made by the coalition government side 
the problem was delicate for solidarity it was concerned over 
countering voters will by seating the rejected officials but it 
saw strong political reasons to have senior communist coalition 
leaders participating in parliament 
an agreement in april between solidarity and the government said 
299 seats of the 460seat chamber would go to the governing 
coalition and 161 would go to democratically elected independents

fiftyseven innercity children got a surprising 
elementary school graduation gift a guarantee of college if they 
finish high school 
atlanta businessman john h mcdonald made the pledge at the 
minnie howell elementary school graduation thursday night 
in addition to the money involved the children will get guidance 
both in and out of the classroom said llewellyn haden jr founder 
of the atlanta chapter of the i have a dream program 
we want them to have a shot at life like others who have been 
more fortunate mcdonald said 
he would not disclose how much money was involved in the program 
but haden said money is not the problem in sending the youngsters to 
college 
thousands of dollars in national scholarships for innercity 
black youths go unused each year haden said and some of that money 
can be used to supplement mcdonalds sponsorship 
what really counts is opening the horizons for children whose 
surroundings of poverty and crime often discourage success haden 
said 
we get them involved culturally and involve them with different 
people so they know what there is to dream about because they 
cant dream about something if they dont know it exists haden 
said 
new york businessman eugene lang announced the creation of i have 
a dream in a 1982 speech to ps 121 the harlem school he attended 
as a child 
the program now operates in 26 cities nationwide and involves 
about 6000 students 
the program hires a project coordinator to live in the targeted 
students neighborhoods and interact with them daily they visit 
colleges attend cultural events and meet with people in different 
occupations 
these kids have zero selfconfidence haden said we have 
to teach them things we simply take for granted public speaking 
manners eating correctly how to fill out a job application

the government launched a crackdown on the radicals after the 
troopers were killed many dissidents have been jailed and their 
rallies blocked by major shows of police strength

weightloss advocate dick gregory is suing 
two companies for 50 million saying they falsely took credit for 
helping a man shed nearly a halfton of fat 
the former comedians lawsuit filed thursday in federal district 
court here said the companies ran a television commercial in which 
walter hudson credited their product for helping him lose over 900 
pounds 
hudson attracted gregorys attention in september 1987 when his 
estimated 1200pound bulk became wedged in a door frame he had not 
left the confines of his bedroom and bathroom for more than 15 years 
and had not worn clothes in a decade 
at the time he weighed several hundred pounds more than the 
person listed by the guinness book of world records as the heaviest 
living man 
gregory who markets dick gregorys slimsafe bahamian diet 
nutritional drink mix put hudson on a rigorous diet substituting 
liquid for his breakfast of a dozen eggs and his dinner of two 
chickens 
gregory set a target weight of 190 pounds and hudson lost 600 in 
five months under constant supervision of gregorys staff the 
lawsuit contends 
after several months hudson went on his own diet after balking 
when gregory asked him to go to his clinic in the bahamas 
the suit does not name hudson 
i think those two companies just took advantage of him 
gregory said from shreveport la where he was arrested thursday 
for picketing shops that sell drug paraphernalia you have to 
understand that hadnt been out of his house in 19 years 
the suit filed by dick gregory health enterprises inc of 
chicago names media arts international ltd of arizona and twin 
star production inc of delaware it focuses on a 40minute 
commercial titled the walter hudson story which promotes the 
optatrym diet system that the companies market and distribute 
the commercial features a talkshow format with hudson saying 
that once i started with this system then a complete turnabout 
occurred an announcer calls optatrym the weight loss system that 
helped walter lose over 900 pounds of fat the lawsuit says 
gregory also requested a preliminary injunction stopping the 
advertisements which run on secondary television stations 
the commercial never mentions gregorys products according to 
the suit although gregory said his product can be seen in the 
background 
hudsons attorney philip asbury said he has represented his 
client for only a month and did not know about the lawsuit he said 
he was unable to reach hudson for comment 
calls to the two companies werent answered thursday 
gregory and two ministers who were protesting with him in 
shreveport were released after being booked on misdemeanor charges 
of refusing to leave a place of business and blocking a public 
passageway

a modified water wheel that one 
researcher described as an automatic rolaids dispenser has been 
installed on a trout stream to combat acid rain pollution 
the powdered calcium carbonate we use is the same stuff thats 
in the antacid tablets that you eat and it does the same thing 
ken simmons of the cooperative fisheries research unit at the 
university of massachusetts said thursday 
the waterpower device installed at whetstone brook in wendell 
mass by the us fish and wildlife service provides a steady 
dribble of basic lime to buffer the streams acidity 
the doser is the first of its type to go into operation in a 25 
million state and federal research project 
a similar machine is going on stream in tennessee and a 
slightly different machine that grinds up limestone before dumping 
the residue in the water has been treating a west virginia stream 
since december said kent schreiber who heads the program 
the agency is also working with minnesota officials on liming a 
lake and with new york on treating a wild watershed in the 
adirondacks by using aircraft to dump powdered lime on the forest 
floor he said 
trout and other stream life are particularily vulnerable because 
heavy rains or runoff from melting snow can raise a streams acidity 
sharply within a few hours schreiber said 
the water wheels on the devices are geared to automatically 
increase the dosages of limestone required as the stream flow rises 
one of the pleasant side effects weve found is some of the 
limestone settles into the sediment where it can have a 
longerlasting effect he said 
obviously because of the amount of limestone involved this 
isnt the sort of thing that can be done to every stream but the 
aim of our project is to see what can be done and the effects on the 
water and the fish and invertebrates in a variety of situations 
treating the isolated 30foot wide onefoot deep whetstone brook 
will require about 60 tons of powdered limestone a year simmons 
said about 24 tons of the chemicals are stored in two 15foot silos 
built along the stream with the help of volunteers from the local 
chapter of trout unlimited 
so far weve found its worked surprisingly well said 
simmons although we have also found that powdered limestone cake 
is one of the most difficult things to work with particularily in 
hot humid weather 
the machine was almost swamped during mays record rains he 
said but kept ph levels at a nearly neutral 65 during the storms 
the ph of untreated water upstream fell to 5 a level that threatens 
trout he said

the european economic community decided today 
to ban ivory imports from africa and support international efforts 
to protect the elephants from extinction 
the 12 eec environment ministers who had been pressed by britain 
to discuss the problem said the ban was necessary because the 
remaining african elephants were being decimated by hunters that 
covet their ivory tusks 
the eec is estimated to account for some 20 percent of world 
demand of ivory which has become more expensive as supplies 
worldwide have diminished asians in particular form a large market 
for ivory 
the ministers instructed the executive eec commission to draft 
measures to enforce the ban which will then become effective 
immediately throughout the common market 
a european official who asked not to be named said the 
commission proposals could be made at the next meeting of eec 
environment ministers possibly next month 
meanwhile individual member countries were asked to take urgent 
measures to ban all imports of ivory either raw or transformed for 
jewelry or other uses 
the 12 environment ministers also decided to have african 
elephants listed among animals threatened with extinction at the 
next international conference on animal protection in october 
the european commission was instructed to make proposals to that 
effect

president roh taewoo has decided not 
to hold a promised midterm referendum on his administration and will 
complete his full fiveyear term the head of the governing party 
said today 
park jyunkyu chairman of the democratic justice party also 
told the associated press in an interview that the gradual 
withdrawal of us forces from south korea could begin in 1992 if 
the seoul government is confident it can defend itself against 
communist north korea 
park said roh had ruled out any vote of confidence because such 
balloting could create political unrest roh has yet to make an 
official announcement on the referendum 
were excluding any possibility of a national referendum on 
roh park said the president is going to perform his duties up 
to the last day of his term we feel thats what the majority of the 
people want 
roh had promised before presidential elections in december 1987 
to hold a referendum on his performance after the september 1988 
olympic games in seoul roh a former general won the elections 
after rival opposition leaders split the opposition vote 
roh postponed a referendum in march saying it threatened to 
create a major political confrontation some opposition leaders had 
said roh would have to resign if he lost the referendum 
park said the government was not ruling out national referendums 
on major issues but there would be no vote that would require roh 
to resign if the administration lost he said opinion polls clearly 
showed public sentiment was against a referendum 
park also said public opposition to antigovernment dissidents 
was growing and the dissidents were losing strength he said the 
government had cracked down on dissidents because they posed a 
violent threat to the government and the public had to be reassured 
police today used tear gas to break up a protest by radical 
students demanding to go to north korea and troopers raided a seoul 
college to search for procommunist literature three hundred 
students were reported arrested 
on foreign affairs park said he did not see much hope for a 
quick end to the bitter confrontation with communist north korea he 
said a recent south korean drive to improve relations failed to make 
substantial progress 
we were too unrealistic he said 
park also expressed concern that recent unrest in china may 
prompt north koreas totalitarian government to enforce its rule and 
block liberalization the one hope for improving relations was the 
norths growing economic crisis and its desperate need for aid from 
south korea and other nations he said 
the korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 and the north 
invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war 
park said he favors a longterm us military presence in the 
south but gradual withdrawal could begin from 1992 if seoul is 
confident it can defend itself against the north some dissidents 
have called for expulsion of the 43000 us troops based in the 
south 
the party chairman also said south korea has to end political 
quarreling over the legacy of the authoritarian regime of former 
president chun doohwan chun a former general who took power with 
military backing in 1980 stepped down in 1988 at the end of his 
term and is now living in rural exile 
opposition parties have been demanding chun atone for 
humanrights abuses and corruption under his rule park said chun 
was responsibile for any abuses under his government and roh could 
not be blamed even though he was one of chuns closest associates 
and his chosen successor 
park said he did not know how the dispute which has dominated 
domestic politics could be settled since the opposition appeared 
determined to punish chun they want to see some suffering he 
said

prime minister sousuke uno today refused to respond 
as a questioner in parliament broke precedent by asking him about a 
news report claiming he kept a highly paid geisha as his mistress 
uno who previously denied the report to journalists said he 
would not comment on it in a public forum 
the report surfaced last weekend in the sunday mainichi magazine 
which broke with japanese journalism tradition by publishing or 
broadcasting reports on such liaisons by government officials 
the magazines story was not picked up at first by major 
newspapers or national television but the question on the issue in 
the upper house of the diet japans parliament was reported by 
kyodo news service and on the evening television news by japan 
broadcasting corp 
socialist manae kubota an activist on womens rights posed uno 
a threepronged question why were there no women in the cabinet he 
formed last friday what did he think about prostitution and 
because the washington post had published an article on the 
allegation that he had kept a geisha mistress if its not true 
you should clearly protest 
uno replied only i will refrain from commenting publicly on 
such a kind of report concerning myself 
miss kubota later told the associated press she brought up the 
question because she thought the geisha story reflected badly on the 
prime ministers integrity and japans image 
it is true that an affair of that sort is often tolerated in 
japanese society however i firmly believe the prime minister 
should quit if the scandal was true she said 
uno 66 took office a week ago in the midst of a bribery scandal 
that forced the resignation of his predecessor noboru takeshita 
unos main qualifications were that he was believed free of 
scandal and that his experience as foreign minister would serve 
japan well at a time of trade tensions and during the summit this 
summer of the seven industralized democracies 
but he is not regarded as a strong politician and some analysts 
doubt he will last more than a few months as his longgoverning 
liberal democratic party sorts itself out in the wake of the recruit 
bribery scandal 
miss kubota said she felt uno may not be fit to represent japan 
abroad buying prostitutes isnt tolerated in international 
society she said 
the sunday mainichi article quoted an unidentified 40yearold 
woman as saying uno had paid her 2100 a month over a fourmonth 
period in 1985 
he is not a man of noble character the article quoted the 
woman as saying i dont want him to use politics the same way he 
treated me 
geishas are women highly trained in music dance and making 
conversation while they are not prostitutes some develop intimate 
relationships with customers who become their patrons and in japan 
it has long been considered not unusual for wealthy and powerful men 
to have such relations 
uno however denied the liaison when asked by reporters early 
this week 
gregory clark professor of japan studies at sophia university 
said it may have been the first time a prime minister was asked 
directly about such a relationship in the diet 
clark thought the issue has arisen in japan partly because of a 
descent to what he called gutter journalism 
but shuntaro torigoe editor in chief of the sunday mainichi 
said he published the article because he wanted to bring issues of 
social ethics into the public arena 
we also want americans who are critical of politicians to 
know that in japan we are changing he added

president pw botha today 
extended the national state of emergency for a fourth year in a bid 
to quell further black unrest and maintain a clampdown on opposition 
political groups 
despite a sharp decline in political violence during the past 
year botha said black revolutionaries are still plotting to 
undermine his whiteled government 
by applying the emergency measures the government succeeded in 
stopping the widespread violence by radicals botha said 
however botha said in his statement that revolutionaries are 
continuing underground to mobilize and to exert their influence 
and unrestrelated violence is still unacceptably high 
antiapartheid groups said bothas decision would further 
polarize the deeply divided country 
the apartheid policy is so acutely unacceptable to the majority 
of the people of south africa that apartheid government can be 
maintained only by force said zach de beer the white leader of 
the antiapartheid democratic party 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
the reimposition of the emergency will be a recipe for 
conflict the mostly black congress of south african trade unions 
the countrys largest labor federation said in a statement 
the government proclamation formally extending the emergency made 
no changes to the existing regulations the wideranging 
restrictions make it illegal to call for boycotts or foreign 
sanctions to seek to undermine the security forces or to report on 
police activity or unrest without permission most forms of peaceful 
protest also are banned 
a senior police official gen johan van der merwe told a news 
briefing that all 32 organizations banned the past three years would 
remain restricted 
he also said restrictions including house arrest prohibitions on 
the right to work speak publicly participate in political 
activity or travel would be reimposed on about 500 people 
about 30000 people almost all of them black have been detained 
without charge for varying lengths of time during the emergency 
although fewer than 100 currently are being held now 
after a hunger strike among detainees this year hundreds were 
freed but restrictions were placed on their activities 
van der merwe said one of the main reasons for continuing the 
state of emergency was indications the september parliamentary 
elections would be the target of terrorist actions parliament 
has chambers for whites asians and people of mixed race but no 
representation for the black majority 
fw de klerk leader of the governing national party and bothas 
designated successor said he supported the renewal of the state of 
emergency the national party is viewed as virtually certain to win 
the september elections and botha has indicated he will step down 
at that time 
when he imposed the national state of emergency on june 12 1986 
botha said the normal law of the land was inadequate to maintain 
order at a time when protests mob violence clashes between police 
and black township residents spread across the country 
the violence which took at least 3000 lives almost all black 
has dropped dramatically 
the only major ongoing conflict is in the townships around durban 
and pietermaritzburg two southeastern cities where rival black 
groups are locked in a bitter power struggle 
elsewhere today a limpet mine exploded at a deserted muncipal 
office building in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
it was the 24th bombing this year but no one has been killed in any 
of the attacks 
there have been nearly 200 bombings injuring 680 people and 
killing 35 during the state of emergency

chikane 38 told reporters thursday that the illness forced him 
to skip a meeting may 18 with president bush to discuss apartheid 
chikane said he was in the united states as part of a council 
delegation that included anglican bishop desmond tutu 
if his luggage was contaminated he said he could not speculate 
whether it was accidental or deliberate i do not remember being 
near any farming area or near any war zone where such chemicals 
could be in use he said 
chikane said his first bout of illness came when he was traveling 
to namibia on april 23 where he was hospitalized briefly and that 
he seemed to be stricken whenever he came in contact with his 
luggage or its contents 
i believe it will be to everyones interest that this matter be 
thoroughly investigated back at home to clear up any uncertainties 
suspicions and even speculations relating to this matter chikane 
said 
chikane was hospitalized on four separate occasions from may 12 
to may 27 at university of wisconsin hospitals dr daniel j smith 
said the only common denominator of the four instances was that 
chikane was living out of a suitcase 
hospital officials said his symptoms were similar to those from 
exposure to chemicals in pesticides but that the cause was not 
identified smith said the chemical might have been organophosphate 
anticholinesterase but that more tests were required before anyone 
could be certain organophosphates are commonly used in pesticides 
in all cases i felt nauseous i started sweating salivating 
and vomited chikane said my body started shaking and 
twitching my eyes became watery and my vision blurred i could 
hardly walk or turn my body in a sleeping position

the nato allies agreed today to retain 
their goal of boosting annual defense budgets by 3 percent even 
though they are pushing for deep military cuts at talks with the 
soviet bloc 
in a statement at the end of a twoday strategy session defense 
ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization acknowledged 
that many allies including the united states have failed to 
achieve the 3 percent growth rate in real terms because of economic 
pressures 
however they said that target must remain in place to secure 
strong defenses as long as the eastwest talks in vienna on 
conventional force cuts in europe have not yielded an accord 
to sustain a credible deterrent there remains at least for 
the time being a continuing need to increase defense spending to 
redress existing deficiencies in conventional defense the 
statement said 
there was broad agreement that sound defenses are constantly 
kept up to date nato secretary general manfred woerner told 
reporters after the meeting saying the warsaw pact retained a 
2to1 superiority over nato in conventional forces to reduce our 
defense efforts in such a situation would be unwise he said 
the ministers also discussed president bushs proposal to remove 
30000 us troops and 325000 soviet soldiers from europe and to 
reduce the number of nato combat aircraft by 750 and warsaw pact 
planes by 3000 bush said such reductions would bring the two sides 
to equal strength in those areas 
bushs offer followed several announcements of proposed cuts and 
unilateral reductions by soviet president mikhail gorbachev in 
december gorbachev said 50000 red army troops would be withdrawn 
from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary by the end of 1990 he 
has also announced removal of 500 shortrange nuclear arms from 
europe 
of bushs proposed 15 percent cut in combat aircraft us 
defense secretary dick cheney said we are confident that we can 
make those adjustments he said these cuts can be made in nato air 
forces without scrapping british and french nuclearcapable aircraft 
cheney said he told the allies the proposals exclude 72 f16 
jetfighters to be moved from torrejon air base near madrid spain 
to southern italy the planes must be restationed because spain 
ended a basing accord with the united states 
officials said the proposed cuts in aircraft would leave 
16member nato and the sevennation warsaw pact each with about 
4600 combat aircraft in europe 
bush proposed at last weeks nato summit that the east and west 
agree within a year on these cuts and others already proposed for 
tanks armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces the vienna 
talks began earlier this year 
natos 3 percent growth target is a longstanding but elusive 
goal in december the alliance issued a lengthy report pinpointing 
nations that fail to maintain even minimum defenses 
even so cheney said that while most countries do not meet the 
target it remains an objective we would like to pursue 
he said economic pressures forced him to slice 10 billion from 
the pentagon budget he said the reductions include closing 86 
military bases in the united states but none overseas

a womans relationships with other men after she filed a paternity 
suit against mayor coleman a young a newspaper reported today 
young and police chief william hart denied knowledge of the 
investigation but detroit free press quoted police sources as 
saying that the unit was seeking information that could be used in 
case annivory calverts suit against young went to trial 
calvert 34 a former assistant director of the city department 
of public works filed the lawsuit jan 27 alleging that young 
fathered her son in 1982 the suit was filed shortly before calvert 
moved to fontana calif where she directs the department of public 
works 
calverts lawsuit which seeks child support and an 
acknowledgement by young that he fathered the child is pending in 
wayne county circuit court three separate tests conducted last 
month virtually proved that young 71 is the childs father and 
diminished the likelihood of a trial 
lawyers for calvert and young have been negotiating child support 
michael thomas a city employee and a former friend of calverts 
said police questioned him in february about calverts dating habits 
and whether she had had sex with any of her dates

the newspaper identified as the commanding officer of a special 
investigative unit attached to the chiefs staff chief william 
hart who is not related to the inspector said the unit 
investigates sensitive matters involving detroit employees 
what this does is substantiate why i couldnt have filed this 
suit and stayed in detroit calvert said

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said 
today that president ali khamenei is qualified to be irans supreme 
leader even if it means bending the constitution the official news 
agency reported 
rafsanjani said khamenei meets conditions outlined in april by 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for his successor and that 
settling the issue quickly has stunned the world the islamic 
republic news agency reported 
khamenei 49 was selected to succeed khomeini as supreme leader 
sunday by the 80member assembly of experts chosen by khomeini in 
the early days of the revolution to determine his succession the 
appointment intially was reported as temporary but rafsanjani said 
thursday it is permanent 
iranian news reports have started calling khamenei an ayatollah 
a title reserved for the highest religious leaders even though he 
is only a middleranking cleric khameneis second term as president 
expires in october and the constitution bars him from running again 
rafsanjani 55 is the only candidate running in the aug 18 
presidential election 
rafsanjani speaking at friday prayers in tehran made his second 
public remarks in as many days concerning leadership posts 
apparently working to consolidate positions of power for the more 
moderate faction he leads 
although khomeini did not name a direct successor rafsanjani 
said the late revolutionary patriarch had hinted that khamenei was 
qualified 
rafsanjani read from an april 29 letter he said khomeini wrote to 
a constitutional review committee 
he said khomeini who died of a heart attack saturday at age 86 
wrote that his successor need not be a marja or supreme religious 
leader although that is stipulated in the constitution 
rafsanjani quoted the letter as saying 
from the start i believed and insisted that it was not 
necessary to be a marja to qualify a just mujtahid skilled 
jurist who is confirmed by the honorable experts from throughout 
the country would be sufficient 
the parliament speaker who also is acting commander of the armed 
forces said khomeini gave permission many times for officials to 
overlook the constitution 
we all accept that leadership is above the constitution he 
said 
rafsanjani himself a middleranking cleric said experience in 
executive positions is more important than strict theological 
training he asked who was more qualified to run the country he 
who is more skilled in social economic cultural and political 
issues the basic issues of state or he who is in the theological 
school 
the world had not expected such a swift transition he said 
the important thing is that with this swift selection we have 
stunned the world irna quoted him as saying it at once 
canceled all this propaganda about a power struggle and differences 
and divisions among radicals and moderates and this and that 
faction

a surge in mumps cases in recent years may be 
easing but mumps victims tend to be older than they once were the 
federal centers for disease control reported 
preliminary figures from the cdc show reported mumps cases 
dropped to 4730 last year after 7790 cases in 1986 and 12848 in 
1987 
mumps cases in the united states plunged after 1967 when the live 
mumps virus vaccine was introduced and reached a record low 2982 
cases in 1985 a 98 percent drop from 1967 the cdc said thursday 
but the report said mumps victims tend to be older than they 
were it said a third of the cases from 19851987 affected people 
age 15 or older the same age group recorded only 8 percent of the 
cases between 1967 and 1971 the first five years after the vaccine 
was licensed 
mumps can be more severe in adults than in children 
particularly for men who are occasionally made sterile by the 
disease symptoms include pain and swelling in the salivary glands 
and throat 
the cdc report said that people who got mumps during the 198687 
surge tended to be born between 1967 and 1977 when there was 
underimmunization immunization did not reach the 50 percent level 
of any age group until 1976 
the study said the surge in mumps cases was largely due to a 
failure to vaccinate not a failure of the vaccine which is about 
95 percent effective 
the report said the lowest incidence of mumps was in the district 
of columbia and 14 states where schools require proof of immunity 
from kindergarten through 12th grade

president bush says the environment is a 
moral issue and he is promising to send congress new clean air 
standards that will significantly improve every north americans 
quality of life 
the president heard conflicting advice thursday from 
industrialists and environmentalists on how to grapple with the 
issue 
both sides said the president didnt tip his hand and assured 
them he had not yet made final decisions 
administration aides speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said however that bush had already decided on many key parts of 
the legislation including tough new standards for cleaning up 
smokestack emissions that cause acid rain 
the industrialists warned the president against standards so 
stringent they hurt the economy the environmentalists said bush was 
shocked to hear that his resort home town of kennebunkport 
maine had dangerously high ozone levels last summer 
administration sources said the president also has decided on 
farreaching rigid new standards to prevent chemical contamination 
of the air extending to hundreds of businesses from paint factories 
to bakeries 
power plants and other industries that burn coal in the midwest 
many of which disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks 
without technological controls will be a key target of bushs 
cleanair attack the sources said 
meanwhile thursday a congressman released survey data compiled 
by the environmental protection agency that found more than 200 
plants emitting toxic air pollutants at levels far above federal 
standards 
rep henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on health and the environment said we 
ignore these data at our peril he added that the threat of cancer 
from plant emissions was much more widespread than commonly 
thought 
but epa officials said the survey findings were preliminary 
outofdate and not yet refined enough to calculate the impact on 
public health 
bush in a luncheon speech to ducks unlimited a hunters 
conservation group said that on monday he will unveil the most 
sweeping changes to the clean air act since it was last amended 12 
years ago 
it will significantly improve every north americans quality of 
life said the president 
he said preventing pollution is far more efficient than 
struggling to deal with problems once theyve occurred 
for too long weve focused on cleanup and penalties after the 
damage is done he said in the 1990s pollution prevention will 
go right to the source 
at the capitol senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
said bush already deserves credit for paying attention to the 
environment 
he has wholly reversed the position of the reagan 
administration on this subject mitchell told reporters during 
the reagan years the biggest obstacle to environmental cleanup 
legislation was the executive branch 
bush who portrayed himself in last years campaign as a lifelong 
environmentalist in the teddy roosevelt tradition brought the 
industrialists and environmentalists into the roosevelt room in 
separate shifts 
william d fay administrator of the clean air working group a 
business coalition said the bills that weve seen before 
congress could have a potentially dramatic impact on jobs on our 
competitiveness 
we urged him to make certain that when the dust settles on 
clean air that we have a healthy economy left said fay 
roger b smith chairman of general motors said the 
industrialists asked the president for a flexible solution that 
would be costeffective 
michael fischer executive director of the sierra club said bush 
assured environmentalists that the deck is not stacked 
ruth caplan executive director of environmental action said 
he was shocked to know that last summer in kennebunkport there 
were many days in which there were serious health problems from 
ozone smog 
i think he is very concerned about clean air she said 
the environmentalists want action not only on acid raid but 
also on air toxics and on ozonesmog said caplan 
fred krupp executive director of the environmental defense fund 
said we told him that the key was going to be whether he comes up 
with an acid rain bill that gets 12 million tons of sulfur dioxide 
emissions out of the air

the soviet unions main spokesman said 
today the kremlin was surprised by chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators and that soviet officials have been 
unable to reach beijing 
we cant get through either foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov said in an interview 
he said soviet officials were surprised at the means with which 
chinese communist leaders suppressed student demonstrators who had 
been rallying peacefully for weeks in support of broader reforms 
asked if he was surprised by the brutality of the crackdown on 
the chinese protests gerasimov said we hadnt expected this 
he said soviet authorities were extremely dismayed at beijings 
actions

since the new soviet congress issued an extremely guarded statement 
tuesday saying events in china were an internal affair 
gerasimov indicated that he and other soviet officials who 
traveled to beijing last month for the first sinosoviet summit in 
30 years were aware of the massive student demonstrations which 
occurred during the visit but avoided focusing their talks on 
chinas domestic unrest because of protocol 
asked whether senior kremlin officials have let beijing leaders 
know of their concern over the military crackdown gerasimov said 
telephone contact with beijing the chinese capital had been 
impossible since chinese troops cleared students from tiananmen 
square on june 3 and 4 
hundreds if not thousands of protesters were reported killed by 
troops acting on orders from chinese hardliners led by conservative 
premier li peng 
gerasimov and numerous other soviet officials are in bonn to

nato ambassadors today proposed an 
unprecedented exchange of information among east west and neutral 
nations about military forces in europe the worlds most heavily 
armed continent 
the proposal made at talks between 35 nations on building 
confidence on european security calls for a data bank that would 
make available details on armed forces and weapons deployment arms 
procurement and other matters 
it is one of a series of suggestions presented by the netherlands 
on behalf of nato at a closed session of the conference attended by 
the united states and canada the soviet union and all european 
nations except albania 
they are discussing confidence and securitybuilding measures to 
verify and enhance agreements reached at parallel vienna talks 
between the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
us ambassador john j maresca speaking at a news conference 
after the proposal was outlined said the suggestions on pooling 
military information will impose burdens on all of us 
no country has the habit of receiving inspectors regularly into 
its military bases he said referring to proposals for random 
inspections in each nation at least three times a year this kind 
of openness helps to enhance security 
dutch ambassador hans meesman told reporters we have a duty to 
see that secrecy on military matters does not have a chance to undo 
a new kind of europe secrecy has done a lot to undermine 
confidence in the past 
east german ambassador guenter buehring reportedly said the 
proposals would be carefully studied 
the western alliance proposes each country 
provide information by dec 15 each year on weapons procurement 
programs for the following year and exact deployment of troops down 
to regiment or brigade level their peacetime strength and equipment 
submit at seven days notice to at least three inspections a 
year 
give more exact information about maneuvers and advance notice 
of all maneuvers involving 50000 troops or more 
improve working facilities for inspectors observation of 
maneuvers and for foreign military attaches and journalists

more people might use living wills to avoid futile 
medical treatment if the documents set down specific guidelines for 
care rather than vaguely rejecting heroic measures to maintain 
life two doctors say 
only 9 percent of americans have living wills although more than 
75 percent of the states legally recognize them the doctors noted 
in todays journal of the american medical association 
living wills provide people a way of saying that if they become 
ill or injured with no hope of recovery they do not want to be kept 
alive indefinitly by mechanical means such as by a respirator 
which they may believe merely prolongs dying 
samples of living wills are apparently not reaching physicians 
offices or hospitals said the doctors linda l emanuel of 
massachusetts general hospital and ezekiel j emanuel of beth israel 
hospital in boston 
the two recommended a document that outlines righttodie 
dilemmas and appropriate treatments 
they said living wills tend to be written in vague terms for 
example some say care should be stopped when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery or when such care 
constitutes heroic measures 
such phrases are open to multiple interpretations on when to 
act and on what interventions the patient would desire said the 
doctors 
people who sign living wills often do so without discussing it 
with their doctors leaving the physicians ignorant of the patients 
wishes the authors said 
many people choose to get around such limitations by giving all 
decisionmaking authority to a relative but surveys show the 
relative often does not know what type of care the patient would 
want said the doctors who proposed a fourpage document that lets 
the patient indicate the treatments he would find acceptable in four 
situations 
a coma with no known hope of regaining awareness 
a coma with a small likelihood of recovering fully a 
slightly larger likelihood of recovering with brain damage and 
a much larger likelihood of dying 
irreversible brain damage or disease accompanied by a terminal 
illness 
irreversible brain damage or disease that makes speaking or 
recognizing people impossible but is not accompanied by terminal 
illness 
for each category the document would list 12 possible 
treatments including cardiopulmonary resuscitation mechanical 
breathing artificial feeding surgery drugs and simple diagnostic 
tests 
the form would not eliminate all medical or legal uncertainty 
but it would provide a tangible expression of the patients 
wishes the doctors said

candidate to replace zhao was present as was vice premier yao 
yilin a conservative economist and wan li current national 
peoples congress chief 
the television also showed deng and the others shaking hands with 
troops inside the great hall of the people 
dengs appearance with the other hardliners gave an impression of 
party unity as the military extended its control over the capital 
and police in other large cities began rounding up participants in 
largescale disturbances that have occurred since the attack on 
beijing on june 3 and 4 
television showed what appeared to be burned out smoldering 
blocks in chengdu the capital of sichuan province violent

one western diplomat dont let people tell you things are calming 
down theyre not

markets city buses rolled past the tanks on tiananmen square for 
the first time since june 3 there were no reports of soldiers 
firing on crowds 
more than a dozen tanks and hundreds of armored personnel 
carriers could be seen on the square which has been turned into a 
vast military encampment since the army ousted student protesters 
with gunfire 
concern that factional fighting between rival military groups 
might turn beijing into a killing field abated as troops from 
various armies took up stations inside the city without major 
conflicts 
those fears prompted an exodus of foreigners from the capital 
with most embassies ordering out all dependents and nonessential 
staff and many arranging special flights out 
the us embassy said registered americans in china had dropped 
from 8800 before the military crackdown to less than 5000 less 
than 400 americans were in beijing down from 1500

president mikhail s gorbachev today denied he was 
hungry for power and told members of the new congress that he is in 
no danger of being removed from office or assassinated 
also today premier nikolai i ryzhkov told the final session of 
the congress of peoples deputies the soviet union has a foreign 
debt of nearly 52 billion it was the first time the debt figure 
was officiallly disclosed 
he said the amount of the debt explains why the government should 
not borrow more from western sources to import more consumer goods 
gorbachev was reacting to criticism from some deputies that for 
one man to be both president of the congress and communist party 
chief makes him too powerful i categorically reject the hints 
that i am trying to concentrate power in my own hands he said 
and acknowledging persistent rumors he said he heard from 
deputies gorbachev told the congress there was no danger of a 
coup or anything like that 
lets end these rumors he told the nationally broadcast 
session in four years i have already died seven times and my 
family was killed three times 
gorbachev told the 2250 deputies that the congress can be 
considered the biggest event in the history of the soviet state 
the twoweek session marked the first time in seven decades the 
kremlin has permitted open debate by popularly elected 
representatives and it produced outspoken criticism of the 
government the communist party gorbachev and his efforts to deal 
with the nations economic problems 
gorbachev said he understood the general dissatisfaction 
expressed by the deputies but he claimed the session marked a new 
stage of perestroika his program to modernize soviet society 
maverick communist boris n yeltsin and others told congress 
gorbachev was accumulating too much power yeltsin said last week 
the extraordinary powers gorbachev had been given in the 
political overhaul that created the congress and a stronger 
presidency could lead to a new dictatorship 
this is alien to me to my views my outlook and my 
character gorbachev said i as general secretary and 
president have no other policy than perestroika democratization 
and glasnost in this i see the point of my life and my work 
ryzhkov who as premier heads the ministries charged with 
carrying out gorbachevs reforms used the new debt figure as an 
argument against deputies who have called for more foreign loans and 
increased imports to ease the countrys consumer crisis 
a western diplomat said the debt figure of 34 billion rubles 
which amounts to 519 billion at the official exchange rate is 
about what foreign analysts estimated but the longsecretive soviet 
union has never acknowledged it 
the soviet union has an excellent repayment record with western 
creditors and the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the debt level is considered relatively small for the size of 
the nations economy 
the premier told congress that in order to give deputies a 
clear idea of our possibilities in this area he would perhaps 
for the first time report that the governments current foreign 
debt is 34 billion rubles 
in the current year he said the soviet union expects an income 
of 244 billion in convertible currency it expects to spend most 
of that sum on foreign technology chemicals raw materials and 
food leaving only 38 billion he said 
but the cost of financing existing debt is 184 billion a year 
he said indicating that the pattern of deficit spending is 
continuing 
so should we take more loans he asked should the 
situation be aggravated further 
the ruble is not traded on international currency markets and 
its value for foreign trade is set by the government which must use 
other currencies or valuable commodities such as gold or oil to pay 
its foreign obligations 
an earlier speech on the economy won a standing ovation from 
several deputies for economist gavriil popov one of the more 
reformminded delegates 
popov who listed the expenses that must not be cut despite the 
massive budget deficit said the soviet union should compensate the 
afghan people for the damage done by the eightyear soviet military 
presence there and should pay all the soviet veterans of the war 
in order for us not to be ashamed to look into their eyes

with the military crackdown in china the legacy of 
empire has returned to haunt the british government 
since chinese troops crushed prodemocracy protests in tiananmen 
square last weekend britains agreement to hand over the coastal 
colony of hong kong to neighboring china in 1997 looks to many 
people like a giant betrayal 
calls are mounting for britain to open its doors to hong kongs 
32 million chinese who hold british passports and to renegotiate or 
even scrap the agreement prime minister margaret thatcher signed in 
1984 
but letting in more immigrants is politically unpopular and 
renegotiating the agreement appears diplomatically impossible 
mrs thatcher has reaffirmed the agreement and all she has 
promised the fearful hong kong residents is greater flexibility 
in the immigration rules these allow discretion over letting in 
senior public servants and people with private incomes 
for the most part the shutters britain brought down in 1962 to 
block immigration from the former empire will remain in place 
before the nationality act was passed every citizen of a colony 
past or present including the population of the entire indian 
subcontinent had the right to settle in this island of 57 million 
people 
in a television interview in hong kong today the leader of 
britains centrist liberal and social democrats paddy ashdown said 
his country should allow all hong kong residents who want to 
resettle to do so 
i dont say it is immediately practical he added but i do 
believe that britain has a moral responsibility to take the lead in 
this issue 
after a meeting with ashdown local legislators issued a 
statement saying we reiterate our position that britain has a 
fundamental moral duty to extend the right to abode to all the 
british nationals in hong kong 
one lawmaker martin lee again called for reconsideration of the 
agreement on turning hong kong back to chinese rule 
elsewhere in the colony protesters again demonstrated in support 
of the prodemocracy campaign suppressed by chinese authorities 
led by more than 100 priests 7000 roman catholics attended a 
mass at a sports stadium to mourn the beijing victims hundres and 
perhaps thousands of people were killed during the crackdown in 
tiananmen square 
about 100 fishing boats sailed through hong kong harbor and the 
lead vessels displayed a black banner saying love democracy love 
freedom 
in britain nearly 30 years after the country dismantled most of 
its globegirdling empire the crisis has reopened old wounds and 
raised painful questions of duty and honor 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe resorted to saying chinas 
aging hardline communists may be gone by 1997 that chinas 
economy will always need hong kongs capitalism and britain has no 
option but to hand over the colony 
the spectator an influential weekly usually sympathetic to mrs 
thatcher wrote if 325 million people are to be abandoned 
she will have presided over the most discreditable british policy of 
the 20th century 
the china crisis has also highlighted longtime charges that the 
immigration rules are aimed mainly at keeping out blacks and asians 
balking at easing the law for hong kong howe warned the house of 
commons against a massive new immigration commitment which could 
more than double the ethnic minority population of the united 
kingdom 
critics recall that mrs thatcher went to war against argentina 
in 1982 to reclaim the windswept falkland islands and gave its 1900 
people mostly sheep farming families the right to settle in 
britain 
britain has also given settlement rights to the 30000 residents 
of gibraltar which wants to remain british but is claimed by 
neighboring spain 
the falklanders and the gibraltarians are all white and few in 
number 
the government rejects the racism charge pointing out that since 
world war ii britain has accepted some 16 million nonwhite 
immigrants from former colonies in 1972 it waived the rules to 
accept some 30000 indiandescended asians expelled from uganda a 
former colony by dictator idi amin 
china ceded hong kong a port that has turned into a major 
financial center to britain in 1898 after a 19th century trade war 
most of the territory was on a 99year lease 
under the 1984 britishchinese agreement china promised to allow 
capitalism to exist under communism for 50 years in a government run 
by hong kongs residents without chinese interference 
critics claim china could override treaty obligations that 
safeguard its autonomy and say the military assault to quash a 
prodemocracy movement shows that chinese leaders cannot be trusted 
before sunday british officials used to portray the 1984 
agreement as at best a diplomatic triumph negotiated with a 
liberalizing china 
now the agreement may herald what londons liberal guardian 
newspaper called a pretty repulsive end to empire

time inc chairman j richard munro has lashed 
out at the head of paramount communications inc claiming he broke 
a promise not to pursue time by launching a hostile 107 billion 
bid 
youve changed the name of your corporation but its still 
engulf and devour munro wrote in a threepage letter to 
paramount chairman martin s davis 
paramount which made the letter public thursday recently 
changed its name from gulf amp western the companys reputation for 
actively pursuing acquisitions in the 1960s and 1970s won it the 
nickname engulf and devour 
that moniker was used by mel brooks as the name of a fictional 
movie studio in the film silent movie 
on a personal level im disappointed that i cant rely on you 
as a man of your word the letter said calling paramounts offer 
illconceived 
davis responded by saying that time voluntarily relinquished 
its independence recently by agreeing to merge with warner 
communications inc paramounts bid threatens to dash the 
timewarner deal which would create the worlds biggest media and 
entertainment concern 
meanwhile time stock slipped a bit as some stock traders took 
quick profits after wednesdays meteoric rise 
time fell 2 a share to close at 168 in new york stock exchange 
composite trading thursday it had soared 44 wednesday after 
paramounts announcement of its 175ashare offer 
securities analysts said traders and arbitragers who play 
takeover stocks may not have liked everything they saw when they got 
their first good look at paramounts offer 
the offer prospectus contained several pages of cautions to 
investors and qualifications about the deal including the need for 
government approval said j kendrick noble an analyst with 
painewebber inc 
it looks like its going to be a long process and it might not 
go through at all noble said 
the government might take months to rule on antitrust 
implications of a paramount buyout said fred anschel who follows 
time for dean witter reynolds inc paramount and time both have 
extensive holdings in publishing and cable television 
some arbitragers may be realizing that and may be turning off 
the stock for that reason anschel said 
meanwhile paramount stock surged 362 to close at 5837 and 
stock in warner communications whose planned merger with time is 
threatened by the paramount bid rose 3 to 5650 
noble said speculation that bids could emerge for paramount or 
warner drove up those companies share prices 
in early trading today the stocks of all three companies were 
slightly lower time slipped an additional 50 cents to 16750 a 
share while paramount was off 25 cents to 5812 and warner was 
down 1 to 5550 
despite thursdays modest decline most traders were sticking 
with their time holdings willing to see the battle through 
there was no word thursday on what times next step would be lou 
slovinsky a time spokesman said he could not comment on the 
companys plans

saying he was used as a pawn by strangers in 
the anitabortion wars a man has filed a 10 million lawsuit

a soviet pilot who defected to turkey in a 
mig29 jet fighter was flown to the united states today after us 
authorities agreed to grant him asylum the turkish foreign ministry 
said 
an istanbul daily reported today that soviet air force capt 
alexander zuyev defected last month because he feared president 
mikhail s gorbachevs social and economic reforms would drive the 
soviet union into a civil war 
a soviet official in turkey said today that zuyev should have 
been extradited to the soviet union as moscow requested 
inal batu a foreign ministry spokesman said zuyev was handed 
over to us officials and zuyev left turkey aboard a us military 
plane early today 
zuyev landed the aircraft at the airport of the black sea coastal 
city of trabzon on may 20 and requested political asylum in the 
united states 
turkish officials appearing anxious not to damage relations with 
their neighbor sent the mig29 back to the soviet union a day after 
the incident 
turkeys decision to immediately return the fighter plane 
dismayed us authorities who hoped turkey a fellow nato member 
would permit them to inspect the aircraft and its advanced 
technology 
the soviet union immediately asked turkish officials to extradite 
the pilot saying he stole the jet fighter and shot and wounded a 
sentry guarding the aircraft at tskhakaya airport 
turkey on thursday officially rejected the soviet extradition 
request and relayed his asylum petition to the us embassy

that the accusations against zuyev were political and military 
allowing him to qualify for refugee status

by the decision to let the pilot go to the united states he said 
the soviet union would now ask us authorities to extradite him 
we insist on our position that zuyev should be extradited we 
consider him a common criminal the ambassador said at a news

to cover up his own profits in the irancontra affair they also 
allege that secord lied to congress by denying that north received 
benefits from a maze of companies known as the enterprise that 
secord and business partner albert hakim set up in the affair 
north was convicted last month of three crimes including 
accepting a 13800 home security system from secord 
the interests of judicial economy and sound administration of 
justice support consolidation judge robinson said in a twopage 
order on the secord matter 
secords lawyer thomas green argued against combining the two 
sets of charges saying his client should be tried on the 1988 
charges and that the new indictment should be dismissed 
green said the indictments are not logically related but the 
judge disagreed 
robinson said proof relating to the 1988 criminal charges would 
be admissible to prove the nine new charges 
on thursday associate independent counsel reid weingarten said 
the government would seek dismissal of broad conspiracy and theft 
counts against secord once the other charges were consolidated 
conspircy and theft counts against north also had been dismissed 
because of national security concerns intelligence agencies have 
refused to declassify material that would be needed to try those 
charges

the white house today denounced as 
repugnant calls by chinese officials for reprisals against 
student leaders of the prodemocracy demonstrations 
despite the reappearance of chinese leaders in public including 
the first view of leader deng xiaoping in more than three weeks 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it still is not clear 
who ordered the killing of civilian demonstrators in tiananmen 
square last weekend 
fitzwater told reporters that uschinese relations will not 
soon return to normal 
keep in mind that the government has murdered many many of its 
citizens we have had an incredible upheaval in that country he 
said 
citing loudspeaker calls in beijing for neighbors to turn in 
demonstrators and for punishment of student demonstrators who met 
with hardline prime minister li peng fitzwater said reprisals 
are repugnant we certainly watch this situation with grave 
concern 
the spokesman said no one doubts in terms of the overall 
government who is in charge in china but in terms of individual 
actions and individual decisions and motivations and 
responsibilities thats where we dont know 
you can watch television and see who the government is but in 
terms of individual actions and motivations we dont know he 
reiterated 
president bush in his televised news conference thursday night 
refused to fix blame for the massacre in beijing but said it would 
be extraordinarily difficult to have ties with anyone 
responsible for the bloodshed 
bush said the united states wont have normal relations with 
china until the government there recognizes demands for democracy 
despite a military crackdown that killed hundreds if not 
thousands of people in beijing bush emphasized thursday night that 
he wants to preserve the relationship with china 
but for that relationship to be normal he said it will take a 
recognition of the rights of individuals and respect for the rights 
of those who disagree 
he said i dont want to pass judgment on individual leaders 
but i want to make very clear to those leaders and to the rest of 
the world that the united states denounces the kind of brutality 
that all of us have seen on our television 
pressed on whether he could maintain relations with anyone who 
ordered the firing on unarmed students bush said it would make 
it extraordinarily difficult 
bush answered questions at the televised news conference for 33 
minutes he appeared relaxed and confident joking at times with his 
interrogators and expressing pleasure when a reporter wished his 
wife barbara happy birthday on her 64th 
bush took the opportunity to say the first lady was doing just 
fine after treatment for a thyroid problem 
on other matters bush 
said he opposed public disclosure of people who test positive 
for aids there is a certain right to privacy that we should 
respect he said adding however that people who test positive 
should inform their doctors and sexual partners 
said he will tell polish leaders during a visit next month we 
want to work with you as long as economic and prodemocracy 
reforms continue when a country moves as poland did down 
democracys path the united states should respond as best it 
could he said 
said he would not give up on his campaign to drive from power 
panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega who has been indicted in 
miami on drugsmuggling charges 
foreign policy issues dominated the questioning 
bush said he was encouraged by moscows response to his proposal 
for cutbacks in soviet and american combat troops in europe to 
275000 each 
he said agreement on that plan could ease tensions in nato about 
updating shortrange nuclear missiles a plan that west germany 
opposes 
while saying he wants to see soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
economic reforms succeed bush said i am going to keep my eyes 
wide open 
he also urged irans new leaders to help free american hostages 
in lebanon and to renounce terrorism if they want better relations 
with the united states 
on the political front in washington where congressional 
republicans and democrats are bitterly attacking each other over 
ethics issues bush said this ugliness of this climate is bad and 
i dont like it and id like to think that i could help 
he said newly elected democratic house speaker thomas foley 
tarred by a republican party circular comparing his record to that 
of a homosexual congressman had been rendered a terrible ill 
service 
bush said gop chairman lee atwater looked me right in the eye 
and said he did not know about the circular whose purported 
author mark goodin resigned as a republican press aide on 
wednesday 
discussing china bush repeatedly referred to his experience as 
us envoy to beijing in 19741975 but said us understanding of 
developments in china was very very murky 
bush said he felt a sense of personal disappointment in the 
governments turn toward violence 
asked whether chinese leader deng xiaoping was still in charge 
bush said i dont know pointing around the room of reporters 
he said and you dont know and he doesnt know and she doesnt 
know and nobody knows outside of china and thats the way the 
chinese system works 
given his personal ties with china bush was asked why he didnt 
pick up the telephone and call the countrys leaders the line was 
busy i couldnt get through he said 
defending his decision not to invoke more sanctions beyond his 
suspension of military sales to china bush said the united states 
is engaged in diplomatic efforts that he hopes will ease the 
situation 
bush said we arent going to remake the world but we should 
stand for something and theres no question in the minds of these 
students in china that the united states is standing in their 
corners

police overpowered a man who rushed toward 
pope john paul ii today while the pontiff was distributing holy 
communion at an outdoor mass the swedish national news agency tt 
reported 
a police officer confirmed that a swede was detained but he had 
no further details tt said security guards tackled the man who 
appeared to be in his 20s as he ran toward the pope at a mass 
outside this university city 
it was not immediately known how close the man got to the pope or 
whether he was armed it was the first incident during john pauls 
tour of five scandinavian countries which ends on saturday 
earlier today the pope hailed raoul wallenberg a swedish 
diplomat who saved thousands of jews from nazi death camps as an 
inspiration in the battle to protect human rights 
the pope also issued his toughest attack on abortion and 
euthanasia of his scandinavian tour declaring that whether in the 
womb or in the final phase of life a person may never be disposed 
of in order to make life easier for others 
speaking at 500yearold uppsala university the pope deplored 
great nations this century that ignored their cultural 
traditions and sought to exterminate entire populations and 
discriminate against religious and ethnic groups he praised those 
who have heroically opposed such aberrations through courageous 
acts or resistance and compassion 
i cannot fail to mention your compatriot raoul wallenberg who 
in praiseworthy fashion rescued so many members of the jewish people 
from nazi concentration camps his example inspires a dedicated 
fight for human rights 
wallenberg is credited with saving tens of thousands of hungarian 
jews from extermination his fate has been a subject of contention 
in january 1945 he was arrested by soviet troops entering 
budapest moscow has said he died in a soviet prison in 1947 but 
soviet dissident sources claim he was seen alive in the 1980s the 
swedish and us governments and private groups have called on the 
soviets to release all the facts in the case 
on the next to last day of his fivecountry tour of the 
overwhelmingly lutheran region john paul visited this religious and 
university center of sweden 35 miles from stockholm for a prayer 
service in the lutheran cathedral attended by 2000 people 
including king carl gustaf xvi and queen silvia 
about 10 demonstrators stood outside the cathedral distributing 
pamphlets reading the pope is a messenger of the devil there 
were no incidents 
making another appeal for improved relations between rome and the 
lutherans the pope said it is a challenge for us to forgive each 
other but the lord has commanded us to do so 
he then went to a nearby university hall where he stressed a 
person cannot be reduced to the status of a means or a tool of 
others 
society exists to promote the security and dignity of the 
person therefore the primary right which society must defend is the 
right to life

wholesale inflation came roaring back in may 
after a twomonth lull rising a steep 09 percent the government 
said today 
the increase in the labor departments producer price index 
primarily reflected higher prices for cars fresh vegetables and 
gasoline 
for the first five months of the year wholesale inflation for 
goods one stop short of the retail level was running at a 94 
percent annual rate more than double the 4 percent rise in 1988 and 
quadruple the 22 percent 1987 gain 
the index troubled economists earlier this year when it soared 
11 percent in january and 09 percent in february but moderate 
rises of 04 percent in both march and april had been seen as a sign 
that inflation had retreated at least a bit 
in advance of todays report many economists were predicting a 
moderatetobrisk 05 percent gain 
financial markets which have been rallying in recent weeks on 
evidence that the overheated economy is cooling enough to produce 
milder price pressures turned down modestly in early trading today 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dipped about 1 points 
in the first hour of trading 
michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser 
attributed most of the inflation so far this year to the special 
factors of energy and food and predicted better numbers ahead 
we want to remain vigilant against inflation we expect 
inflation to stabilize in the second half of the year and decline 
thereafter boskin told reporters at a white house briefing 
energy prices in may rose 33 percent a steep increase but less 
than half aprils 30month record of 72 percent for the past six 
months energy prices have surged at a 433 percent annual rate 
in may the increase was propelled by a 52 percent jump in 
gasoline prices which followed a 134 percent jump in april 
natural gas prices rose 34 percent while heating oil costs 
declined 77 percent 
food prices which had posted a rare 06 percent decline in 
april rebounded 08 percent in may the price of vegetables 
skyrocketed 264 percent as celery and tomato prices doubled and 
cabbage prices rose by onethird 
there were also significant increases for eggs rice pasta and 
chicken prices for beef pork and fish declined 
for the past six months food prices have risen at an annual rate 
of 73 percent but analysts expect that trend to moderate barring 
a repeat of last years drought 
the price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy 
sectors often taken by analysts as a truer reflection of underlying 
inflationary pressures rose 05 percent last month following an 
unusual 01 percent decline in april 
the increase in may was largely driven by a 18 percent rebound 
in auto prices following a 28 percent decline a month earlier 
the april drop was produced by manufacturers incentives to 
bolster sagging sales while a labor department analyst said the 
rebound was driven by price increases fnd 09 percent in february 
but moderate rises of 04 percent in both march and april had been 
seen as a sign that inflation had retreated at least a bit 
energy prices in may rose 33 percent a steep increase but less 
than half aprils 30month record of 72 percent for the past six 
months energy prices havergy prices have surged at a 433 percent 
annual rate 
in may the increase was propelled by a 52 percent jump in 
gasoline prices which followed a 134 percent jump in april 
natural gas prices rose 34 percent while heating oil costs 
declined 77 perceces which had posted a rar bread flour and wheat 
traders in financial markets were looking to todays report to 
provide an indication of how far and how fast the federal reserve 
board will lower interest rates 
earlier this week the fed nudged the key federal funds rate 
the interest charged banks for overnight loans down by onequarter 
of a percentage point to near 8 percent 
stock and bond markets rallied in response taking the change as 
evidence the central bank has decided to end its 15month campaign 
of fighting inflation with higher interest rates 
michael k evans president of evans economics inc in 
washington said todays report means the fed likely will wait at 
least a month before loosening credit further 
i dont think theres going to be any further easing by the fed 
until we get some good inflation numbers for more than one month 
at a time he said 
still analysts were optimistic that inflation reports eventually 
would improve economist donald ratajczak of georgia state 
university said he believed gasoline prices have now more than 
reflected the runup in crude oil prices this spring and will 
stabilize 
his view is bolstered by the deal struck wednesday by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries which set a higher 
target for crude oil production

president najib says his communist 
government must be included in any talks to end the decadelong war 
with americanbacked moslem fundamentalists 
najib also said the apparent change of policy by the united 
states and pakistan toward a political rather than military solution 
could hasten an end to afghanistans conflict 
in washington this week president bush and prime minister 
benazir bhutto of pakistan agreed to press for a political solution 
on afghanistan but they also said they will continue to arm the 
guerrillas and seek najibs fall 
how can a political solution be achieved without the lawful 
government of afghanistan the nations official bakhtar news 
agency quoted najib as saying in an interview thursday night 
we believe it is not appropriate for the united states and 
pakistan to dictate the acceptable models and prescriptions for a 
political solution to the people of afghanistan 
pakistan shares a border with afghanistan and is the main conduit 
of arms for the guerrillas 
the insurgents refuse to negotiate with najib the former chief 
of the afghan secret police who seized power in a sovietbacked coup 
10 years ago but their war has stalled since the withdrawal of the 
last soviet soldiers on feb 15 
pakistani officials say the guerrillas should be able to 
negotiate with the kabul government if najib and other leaders of 
his peoples democratic party are ousted 
they speak of a political solution but also of supplying arms 
and continuing the war najib said how can they justify this 
contradiction does the continuation of military supplies to people 
who openly refuse a political solution not mean supporting a 
continuation of war and bloodshed 
ms bhutto is concerned about 3 million afghan refugees living in 
pakistan and influential us lawmakers have told bush that merely 
continuing to arm the guerrillas is not an adequate policy 
the pakistani leader was to discuss afghanistan with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on friday 
american officials are receptive to the formation of what ms 
bhutto called a stable independent and neutral afghanistan and 
say they expect serious discussions about it with the soviet union 
washington previously refused soviet appeals for talks saying the 
resistance could win a swift military victory 
moscow has asked saudi arabia another guerrilla backer to 
persuade the fighters to negotiate kuwaits alanbaa newspaper 
reported friday quoting the soviet first deputy foreign minister 
yuli vorontsov 
saudi arabia is reluctant to do so but we are hopeful that 
eventually saudi arabia will agree it quoted vorontsov as saying 
najib said the republic of afghanistan sees with joy that 
prospects of resolving the countrys problems are emerging those 
people who until recently insisted on a military solution and 
rejected any other alternative today in principle if not in deed 
are accepting the position of the afghan government however our 
happiness would be greater if we saw that ms bhutto and mr bush 
were accompanying their remarks with good will and that they did not 
make the removal of the lawful government of afghanistan a condition 
for reaching a political solution 
najib did not refer to demands he step down the 43yearold 
president already has said he would resign if that would guarantee 
an end to the conflict which has claimed more than 1 million lives 
but he insists the government be part of any settlement

the department of housing and urban development 
has reopened an investigation into a program in which federally 
subsidized housing in island park ny allegedly was steered to 
white residents with political connections 
hud secretary jack kemp announced the probe thursday in the wake 
of a news report in which the former island park town clerk said he 
had misled hud inspectors five years ago and covered up for 
geraldine mcgann a village board member and highranking hud 
official 
mrs mcgann who last year became huds region ii administrator 
has taken a paid leave from her 68500ayear job kemp said 
thursday 
her son daniel mcgann was among those selected to purchase a 
44500 house in the program according to a 1984 hud audit his 
application was not numbered or datestamped and he was not married 
at the time the audit noted single people generally were not 
eligible for the program and the village had rejected other 
singles according to the new york times 
mrs mcgann could not be reached for comment thursday a woman 
answering the phone in her office said mrs mcgann would not be at 
work 
the new investigation was triggered by a times story saying 
officials in island park a predominantly white long island village 
which is also the hometown of republican sen alfonse damato 
had distributed federally subsidized homes to people with political 
connections and excluded blacks the times based its story in part 
on the hud audit which covered 1980 to 1984 
kemp also announced that from now on no highlevel hud employee 
may serve on state or local government boards agencies or panels 
and no hud employee at any level may serve on any such body that 
does business with the department 
damatos cousin anthony ciccimarro also benefitted from island 
parks hud program paying 40000 for one of the subsidized houses 
according to the 1984 audit 
on thursday damato denied any involvement and termed the 
program excellent 
i know of no abuse and i know of no preferential treatment 
damato said at a news conference in his capitol hill offices i 
wrote no applications nor made any applications on peoples 
behalf had they asked me i would have i thought the program was a 
good program

a federal appeals court today awarded 72875 
in attorneys fees and expenses to former labor secretary raymond 
donovan following an investigation into his activities as a 
construction company executive 
donovan had sought more than 112000 but the threemember court 
panel lowered that figure by nearly 40000 
a court order said there was insufficient documentation for some 
of the legal fees and that services provided by lawyers for the two 
firms representing donovan were in some cases duplicative 
the criminal investigation by independent counsel leon silverman 
was closed after insufficient credible evidence was found to warrant 
prosecution 
retaining lawyers from two firms was excessive and therefore an 
unreasonable expenditure said the court panel headed by appeals 
judge george mackinnon the court cannot see any reason why one 
firm could not have handled the entire case lawyers representing 
donovan were from pierson ball amp dowd in washington and kaye 
scholer fierman hays amp handler in new york 
silverman investigated the possibility in 1987 and 1988 that 
donovan may have lied to congress and a grand jury about an alleged 
kickback scheme on a new york city subway construction project in 
1976 and 1977 
the allegation was that donovan as vice president of schiavone 
construction co demanded and received a kickback from columbian 
steel co the principal witness against donovan was gerald meyer 
the president and coowner of columbian which brokered steel for 
the construction project 
the 1978 ethics in government act provides for reimbursement of 
attorneys fees for the unindicted subject of an independent 
counsels investigation

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani on 
friday turned a memorial service for ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
into a mass rally for his successor 
the speaker has moved this week to bolster the reputation of 
president ali khamenei who was picked to succeed khomeini as 
supreme political and religious leader rafsanjani and khamenei are 
considered moderates 
during his sermon at the friday prayer service at tehran 
university rafsanjani said khamenei met the conditions khomeini 
outlined for his successor 
obeying khamenei is obeying khomeini chanted the crowd of 
hundreds of thousands who packed the campus and surrounding streets 
for miles families knelt on prayer mats in the streets 
the appointment of khamenei only a middleranking cleric was 
initially viewed as temporary however rafsanjani said thursday it 
was permanent 
during fridays memorial rafsanjani and other leaders sat 
crosslegged on carpets next to the rostrum which held a color 
portrait of khomeini four little boys knelt below the picture 
holding bunches of red and white gladiolas 
khamenei did not attend the service 
while he spoke rafsanjani clutched the barrel of an ak47 
assault rifle as he usually does at the friday prayer service the 
gun symbolizes the determination of iran to fight its enemies 
the speaker said khomeini although he did not name a successor 
had hinted that khamenei was qualified 
he said khomeini who died of a heart attack saturday at age 86 
wrote that his successor need not be a marja or supreme religous 
leader even though the constitution says so 
khomeini had given permission many times for officials to 
overlook the constitution rafsanjani said adding we all accept 
that leadership is above the constitution 
he asked who was more qualified to run the country he who is 
more skilled in social economic cultural and political issues 
or he who is in the theological school 
khamenei 49 was selected to succeed khomeini on sunday by the 
assembly of experts khomeini had formed the 83member group to 
handle his succession 
iranian press reports have started calling khamenei an ayatollah 
a title reserved for the highest religious leaders 
in another sign of khameneis rising fortunes the official 
islamic republic news agency announced that irans military 
commanders met with him thursday to declare their allegiance 
also on thursday rafsanjani signaled his own intention of 
playing a bigger political role telling foreign reporters he wants 
more executive power for the presidency 
rafsanjani 55 is the only declared candidate in the aug 18 
presidential election 
khameneis second term as president expires in october and the 
constitution bars him from running again 
iranian moderates such as rafsanjani seek to end the countrys 
international isolation and boost private enterprise radicals 
hardliners favor a selfreliant fundamentalist iran

the cockpit voice recorder from a southern co 
airplane that crashed in april shows the crew knew the plane was on 
fire but investigators said today that their effort to explain the 
fatal crash has not progressed far enough to draw any conclusions 
an executive of the atlantabased company who was facing possible 
dismissal and two company pilots were killed in the april 10 crash 
minutes after takeoff from pensacola fla 
the transcript released today showed that the crew and passenger 
realized there was a fire in the back of the atlantabound plane a 
little more than a minute before it crashed into an apartment 
complex no one on the ground was injured 
national transportation safety board officials who released the 
transcript emphasized that their investigation is continuing and 
refused to say if sabotage is suspected 
were not ruling anything out at this point said walter g 
stiner an ntsb air safety investigator were not ruling anything 
in either 
jake horton the southern co executive killed in the crash had 
recently been told before that he could be fired or suspended 
because of alleged accounting improprieties uncovered in a company 
audit he was senior vice president of southern subsidiary gulf 
power co 
the crash occurred as a federal grand jury in atlanta was 
continuing an investigation begun last august into alleged tax law 
violations and political contributions by southern and its 
subsidiaries 
an attorney who met with horton shortly before the plane crash 
later testified before the grand jury 
the actual tape was not played at todays news conference in 
atlanta but ntsb regional director jay golden said there was no 
violence in the voices of the planes occupants 
there was no violence no screaming no accusations he said 
golden said the investigation which involves a number of federal 
and florida authorities as well as southern co is continuing 
though the fbi is involved the investigation is not considered a 
criminal one at this point he said 
according to the transcript the fire was detected about 1 pm 
on april 10 a unidentified voice said at that point oh the 
copilot said what the hell was that and horton responded 
fire 
immediately following that exchange the transcript indicates the

a senatepassed bill would prevent disabled 
vietnam veterans and their survivors from losing federal public 
assistance benefits if they get settlement payments from makers of 
agent orange 
with the passage of this measure veterans will not have to 
choose between the assistance payments to which they are entitled 
and the pitiful compensation they will be granted for their agent 
orange exposure sen daniel p moynihan dny sponsor of the 
legislation said friday 
the senate passed the measure late thursday 
a companion measure in the house introduced by rep george 
hochbrueckner dny has been referred to the government 
operations committee said hochbrueckners spokesman peter coogan 
without this change in law many veterans would become ineligible 
for benefits such as housing assistance supplemental security 
income and food stamps because the agent orange settlement payments 
would push them over qualifyingincome levels 
in 1984 the manufacturers of agent orange agreed to put up 180 
million to settle all claims while admitting no liability for 
injuries or deaths caused by the chemical defoliant the agreement 
was approved by the us district court in brooklyn ny in july 
1988 
to be eligible for payments a veteran must be totally disabled 
show exposure to agent orange in vietnam and prove the disability 
was not caused by anything else 
based on court estimates the average payment per veteran will be 
5700 over a sixyear distribution period or about 950 a year of 
the 250000 veterans who have filed preliminary claims as many as 
60000 may be eligible though distribution of payments began in 
march provisions of the bill passed thursday are retroactive 
without this law veterans who have sacrificed much or all 
would have lost the help they or their survivors should most 
deservedly receive moynihan said

the bonneville power administration today 
began supplying electricity to sacramento calif where voters this 
week shut down the rancho seco nuclear power plant 
the sacramento municipal utility district asked to buy 350 
megawatts enough electricity to supply tacoma from the 
northwest said sharon blair a spokeswoman for the federal power 
agency 
she said its not known how long sacramento will buy bonneville 
power because the city is still trying to figure out how to cope 
with loss of the 15yearold nuclear plant 
bpa power is available because of high spring river runoff but 
the utility could not promise to keep sacramento supplied over the 
long run ms blair said 
they could be cut anytime if we dont have it this does not 
affect our surplus at all she said 
bpa has a surplus of 400 megawatts it can guarantee to utilities 
and sacramento is not buying any of that power she said adding 
that the sale will have a negligible impact on bpa rates 
smud is paying 17 cents a kilowatt hour less than the bpa 
wholesale rate of 24 cents for guaranteed power 
the sacramento district also is buying power from elsewhere in 
california and small amounts from portland orebased pacific 
power and light a private utility said wally gibson rate director 
for the northwest power planning council 
in tuesdays election 534 percent of sacramento voters favored 
closing rancho seco which has been plagued by shutdowns and soaring 
costs the public utilitys board members had agreed in advance to 
shut the plant if voters taking part in the advisory referendum 
wanted it shut 
the plant averaged just 39 percent of capacity over its 15year 
life although managers contended operations were improving

the fbi affidavit that triggered this weeks 
federal raid of rocky flats nuclear weapons plant was unsealed 
today and it reveals allegations of illegal discharge of pollutants 
into a creek and unpermitted dumping of hazardous wastes 
us magistrate hilbert schauer unsealed the affidavit after the 
rocky mountain news challenged the withholding of the information 
that led schauer issue a search warrant for the facility 16 miles 
northwest of denver 
the 116page affidavit catalogues the allegations made by fbi 
agent jon lipsky and indicates the investigation will probe 
activities as the nuclear weapons plant going back to november 1980 
among other things the affidavit alleges up to 40 hazardous or 
mixed wastes are sent to onsite facilities that do not have 
disposal permits that hazardous and mixed wastes are being burned 
in an unpermitted incinerator and that last november rocky flats 
illegally discharged pollutants into walnut creek without a permit 
the affidavit also questions the does decision to award an 86 
million bonus to rockwell international corp for excellent 
management of rocky flats 
the rocky mountain news reported today that the general 
accounting office also has launched an investigation of performance 
bonuses awarded rocky flats managers 
on tuesday 75 fbi and environmental protection agency agents 
raided the facility to investigate alleged criminal violations of 
hazardous waste laws on wednesday the colorado department of 
health announced it had found 25 environmental violations at the 
plant 
fbi agents were expected to continue their investigation for the 
justice department at least through next week said bob pence agent 
in charge of the colorado fbi office they are investigating whether 
hazardous waste was illegally disposed of at the plant and the 
actions then covered up 
the gao investigation of the bonus program at rocky flats and 
other weapons plants is expected to be completed in about two 
months carl bannerman assistant director of the gaos energy 
division in washington dc was quoted as saying in the rocky 
mountain news the newspaper did not say when the investigation 
began 
the gao is the investigative arm of congress 
rockwell international corp has operated rocky flats which 
manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons for the 
department of energy since 1975 the plant also recycles plutonium 
for use in making the triggers 
the bonuses known as award fees are based on performance 
in six weighted categories at rocky flats those categories are 
general management 25 percent environmental health and safety 20 
percent cost management 15 percent quality control 15 percent 
production operations 15 percent and waste management 10 percent 
the energy department rates the plants performance in those 
categories 
defense contractors can earn additional bonuses by meeting or 
surpassing production goals 
records show that bonuses paid to rockwell for its rocky flats 
performance have totaled more than 416 million since 1981 bonuses 
for 1988 totaled 94 million 
rockwell in turn awards some of the bonus money to top 
management officials at rocky flats as a reward for reaching 
perfomance goals said rockwell spokesman ed heintz 
last year rockwell lost part of its 94 million bonus after the 
energy department found some employees in a shop at the plant had 
spent working time making gifts and trinkets for personal use 
much of the fbi investigation at the plant focuses on allegations 
of illegal waste disposal water pollution violations and falsifying 
records particularly on the possible improper use of an incinerator 
designed to remove valuable radioactive plutonium from contaminated 
debris

the bush administration saying the chinese 
government has murdered many many of its citizens on friday 
denounced calls for reprisals against the prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
the administration also said the reappearance of chinese leader 
deng xiaoping in public does not settle the question of who bears 
responsibility for ordering last weekends bloody crackdown on 
civilians in tiananmen square 
you can watch television and see who the government is but in 
terms of individual actions and motivations we dont know 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but he added that i dont think anyone doubts that deng and 
prime minister li peng are now in charge of the overall government 
in beijing 
president bush is still waiting for deng to return a phone call 
the us leader made to no avail on thursday 
the phone call remains placed and well see if he returns our 
call fitzwater told reporters 
deng appeared in public friday for the first time since may 16 to 
attend a ceremony at which he saluted military leaders for carrying 
out the crackdown on the counterrevolutionaries 
fitzwater used some of the strongest language yet to express us 
condemnation of the military actions that claimed hundreds and 
possibly thousands of lives last weekend 
keep in mind that the government has murdered many many of its 
citizens we have had an incredible upheaval in that country 
said fitzwater things are not going back to normal soon or in a 
quick fashion 
the violence will affect chinas relations with all countries 
of the world for a considerable period of time said fitzwater 
the government has killed people there their own citizens and 
now we see reprisals being announced over the loudspeakers in the 
public squares reprisals are repugnant we certainly watch this 
situation with grave concern said fitzwater citing the 
loudspeaker calls for neighbors to call in neighbors the public 
calls for reprisals against students who met with li peng 
bush suspended military sales to china on monday but has 
refrained from economic sanctions saying he does not want to cause 
hardship for the chinese people 
we remain prepared to take any action that we feel will be 
beneficial to the situation but were not willing to speculate in 
advance on what we might do he said 
fitzwater said violence in the streets of china appears to be 
calming down but he said the situation remains clouded with the 
united states still in the dark with regard to our knowledge of 
the structure or command responsibility of the leadership 
bush whose personal ties with the chinese leadership date back 
to his service as us envoy to china in 197475 said thursday it 
would be extraordinarily difficult to have ties with anyone 
responsible for the bloodshed 
bush said he wants to preserve the uschinese relationship but 
it will take a recognition of the rights of individuals and 
respect for the rights of those who disagree 
we arent going to remake the world but we should stand for 
something and theres no question in the minds of these students 
in china that the united states is standing in their corners

reporters outside the hospital where rodriguez was taken another 
arena leader col sigifredo ochoa perez said we are confronting 
brazen terrorism commanders and communists who are here with the

is to fight fire with fire we cant continue to stand with our 
arms folded he said 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we condemn this outrage and call for an end to violence in 
el salvador 
attacks such as this are designed to provoke a violent reaction 
by the goverment of el salvador and its military and security 
forces who continue to demonstrate restraint in the face of ongoing 
terrorist provocations 
rodriguez took office june 1 the day cristiani was inaugurated 
for a fiveyear term leftist guerrillas who tried to disrupt the 
election that brought cristiani to power vowed before the 
inauguration to make el salvador ungovernable

the last time nazgi mir vagirzade saw her father 
he was in a frightened crowd of people looking for a way to flee the 
mob that set fire to their homes 
the next day she said her fear of the rampaging mobs caused her 
to suffer a miscarriage but after two days in the hospital she fled 
to moscow from the fergana valley of uzbekistan to save herself and 
her 22monthold son ali 
mrs vagirzade was one of the people caught up in violence that 
swept the central asian republic of uzbekistan 
her husband an engineer insisted on staying behind tuesday to 
look for her father and older brother but there has been no further 
word from the family in the fertile valley 1500 miles southeast of 
moscow 
communications are cut off 
on friday a week after the rioting reached her hometown fergana 
the 31yearold teacher placed a black lace scarf of mourning around 
her shoulders and joined 100 other meskhi turks pleading at a moscow 
government office for a meeting with president mikhail s gorbachev 
to stop the bloodshed 
gorbachev was wrapping up the first session of the congress of 
peoples deputies at the kremlin and by late afternoon there had 
been no meeting 
the meskhi turks were not surprised they said it was the 146th 
delegation theyve sent to moscow since 1957 they said theyve seen 
no results 
the turks say overcrowding and economic frustrations have raised 
tensions among uzbeks and meskhi turks who were exiled to the 
region from their native georgia by stalin in 1944 
mrs vagirzade didnt know whether her father or her older 
brother are among the 80 dead 
seated in a small downtown moscow park on friday she related her 
experiences in an emotional but steady voice 
homes built by the turks when they were exiled are all burned 
down she said the crowd that included her father gathered sunday 
in downtown fergana not knowing how to protect themselves the 
people were all afraid and no one knew where to run what to do 
the next day i ended up in the maternity hospital because of 
my fear and i had a miscarriage i lost a 3monthold child she 
said when i wanted to leave not one uzbek taxi driver would pick 
me up a russian man stopped for me in his private car 
we dont have anywhere to go the uzbeks want to clean us out 
and in georgia our homeland they dont want us she said 
the late dictator josef stalin forced the turks to move to 
uzbekistan from soviet georgia in 1944 
i still dont know where my father and older brother are what 
has happened to them she said 
another brother two sistersinlaw nieces and nephews are among 
about 10000 meskhi turks now living in openair camps protected by 
some of the 9000 interior ministry soldiers sent to the region to 
restore order 
when the rioting started ethnic uzbeks began hanging red rags or

local authorities didnt try to stop the violence she charged 
some uzbeks risked their lives to protect friends 
mrs vagirzade said her own house was still standing when she

the economy went sour 
as soon as the economic situation got bad they began to demand 
that we be sent back he said 
the valley is home to 25 million people there is no longer 
any land to build a house not enough work and the economic 
situation has gotten worse he said

president bushs proposal to reduce military 
forces in europe both for the nato alliance and warsaw pact nations 
could amount to about 2 billion a year in savings for the united 
states according to the congressional budget office 
the offices analysis released this week found that the 
presidents offer would result in about 1 billion in savings from 
reductions in pay and allowances for troops stationed overseas with 
the remaining windfall the result of lower daytoday operating 
costs 
bushs proposal calls for removing 30000 us troops and 325000 
soviet soldiers from europe and reductions in the number of nato 
combat aircraft by 750 and warsaw pact planes by 3000 
the president introduced his arms control initiatives placing 
ceilings on troops tanks combat aircraft and attack helicopters 
artillery and armored personnel carriers last month at the 40th 
anniversary of nato the proposal refines what the alliance put on 
the bargaining table in vienna in march 
under bushs proposal a conventional arms treaty would be 
negotiated within six months to a year the budget office analysis 
said that under that schedule savings would not begin until 1991 
at the earliest and full savings would probably not be realized 
until at least 1993 
the costs are based on 1990 dollars in budget authority the 
office said 
the analysis also said that the proposal might also allow the 
pentagon to avoid the need to buy about 6 billion in new weapons 
the savings however would likely come over many years and only if 
the procurement rate for new weapons is reduced 
if bush decides that reductions in the warsaw pact forces means 
less of a threat and choses to maintain a smaller or lessmodern 
military such a decision could result in reductions in the 
defense budget much larger than those estimated in this paper the 
office said 
however the budget office which conducted its analysis at the 
request of the senate budget committee said the savings could be 
less if bush decides cuts in forces in europe require a greater 
number of forces in the united states or increases in the number of 
ships or aircraft to carry weapons and cargo to europe 
cost of verification also could cut into the net savings the 
office said 
bush did not specify which us forces would be removed to 
achieve the reductions but the budget office suggested possible 
steps to realize the savings among the offices suggestions was 
withdrawal of one armored or mechanized division including all its 
helicopters and artillery an armored or mechanized division 
includes three brigades with about 17000 personnel 
such as step would require removing about 26000 army personnel 
from europe in addition the united states could withdraw one and 
onethird of a tactical wing of f16 fighter aircraft about 4000 
personnel are attached to a wing 
the united states could see a onetime saving if bush decides 
against construction of new base in crotone italy to house the 
401st tactical fighter wing of f16 fighters and the approximately 
3600 us troops and 600 civilians 
estimated cost to build the new base is 830 million for the nato 
allies with the united states expected to pay about 26 million the 
us expense does not include 180 million for housing over 10 years 
last year italy agreed to provide a new home for the wing after 
spain demanded that it leave the base at torrejon de ardoz just 
east of madrid 
however defense secretary dick cheney told nato allies in 
brussels belgium friday that bush proposals on reductions in 
combat aircraft exclude the 72 f16 of the 401st tactical wing

fiftyseven senators expressed disappointment 
friday at the decision of south african president p w botha to 
extend his nations stateofemergency rule for another year 
the senators 38 democrats and 19 republicans told botha in a 
telegram a peaceful end to apartheid will only be possible if 
political and human rights are respected in south africa 
signers of the telegram include senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
sen nancy landon kassebaum rkan ranking gop member of the 
senate foreign relations african affairs subcommittee helped 
organize the message to botha 
since the state of emergency was imposed three years ago the 
south african government has sharply restricted the activities of 34 
black political organizations detained more than 30000 people and 
silenced political dissent with stringent press censorship mrs 
kassebaum said in a statement 
it is critical that south africa begin the process toward 
peaceful national reconciliation through negotiation she said 
unfortunately another year under the state of emergency makes 
that process very difficult 
botha said in a statement that by applying the emergency measures 
his government succeeded in stopping the widespread violence by 
radicals 
but he said it was necessary to extend the decree despite a sharp 
decline in political violence over the past year because black 
revolutionaries continue plots aimed at undermining his whiteled 
government

the number of people living on the nations 
farms has been declining for years says the agriculture department 
on the other hand the farm entrepreneurial population of 
people involved in the farming business may be holding its own a 
new usda report showed friday 
in 1987 the report said approximately 57 million people 
lived in households associated with the operation of farms in 
the united states that was up slightly from 56 million in 1986 
however the author of the report economist margaret a butler 
said the 1986 and 1987 numbers were not significantly changed 
a year ago the usda agency and the census bureau reported the 
1987 farm population at just under 5 million down from almost 
53 million in 1986 
traditionally the farm population has been defined as the number 
of people living on farms and ranches regardless of occupation or 
income 
but the report said that people who live on farms today are not 
necessarily employed in agriculture and those employed in 
agriculture often do not live on farms 
so the new category of people who are actually involved in 
farming based on current population surveys conducted annually by 
the census bureau was devised 
no attempt was made to indentify hired farm workers because 
many persons who do hired farm work have only a tenuous connection 
with farming based on shortterm seasonal work the report said 
the objective here is to define and characterize in its own right 
the population of farmer households

this time it may be legal 
culhane and ann a new jersey social worker whose last name he 
requested not be used had a wedding ceremony a few years ago in the 
visiting room at sing sing state prison but under new york law 
lifers were considered civilly dead and not allowed to marry 
then last month a federal judge in syracuse overturned the new 
york law ruling that it was arbitrary and irrational 
the right to marry in a prison setting is a fundamental one 
wrote us district judge neal mccurn 
well be getting married next wednesday about noontime 
culhane said in a telephone interview this week from woodbourne 
state prison a mediumsecurity facility im going to get in and 
do it before someone decides to appeal 
state corrections commissioner thomas coughlin who has been 
lobbying the state legislature for several years to repeal the law 
said he would not appeal mccurns ruling 
also planning to wed soon are richard langone 32 an inmate at 
the queensboro state prison and dari schmall 23 of new york city 
langone said he wanted to keep the date private

the classaction lawsuit against the state 
langone who is a friend of culhanes said he and schmall met 
when his mother brought her along for a prison visit in 1981 his 
mother and schmalls were best friends 
at the end of 1983 we decided we wanted to marry langone 
said in an interview this week that was the first time i came up 
against the law i asked my mom if i could borrow 160 i told her i 
had to take a course in constitutional law 
langone took the law course and a host of others and challenged 
the nomarriage law he felt punishes you in a perverted way 
marriage is important for someone in prison it makes a person 
feel like hes got something he said 
coughlins office had no figures on whether other states have 
laws similar to the one struck down in new york langone said he 
thought about a dozen other states banned marriage for lifers 
state corrections department officials say there are about 7500 
inmates serving life sentences they are unsure how many are single

teams of clubwielding police officers rove the 
streets soldiers with automatic weapons check identity papers at 
all major intersections squads of them toting flashlights pedal 
bicycles up alleyways 
night has fallen in beijing 
no curfew has been declared in the capital but bands of troops 
who patrol this city after dark are effectively deterring anyone 
from staying outside past 10 pm or gathering in a group larger 
than five 
during the day a veneer of normal life is spreading across 
beijing but when night falls so does any pretense to calm and 
safety 
on friday night a convoy of troop trucks patrolled the streets 
of the university district to the northwest for the first time 
during the weeklong crackdown on the movement for democracy and 
freedom 
small groups of students and local residents who had congregated 
on the main streets fled as the convoy bore down on them 
here they come lets get out of here yelled one youth as 
five trucks led by two police vans sped around a corner and flashed 
their lights at a crowd 
soldiers their ak47 automatic rifles pointed into the crowd 
shouted at it to disperse 
go home everybody one officer barked go home 
the crowd that had been forming nightly in front of peoples 
university was not there friday only a few outdoor food stands were 
in front of the universitys gates 
most of my classmates have gone home said one student he 
said he was having trouble buying a train ticket to get out of town 
i hope to be out too in about a week 
soldiers stood on street corners near the campuses a group of 
seven blocked off a small street but students said troops had yet to 
enter their schools 
what we do have is plainclothes police said one student 
they are everywhere 
indeed security forces and university officials scrubbed the 
posters calling for freedom from the walls of beijing university 
several daring students placed another poster up but within minutes 
it too was taken down 
posters also disappeared from in front of peoples university and 
beijing normal university only a handful of paper chrysanthemums a 
flower used in traditional chinese wakes remained at the gate of 
one school 
troop concentrations increase near the center of the city and 
most major intersections are occupied by soldiers at the crossing 
next to the china art gallery soldiers searched the bag of one 
woman 
restaurants that had been staying open until 1030 pm are 
shutting at 8 pm 
things are in chaos everywhere said one proprietor if i 
stay open these police hooligans may come and get me its best to 
keep things locked up 
by 11 pm the streets were mostly empty unusual for a balmy 
night in late spring during more peaceful times families would be 
sitting outside catching fresh air and a respite from their airless 
quarters down the alleyways 
bands of soldiers their helmets and rifles glinting under the 
streetlights pedaled through the streets on bicycles soldiers 
venture up alleys with flashlights 
people moved hurriedly in the shadows but in those shadows too 
are detachments of troops leaning up against walls their weapons 
slung across their backs 
entering the inner city two reporters were stopped at two 
intersections by police backed up by soldiers 
all other vehicles were similarly stopped some were searched 
later in the evening just after midnight one of the largest 
movements of tanks occurred on changan avenue the citys main 
boulevard 
more than 70 tanks with more than 20 armored personnel carriers 
moved out of the city center most pedestrians fled behind 
buildings a few stood under street lamps and watched the convoy 
afterward little stirred in this city of 11 million

twenty years after neil a armstrong made his 
giant leap for mankind on the moon he and his fellow apollo 11 
astronauts said friday they are disappointed man has not taken even 
one small step on mars 
i thought the moon would lead immediately and logically to 
mars said michael collins the astronaut who remained in the 
spacecraft columbia circling the moon while armstrong and edwin 
buzz aldrin set down on the sea of tranquility on july 20 1969 
millions of television viewers watched the heady culmination of a 
bold challenge issued in 1961 by president john f kennedy to land 
an american on the moon by the end of the decade 
speaking to a jammed news conference at the paris air show the 
three grayhaired astronauts used the anniversary to renew the 
challenge for americans to expand the human presence in the solar 
system 
also on friday soviet pilot anatoly kvochur was discharged from 
the hospital after being treated for injuries he suffered on 
thursday when he ejected from his mig29 fighter seconds before it 
exploded at the air show 
no one else was injured when the jet stalled during a performance 
before reporters and exhibitors and crashed in the center of the 
field at le bourget airport the cause was being investigated 
at the news conference aldrin said it was competition from the 
soviet union in the early 1960s that spawned the leap into space 
and that no similar urgency exists today 
armstrong who commanded the apollo 11 mission said we all 
started much before 1969 and at the time most people did not 
believe there would ever be people in space in our lifetime in that 
sense im very encouraged that we did more than most people 
including myself would have guessed 30 years ago 
having said that and knowing now that we were able to break the 
chains of gravity those of us who are involved are always 
disappointed that we are not doing more and doing more faster 
collins added i think of the moon not so much as a place these 
days than as of a direction a direction out there a small way 
station on the way to mars or the outer planets beyond our solar 
system 
in an interview earlier aldrin said nasa planners only recently 
considered seriously a proposal he made in 1985 for a cycling 
spaceship 
two spaceships would orbit the sun in a twoyear cycle passing 
mars on the outbound leg and then circling back to earth 
the spaceships could serve as permanent transport to and from 
mars with strippeddown space ferries shuttling men and materials 
back and forth to earth said aldrin whose book men from 
earth was published in the united states last month 
i hope the spaceships will become an increasingly pursued means 
of getting to mars said aldrin who lives in laguna beach calif 
i expect well be back on the moon by 2005 and then by 2010 we 
should be sending people to mars he said 
the three astronauts said they did not expect to set foot on 
mars but that the moon still holds allure 
i look forward to the day when there is commercial service and 
i have a chance to go back armstrong said

the crew and builders of the gossamer 
albatross the first humanpowered plane to fly across the english 
channel plan to gather saturday for a 10year reunion of the 
historic event 
just a gettogether explained paul maccready the monrovia 
aeronautics engineer who designed the awkwardlooking plane largely 
held together with transparent tape 
the private event is being held in a cavernous building where 
rose bowl floats are assembled and the gossamer albatross ii a 
backup of the original plane is stored the plane that made the 
historic flight is displayed in the london science museum 
among the 60 or so crewmembers and their families planning to 
attend is bryan allen who was recruited for his skills as a pilot 
bicyclist and hangglider to pedal the craft 23 miles from 
folkstone england to cap gris nez france on june 12 1979 
allen now a 36yearold computer software specialist for a 
pasadena firm recalled the grueling twohour 49minute flight as 
by far the most difficult thing ive ever done physically and 
i suppose mentally 
allen flying the 70pound craft just a few feet over the water 
battled cross winds dehydration and fatigue before landing the 
gossamer albatross on a beach where crew members had to help him 
stand up 
by then i didnt want to spend another tenth of a second in 
the plane he said 
despite the drama of the event the flight turned out to have 
little longrange practical application to aeronautic technology 
except for the use of a couple of materials now found on commercial 
aircraft 
carbon filament and kevlar a compound used in some of the 
control mechanisms are sneaking their way into airlines 
maccready said 
the 220000 prize for the flight put up by english 
industrialist henry kremer went to cover expenses 
maccready 63 said the flight of the gossamer albatross was more 
symbolic than anything much like charles lindberghs 1927 flight 
across the atlantic 
it helped change peoples perceptions about how we can do more 
with less he said weve reached an era of limits on earth so 
it is really important

et phone home it wont cost you 
anything from a long island expressway rest stop near exit 52 
new york telephone on thursday finally caught up with two dozen 
pay telephones that were operating free of charge and letting 
those in the know call friends and relatives all over the world 
police alerted the phone company after a man who lived 50 miles 
away was wounded at the rest stop in a holdup attempt 
when police asked the victim waseem moosa of new york city what 
he was doing so far from home at 130 am wednesday he admitted he 
had driven the distance to make a phone call to pakistan 
skeptical officers returned to the area to look for witnesses to 
the robbery and discovered 15 pakistani men using the phones 
police then notified the phone company which reprogrammed the 
phones 
it was a booboo a human error in which somewhere down the 
line the pay phones were not given a proper code with the main 
computer in commack said phone company spokesman bruce reisman 
reisman guessed the calls were made throughout may adding that 
new york telephone normally doesnt benefit from international 
calls since the breakup of atampt in 1984 new york telephone offers 
only local service 
atampt spokeswoman laura abbot said the incident was under 
investigation and that her company and new york telephone will 
determine which one will be stuck with the bill 
abbot could not say how many calls were made from the free phones 
or how much they were worth

mice given an aids virus gene developed an 
aidsrelated cancer suggesting the virus itself may cause cancer 
leading researcher dr robert gallo said friday 
gallo one of the discoverers of the aids virus also said an 
experimental aids drug called cd4 is the closest thing to a magic 
bullet to eradicate aids 
if cd4 doesnt work in the early phases dont despair he 
said the drug blocks the mechanism by which the aids virus attaches 
to certain white blood cells and infects them 
this mechanism is so critical to aids virus growth in the body 
that some version of cd4 ought to be able to interfere with it he 
said 
gallo spoke at the fifth international conference on aids which 
ended friday 
his studies of the cancer called kaposis sarcoma offer one 
possible explanation for the origin of the disease in aids patients 
others have evidence that kaposis sarcoma may be caused by a 
virus other than aids but gallos work suggests otherwise 
he reported a study showing the cancer developed in mice that 
were genetically engineered to contain an aids virus gene called 
tat the tat gene is a kind of supercharger that speeds up 
replication of the aids virus 
the mice carrying the tat gene developed kaposis sarcoma but 
the cancer did not arise in the cells carrying the gene it arose 
from other cells 
that suggests the gene triggers production of some biochemical 
factor that causes the cancer 
he also showed that certain kaposis sarcoma cells called spindle 
cells release a whole series of biological molecules that allow us 
to create ks in a mouse 
if the work proves correct it offers the possibility that drugs 
could be designed to interfere with these molecules and thus treat 
or prevent kaposis sarcoma gallo said 
the aids virus infects certain white blood cells that direct many 
immune functions they are called t4 cells or cd4 cells 
gallo argues other viruses that activate the immune system and 
therefore activate t4 cells can aggravate infection with the aids 
virus known as the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
for example a leukemiacausing virus called htlv1 can infect 
the same cells infected with hiv and can turn on hiv in the 
cells triggering production of more hiv he said 
human herpes virus type 6 or hhv6 which was discovered 
recently by gallo and his colleagues also can infect the same cells 
and turn on hiv he said 
gallo described a possible vicious cycle in which hhv6 and hiv 
work together to cause disease 
all of us in this room almost have hhv6 he said healthy 
people control it it causes no illness but hiv weakens the immune 
system allowing hhv6 to grow 
the proliferating hhv6 then activates production of hiv in 
gallos scenario the hiv further weakens the immune system 
allowing further growth of hhv6 and so on

president bush isnt ready to make a tax deal 
to gain house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowskis 
backing for a lower capital gains tax rate bushs spokesman said 
friday 
there are no deals we are pleased that the chairman is moving 
in the direction of supporting lower capital gains we still 
believe our original proposal is the best one and the right way to 
go said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
earlier this week rostenkowski an illinois democrat who heads 
the houses taxoriginating committee suggested he might go along 
with lowering the tax rate on capital gains a move advocated by 
bush 
however rostenkowski also hinted there were some strings 
attached to his offer namely that the president back away from 
his nonewtaxes pledge to support some form of new taxes to help 
reduce the budget deficit 
bushs original proposal is to lower the capital gains rate from 
its current maximum level of 33 percent to 15 percent he claims 
such a move would stimulate more business investment and bring in 
some 5 billion in new revenues 
democrats including rostenkowski had previously dismissed the 
proposal as a tax break mainly favoring the rich capital gains are 
the profits on the sale of real estate stocks works of art and 
other assets 
fitzwater conceded that bush had talked about these matters 
with chairman rostenkowski but he reiterated we havent made 
any deals 
we stick to all our former positions on a tax increase he 
said

prime minister sousuke uno faced unprecedented and 
embarrassing questioning in parliament on friday about a magazine 
article that said he paid a geisha to be his mistress 
after only a week in office uno is seeing one taboo after 
another fall as his supposedly scandalfree background takes a 
beating from unexpected quarters 
geishas traditionally do not reveal the identity of patrons 
japanese mainstream media traditionally do not report on 
politicians dalliances opposition legislators traditionally do not 
raise such subjects in parliament 
it all changed this week with an anonymous account in sunday 
mainichi magazine asserting uno bought a geisha who denounced 
him as immoral 
at first the accusation got only scattered mentions 
but on friday socialist manae kubota posed the question in the 
house of councilors the exchange was broadcast on the evening 
television news and transmitted nationwide by kyodo the countrys 
top news agency 
miss kubota an activist on womens issues said the washington 
post had reported on the claim if its not true you should 
clearly protest she admonished the prime minister 
looking discomfited uno replied i will refrain from 
commenting publicly on such a kind of report concerning myself 
earlier this week he told inquiring journalists the story was not 
true but that was reported only in a few dailies 
uno 66 was foreign minister until june 2 when the governing 
liberal democratic party chose him to change its scandalplagued 
image and guide japan through difficult foreign challenges 
his main qualifications were his unblemished reputation and 
foreign experience but the geisha scandal challenges both his 
supposed strengths 
buying prostitutes isnt tolerated in international society 
miss kubota told the associated press after the exchange she said 
she thought uno was unfit to represent japan abroad and that was 
why she brought up the formerly taboo subject 
sunday mainichi quoted an unidentified 40yearold woman as 
saying uno paid her 2100 a month to be his mistress for four 
months in 1985 she said she now works as an office assistant 
as a geisha she would have been trained in classical song dance 
and conversation a true geisha is not a prostitute but she would 
entertain male guests at traditional restaurants and might become 
the mistress of a favored patron 
the anonymous woman was quoted as saying uno fell in love with 
her but she purportedly came to dislike his selfish behavior 
and bullying of an older woman who managed the geishas 
restaurant uno decided to end the arrangement she reportedly said 
but still wanted to call on her to meet him for a fee 
he is not a man of noble character the woman was quoted as 
saying i dont want him to use politics in the same way he 
treated me 
the article said the affair was a scandal and suggested uno is 
not the right person to salvage the liberal democratic party from a 
bribery scandal that forced noboru takeshita to resign as prime 
minister

against him into a single indictment 
chief us district court judge aubrey robinson took three counts 
against secord involving accusations of illegal gifts to oliver 
north and consolidated the with nine new charges accusing secord of 
lying to congress 
the alleged lies involve covering up secords own profits in the 
irancontra affair and denying that north received any benefits from 
the maze of corporations known as the enterprise set up by secord 
and business partner albert hakim 
north who enlisted secord to run arms to the nicaraguan rebels 
during a congressional ban on military aid to the contras was 
convicted last month of accepting a 13800 home security system 
from secord north faces sentencing june 23 for that and two other 
crimes in the irancontra scandal 
the government says secords profits from running arms to the 
nicaraguan contras and assisting the reagan administrations secret 
iran arms initiative totaled more than 1 million 
consolidating the 1988 gratuities charges against secord with the 
ninecount indictment brought in april will serve the interests of 
judicial economy and sound administration judge robinson said in 
a twopage order 
secords lawyer thomas green argued thursday in favor of trying 
secord on the gratuities charges alone 
green said the new indictment is laden with potential problems 
over the use of classified information which will delay any trial 
in short consolidation will not result in any judicial 
economy green also said the indictments are not logically related 
but robinson said proof for the gratuities charges would be 
admissible to prove the coverup allegations and that there is 
little doubt that consolidation is appropriate 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh has said it 
plans to offer no classified documents in prosecuting the 12 charges 
secords claim to classified documents in his defense will have 
very little likelihood of success the prosecution said in a court 
filing 
associate independent counsel reid weingarten said the government 
would seek dismissal of broad conspiracy theft and wire fraud 
charges against secord they focus on the diversion of iran arms 
sale money to the contras and prosecuting them would involve the use 
of extensive amounts of sensitive material us intelligence 
agencies are unwilling to turn over such material to secord without 
a painstaking pagebypage review the government said in a recent 
court filing 
identical conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed against 
north when intelligence agencies refused to declassify national 
secrets contained in material that was relevant to the prosecutions 
case and norths defense

the state department said friday the reported 
nicaraguan transfer of weapons to panama is deeply offensive to 
all who support democracy in latin america 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the nicaraguan 
action constituted backing for panamanian leader manuel antonio 
noriega whom she accused of stealing last months national 
elections and of using thugs to viciously assault the legitimate 
victor 
sandinista officials have confirmed that grenade launchers light 
artillery and dozens of ak47 rifles were sent to panama to help 
that countrys security forces in the event of a us military 
attack

foreign ministers meeting this week nicaragua stood alone in 
defending noriega and opposed sending an oas commission to panama to

electoral process by denying the opposition fair representation in 
the allpowerful electoral tribunal

after investigating for 17 months collecting a 
million pages of documents and holding 20 days of public hearings a 
senate panel is preparing a report detailing what its chairman calls 
the governments failed responsibility to indians 
members of a special unit of the senate select committee on 
indian affairs have advocated that interior secretary manuel lujan 
jr make reforms in the agencies responsible to native americans 
i cannot think of any area where the federal government has so 
completely abdicated its responsibility as it has in indian 
affairs sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the special 
committee said thursday 
at the same time lujan told the committee he thought his 
department was doing a generally good job 
however i am sure that the department of interior can do 
more lujan added i believe the department has no 
responsibility more serious than our trust responsibilities to the 
indians i welcome continuing discussions about ways in which we can 
enhance our procedures for legal representation on these complex 
indian issues the secretary said 
the committee which also included sens john mccain rariz 
and thomas daschle dsd looked at federal agencies dealing with 
native americans and found them lacking in many respects 
but deconcini said some positive actions have already come as a 
result of the committees work 
first we have brought the misconduct of navajo chairman peter 
macdonald and other tribal officials to the attention of their 
respective tribes and the us department of justice who are taking 
action he said 
macdonald was ousted as chairman of the navajos when contracting 
irregularities involving payments to macdonald were revealed by 
senate staff investigators 
deconcini also said 20 firms that were improperly receiving 
indian contracts were exposed 
many of them are now being sued or debarred by tribal 
governments as well as investigated by the justice department he 
said 
the problem of child abuse on some reservations that was brought 
to light has led to creation of parent support groups and community 
awareness programs he said 
lujan said bureau of indian affairs employees with direct access 
to children are now given deeper background checks before hiring 
deconcini said that a hearing last month on encroachment by 
private individuals onto indian land in the arkansas riverbed has 
inspired several companies and people to contact the cherokee 
choctaw and chickasaw tribes who own the land with offers to pay 
royalties 
the senator said hearings on oil and gas theft from indians 
caused tribes and oil producers to hire new inspectors to help 
prevent such theft 
litigation has begun in efforts to recover compensation for 
stolen oil and the justice department is conducting a criminal 
investigation based on the evidence the committee developed he said 
but despite what he considered successes deconcini expressed 
dismay that conditions were so bad 
why werent these problems discovered and dealt with earlier 
he said and how can the federal government spend 3 billion a 
year on indian programs with no assurance that the most fundamental 
standards of accountability are being met 
the indian health service came under criticism but never got a 
public hearing the committee canceled questioning because the 
agency had delayed sending requested documents deconcini said the 
committee and its staff will continue to pursue the investigation of 
the ihs through the summer 
since our hearing may 15 ihs has sent us tens of thousands of 
pages of documents carefully tabulated and organized he said 
our investigative staff has just begun to systematically examine 
these papers 
officials of the health service may be called to testify in 
public it also is possible that their testimony will be taken in 
deposition form and included in the report without a public hearing 
deconcini said 
legislation is expected to be recommended this fall as part of 
the committees final report which deconcini said will not be 
complimentary 
the federal agencies entrusted with administering indian 
programs have clearly failed in their responsibility he said 
moreover they have failed to even recognize their own 
inadequacies

lowlevel military flights over a millionacre 
wilderness would be banned under an agreement between federal 
officials and environmentalists who say the flights shatter the 
areas tranquility 
the agreement which requires approval of the federal aviation 
administration is intended to settle a lawsuit brought against 
defense officials by six environmental groups who also say the 
flights by air national guard jets often have been lower than 
federal law allows 
richard duncan a attorney who represented the environmental 
groups said thursday the agreement is the best possible 
solution 
the agreement avoids a couple years of litigation he said 
and we think that litigation would have resulted in a redesigned 
military operations area anyway 
the agreement would shift the boundaries of the snoopy military 
operations area so that it would no longer extend above the boundary 
waters canoe area in northeastern minnesota 
the snoopy area is used primarily for flight training by the 
duluthbased 148th fighter interceptor group 
the agreement also would restrict military flights over the canoe 
area to no lower than 18000 feet above sea level federal law 
prohibits flights over the canoe area below 4000 feet above sea 
level which in most places there would be 2000 to 2500 feet above 
the ground 
if the faa approves the snoopy area would be shifted away from 
the canoe areas southern boundary toward the south and east the 
snoopy area established in 1976 lies above 16 million acres of 
northeastern minnesota the shift would establish a new slightly 
larger military air space part of which would be above lake 
superior 
such a boundary shift is not expected to create problems for 
military training flights said army capt david wirwahn a 
spokesman for the minnesota department of military affairs which 
oversees the state air guard 
were sensitive to environmental concerns but we also realize 
the need for training in air defense wirwahn said we think 
this agreement will allow us to accomplish that training and be 
responsive to the citizens of minnesota 
the lawsuit was filed last june in us district court by friends 
of the boundary waters wilderness izaak walton league sierra club 
wilderness society friends of animals and their environment and 
help our wolves live 
kevin proescholdt executive director of friends of the boundary 
waters wilderness said the agreement will get the jets out of the 
bwca and restore the solitude and silence for which the area is 
renowned

the white house said friday that president bush 
has made no final decisions on negotiating strategies for the arms 
talks with the soviet union that resume in geneva june 19 
asked about reports that the joint chiefs of staff were urging 
the president to soften the previous administrations stand on 
antimissile systems white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
only that bush has made no final judgments yet 
bush has held several meetings with his national security 
advisers including the joint chiefs on negotiating positions and 
strategy for the start talks fitzwater said 
the ussoviet talks aimed at reaching a new agreement to reduce 
longrange nuclear missiles were stalled last year over the reagan 
administrations efforts to develop a spacebased missile shield 
called the strategic defense initiative 
the joint chiefs reportedly recommended that bush drop the 
insistence that the united states retain the right to deploy such a 
missile defense 
fitzwater said the bush administration will use as the starting 
point for discussions with the soviets the same position that was 
on the table at the end of the reagan administration 
nevertheless there are a number of negotiating positions and 
strategies that the president will be instructing his negotiators to 
take into the talks said fitzwater 
all these matters are under consideration but the president has 
not made final judgments on this question of the abm treaty or on 
most of the major other questions too he said 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty permits testing of 
unsophisticated devices but bars advanced missile tests and 
deployment

despite millions of listeners radio talk show 
hosts say theyre feeling ignored and maligned so these arbiters of 
the air waves have decided to take a cue from other minorities and 
organize 
on friday about 50 of the countrys 225 radio talk show hosts 
began arriving for the inaugural talkradio conference the 
organizer jerry williams of wrkoboston said he hopes the 
gathering will be part professional society part lobby group and 
part movement 
in the words of rodney dangerfield we dont get no respect 
said williams 65 and in the professional talk business since 
1950 the national media never took us very seriously they 
think theres some conspiracy here 
the function of the radio talk show and the gathering is to 
simply enhance the public forum for exchanging opinions williams 
said 
theres a huge void where people feel they dont have a voice 
anymore he said around him the room was a hubbub of smooth deep 
voices big smiles and wellrehearsed words 
the gathering is about freedom of speech and that theres 
really very little freedom of speech left in this country said 
mills crenshaw of ktkkam in salt lake city 
there is no more representative government in this country any 
more its all special interests crenshaw said the reason 
politicians are afraid of talk radio is we have the ability to allow 
private citizens to talk to their government 
williams said the idea for a conference came to him after he was 
able to marshal his talkshow colleagues to lead a protest against 
proposed federal pay increases last february 
led by their local hosts listeners nationwide dispatched to 
congress a load of tea bags bearing the message read my tea bag 
no 50 percent raise the public pressure helped halt a pay hike 
for lawmakers judges and other people on the federal payroll 
williams was encouraged by this to make the connections more 
formal 
the twoday gab confab was expected to include consumer activist 
ralph nader radio show hostgonetv morton downey jr and political 
columnist jack anderson 
fridays event was what else a callin show over an open 
mike to boston on saturday the conferees planned to get down to 
business and talk to each other exchanging ideas and formally 
organizing williams said 
faneuil hall the venerable brick building where revolutionaries 
fomented independence from britain and abolitionists railed against 
slavery served as the stage for the gab fest

a fundamentalist protestant demonstrator 
rushed toward pope john paul during an outdoor mass on friday but 
vatican security agents and swedish police stopped the unarmed man 
and dragged him away 
authorities hauled the man identified only as a 28yearold 
swede into a police van and drove him to a station for questioning 
said police inspector ulf ohlsson he said no one was injured 
the demonstrator belonged to a fundamentalist protestant group 
that opposes the popes efforts to improve roman catholic relations 
with the state church of this overwhelmingly lutheran country 
ohlsson said 
police said the protester was carrying leaflets denouncing the 
pope with all his abominations to distribute to participants at 
the mass 
they said he would be released without charge and refused to 
disclose his name in keeping with swedish practice 
it was not clear why the protester rushed toward the pope as john 
paul disrtibuted communion 
witnesses said four or five agents wrestled with the 
demonstrator who came within 10 yards of the pope and pulled him 
away from a security barrier around the altar they pinned him to 
the ground until the police van arrived 
several other fundamentalists were outside the mass the maranata 
group which sometimes calls the popes teachings fascist says 
no church or the pope is needed to speak to god just the bible 
it was the most serious incident during john pauls tour of five 
scandinavian countries which ends saturday on may 2 norwegian 
police hauled away demonstrators from a mass in tromsoe but those 
protesters did not get near the pope 
the incident in sweden caused little disruption it appeared that 
many people were unaware anything had happened i saw some 
commotion but i thought it was someone fainting said a nun who 
did not give her name 
earlier in the day the pope attacked abortion and euthanasia 
while emphasizing family values 
the primary right which society must defend is the right to 
life whether in the womb or in the final phase of life a person 
may never be disposed of in order to make life easier for others 
he said in a speech at the 500yearold uppsala university 
abortion in the first three months of pregnancy is legal and 
widely practiced throughout scandinavia euthanasia is illegal 
although it has been debated 
john paul also praised raoul wallenberg a swedish diplomat 
credited with saving thousands of jews in hungary from nazi death 
camps 
i cannot fail to mention your compatriot raoul wallenberg who 
in praiseworthy fashion rescued so many members of the jewish people 
from nazi concentration camps his example inspires a dedicated 
fight for human rights 
wallenberg disappeared after he was arrested by soviet troops 
entering budapest in january 1945 
moscow has said he died in a soviet prison in 1947 but soviet 
dissident sources claim he was seen alive in the 1980s the swedish 
and us governments have called on the soviets to release all the 
facts in the case 
in addition to sweden and norway john paul has visited denmark 
finland and iceland during his 42nd foreign trip he is to return to 
rome on saturday 
throughout his visit to the largely lutheran region the pope has 
stressed unity among christian denominations despite their 
differences

antiapartheid groups said 
extending the state of emergency for a fourth year friday proves the 
government is illegitimate supporters said the action will promote 
peace and constitutional reform 
only in police and totalitarian states does the government 
assume such frightening powers when it is not at war said 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu the state of emergency is very 
convenient for an authoritarian government that has no legitimacy 
amongst the majority of the people 
in washington 57 senators and the state department expressed 
disappointment at the extension of emergency powers 
a peaceful end to apartheid will only be possible if political 
and human rights are respected in south africa said a telegram by 
38 democrats and 19 republicans to president pw botha 
botha extended the 3yearold emergency at midnight without 
making any changes in the restrictions on freedom of the press 
speech and assembly or reducing the power of police to take any 
action they deem necessary to maintain law and order 
botha said that although political violence has declined 
revolutionaries were continuing underground to mobilize and to 
exert their influence he said emergency rule permits his national 
party government to proceed with upgrading black living conditions 
and seeking negotiations with black leaders on changes in the 
apartheid system 
but zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi one of those the government 
is trying to coax into negotiations called the extension a tragic 
indication of the abnormality of our society 
real negotiation between white and black leaders will not get 
off the ground while political leaders remain in jail and others are 
under a constant threat of detention he said 
approximately 30000 people mostly black were detained without 
trial during the emergency hundreds were freed this year after a 
hunger strike among detainees but officials say restrictions were 
imposed on about 500 of them 
the restrictions include house arrest bans on speaking in 
public writing articles for publication attending political 
meetings or criticizing the government 
fw de klerk leader of the national party and bothas 
designated successor after september parliamentary elections 
expressed his full support for the decision to extend the emergency 
for another year he said a certain degree of stability had been 
achieved through the decrease in violence and the advancement of 
social and economic development in black townships 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

lech walesa thanked voters friday for 
solidaritys overwhelming victory in weekend parliamentary elections 
and explained why he opposed the unions joining a communistled 
government coalition now 
he said solidarity was not ready to rule and must remain faithful 
to voters who want it to counter communist rule in the national 
assembly as the sejm the existing parliament and the newly 
created senate will be called 
everywhere where society agrees with the government we will 
support the government and where it is inconsistent with social 
feeling we are opposed walesa told a news conference in gdansk 
he said the immediate objective of his independent trade union 
movement was not cabinet positions but only to control and to 
broaden democracy and freedom probably this concept will prevail 
walesa said some solidarity candidates favor joining a coalition 
at once but others want the union to stay in opposition and support 
authorities only on an issuebyissue basis 
the government has prodded solidarity to join a coalition 
government after the humiliating rejection of 33 of 35 top party and 
government leaders who ran unopposed last sunday on a national 
list 
election results showed solidarity won 160 of the 161 seats in 
the sejm available to the opposition and 92 of the 100 seats in the 
senate 
i would like to thank voters for their effort for the 
elections and for their attitude toward solidarity walesa said 
a new round of elections will be held june 18 for the 33 
unopposed seats left vacant and for 262 contested sejm seats and 
eight senate seats in which no candidate received 50 percent of the 
vote in the first round 
the top two votegetters for each seat will be entered in the 
runoffs 
walesa returned to gdansk after an eighthour meeting with 
government officials thursday at which the two sides agreed to hold 
new elections for the 33 vacant seats communist officials said 
candidates for those seats have yet to be decided but all 33 races 
will be competitive 
senior solidarity advisers said the union received scores of 
letters and phone calls from supporters urging it to resist the 
temptation to join the communists in a coalition 
i will be advocating the concept that we should remain the 
opposition and dont go into the government because thats not what 
we went there for walesa said referring to the thursday meeting 
with the government 
it may look like we went there for cabinet chairs already 
now there are voices about betrayal we will not permit an departure 
from the road of reforms but we dont have a mandate for ruling 
walesa said solidarity would respect the roundtable agreements 
concluded with authorities april 5 guaranteeing the communists 65 
percent or 299 seats in the 460member sejm with the remaining 
seats reserved for the opposition 
we must explain to society that we didnt give as much as a 
button and that the coalition gets what belongs to it we cant 
negate it because thats what the agreement was walesa said 
walesa had said beforehand he would vote for all but one 
candidate on the national list he called the slates defeat a 
terrible thing because of the political crisis that ensued 
on the list were many government members of the roundtable talks 
that led to legalizing solidarity after a sevenyear ban and to 
polands freest elections in more than 40 years among those 
rejected by voters were prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski and 
seven other members of the 17member politburo 
solidarity is concerned that the sejm could lose its importance 
if major representatives of the authorities are not seated 
at least one rejected candidate politburo member alfred 
miodowicz the head of the official trade unions on friday ruled 
out another bid for election

the us trade representatives attacks on 
sugar import quotas hit sour notes on capitol hill this week 
an industry official said producers would be swiftly knocked out 
of business if the trade representative carla hills has her way 
during trade negotiations in geneva 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee rep kika de la 
garza dtexas said hes not pleased 
ms hills office said shes been misunderstood and she is not 
advocating unilateral abolition of the quotas 
when someone is telling you they want to put you out of 
business it could well be described as hysteria said mike 
morton a lobbyist for the florida sugar cane league and the rio 
grande valley sugar growers 
the source of the furor is a may 24 letter ms hill wrote el 
salvadors ambassador ernesto rivas gallont that the 
administration is pursuing the elimination of the us sugar 
program through the agricultural negotiations in the uruguay round 
of the international general agreement on tariffs and trade 
de la garza said he is seeking a white house meeting to determine 
president bushs position on the sugar program because i dont 
know who is speaking for the administration 
spokeswoman claire buchan said that while ms hills letter 
perhaps could have been more artfully written there is no policy 
change the letter is not meant to imply there is one 
ms hills does not advocate that the united states unilaterally 
disarm our sugar producers but does agree with gatts attempts to 
move toward substantial progressive reductions in all 
tradedistorting agricultural policies such as import quotas and 
export subsidies 
its a lot of todo about nothing agreed tom hammer 
president of the sweetener users association which represents 
makers of sweetened beverages and foods and opposes the current 
quota system 
he said consumers pay an extra 3 billion a year to benefit a 
mere 10000 domestic producers 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter also believes the united 
states should accept a gatt panels recent findings that us sugar 
quotas violate international trade agreements and argues that the 
next time the panel finds in the united states favor we could be 
criticized for having a double standard said spokeswoman kelly 
shipp 
yeutters position doesnt mean the sugar program is going to 
end abruptly she said 
morton the growers lobbyist said the administration had 
promised during the gatt panels deliberations to fight for us 
authority to set sugar quotas 
i think it is a disgrace that us representatives of the 
government do not have the sense to represent the best interests of 
us citizens us business and us jobs morton said 
eiler ravnholt president of the hawaiian sugar planters 
association and chairman of the american sugar alliance a producer 
coalition said the industry is puzzled how we can effectively 
negotiate reductions of sugar programs in other countries by 
signaling beforehand the united states is ready to scrap its own 
by limiting supply quotas act to give us producers a higher 
price this years import limit is 124 million tons which the 
agriculture department allots country by country among 39 producing 
nations the department sets the quota to keep the us price at a 
level high enough to encourage us production and avoid triggering 
government purchases of surplus sugar 
the us price is currently twice the world price 225 cents 
per pound vs 1175 cents 
the high price also encourages users to use nonsugar sweeteners 
like corn fructose 
quotas protect us producers from instabilities in the world 
market and without them the producers would be unable to compete 
against heavily subsidized european countries morton said 
quotas also give many poor caribbean nations a guaranteed outlet 
and price for at least part of their production he said

the evacuation of foreigners from beijing appeared 
to be nearing completion as the final special flight chartered by 
the us state department arrived friday night in tokyo with just 77 
on board 
us ambassador james lilley saw off one of the last groups of 
embassy dependents to leave china which included his wife 
we have moved out literally hundreds and hundreds of americans 
our people working this problem have done an almost incredible 
job he said 
many americans who left earlier in the week complained they 
received no help from the embassy in evacuating and that many were 
taken to safety or to the airport by cars and vans provided by other 
embassies 
the flood of foreigners fleeing turmoilwracked china slowed to a 
trickle with jumbo jets only partially full no more chartered 
flights are being arranged the spokeswoman said since there are 
many seats now available on regularly scheduled flights said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
about 1500 americans remain in china down from 8800 at the 
beginning of this year said ms tutwiler the embassy estimated 400 
americans remained in the city including about 100 embassy 
employees 
ms tutwiler said embassy personnel are making daily visits to 
the universities and to the hotels and there are no american 
students left at beijing university one of the rallying points of 
the student prodemocracy movement 
many foreigners who had been in beijing and shanghai during the 
last week were still shaken by the bloodshed and burning vehicles 
they had seen while some of those who journeyed from the provinces 
said other parts of china seemed nearly untouched by unrest in the 
capital 
some foreigners had trouble getting to beijing because some 
public transportation was suspended because of police and military 
roadblocks on the way to beijing and because drivers were afraid to 
go to beijing because of rumors of the dangerous situation there 
barbara weingardner an english teacher from cedar rapids iowa 
her husband and two children were at first unable to get 
transportation to beijing 
she said the town where she had been living was very 
peaceful but because of rumors of the danger in the capital 
nobody wanted to bring us into beijing she said 
later chinese officials arranged for a van with permission to 
enter beijing to transport the family 
the west german government said friday that it has withdrawn all 
nonessential staff from its embassy in beijing on wednesday it 
ordered the evacuation of all west germans working in beijing and 
their familes except for diplomats and journalists 
of the 3039 japanese who lived in beijing only embassy 
personnel and nine employees of trading companies remained behind 
kyodo news service reported 
a journalist who flew to beijing friday morning said the japan 
airlines jumbo jet carried only 21 people into china

former interior secretary james watt on friday 
denied using his contacts with former reagan cabinet colleague 
samuel pierce to sway federally subsidized housing projects to 
developers who paid watt as a consultant 
i never asked secretary pierce to do anything that would 
embarrass him or me said watt of his meetings in early 1985 with 
pierce who was secretary of housing and urban development at the 
time the meetings were in connection with a project to renovate a 
lowincome maryland housing development under huds section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman the house government 
operations subcommittee on housing and employment told watt at a 
hearing friday this project came into existence because of 
influencepeddling by you a much more worthy project may not have 
come into existence because they didnt have the good fortune to 
hire you 
and rep barney frank dmass told watt people had to pay to 
get influence on their behalf the fact remains you were able to 
do something because of your prior cabinet relationship with sam 
pierce 
watt said that in addition to his meetings with pierce in 
connection with the projects he had several conversations with 
three other hud officials deborah gore dean a special assistant 
to pierce and silvio debartolomeis and maurice barksdale who both 
served as assistant secretary for housing during pierces tenure 
however watt said he was not aware that pierce had set up a 
threeperson panel which included dean in the housing department 
to select projects for moderate rehabilitation funding 
he repeatedly rejected the characterization of his actions as 
influencepeddling saying he merely met with pierce to move 
the career bureaucracy in an agency which he said had become 
paralyzed 
im the messenger you dont need to badmouth the 
messenger watt retorted 
watt who left the cabinet in 1983 described what he termed a 
fee sharing arrangement with phoenix associates a group headed 
by joseph strauss who had been a special assistant to pierce watt 
and phoenix were paid 300000 as consultants to developer judith 
siegels landex corp on a project to renovate 312 units at the 
kingsley park apartments in essex md 
watt also testified he received 20000 and 100000 in 
consultant fees from similar arrangements with the phoenix group on 
projects in new jersey and puerto rico 
youre much more than a messenger frank said you are a 
great critic of the established ways but when the chance to make 
169000 came your way that did not seem to motivate you the 
balance of the 300000 went to phoenix associates 
the overall program came under congressional scrutiny after the 
hud inspector general found it poorly managed with little or 
no documentation or accountability and not in compliance with 
the competitive selection process required by federal 
regulations and guidelines 
hud secretary jack kemp suspended the program in april after the 
investigative audit revealed several former hud and other government 
officials had assisted public housing authorities and developers in 
obtaining grants to renovate or repair subsidized housing for 
lowincome families 
kemp has restored 1989 funding for the program and issued new 
guidelines on june 1 
at fridays hearing lantos said while in government mr watt 
often belittled federal programs to assist the poor and the less 
fortunate he spoke of the dangers of being lured by the crumbs of 
subsidies entitlements and giveaways but he apparently decided to 
take advantage of them 
watt acknowledged he wasnt hired by developers for his housing 
expertise but he said there was no abuse no illegality nothing 
done wrong in connection with my activities 
i have never received any hud funds federal funds or 
government funds not us government money or state government 
money or city or county tax dollars watt said emphasizing he was 
instead paid from the developers potential profits 
the point is whether you were paid to influence the decisions 
of government officials and did you have the access that other 
people did not said rep christopher shays rconn that is the 
classic definition of influencepeddling week 
dean and debartolomeis are scheduled to testify next week before 
lantos subcommittee one of several congressional panels 
investigating the housing program

a compromise package that would produce the 
first comprehensive update of the us immigration system in 25 
years is headed for the senate floor after clearing its major 
committee hurdle 
this is not a perfect bill said sen paul simon dill 
after the judiciary committee on thursday approved the bill 122 
the driving element of our immigration system has been family 
unification and this only modestly shortens the backlogs but it 
will inject some new life and flexibility into a petrified system 
simon said 
the measure provides for an overall immigration level of 600000 
annually the first such cap in us history it reflects the 
current flow plus 110000 
under the twotrack bill about 480000 visas would be reserved 
for socalled family immigration up from 436000 a newly 
established independent track for those with no current us 
relatives would provide for aproximately 120000 visas that 
represents a jump in such immigration from a current level of about 
54000 a year 
the bill had been stalled in the judiciary committee until a 
compromise under which lawmakers moved to keep at the current level 
64800 the number of brothers and sisters of adult us citizens 
permitted as immigrants 
sen alan simpson rwyo had urged a cut to 21600 in that 
category while simon called for an increase to 84000 
simpson and sen edward m kennedy dmass were cosponsors of 
the original version while simon offered a rival plan 
the compromise is expected to aid wouldbe immigrants from asian 
countries while the independent category was described by 
congressional aides who asked not to be identified by name as a 
boon to immigrants from african nations and some european countries 
including ireland 
the bill combines existing visas for professionals persons of 
exceptional merit and those with needed skills with 54000 new ones 
for independent immigrants annually 
the 54000 visas would be reserved for those qualifying under a 
pointsystem with points awarded for desirable attributes at the 
last minute the committee voted to drop a provision that would 
award 20 points to english language speakers a number of lawmakers 
recalled that their own relatives had arrived here without a command 
of english 
thus far the house has taken no action on the issue bills 
sponsored by reps howard l berman dcalif and hamilton fish 
rny are pending

the often raucous inaugural session of the new 
congress ended friday with president mikhail s gorbachev vigorously 
denying hes power hungry and andrei d sakharov demanding that the 
communist partys legal monopoly on power be abolished 
gorbachev interrupted sakharovs nationally televised speech from 
the dais saying he had spoken twice as long as permitted but the 
68yearold nobel peace laureate continued his voice rising and his 
arms flailing 
sakharov father of the soviet human rights movement told the 
congress of peoples deputies it had failed in its main task to 
establish a system of power to overcome economic and social problems 
and put an end to ecological madness 
the 1975 nobel peace laureate also said that by electing 
gorbachev president uncontested and investing him with far greater 
powers the deputies gave the communist party chief absolute 
personal power 
he called for abolishing article 6 of the constitution which 
declares the party the leading and guiding force of soviet society 
and the nucleus of its political system 
his proposal also would empower the congress to appoint the head 
of the kgb secret police the editor of the government newspaper 
izvestia the chief of the gostelradio state broadcasting authority 
and other top officials 
gorbachev to loud applause in the kremlin palace of congresses 
vigorously objected to what he described as sakharovs attempt to 
abase the work of the new parliament 
earlier he called the meeting of the first parliament chosen by 
multicandidate elections the most outstanding event in the entire 
history of the soviet state and a a new stage of perestroika 
his 4yearold campaign to reform the economy and society 
in proceedings that began may 25 and lasted twice as long as 
predicted the congress elected gorbachev to a presidency with 
vastly increased powers named his protege anatoly i lukyanov vice 
president and chose 542 of its 2250 members as a fulltime 
legislature to replace the old rubberstamp supreme soviet 
the parliament sessions broadcast live were gripping political 
drama for millions of soviets they contained unprecedent public 
criticism of kremlin leaders and detailed reports on the countrys 
woes 
government officials disclosed data long classified by the 
secretive bureaucracy premier nikolai i ryzhkov continued the 
trend friday by revealing that the foreign debt is 34 billion 
rubles 52 billion at the official exchange rate 
congress subjected national leaders to an unprecedented grilling 
gorbachev was driven on friday to deny indignantly that he was 
hungry for personal power and to assure deputies he was in no 
danger of being removed or assassinated 
reacting to challenges from several deputies that being both 
soviet president and chief of the communist party would make one man 
too powerful gorbachev said as a communist i categorically 
reject hints i am trying to concentrate power in my own hands 
this is alien to me to my views my outlook and my 
character he declared i as general secretary and president 
have no other policy than perestroika democratization and glasnost 
in this i see the point of my life and my work 
responding to comments he reported hearing from deputies about 
the inner workings of the ruling party politburo gorbachev assured 
them there was no danger of a coup or anything like that 
lets end these rumors he said in four years i have 
already died seven times and my family was killed three times 
boris n yeltsin the maverick former moscow party chief was 
among those who argued that gorbachev was accumulating too much 
power he said in the congress last week the extraordinary 
powers could lead to a new dictatorship 
sakharov told the deputies friday i personally respect mikhail 
sergeyevich gorbachev very much but it is dangerous to give so much 
power even to the initiator of perestroika 
in a rousing speech on the final day gorbachev said he 
understood the general dissatisfaction deputies had expressed but 
expressed confidence the session would move the country farther 
along the road of glasnost 
the new parliaments contentiousness reached an emotional peak 
thursday when about two dozen baltic deputies stormed out 
they left after objecting to formation of a committee to decide 
whether laws conform to the constitution they said the committee 
might encroach on their republics right to selfdetermination and 
the right professed by lithuania and estonia to veto laws passed by 
the central government 
estonia lithuania and latvia were independent when the soviet 
union absorbed them by force in 1940 
gorbachev asked the congress on friday to create a commission to 
write a law on protecting the constitutionality of soviet laws and 
report to the fall session of the congress it passed with only 10 
negative votes and 25 abstentions 
deputies also formed a commission chaired by gorbachev to draft 
a new constitution to replace the charter enacted in 1977

the bush administration is considering using 
the us military possibly including commando units against drug 
lords overseas as part of a broad campaign against narcotics 
trafficking according to a report published friday 
new guidelines to that effect despite a 1976 presidential order 
barring the us government from assassinations abroad are 
contained in a draft national security directive awaiting action at 
the white house said the miami herald in a report distributed by 
the knightridder news service 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he was not 
familiar with the story but he added assassinations are illegal 
we dont do assassinations 
the 1976 presidential directive forbids us government personnel 
from carrying out assassinations 
the news report said that david c miller a staff member of the 
national security council at the white house discussed the plan 
with congressional aides miller referred all telephone calls to 
fitzwaters office friday 
the knightridder story quoted a senior administration official 
as saying that a national security council team was considering 
military operations including such efforts against highvalue 
targets 
one pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
friday that military operations could include such activities as 
radio and telephone interceptions and aerial surveillance 
a congressional aide said that the national security council 
staff was drafting a directive to broaden the war on drugs 
it would call for close cooperation with foreign countries where 
drug traffickers operate and would require the consent of those 
governments before us military force was used on their territory 
said the source who spoke on condition he not be further identified 
the document which would elaborate on the directive signed by 
thenpresident ford on april 8 1976 would also call for increased 
financial assistance to latin american countries were drugs 
originate and for an expanded intelligence capacity against 
traffickers sources said 
all policy options are being considered in our efforts to 
combat drug trafficking and more and more people are beginning to 
view drug trafficking as a form of low intensity conflict said 
raphael perl an attorney and specialist on international affairs at 
the congressional research service 
people in policy positions in the administration are 
considering a full range of options said perl 
asked whether the use of military force against drug lords might 
be viewed as illegal perl said there is no doubt that a reading 
of the 1976 directive would give the impression that that was 
illegal 
other government lawyers have argued that the use of military 
force against enemies in a low intensity conflict might not be 
considered assassination 
an army attorney says that the term assassination refers to 
the killing of political figures rather than drug traffickers 
the armys top lawyer maj gen hugh overholt has argued in an 
eightpage memorandum that killing drug traffickers also would not 
be classified as assassinations if us military units rather than 
covert agents were involved 
the memo drafted by another army attorney w hays parks 
originated as a proposed section in an army manual on international 
law rather than as a policy initiative according to pentagon 
officials the memo is not classified and has been provided to 
reporters 
when asked to draw a distinction between assassinations of 
foreign leaders and the killing of drug lords fitzwater said 
well i dont know what the story is about i havent seen it 
but assassinations are illegal and we are not involved in those

construction began on a doubledecker highway 
friday in an effort to ease one of the nations worst commuter 
traffic jams but road work threatened to worsen the 
bumpertobumper standstill called rush hour 
gov george deukmejian presided at a ceremonial dedication of the 
overhead highway project dubbed the second generation of 
freeways 
standing atop an unfinished freeway link that will give rise to 
the top deck deukmejian praised the 530 million project which 
will cater to buses and carpools as californias road to rational 
commuting 
the fact that were holding this event on an onramp is 
symbolic he said because it demonstrates our commitment not to 
let traffic congestion force california onto an offramp in terms of 
our prosperity in the future 
car worship has caused mounting problems in southern california 
where cruising is still king but frustration over snarled roadways 
prompted a 1987 summer of freeway violence as angry motorists took 
potshots at one another 
we know that impatience and driver anger often result in 
serious injuries said sgt mike brey of the california highway 
patrol 
urging everyone trapped in their fast car to dont worry 
be happy kearth radio disc jockey steve morris broadcast his 
morning commute show from a dennys restaurant in hollywood where 
commuters were offered a complimentary meal 
the new overhead project will link the century freeway still 
under construction with exclusive carpool and bus lanes from the 
heavily traveled harbor freeway which links downtown to the citys 
port district 
the elevated sections of the harbor freeway transitway will 
stretch 26 miles and are scheduled to open in the fall of 1993 
during construction which takes place in the center of the 
existing highway some of the average 230000 daily drivers are 
bound to get testy during delays because the freeway already has a 
50 percent higher accident rate than other los angeles freeways as 
a result the time lost on the harbor is 40 percent higher than 
other freeways 
deukmejian said increasing reliance on mass transit and carpools 
was the only way to solve the states traffic problems 
we cannot just build ourselves out of the problem he said 
caltrans calls the overhead project the beginning of its second 
generation because it involves expanding capacity without buying new 
land a feature likely to be used more and more as property values 
soar deukmejian said 
the overhead sections devoted solely to buses and other socalled 
highoccupancy vehicles can also be converted to service a proposed 
light rail line 
to close the ceremonies california department of transportation 
officials made deukmejian an honorary highway engineer and presented 
him with a hardhat and a trademark caltrans orange safety vest 
but the governor didnt let the honor go to his head 
this means im qualified to go pick up litter along the 
freeways he joked 
the special kearth radio show and broadcast site were staged as 
part of drivetime day decreed by mayor tom bradley to emphasize a 
citywide effort to promote commuter courtesy

pentagon officials disputing a congressional 
report said friday that if congress wants to fight illegal drug 
imports more money must be spent on aerial interdiction efforts 
they told a senate panel the defense department wants to spend a 
third of the 300 million its getting to fight drugs this year to 
add radar equipment and radar balloons known as aerostats that aid 
surveillance along the nations southern border 
if youre going to put up a fence the fence isnt very valid 
until you get the whole thing up because they keep coming through 
the holes said army lt gen thomas w kelly director of 
operations for the joint chiefs of staff 
kelly criticized a report by arnold p jones of the general 
accounting office the research branch of congress who said he 
concluded from an 18month study that spending more money on air 
interdiction efforts would not substantially curtail drug 
trafficking 
despite substantial drug seizures through aerial interdiction 
far more drugs are getting into the country illustrated by greater 
purity of drugs on the street decreases in prices and hikes in 
drugrelated emergency room treatments jones told the senate 
permanent subcommittee on investigations 
we have to start looking for alternative approaches jones 
said noting that federal spending on air interdiction programs 
increased from about 18 million in 1982 to about 204 million in 
1989 
meanwhile jamaican prime minister michael manley proposed 
creation of an international organization to coordinate drug 
intelligence interdiction and enforcement such a force manley 
said could be available to provide paramilitary muscle if a 
problem in a particular country is that serious 
i would feel very good to know i could raise a hand and say 
come please help me fight drug traffickers manley who was in 
washington on a private visit said at a press conference 
such a force would also train personnel from smaller nations he 
said 
the principal us radar network to detect airborne smugglers 
uses five radars attached to tethered balloons called aerostats in 
south florida the bahamas and on the usmexico border the 
pentagon plans to add 11 more aerostats and the cost for the six 
aerostats not already funded and two longrange radar aircraft is at 
least 124 million jones said 
all air interdiction programs resulted in the seizure of about 28 
tons of cocaine through 1987 but many of those resulted from 
advance intelligence in which federal agents allowed the flights to 
occur in order to make arrests he said 
there is a lot of legitimate air traffic along the border 
said jones technology no matter how sophisticated is never 
going to say what is in that plane what is in that vehicle 
kelly acknowledged aerostats have had limited success thus far 
but said pretty obviously thats because theyre very easy at 
this point to fly around 
and he said when we turn the radars on whether its in an 
awacs surveillance plane or its in an aerostat balloon they 
have fuzzbusters radar detectors in their aircraft and they just 
turn around and dont come in 
once more aerostats are up he said we will begin to make some 
measurable progress even if we only ot 50 percent availability 
of the aerostats that would be 50 percent of the time that wed 
have the fence up and it would then allow us to concentrate our 
other resources such as awacs to make it continually more 
difficult for the drug traffickers to do business to come into the 
united states 
the pentagon is getting 300 million for its part in the drug war 
this year and wants to buy three more regular aerostats one 
semisubmersible vehicle with an aerostat a ship with an aerostat 
on it and a spare aerostat kelly said 
lt gen stephen g olmstead deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for drug policy and enforcement said the pentagon plans to 
spend 100 million for various aerostats and radar support this year 
olmstead said the pentagons antidrug spending plans also 
include 100 million for its own detection and monitoring efforts 
60 million for communications equipment to create a network linking 
all federal drug enforcement efforts and 40 million for national 
guard operations for which 49 plans have been approved so far

the us government thinks the palestine 
liberation organization is examining the possibility of holding 
elections in israelioccupied territories as a first step to peace 
talks an official said friday 
us ambassador robert pelletreau said on thursday that he 
devoted his third round of talks with plo officials in tunisia to 
seeking acceptance of elections in the west bank and gaza strip as 
proposed by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler told reporters on 
friday that she had little to add to what pelletreau said after the 
meeting 
ms tutwiler was asked whether the plo had responded firmly to 
whether it would allow palestinians in the territories to discuss 
the election proposal with israel 
we have made it very clear to them that the elections concept 
offers the pathway to progress and that they should not impose 
conditions upon it that would make it impossible to move ahead 
she said 
based on the discussions that we have had with plo officials 
they have not in our opinion rejected the election concept ms 
tutwiler said our view is that they will continue to explore the 
elections concept

andrei d sakharov proposed in a nationally 
televised speech in congress on friday his own bold program for 
political reform that would abolish the communist partys legal 
monopoly on power 
president mikhail s gorbachev interrupted sakharov from the 
dais saying he had spoken twice as long as permitted but the 
68yearold nobel peace laureate continued raising his voice and 
waving his arms 
sakharov father of the soviet human rights movement told the 
congress of peoples deputies on the final day of its inaugural 
session that it had failed in its main task to establish a 
system of power to overcome economic and social problems and put an 
end to ecological madness 
the standing legislature chosen by the 2250member congress 
contains more than 50 percent idle functionaries he charged 
so the supreme soviet will be used as a screen for the party and 
the party apparatus 
he also said congress did communist party chief gorbachev a 
disservice by electing him soviet president when it convened may 25 
without considering alternative candidates 
in accordance with the constitution the president has 
absolute personal power concentrated in the hands of one person 
sakharov said i personally respect mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev 
very much but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the 
initiator of perestroika 
sakharov elected to congress from the soviet academy of 
sciences proposed his own decree on power that would end the 
monopoly on power the communist party has jealously guarded since 
the 1917 russian revolution 
he called for abolishing article 6 of the constitution which 
declares the 20million member party the leading and guiding force 
of soviet society and the nucleus of its political system and 
gives the party the right to determine the general perspectives of 
the development of society and the course of the domestic and 
foreign policy of the ussr 
sakharovs proposal would also empower congress to appoint the 
head of the kgb secret police the editor of the government 
newspaper izvestia the chief of the gostelradio state broadcasting 
authority and other top leadership figures 
sakharov said the soviet president and those officials should 
report to congress alone to be independent from the party and the 
partys bodies 
he said kgb functions should be limited to ensuring the 
international security of the ussr which would mean an end to 
its widespread spying activities on soviet citizens 
the activist whom gorbachev allowed to return to moscow in 
december 1986 after nearly seven years of forced exile in the closed 
city of gorky asked congress to form a committee to consider his 
proposal and to adopt it at an extraordinary sesssion 
he appealed on the live telecast for the support of the soviet 
people as they have done when there was an attempt to discredit 
sakharov to divert attention from the problem of the afghan war 
sakharovs public criticism of the december 1979 soviet military 
push into afghanistan prompted his being exiled and stripped of 
medals and honors 
sakharov also proposed creating an equal federal system to 
give the 15 constituent soviet republics more rights and end decades 
of topheavy centralized control from moscow 
gorbachev tried to cut sakharov off when he complained that a 
resolution adopted tuesday by congress on the recent violence in 
beijing did not fully reflect the depth of the problem 
the resolution called events in china including the bloody army 
attack on prodemocracy demonstrators a purely internal affair 
gorbachev told sakharov he had already spoken twice as long as 
permitted by congress rules 
i respect congress but i respect the people who listen to 
me sakharov answered from the rostrum i respect humanity

the bush administrations new debtreduction 
effort is likely to fail unless more taxpayer resources are 
provided an international research group said friday 
the report prepared by the world institute for development 
economics research said any successful effort to tackle the debt 
problem would need to slash the 370 billion owed by the 39 most 
heavily indebted countries by 125 billion a reduction of 33 
percent 
to accomplish this the study said governments would need to put 
up 50 billion as an enticement to commercial banks to participate 
in the voluntary debt forgiveness program 
by contrast the debt reduction strategy unveiled by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady on march 10 called for a 20 percent 
reduction in debt owed by the 39 largest debtor nations over a 
threeyear period the 151nation international monetary fund and 
its sister lending organization the world bank would put up 
approximately 24 billion under that plan 
the brady initiative has been criticized by some who charge that 
it represents a taxpayerfinanced bailout for the worlds large 
commercial banks 
but the new study argued that unless even more funds are 
committed to the debt relief effort there is a danger that heavily 
indebted countries will simply default on their loans forcing 
commercial banks to take huge writeoffs which would end up costing 
taxpayers more 
accomplishing debt relief in an orderly way would reduce the 
burden on taxpayers said former imf director johannes witteveen 
one of the authors of the report 
witteveen told reporters in washington that one way to attract 
larger resources to help write off the debt would be to have the imf 
set up a special trust fund and encourage countries with large trade 
surpluses such as japan south korea taiwan and west germany to 
contribute to the fund 
the special imf fund could be used to provide more incentives to 
commercial banks to forgive a portion of their third world loans 
the brady plan envisions using the resources of the imf and world 
bank to guarantee that the reduced level of debt will be repaid 
thus enticing banks to participate in the debt reduction effort 
if these debtreduction negotiations do not succeed you 
would get debt reduction in a disorderly way with wide ranging 
defaults by debtor nations witteveen said that would be more 
harmful to the world financial system 
among participants in the group which produced the study were 
former french prime minister raymond barre and robert solow nobel 
prizewinning economist at the massachusetts institute of technology 
the world institute for development economics research 
affiliated with the united nations university was established in 
helsinki in 1985 to study world economic problems

mobs with guns molotov cocktails and pitchforks 
have seized several police stations in soviet uzbekistan and show no 
signs of ending a weeklong frenzy of arson and murder soviet media 
reported friday 
the death toll from uzbekturkish violence in the fergana region 
of the central asian republic is nearing 80 and more than 800 
people have been injured the government newspaper izvestia said 
mobs of more than 5000 people have been on a destructive rampage 
in the city of kokand according to the official media 
fighting began june 3 between ethnic uzbeks and members of the 
meskhi turk minority who were forcibly resettled in the fergana 
valley by the late dictator josef stalin in 1944 reports said 
rioters have burned more than 550 houses and nearly 300 vehicles 
most owned by turks and 300 people have been detained 
about 9000 internalsecurity troops have been sent to the area 
moscows evening news program vremya said the troops are in 
control in the regional center of fergana but cannot restore order 
elsewhere frankly speaking police dont have enough force to 
stop all the violence the commentator said 
in kokand 1500 miles southeast of moscow a militant mob 
is freely moving around the place setting houses on fire stoning 
trains mutilating and killing vremya reported videotapes showed 
crowds blocking railroad tracks and buildings in flames it said 
from 5000 to 6000 people were massed at the local police station 
the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said mobs in kokand 
stormed most of the police stations and also seized three 
locomotives rioters were threatening to blow up ailroad fuel tanks 
it said 
interior minister gen y v shatalin told vremya that friday 
afternoon about 5000 extremist youths attacked government 
office buildings and turkish neighborhoods in kokand 
for the first time we saw a great number of automatic firearms 
carried by the attackers shatalin said he did not say where they 
might have obtained the weapons 
he said about 100 people suffered gunshot woundes 
a vremya correspondent in kokand said interior ministry troops 
were firing into the air to try to disperse the mob and shots are 
heard from the crowd 
in tashlak a wild mob incited by extremists tried several 
times to occupy an administration building and inflict reprisals on 
women and children of the turkish nationality the military 
newspaper krasnaya zvezda said the hooligans used bottles filled 
with fuel firearms rocks pitchforks and other objects 
izvestia said the actions of uncontrolled elements are 
becoming more aggressive more and more often attacks are being made 
on buildings of the interior ministry and police the goal is to 
seize weapons the population is extremely agitated 
shavkat yuldashev the fergana regions communist party chief 
told izvestia we dont have enough force yet for its 
stabilization and he called for more decisive measures 
but the nations new parliament the congress of peoples 
deputies did not discuss the uzbekistan violence in its televised 
public sessions friday the final day of its session authorities 
have not announced reinforcements for troops in the area 
the newspaper trud said many of the kokand hooligans arrived 
in the city of more than 150000 in organized columns of cars from 
other regions of the cottongrowing valley 
the extremists activities have confirmed they are not 
nationalistic riots by separate groups of youth but wellorganized 
and controlled political actions shatalin said apparently many 
dislike what is happening in our country now and in particular in 
uzbekistan 
he apparently referred to president mikhail s gorbachevs reform 
programs which have included a campaign against corruption in 
uzbekistan many government and party officials have been accused of 
taking bribes and fired 
the violence is the latest in a series of ethnic disputes in the 
southern soviet union where confrontations in the caucasus region 
and in central asia have killed scores of people and left thousands 
homeless 
uzbeks are hanging red cloths on their homes so the mobs would 
know they are not turks said nazgi mir vagirzade a 31yearold 
teacher and meskhi turk in moscow to appeal for help 
officials said more than 10000 meskhi turks have been evacuated 
to army camps 
the meskhi turks were forcibly resettled from soviet georgia 
near the turkish border during world war ii

the air force on friday narrowed its search for 
40 radio tower sites needed to complete a doomsday radio 
network announcing construction was envisioned from maine to 
georgia and from virginia to california 
in all 26 states will probably have one or more of the final 40 
towers the air force said 
the service through its electronic systems division at hanscomb 
air force base mass said it had selected sections of the various 
states where a tower would be needed but not the specific sites 
the air force said it would spend the next year conducting 
environmental studies holding public hearings and picking the 
specific 11acre tracts needed within each state section only when 
a specific site is approved after the environmental process can 
construction of the lowpower lowfrequency radio towers begin the 
service said 
the ground wave emergency network known as gwen is an 
automated system of radio transmitters designed to ensure adequate 
communication links for military forces in time of war if theres a 
nuclear war the satellite telephone and radio links now used for 
military communications would likely be destroyed or disrupted 
the air force already is building a thin line gwen system 
across the country consisting of 56 radio relay towers that link 38 
terminals at military bases the thin line system 52 of the 56 
towers have been built looks like a giant 8 stretched across 
the country with the center at the strategic air command 
headquarters at omaha neb 
fridays announcement by the air force finally completes the 
picture of how the emergency warfighting network will look when the 
final offshoots or radio paths are added to the 8 to link 
more sac bases to the system 
the service hopes to have all 96 radio towers operating by early 
1992 the system carries a price tag of between 600 million and 
700 million 
the work is an integral part of the strategic modernization 
program begun by former president reagan the air force said 
this system will ensure that vital messages flow to top military 
leaders and operational forces 
according to fridays announcement the air force expects to 
build new towers in the northeast and south in the following areas 
southwestern and central maine eastern pennsylvania western 
maryland central and western virginia central north carolina 
northwestern georgia eastern and central tennessee central 
kentucky and southern arkansas 
in the midwest the service said towers will be needed in central 
ohio northwestern indiana central michigan north central 
wisconsin central minnesota north central south dakota 
northwestern nebraska north central iowa and northeastern and 
southern missouri 
and in the west the air force said towers would be needed in 
central northeast and north central texas southwest south central 
and northwest colorado southern and central utah central southern 
and northeastern nevada northern california southeastern idaho 
central wyoming and southeastern northeastern south central and 
western montana 
a typical gwen station consists of a thin 300foot tower and 
three small shelters surrounded by a fence the shelters house 
electronic equipment and an emergency generator and fuel the 
stations normally require a 700foot square parcel of land about 
11 acres 
each gwen antenna is connected to a small grid of copper wire 
buried underground at its base and operates with 2000 to 3000 
watts of power the towers must be located with 200 miles of each 
other 
some of the towers in the thinline system prompted public 
controversy with citizen groups in such states as massachusetts 
oregon pennsylvania and california banding together to fight gwen 
on grounds the towers increased the likelihood of their towns 
becoming nuclear targets 
the air force has dismissed such arguments asserting the 
isolated 300foot gwen towers are not tempting enough to be 
targeted

president roh taewoo has ruled out a 
promised referendum on his administration because it might cause 
unrest and he will complete his fiveyear term the head of the 
governing party said friday 
park jyunkyu chairman of the democratic justice party also 
told the associated press in an interview the gradual withdrawal of 
us forces from south korea could begin in 1992 if the government 
is confident it can defend itself against communist north korea 
were excluding any possibility of a national referendum 
park said the president is going to perform his duties up to the 
last day of his term we feel thats what the majority of the people 
want 
before the presidential election in december 1987 roh promised 
to hold a referendum on his performance after the olympic games were 
held in seoul in september 1988 the former general won the election 
when rival candidates split the opposition vote 
he postponed the referendum in march saying it could create a 
major political confrontation some opposition leaders had said roh 
must resign if he lost the referendum 
park said the government was not ruling out referendums on major 
issues but there would be no vote requiring roh to resign if the 
government lost he said polls clearly showed public opposition to a 
referendum 
the party chairman also said public opposition to dissidents was 
growing and the dissidents were losing strength he said the 
government had cracked down because the dissidents because were a 
violent threat to the government and the public needed reassurance 
on friday riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse 
radical students demanding to take part in a youth festival in 
communist north korea about 300 arrests were reported 
park said he saw little hope for a quick end to confrontation 
with the communist north and recent south korean efforts to improve 
relations made no substantial progress 
we were too unrealistic he said 
the korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 the north 
invaded the south in 1950 starting the threeyear korean war 
park said he favors a longterm us military presence but 
gradual withdrawal could begin in 1992 if south korea is able to 
defend itself some dissidents have demanded expulsion of the 43000 
american soldiers

leaders of the us highereducation community 
on friday urged chinese officials to keep soldiers off campuses and 
refrain from reprisals against students and scholars involved in 
prodemocracy protests 
the leaders of six associations representing more than 3000 us 
colleges and universities also urged president bush to act promptly 
on visa extensions for chinese students and scholars in the united 
states and explore the possibility of federal help for those who may 
face an end to support from the chinese government 
in a letter to li tie ying chairman of the the state education 
commission in beijing the education leaders called on chinese 
officials to prevent further bloodshed and find ways to resolve 
differences peacefully 
we urge chinese leaders including the leadership of the 
peoples liberation army not to send troops into university 
campuses and to refrain from punitive actions and harsh measures 
against members of the academic community the letter said 
robert atwell president of the american council on education 
said he delivered the letter to ni mengxiong the ministercounselor 
for education affairs at the chinese embassy here 
he told reporters that the recent military crackdown in which 
hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed poses a 
serious threat to relations between us and chinese universities 
these relations have painstakingly and productively evolved 
since president nixons visit to china theres no question that 
what has happened there has created a lot of damage that will last 
for a long time said atwell 
allan ostar president of the american association of state 
colleges and universities said his group has canceled all exchanges 
with china including a delegation of university presidents that had 
been scheduled to leave for china on june 25 and plans to send 
english teachers to various chinese provinces 
in a telex to li the state education commission chairman ostar 
said his association felt revulsion and outrage toward the 
atrocities committed by the peoples liberation army given 
these deplorable acts we have no choice but to suspend all exchange 
activities until a responsible government with a respect for its 
people and for its educational institutions is restored 
however some groups are still hoping to go ahead with exchange 
plans for the fall and a symposium next summer in california 
officials said atwell said there were about 1000 us students and 
teachers in china before the crackdown 
there are 40000 chinese students and scholars attending or 
working at us colleges and universities according to atwell many 
of their visas are expiring as the school year ends and they are in 
need of immediate advice on how to get extensions 
the education leaders urged bush in a letter to instruct the 
justice department to promptly advise the visiting students and 
scholars on how to apply for oneyear extensions and decide by dec 
30 whether to make the oneyear extensions indefinite 
they also asked the president to make temporary changes enabling 
the academic visitors to get or keep jobs here and they urged 
consideration of emergency funds for those who depend on support 
from the chinese government and may face delays or cutoffs of funds 
about onequarter of the 40000 depend on such support atwell said 
those signing the letters to li and bush were atwell ostar and 
leaders of the association of american universities the national 
association of state universities and landgrant colleges the 
american association of community and junior colleges and the 
national association of independent colleges and universities

the largest newark anywhere held a reunion 
friday for its namesakes around the world stretching from 
california to south africa to the english mother of them all 
newarkontrent 
were proud of each other and were inspired by each other 
said sharpe james mayor of newark nj now were talking to each 
other and learning and i guess trying to outdo each other 
the reunion of municipalities named newark originated about two 
years ago in california when that states newark gathered eight 
cities with the same name 
officials in new jerseys largest city thought they could do 
better and did finding 29 they were in brazil and vermont 
arkansas and maryland delaware and illinois they looked in their 
backyard and found newark ny and east newark nj and looked 
down under and found newark australia 
meg glover is the city clerk of the smallest newark the one in 
missouri population 105 
we fluctuate a little bit as people die and people are born 
ms glover said but i dont expect its changed much since i 
left 
ms glover said talking with newarkers from around the world has 
shown her that people share the same problems everywhere in her 
small town 35 miles north of hannibal mo residents are grappling 
with some of the same pressures as newark ohio 
we had a problem that we didnt have housing for the 
elderly ms glover said now we have eight units thats a lot 
for us 
the newark in california also had a problem although it now 
celebrates its name and its heritage the city once considered 
calling itself newark of bay so it wouldnt be so closely identified 
with newark nj a city of 330000 that has been maligned for its 
problems with poverty and crime 
that ideas dead now said nita clendenning who helped

british officials on friday urged that hong kong 
send home most vietnamese boat people whose latest influx is 
creating a second crisis for the british colony deeply worried about 
coming under chinese rule in 1997 
in hong kong legislators said friday that londons policy of 
allowing only some hong kong citizens the right to emigrate to 
britain is no longer adequate 
with boat people arriving at a record rate of 500 a day public 
opinion in hong kong is very frustrated said geoffrey barnes the 
colonys british secretary of security they see no end to it 
hong kong has had enough 
we believe that mandatory repatriation of all nonrefugees 
is a logical and essential consequence of screening he said at a 
news conference 
hong kong has 42766 vietnamese boat people one third of whom 
arrived this year barnes said all but 14150 were categorized as 
simply seeking a better way of life as opposed to being political 
refugees 
the british government said foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
will visit hong kong early next month in an attempt to restore 
confidence 
aides said that among other things howe will discuss a 
relaxation of emigration rules to give a greater number of the 32 
million hong kong chinese with british passports the right to 
emigrate to britain 
prime minister margaret thatcher this week ruled out an opendoor 
policy but promised greater flexibility particularly for public 
servants and people with private incomes 
british newspapers reported that all 180000 hong kong civil 
servants and up to 50000 retired civil servants and businessmen and 
their families will be given the right to come to britain 
but hong kong legislators said increased flexibility is no 
longer adequate 
britain has a fundamental moral duty to extend the right to 
abode to all the british nationals in hong kong said a statement 
by the lawmakers 
the declaration came a day after mrs thatcher rejected a similar 
appeal by hong kong governor sir david wilson during an emergency 
meeting in london 
the crackdown in china on prodemocracy students has increased 
fears china will renege on an agreement to preserve hong kongs 
capitalist system for 50 years after it takes over the territory 
now an important financial center 
britain is now simply hoping that the aging hardliners now in 
charge in beijing will be gone before 1997 and that china will want 
to keep hong kong capitalist for its own benefit 
economic selfinterest will surely reassert itself in china 
british trade and industry secretary lord young said friday in an 
address to a hong kong chinese group in london but he added 
these are dark and still early days i have for you no easy 
reassurances 
a conference in geneva next week on refugees to be attended by 
united nations representatives and southeast asian countries is 
expected to agree on tough screening procedures for boat people but 
stop short of forced repatriation

a jury awarded 1 million friday to a woman who 
said she suffered grave mental anguish after learning that her 
college boyfriend had secretly videotaped them having sex and shown 
the tape to others 
we just feel wonderful said ronald krist who represented 
23yearold susan kerr in a lawsuit seeking 48 million in damages 
you know this lawsuit was never about money it was about a 
definition of who was the victim and who was the culprit he said 
we undertook a jury to help cleanse our reputation and that was 
done 
the jury of seven women and five men said the exboyfriend and 
three other defendants had acted with gross negligence the four 
were assessed 500000 in compensatory damages for pain and 
suffering and an additional 500000 in punitive damages 
ms kerr who testified during the trial that the tape and the 
ensuing gossip it caused affected her health and her studies said 
she accomplished what she wanted 
the purpose was to know and let other people know that i wasnt 
wrong in what i did ms kerr said i never did anything wrong 
what they did to me was wrong 
the largest share of damages was 350000 assessed against dan 
boyles 21 who admitted appearing in the videotape having sex with 
ms kerr and showing the tape to at least 10 fellow students at the 
university of texas at austin 
other defendants and damages were karl broesche at whose house 
the filming took place 100000 john paul tamborello 25000 and 
wray widner 25000 
boyles attorney jaime drabek said he was surprised by the 
amount of damages but pleased the jury did not award the full amount 
sought by ms kerr 
drabek said he expected the jury to assess some liability but 
not to find there was gross negligence 
this was an impromptu stupid immature and adolescent 
mistake drabek said but he added that the matter would have been 
better solved between all the parents not by the court 
drabek said he was not sure yet whether the verdict would be 
appealed attorneys for the other defendants could not be reached by 
telephone in their offices friday afternoon

nato allies promised friday to increase 
their annual defense budgets to retain a strong military stance 
while awaiting an accord with the east to cut conventional forces in 
europe 
defense ministers said they will seek increases of 3 percent 
discounting inflation the goal dates to 1977 although many of the 
western alliances 16 members including the united states have 
never achieved or sustained it 
notwithstanding the announced unilateral reductions in warsaw 
pact forces and the possibility of future arms control agreements a 
very considerable imbalance remains between the forces of the warsaw 
pact and nato western defense ministers said in statement after a 
twoday meeting 
the target of a real increase in defense expenditure of the 
order of 3 percent should in the absence of tangible improvement in 
the balance of forces serve as a general guide 
in vienna nato ambassadors proposed an unprecedented exchange of 
information among east west and neutral nations about military 
forces in europe the proposal made at talks between 35 nations on 
building confidence on european security calls for a data bank that 
would make available details on armed forces and weapons deployment 
arms procurement and other matters 
us defense secretary dick cheney told reporters in brussels 
if we reach an agreement for reductions in armaments on both sides 
to equal levels there will still be the need for modernizing these 
forces 
he said the prospect of reducing conventional forces in europe 
being negotiated in vienna is no reason to relax defense spending 
nato in december listed alliance nations whose defense efforts 
were considered insufficient fueling criticism by us lawmakers 
who believe the united states pays too great a share for europes 
security 
cheney said the united states will not reach the 3 percent target 
in higher defense spending in the next fiscal year but stressed 
this would not undermine us commitments in europe 
at the meeting cheney discussed president bushs proposal to 
remove 30000 us troops and 325000 soviet soldiers from europe 
and reduce aircraft fleets by 15 percent natos by 750 planes and 
the warsaw pacts by 3000 
he said the aircraft reductions would not include british and 
french planes able to carry conventional and nuclear arms 
cheney said he assured western allies that washington will not 
withdraw from europe 72 f16 jetfighters in spain the planes which 
cheney called absolutely vital to the defense of natos southern 
flank are to go to italy when spain ends an accord with the united 
states 
the proposed aircraft cuts would leave nato and the sevennation 
east bloc each with roughly 4600 combat aircraft in europe nato 
sources said 
bush proposed last week that the east and west agree in six to 12 
months to the cuts and others proposed in vienna for tanks armored 
personnel carriers and artillery pieces natowarsaw pact talks 
began in vienna this year 
cheney called the timetable optimistic 
but i think it is well worth our making that effort he said 
there is a real sense of momentum now 
the defense ministers said raising defense budgets by 3 percent a 
year must remain a goal 
there was broad agreement that sound defenses are constantly 
kept up to date said nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner of 
west germany 
he said the warsaw pact retains roughly a 2to1 superiority over 
nato in conventional forces 
woerner said recently announced soviet troop withdrawals from 
eastern europe have still to be fully implemented and soviet 
military production remains very high 
in december gorbachev said 50000 red army troops would be 
withdrawn from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary by the end 
of 1990 he also has announced that 500 shortrange nuclear missiles 
will be removed from europe 
the vienna proposal was presented by the netherlands on behalf of 
nato at a closed session of the conference attended by the united 
states and canada the soviet union and all european nations except 
albania 
they are discussing confidence and securitybuilding measures to 
verify and enhance agreements reached at the parallel vienna talks 
between the nato and seven warsaw pact nations on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
the western alliance proposes each country 
provide information by dec 15 each year on weapons procurement 
programs for the following year and exact deployment of troops down 
to regiment or brigade level and their peacetime strength and 
equipment 
submit at seven days notice to at least three inspections a 
year 
give more exact information about maneuvers and advance notice 
of all maneuvers involving 50000 troops or more 
improve working facilities for inspectors observation of 
maneuvers and for foreign military attaches and journalists

a pediatrician said in an article published friday 
that up to 10 percent of babies thought to be crib death victims 
probably were killed by their mothers 
the article by professor roy meadow head of pediatrics and child 
health at st jamess university hospital leeds appeared in the 
british medical journal 
meadow wrote that from 2 percent to 10 percent of the deaths 
attributed to sudden infant death syndrome have probably been 
smothered by their mothers 
some mothers smother their child when they are feeling a 
violent hatred toward their baby he wrote others do it in a 
repetitive systematic way taking their child regularly to the 
doctor each time they have smothered their child for long enough to 
make him or her unconscious 
dr pamela davies of the foundation for the study of infant 
deaths said the organization had always recognized that some crib 
deaths may have been caused by adults but she thought a figure of 
10 percent was highly unlikely 
meadow said many crib death victims have suffered recurrent 
episodes of respiratory arrest or seizures that may have been 
investigated but doctors may not have considered the possibility of 
child abuse 
asphyxia is an uncommon but serious form of child abuse 
meadow wrote 
the commonest form is smothering and the abuser is usually the 
childs mother who uses her hand a pad of rolledup clothing or a 
pillow to obstruct the childs air passages 
less commonly she presses the childs face against her chest 
encloses the childs head in a plastic bag or strangles by pressure 
on the childs neck 
he added a young child who cannot breathe struggles and tries 
to get air the smothering needs considerable force even when a 
child is young despite the obvious violence entailed the signs may 
be very few

president bush is expected to propose 
legislation requiring a 10 millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000 to combat acid rain administration and 
congressional sources said friday 
the new acidrain standards not quite as extensive as the 12 
millionton cut sought by environmentalists but far more rigid than 
industry has wanted are expected to be a key component in a 
cleanair package bush will unveil on monday 
the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity also said 
that bushs package likely would give industries that use cleancoal 
technology additional time and flexibility in meeting the standards 
the legislation will not mandate how industrial plants should go 
about reducing sulfur dioxide emissions giving them the choice of 
methods the sources said 
and the package will offer special credits and other financial 
incentives to industries that surpass the standards the sources 
said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush had 
made some preliminary decisions on the cleanair package but 
would make up his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekend 
while at the presidential retreat in camp david md 
he is taking with him decision memos and options on all the 
major questions that are still outstanding and we would expect 
decisions over the weekend fitzwater said 
it was unclear friday on how the cuts would be distributed 
nationwide but the president was expected to include a proposal 
where a utility excceeding the required reductions could sell 
credits to one that had not permitting the buying to utility to 
comply 
several sources said the president was provided options that 
ranged from forcing the 20 dirtiest plants to come up with most of 
the early emission reductions to forcing smaller cuts on 107 plants 
across the country 
the president is expected to propose a system by which a utility 
that exceeds the reduction requirements may sell credits to another 
that has not bringing the buying utility into compliance 
american electric power which operates in parts of ohio 
indiana kentucky michigan and west virginia said friday if the 
20plant option is adopted it would be forced to raise residential 
electric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent 
the cost of such emission reductions will grind the economies 
of the midwestern states our heavy industries which rely upon low 
energy costs would be devastated maintained a joseph dowd 
senior vice president of american electric power 
among the decisions still to be resolved presumably are whether 
bushs package billed in advance as the most comprehensive 
overhaul yet of the 19yearold clean air act will set new 
standards for automobile tailpipe exhausts 
environmentalists want a requirement that tailpipe emissions of 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide which were last reduced in 1981 
be further reduced by 1993 the automobile industry has voiced 
strong objections to any further tightening of the standards 
administration officials perhaps signaling a decision against 
tighter tailpipe standards have stressed in recent days that the 
bush package would put heavy emphasis on alternate auto fuels such 
as alcohol blends that contain fewer contaminants 
the president also is considering a reduction in nitrogen oxide 
emissions another component of acid rain which primarily comes from 
both electric utility plants and automobiles options prepared by 
the domestic policy council suggested that annual nitrogen oxide 
emissions be cut by 2 million to 4 million tons roughly 10 percent 
to 20 percent 
nitrogen oxidens are transformed into nitric acid in the 
atmosphere a minority component in acid rain in the east but 
nonetheless suspected by many scientists of helping damaqe 
highaltitude forests through overfertilization 
the president is expected to promote the alternate fuels section 
of his bill on tuesday in a speech at the university of nebraska in 
lincoln its the second day of a twoday western trip to showcase 
the new package 
he visits yellowstone national park on monday and gives a talk 
on the cleanair package tuesday morning at the teton science school 
at jackson hole wyo 
the cleanair bill which bush on thursday declared would benefit 
the quality of life of every north american will have three 
sections dealing with acid rain urban smog and chemical pollution 
sources have said that the section on chemical pollution would 
set tough new requirements that would affect hundreds of categories 
of businesses from paint plants to bakeries 
cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year 
2000 as bush was expected to recommend would reduce the 
contaminant to roughly half its current level 
acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide an ingredient of 
smokestack emissions from coalburning utilities and industries 
combines with water in the atmosphere and clouds to form acid which 
then returns to earth in rain and snow 
midwestern utilities that burn highsulfur coal without cleanup 
technology are generally agreed to be the chief source of the acid 
rain that damages sensitive lakes streams and aquatic life in 
canada and the northeast 
bush in his 1989 budget document to congress said his 
administration was committed to ending the long debate on acid 
rain 
the president also agreed previously to a 5 billion fiveyear 
joint study with canada on finding ways to develop cleanerburning 
coal

prime minister sousuke uno said friday that japans 
past militarism was responsible for causing hardships in korea and 
elsewhere in asia before world war ii and that japan should reflect 
on its role in that war 
the war issue has been sensitive here since japan drew a storm of 
criticism from its asian neighbors in the late 1970s when it revised 
school textbooks in what critics called an effort to gloss over its 
militaristic past 
in february unos predecessor noboru takeshita drew fire from 
china south korea and others by saying japans responsibility for 
the war will have to be decided by future historians 
uno speaking at a parliament session said friday in response to 
a question from a communist party lawmaker we must reflect on our 
past including the dark history involving korea and others 
we must reflect on the dark history of japans 36year 
colonial rule of korea we must reflect on the past war kyodo 
news service quoted uno as saying 
japan annexed korea and ruled the peninsula as a colony from 
191045 and invaded china and other asian countries before and 
during world war ii 
many asian critics complain that school textbooks here which 
must be approved by the government deliberately whitewash japans 
military role and responsibility in the war 
uno defended instructions issued in february by the education 
ministry that require schools to use the risingsun flag and 
play the semiofficial anthem kimigayo at school ceremonies 
neither has been legally adopted and both remain controversial 
because they were symbols of militarism 
uno said the flag and anthem have been accepted by the people as 
a result of long tradition and should be used in schools 
the japan teachers union denounced the ministry measure calling 
it a move aimed at reviving nationalism

the justice departments antitrust division 
recommended friday that attorney general dick thornburgh allow the 
two competing daily newspapers in york pa to form a joint 
operating agreement 
the antitrust division in the report to thornburgh said the 
york daily record qualified for an antitrust exemption under the 
newspaper preservation act because it showed no substantial 
prospect of reversing a decade of losses totaling 24 million 
michael boudin acting assistant attorney general for antitrust 
recommended that thornburgh allow the daily record to merge its 
commercial and production facilities with the evening york dispatch 
which was purchased last year by garden state newspapers inc 
boudins recommendations will be open for public comment for one 
month the attorney general would then decide whether to allow 
formation of a joint operating agreement 
the proposed joint operating agreement calls for the record to be 
published mornings from monday through saturday while the dispatch 
would publish evening editions during the week 
the records sunday edition would give way to the sunday news a 
paper recently started by the dispatch under the proposed 
arrangement the dispatch would discontinue its saturday evening 
edition 
boudin who recommended against holding a hearing noted in his 
report that the record has slowly boosted its circulation and 
advertising revenues over the past decade but these gains were 
against a passive dispatch 
since its purchase last year by garden state the dispatch has 
become an effective competitor he said the new owners started 
the sunday news and the dispatch now has a morning edition to 
compete directly with the record for street sales 
the applicants have met their burden of demonstrating that the 
records losses show no substantial prospect of being reversed and 
that the record is in probable danger of financial failure in the 
near immediate term boudin said 
the record whose majority owner is the carlsbad publishing co 
had an average daily circulation last year of 40164 according to 
boudins report the dispatchs circulation last year was 47549 
the record lost 171000 last year and 516000 in 1987 the 
report said 
the dispatch continues to dominate the york newspaper advertising 
market with about 108 million in ad revenues compared to 88 
million for the record

president augusto pinochet said friday his 
military regime may grant amnesty to human rights violators before 
handing power to an elected civilian government in march 
police said gunmen in a stolen car shot and killed roberto 
fuentes morrison a retired security agent accused of being among 
the most notorious violators 
this situation must be resolved now whatever the protests by 
some people pinochet said in iquique a port city 1150 miles 
north of santiago his comments were carried by local radio stations 
if we want to stop all this fighting if we want to prevent 
things from getting ugly again we have to put an end to all these 
things said the 73yearold president and army commander who 
seized power in a coup 16 years ago 
he said the matter must be settled before march 11 1990 when he 
steps down in favor of a civilian president to be elected in 
december 
pinochet said he was not worried about himself but i do worry 
about my people for me my people come first 
it was the second time this week the general showed concern about 
possible human rights trials under the next government last 
tuesday he said the military will not tolerate such trials by 
special courts or the legislature 
i can not accept that members of the services be taken as 
targets for revenge or that special courts be organized in 
congress he said 
speaking to reporters friday in iquique pinochet said a new 
amnesty law would cover everyone apparently meaning both human 
rights violators and terrorists there will be no blacks nor 
whites this is over he said 
a 1978 amnesty law covered all human rights violations and 
terrorist acts from 1973 to 1978 
that amnesty has been applied recently favoring among others

dissidents who disappeared after arrest 
the opposition widely expected to win the december election 
says it does not seek revenge but intends to find the truth 
about human rights abuses and bring those responsible to trial 
police sources said fuentes was hit by 13 bullets when four or 
five attackers who fired automatic weapons from the stolen car as he 
left his home the attackers fled 
fuentes in his mid50s was a leading member of the joint

a 78yearold fraternity house was bulldozed 
friday to make way for a student center at lafayette college hours 
before alumni and preservationists planned to ask a court to block 
the demolition 
the 630 am bulldozing came after groups had tried for months 
to convince the private liberal arts and engineering college that 
the threestory doublegable stone house had historical 
significance and should be saved 
its like taking a sledgehammer to an antique said antonia 
mitman founder of historical easton inc a preservation group 
it was an irreplaceable stone building 
bernard carman a college spokesman said the college announced 
plans to tear down the building last november the college got a 
permit earlier this week that allowed the demolition between june 8 
and 15 
obviously there is nostalgia but the building is simply 
inappropriate for the plans we had said charles hugle chairman 
of lafayettes board of trustees he promised the 16 million 
student center will be a beautiful building 
preservationists and fraternity alumni planned to seek a 
temporary restraining order in northhampton county court when it 
opened at 9 am friday mrs mitman said 
college officials had allowed them in thursday to photograph the 
house saying it would be demolished either friday or monday but 
mrs mitman said opponents had no warning the bulldozers would 
arrive at 630 am 
im not going to claim it was a building of national 
significance but thats not the issue said brent glass 
executive director of the pennsylvania historical and museum 
commission and a lafayette graduate the building is more of an 
example of a critical pressing issue because some of our best 
architecture happens to be located on college campuses 
the delta upsilon house stood on land the fraternity had leased 
on the quadrangle of the 2000student college the chapter 
disbanded in 1988 for at least four years acknowledging a pattern 
of inappropriate behavior said jeffrey p brown a member of the 
fraternity board

immediate comment 
negotiators said agreement was reached thursday after two days of 
talks in neighboring french guiana between delegations from the 
national assembly and the jungle commando the main rebel group 
they said among the conditions for a permanent trace are the 
abolishment of a state of emergency in effect since dec 1 1986 in 
eastern and southern suriname where the guerrilla war is 
concentrated and measures guaranteeing administrative 
representation to the regions bush negroes

paramaribo that during the talks brunswijk welcomed an amnesty 
granted to the rebels by the assembly a week ago

despite lastminute legal efforts 
by angry residents fuel started flowing again friday through a 
pipeline that blasted part of a neighborhood just 13 days after a 
runaway train disaster there 
operation of the pipeline resumed at 337 pm calnev pipe line 
co said the company earlier received authorization from the us 
department of transportations office of pipeline safety calnev 
spokesman scott heath said 
us district judge lawrence lydick in santa ana rejected a 
request by muscoy neighborhood residents who sought a temporary 
restraining order to prevent the pipeline from operating 
lydicks ruling said he lacked jurisdictional authority to halt 
the flow of fuel or grant the residents request that the pipeline 
be rerouted away from the neighborhood court clerk debbie beard 
said 
the request was filed by james h davis a lawyer representing 
residents of the devastated neighborhood the city of san bernardino 
had exhausted its legal efforts to stop the pipeline from being 
reactivated 
the pipeline which stretches 250 miles from colton calif into 
nevada carries gasoline jet and diesel fuel it supplies las vegas 
with 90 percent of its gasoline and provides fuel for barstow 
calif george and edwards air force bases in california and nellis 
air force base in nevada 
resumption of fuel pumping was bitterly opposed by residents of 
the neighborhood 60 miles east of los angeles many residents have 
refused to return home fearing another disaster despite assurances 
the area is safe 
on may 12 an overloaded runaway southern pacific freight train 
barreled down from cajon pass at 90 mph derailing on a sharp curve 
and flattening part of the neighborhood four people were killed 11 
were injured and at least seven homes were damaged or destroyed 
officials said the 14inchdiameter pipeline adjacent to the 
track was inspected and was safe but it ruptured may 25 engulfing 
more of the neighborhood in flames two people died 31 were 
injured 10 more homes were wrecked or damaged and up to 1000 
residents were evacuated to area motels 
calnev later replaced and tested a 600foot stretch of the 
pipeline in the devastated neighborhood 
in fridays court hearing the judge said the federal 
transportation secretary not the court had power to keep the 
pipeline shut down but he said he felt a great deal of sympathy 
and concern for the people that live in this area 
davis argued that the pipeline should be moved from its present 
location down an embankment from the tracks 
why leave a 14inch pipeline carrying jet fuel and gasoline 
in exactly the same place where the next derailing train will hit 
it the lawyer said 
anthony andrukaitis vice president of chicagobased gatx 
terminals corp calnevs parent company said the 600foot stretch 
of new pipeline was pressuretested wednesday and is safe 
its walls are a halfinch thick more than required it is buried 
deeper than the old section and it is wrapped in an anticorrosion 
material and covered with concrete slurry he said thursday 
calnev didnt want to reroute the line saying that would cause a 
six to eightweek interruption of service 
the national transportation safety board is investigating both 
the derailment helped cause the pipeline explosion but does not 
expect the results of its probe for two months 
southern pacific and calnev have agreed to buy 22 homes 
including those destroyed or damaged in addition to others deemed in 
an unsafe location most of the homes already have been razed 
the companies also have paid food and lodging for 800 to 1000 
evacuated residents and are offering 5000 to the head of each 
evacuated household to cover other incidental expenses

demonstrators of trespassing for blocking an abortion clinic in a 
case tried in a theater because no courtroom was large enough

the protesters face a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 
1000 fine when they return for sentencing before hillsborough 
county judge james arnold on june 16 
assistant hillsborough state attorney hank lavandera said the 
verdict shows that those who disregard the law to make a point do so 
at the risk of a penalty 
the defendants state of mind or motive for remaining on that 
property is not a defense to the crime of trespass thats the 
law prosecutor ron hanes told the sixperson jury in summation 
the defendants took part in a demonstration of 1200 people 
organized by operation rescue outside the womens health center on 
april 15 more than 180 abortion foes scaled a fence and blocked the

high explosives and automatic weapons intended for the assassination 
of the medellin drug cartels top trafficker federal officials said 
friday 
two men allegedly connected with the cali cartel a rival 
colombian cocainesmuggling operation were arrested in west palm 
beach on friday said patrick obrien agent in charge of the 
customs service in south florida 
the plot included the planned purchase of a small drone aircraft 
to be flown over medellin cartel leader pablo escobar gavirias 
hideout and exploded obrien said escobars medellin cartel is 
responsible for up to 80 percent of us cocaine imports drug 
agents say 
the weapons were being purchased by the cali cartel and shipped 
to colombia in what they considered a lastditch effort to 
assassinate pablo escobar obrien said they had shot down 
escobars helicopter and they had him cornered and they wanted to 
finish him off 
the weapons were intercepted on floridas turnpike as the two 
suspects were to pick them up from illegal arms dealers obrien 
said 
this was not a sting and we expect to charge the dealers as 
well he added 
customs and bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms agents 
confiscated five fully automatic m60 machine guns 100 pounds of 
c4 explosives 25 mac11 machine guns 20 ar15 assault rifles and 
104000 in cash along with a plane and a van 
the m60 machine guns were to be mounted on helicopters for an 
attack on escobars hideout customs officials said

candiotti 27 of miami beach and carlos enrique gil 25 of miami 
they told undercover agents their orders were coming from don 
pacho a leader of the cali cartel

of the cali cartel identified as luis santacruz echeverri and 
guillermo penagos according to the us attorneys office 
the medellin and cali cartels have worked together in the past on 
some drug shipments drug agents say obrien said he did not know 
why the cali smugglers had decided to kill escobar 
a sixmonth investigation which originated with an undercover 
penetration of a south american drug organization also uncovered 
previous shipments to colombia he said 
the five flights to a clandestine strip in cali carried automatic 
weapons plastic explosives silencers machine pistols 
nightvision equipment and sniper rifles obrien said 
the weapons were to be used by rival political factions in 
colombia for use in protection and political assassinations he 
said 
in addition the cali cartel had a shopping list that included 
grenade launchers and armorpenetrating weapons systems customs 
officials said 
drug agents seized 104000 the suspects had intended to use to 
buy some of the weapons the suspects also asked agents to launder 
10 million in drug profits at a later date 
but the weapons came first so we decided to move right away 
obrien said 
he said the investigation into the case was continuing 
although the agents were pleased with the bust there were some 
regrets miami customs spokesman michael sheehan said 
legally we were obligated to arrest the individuals and seize 
the weapons sheehan said but realistically many of us would 
have been happy to see them used against cartel leaders

the united states vetoed a security council 
resolution friday calling it unbalanced because it condemned 
israels crackdown in the occupied territories but did not address 
palestinian violence 
the vote was 141 with american allies britain france and canada 
supporting the resolution in weeks of negotiation and argument 
before the vote the united states sought first to block debate and 
then to obtain amendments 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said the resolution made 
sweeping condemnations of israels policies and practices without 
any reference to any of the serious acts of violence by the other 
side 
it does not condemn violence from all quarters or affirm that 
all parties have a responsibility to help reduce tensions he said 
arab league ambassador clovis maksoud called the veto a major 
disappointment it indicates how entrenched is the us bias in 
favor of israel and how cosmetic and supervicial can be us 
official proclamations of concern for palestinian suffering and 
rights 
he said the league had hoped the bush administration was moving 
toward a more evenhanded position in the arabisraeli conflict 
at least 513 palestinians have been killed during the 
18monthold rebellion in the west bank and gaza strip and 22 
israelis have been slain israel captured the territories from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
more than 50 speakers addressed the council in four days of 
debate most criticized israeli tactics which they said violated 
the rights of palestinians 
israel said the denunciations of the jewish state prove an 
international conference on the middle east would be accomplish 
nothing 
on thursday ambassador johanan bein presented a litany of 
palestinian terrorism and guerrilla actions against israel but did 
not address israels harsh tactics in the west bank and gaza 
the soviet union france and finland said friday an international 
conference should be held under un auspices as away to begin peace 
negotiations 
ambassador john birch of britain said israels practices in the 
territories ill become a state that was founded after so much 
suffering by its people on humane and democratic principles 
the united states and the four other permanent members the 
soviet union china britain and france can kill any security 
council resolution by voting against it washington routinely vetoes 
measures it considers to be onesided criticisms of israel 
pickering who previously served as ambassador to israel is 
chairman of the security council for june he said the united states 
wanted amendments to make the resolution more balanced but they 
were rejected by most members 
he said the united states deplored all violence in the occupied 
lands and supported some provisions of the resolution he said the 
united states agreed that israel should abide by the 1949 geneva 
convention on the treatement of civilians in occupied territories 
the united states is deeply disturbed by the continuing 
violence in the territories and we deplore bloodshed pickering 
said but the problem of the occupied territories can be resolved 
only through a negotiated settlement for a comprehensive peace 
based on previous un resolutions 
fridays resolution strongly deplores those policies and 
practices of israel the occupying power which violate the human 
rights of the palestinian people as well as vigilante attacks 
against palestinian towns and villages and desecration of the holy 
koran 
it demands that israel stop deporting palestinians and ensure the 
safe and immediate return of those who have been expelled

the first nicaraguan contra leader willing to return 
home to test the sandinistas commitment to democracy left exile 
here friday saying he hopes to help end the bloody fighting that 
has divided his country 
alfredo cesar the only one of seven contra directors to make the 
trip departed miami aboard an eastern airlines flight friday 
evening he planned to arrive in nicaragua on sunday morning 
cesar said he goes home wary of the sandinistas sincerity in 
conducting februarys scheduled presidential elections but willing 
to test his former enemy 
ive been in exile seven years and its pretty hard to assess 
the sandinistas intentions cesar told the associated press i 
do return with good will and i hope that this is going to be the 
final solution for the conflict in nicaragua 
the anticommunist rebels other six directors refused to bow to 
pressure from the bush administration and latin american leaders to 
return and earlier this week criticized cesar 
we think it divides the opposition aristides sanchez said 
cesar said the contra leadership must agree to disagree 
i told them that i respect their decision and that i hope they 
will respect my decision cesar said 
cesar said he and his family want to return to nicaragua because 
now it is the only place he can continue battling for freedom and 
democracy 
he and 15 other people most associated with nicaraguas social 
democratic party are meeting in guatemala city and will fly to 
managua on sunday aboard a plane provided by venezuelas president 
carlos andres perez 
what i plan to do is mobilize the people in nicaragua to put on 
pressure to make sure the elections are going to be fair he said 
he is not expecting a smooth political campaign 
thats inevitable were coming out of eight years of civil 
war you cant have it perfect cesar said 
the sandinistas have harassed opposition politicians by 
interfering with their communication and transportation and 
limiting their access to the media he said that alone will not 
cause him to give up however 
the key issue is that we cant have widespread fraud in 
februarys vote counting cesar said 
he said internal opposition groups will agree on a single 
candidate to run against the sandinistas but insists he will not be 
that person 
i will be devoting my time to grassroots politics organizing 
the party nationwide he said i dont have plans to run for 
office and i will support a single candidate from the opposition 
despite his willingness to jump into the political process he 
does not favor disbanding the thousands of ussupported contra 
troops in honduran camps just over the nicaraguan border 
he said the united states should continue providing nonlethal 
aid to the rebels although he opposes military aid at this time 
they should sit there and wait and observe whats going on in 
the process he said if the process is not fair and the 
nicaraguan people do not get the chance to express their will then 
the troops should decide what to do

a decorated vietnam war veteran from 
scotland who federal officials have been trying to deport for 11 
years can stay in the united states a federal immigration judge 
ruled friday 
its sort of like coming home said frederick s jackson 
wiping tears away from his eyes after judge billino w dambrosio 
handed down the ruling i feel a little better about myself 
the government began deportation proceedings against jackson in 
1978 citing his convictions on a string of burglary larceny and 
drug possession charges 
jackson 40 has been a resident alien in the united states for 
20 years he enlisted in the us army in 1967 at age 18 two years 
after his family emigrated to norwich an industrial city about 30 
miles southeast of hartford 
he went to vietnam in january 1968 as an infantryman with the 1st 
air cavalry division and was awarded two purple hearts and a bronze 
star 
dambrosio ruled that jacksons family ties his military service 
and efforts to rehabilitate himself outweigh his criminal record 
which includes 26 felony convictions since he left the army in 1970 
under federal immigration laws resident aliens who have been 
convicted of at least two crimes involving moral turpitude are 
subject to deportation 
jackson blames his crimes on posttraumatic stress disorder a 
psychological disorder found in some vietnam veterans and victims of 
violent crimes jackson has said flashbacks of terrifying ambushes 
and firefights led him to abuse drugs and alcohol 
fred was more of a victim than anything said robert money of 
the international institute jacksons legal representative during 
the hearings its been neglect on the part of the va nobody 
recognized the fact that he had ptsd until recently 
jackson sought treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder last 
summer at the veterans administration medical center in 
northhampton mass and said he has not used drugs or alcohol since 
he began the treatment program 
jacksons wife charlene said after the hearing that the changes 
in her husband since he began psychiatric treatment are dramatic 
the difference between three years ago and today is a 180degree 
turnaround she said 
in 1980 jackson was convicted on armed robbery charges in 
florida after he was released from prison in 1985 the government 
renewed its efforts to force jackson out of the country 
money said he has filed an application for jackson to become a 
naturalized citizen but he said the application was put on hold 
until the judge issued the deportation ruling 
jackson lives in public housing in norwich with his wife 
charlene her 6yearold son and their infant daughter the family 
lives on disability payments from the army and from social 
security which has declared him 100 percent disabled

three whites were sentenced friday to an 
effective 40 years in prison for helping south african commandos 
attack african national congress targets in zimbabwe 
high court judge ahmed ebrahim told zimbabwean nationals kevin 
woods 36 michael smith 35 and barry bawden 31 they were 
convicted of giving active and direct assistance to an unspecified 
number of south african raiders in may 1986 but he decided against 
sentencing them to death 
he sentenced each man to 70 years imprisonment with 30 years to 
run concurrently on charges under law and order regulations 
the anc is the main guerrilla organization fighting the 
whitedominated government in south africa 
the courts of this country are determined to play their part in 
taking terrorist attacks off the streets and keeping violence out of 
our society ebrahim said 
on may 19 1986 south african raiders bombed offices of the anc 
in downtown harare and raked with gunfire a suburban house used by 
anc officials before demolishing it with high explosives 
both buildings were empty and no one was injured in the attacks 
ebrahim said the three whites helped in the careful planning of 
the attacks and provided equipment and transport for the attacking 
force after the attacks the commandos were picked up by a south 
african military helicopter at a remote landing strip southwest of 
harare he said 
woods a former senior officer in the zimbabwe intellegence 
service and smith are already under sentence of death for 
involvement in a car bombing last year outside an anc house in the 
second biggest city of bulawayo 
a man hired to drive a boobytrapped car died in that blast 
ebrahim rejected a defense application to appeal against the jail 
terms described by advocate john sayce as manifestly excessive 
he said the whites were convicted on capital charges relating to 
national security and if anything we are erring on the side of 
leniency

occurred simultaneously at 930 pm thursday about 100 miles north 
of the capital 
early reports had mentioned only centroamerica as a target 
there were no deaths on either side col manuel salvatierra 
told the associated press on friday salvatierra is military chief 
of the 6th region which oversees jinotega and matagalpa provinces 
sources said the rebels known as the contras also blew up 
electrical poles along the road between jinotega and centroamerica 
the 50megawatt plant is a major component of the nations power 
grid 
the governments voice of nicaragua radio station said jinotega 
city the provincial capital and a large part of northern nicaragua 
were left without electricity all night power was restored in some 
areas early friday it said 
sandinsta soldier ladislao vargas among those trying to repel 
the rebel attack at the canal plant said one soldier was slightly 
injured 
they couldnt get us out of the ditch said vargas motioning 
to ditches surrounded by stones 
we communicated by radio but reinforcements arrived after the 
contras had begun retreating 
vargas said the fighting between about 25 rebels and six soldiers 
at the canal plant lasted about 30 minutes

institute emilio rapacciolli ordered plant operators to turn off 
turbines to minimize damage 
energy officials reported minor damage to the canal plant 
building but said the turbines were not affected

massive flooding in the neighboring cacio valley home to about 400 
people 
the plant controls all water flow into centroamericas turbines

came at two points and lasted up to 45 minutes

assassins firing submachine guns 
from a moving car killed the new governments most senior cabinet 
minister and two bodyguards on friday as they drove from the 
ministers home officials said 
the armed forces president alfredo cristiani and leaders of his 
governing rightwing republican nationalist alliance blamed leftist 
guerrillas who have pledged to make the country ungovernable rebels 
did not immediately claim responsibility 
jose antonio rodriguez porth 73 minister of the presidency and 
president alfredo cristianis closest adviser died shortly after 
arriving at zaldivar hospital a nurse said on condition of 
anonymity 
he was the first cabinet member killed in the nineyear guerrilla 
war police sources said the bodyguards one of whom was driving the 
bulletproof car died at the scene machinegun fire can penetrate 
socalled bulletproof cars 
cristiani told a news conference his government will not allow 
more provocations that push our country farther down into the 
whirlpool of violence he called rodriguez one of the most 
illustrious men of our country 
cristiani said his government is convinced leftist rebels are 
trying to provoke a reaction from us but we are not going to 
react outside of the law 
a white house statement issued in washington said president bush 
strongly condemns the vicious murder of rodriguez we hope the 
salvadoran police forces will find those responsible for this 
despicable act the president again calls on extremist groups to 
put an end to the violence in el salvador vice president dan 
quayle will deliver bushs condolences to the rodriguez family and 
to christiani while visiting central america next week it added 
party president armando calderon sol said the minister was 
ambushed just after leaving his home in a western neighborhood of 
san salvador 
witnesses however said four men in a red vehicle fired in front 
of rodriguez house before the car was started they said they heard 
five or six shots 
it was the first attack on an official of the party known as 
arena since cristiani took office june 1 and the fourth attack on 
party officials this year 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln last week offered to halt attacks if the new government 
eliminated death squads the government denies any involvement with 
death squads and spurned the proposal 
arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army maj roberto 
daubuisson an arena legislator who has been linked to the squads 
that killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s he 
denies the accusations 
col sigifrido ochoa another arena leader called for action 
we are confronting brazen terrorism commanders and 
communists he said we either let ourselves be killed like 
cowardly rats or we organize to defend the country 
calderon sol told reporters a man who defended law and justice 
has fallen 
gerardo le chevallier leader of the christian democratic party 
said the polarization that the party had expected when arena came to 
power had begun 
the transfer of power from christian democratic president jose 
napoleon duarte to cristiani was the first in salvadoran history by 
one democratically elected leader to another 
le chevallier said the attack was the result of the 
declarations of cristiani that if the fmln does not accept its peace 
proposal there could be a military response 
guillermo ungo a social democrat and political ally of the rebel 
front called it an assassination in cold blood that does not 
contribute in any way to peaceful coexistence and dialogue 
rodriguez a founding member of arena was a vice minister in the 
1940s a member of the civilianmilitary junta in 1961 and foreign 
minister in 1978 
his assassination came on the third day of a new guerrilla 
campaign 
on thursday rebels bombed a gasoline station in the capital and 
attacked troops in central and eastern el salvador 
the day before they attacked nine military posts and the army 
said 21 rebels and three soldiers died 
the intensified fighting follows the guerrillas rejection 
saturday of cristianis proposal for dialogue an estimated 70000 
people mostly civilians have been killed in the war

charges were dropped friday against a mother 
who was the first to be charged under a new state law that holds 
parents responsible for their childrens gang activity officials 
said 
gloria williams 37 a south central los angeles resident was 
charged may 1 with failure to exercise reasonable care supervision 
or protection of minor children 
her 14yearold son an alleged gang member is accused in the 
group rape of a 12yearold girl who was abducted from ms williams 
back yard 
further investigation showed that ms williams took skilled 
parenting classes at a nearby youth center and received a 
certificate after she completed 30 hours of course work 
while we will not hesitate to prosecute parents who demonstrate 
a lack of interest in correcting their childrens behavior this law 
was not designed to prosecute parents who are making an effort to 
control their children said city attorney james hahn 
the new evidence we discovered in this case indicates that ms 
williams was making that effort hahn said in a news release 
ms williams who works as an assembly line supervisor at an 
electronics plant told the los angeles times in a published 
interview how could the police know about all the things i have 
done to try to help my son 
she was arrested at home on april 29 after a search of her modest 
home showed snapshots of her son in gang regalia and one the homes 
bedroom walls filled with graffiti 
ms williams also the mother of a 20yearold daughter and an 
8yearold boy maintained that her teenage son is a good boy and 
we just want him home she refused to talk about the charges 
leveled against her son for fear of incriminating him 
we knew they didnt have a case ms williams attorney daye 
shinn said i think that they didnt do their investigation they 
just panicked and made a big story out of this 
the charges were under a provision of the 1988 street terrorism 
enforcement and prevention act passed by the legislature to combat 
gangrelated crimes if she was convicted she could have faced a 
year in jail and a fine of up to 2500

president bush is ready to propose legislation 
requiring a 10million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by 
the end of the century to combat acid rain sources say 
the proposal is expected to be part of a farreaching rewrite of 
the 1970 clean air act that bush will unveil monday he was spending 
the weekend at the presidential retreat in camp david md putting 
finishing touches on the package 
bushs expected proposal for cutting sulfur dioxide emitted 
mainly by coalfired power plants and identified as a main 
ingredient in forming acid rain is not quite as tough as the 
12million ton reduction advocated by environmentalists 
but it was far stronger than utilities and other coalburning 
industries have advocated and represents a dramatic turnabout from 
the reagan adminstrations resistence to any new standards for 
controlling acid rain 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush had made 
preliminary decisions on the cleanair package but would make 
up his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekend while at 
camp david 
he is taking with him decision memos and options on all the 
major questions that are still outstanding and we would expect 
decisions over the weekend fitzwater said 
among the decisions still to be resolved presumably are whether 
bushs package will set new standards for automobile tailpipe 
exhausts 
however administration officials perhaps signalling a decision 
against tighter tailpipe emission standards have stressed in recent 
days that the bush package would put heavy emphasis on alternative 
auto fuels like alcohol blends that contain fewer contaminants 
after unveiling the cleanair package on monday bush was to 
showcase it on a twoday trip west with cleanair speeches planned 
for wyoming and nebraska 
cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year 
2000 as bush was expected to recommend would reduce the 
contaminent to roughly half current levels 
acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
combine with water in the atmosphere to form acid which then returns 
to earth in the rainfall snow and dust 
midwestern utilties that burn highsulfur coal without 
technological controls are generally agreed to be the chief sources 
of much of the acid rain downwind of them damaging forests and 
lakes in canada and the northeast 
bushs acidrain reduction program is expected to be in two 
phases with half of the 10 millionton cut in sulfur dioxide 
emissions to be achieved by 1995 and the remainder by the year 2000 
according to sources 
it was unclear friday how the reduction requirements would be 
distributed among electric power plants nationwide 
according to sources the president was provided options that 
ranged from hitting the 20 dirtiest plants hardest during the first 
phase forcing them to come up with most of the early reductions to 
spreading the burden across 107 plants across the country nationwide 
with each plant requiring smaller cuts in emissions 
the president also is expected to include in his proposal a 
system by which a utility that exceeds the reduction requirements 
may sell credits to another utility that has not met the lower 
emissions levels to help bring that utility into compliance 
bush also is considering a reduction in nitrous oxide emissions 
another component of acid rain which primarily comes from electric 
utility plants and automobiles nitric acid is suspected of causing 
some kinds of forest damage 
options prepared for bush by the cabinetlevel domestic policy 
council suggest that nitrous oxides be cut by 2 million to 4 million 
tons the list of options was obtained by the associated press 
the utility industry has complained that if the 20 worst 
polluting plant are required to make drastic cuts it would mean 
sharply higher electric rates for the customers of those utilities 
an ohio utility company american electric power said friday if 
the 20plant option is adopted it would be forced to raise 
residential electric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent 
six of the 20 dirtiest power plants all of which burn high 
sulfur coal are in ohio 
the cost of such emission reductions will grind the economies 
of the midwestern states our heavy industries which rely upon low 
energy costs would be devastated said a joseph dowd senior 
vice president of american electric power

relations with china until the government there recognizes demands 
for democracy 
despite a military crackdown that killed hundreds if not 
thousands of people in beijing bush emphasized thursday night that 
he wants to preserve the relationship with china

some chinese army officers favor the goals of the 
democracy movement but the military as a whole is still largely 
sympathetic to hardliners who ordered the recent crackdown 
academic experts on china say 
any conflicts within the military over the handling of student 
unrest are unlikely to flare into major confrontations among army 
units they say 
the army has always opted for unity the instinct of most 
chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy instead of breaking 
up said harvey jencks a research associate at the university of 
california at berkeley and an expert on the chinese military 
economic reforms have increased inflation in china eroding the 
value of military wages and making the army sympathetic to hardline

people who enter the governments premier 
jobtraining program with marketable skills get more attention than 
unskilled people most in need of help the general accounting office 
said friday 
the agency the investigative arm of congress also said far too 
little attention is paid to remedial education needs of high school 
dropouts in the system set up under the job training partnership act

employment and training services the gao said in a report to

the philippines last 
environmental frontier is here in palawan province and 
conservationists are struggling to save it from people who sell 
its wildlife chop down its forests overfish its waters and swarm 
in from elsewhere to burn off its land for farming 
at puerto princesas bustling market whitebreasted sea eagles 
are sold for less than 100 and talking mynah birds for 30 
immigration from other islands which has grown by an average of 
5 percent since the start of the decade has reduced the percentage 
of palawans original settlers including at least seven native 
tribes to less than half of the population now estimated at 
500000 
the influx has created serious ecological problems among them 
the slashandburn farming methods of poor settlers and the vigorous 
collection of wildlife for sale wealthy logging concessionaires 
have been accused of plundering the provinces timber resources 
mountains run the length of the provinces main island on which 
are found 232 or onefifth of the countrys wildlife species 
environmentalists say many of the species are yet to be classified 
palawan the philippines largest province about 150 miles 
southwest of manila is also home to about 1500 species of plants 
whose medicinal and food properties have not been fully examined 
more than 1700 islands offer 2000 miles of coastline waters 
teem with fish the provincial environment office says nearly 50 
million metric tons of fish were caught in 1987 alone 
human fossils 22000 years old have been found in the provinces 
tabon cave 
the haribon foundation a conservationist group has gathered a 
million signatures since last year to pressure the government into 
declaring palawan a protected area 
in a recent letter to president corazon aquino haribons 
president maximo kalaw urged a ban on commercial logging and 
collection of wildlife in palawan haribon also urged the 
establishment of communal forest areas for island residents 
mrs aquino referred the petition to the department of 
environment and natural resources 
the issue in palawan is not only about conservation but about 
social equity and sustainable development for generations of 
filipinos to come kalaw said 
nearly 70 percent of palawans land area of 37 million acres is 
forested haribon blames loggers whose concessions cover onefifth 
of forest lands for denuding an estimated 46930 acres of forests 
yearly 
the destruction of natural forests has resulted in soil erosion 
siltation and flooding in the southern part of the province 
district foresters said 
officials say they lack resources to protect the forests mariano 
villanueva provincial environment and natural resources officer 
says he has only 179 guards each responsible for 9880 acres of 
forest 
the illegal use of cyanide and dynamite by fishermen threatens 
fish stocks and the coral offshore villanueva says his agents 
cannot arrest fishermen suspected of using cyanide because they have 
no equipment to detect the poison 
aside from cyanide and dynamite local fishermen use a technique 
called muroami fishing in which they drive poles into the 
coral to divert fish into their nets 
brig gen napoleon angeles the regional military commander has 
seized boats and other marine equipment to discourage illegal 
fishing 
but he opposes a logging ban for fear it would result in higher 
unemployment and possibly fuel the philippines yearslong communist 
insurgency which has just recently made its way to palawan 
i am for a sustainable use of natural resources so people may 
eke out some kind of livelihood program for themselves said 
angeles a member of the provincial development council 
a british consulting firm hunting technical services and local 
agencies have developed an environmental plan for the palawan 
integrated area development project 
the plan recommends a 20 percent reduction in the area authorized 
for logging each year to prolong the cutting cycle and protect 
against erosion 
currently timber companies may operate on about 12350 acres a 
year the plan calls for stricter monitoring of these companies 
officials have also stepped up the campaign against illegal 
logging 
although palawan was declared a game refuge and bird sanctuary in 
1967 trading of wildlife continues officials recently raided the 
public market and retrieved an eagle green parrots porcupines and 
mynah birds

despite early hopes the giant soviet oil 
skimmer vaidogubsky has been less than salvation in the messy war on 
this nations worst oil spill but the vessel wears its oil stains 
and smudges like badges of honor 
if we could have gotten here sooner sergey p rekin 
master of the 425foot ship said through an interpreter but 
under the circumstances we thought we accomplished more than 
expected 
had the 11400ton vessel arrived immediately after the march 24 
spill we could have picked up all of it said rekin who has 
been a sailor for 20 of his 38 years with good organization it 
would have been possible 
the ship arrived in seward 26 days after the spill 
one of alaskas top environmental officials said a ship with the 
vaidogubskys capabilities should be based in alaska 
were kidding ourselves after what weve seen in the last nine 
weeks if we think we dont need one said bill lamoreaux of the 
alaska department of environmental conservation that ship and 
other pieces of equipment in this particular case would have 
made a lot of difference 
lamoreaux said the state has not completed its contingency 
planning and could mandate that a large vessl be stationed in the 
sound to handle spills in rough seas 
its a combination of capacity and size lamoreaux said 
with the weather out there we cant have a bunch of tonka toys 
out there 
and he said the likelihood nowadays of the state making such a 
requirement stick are much better it would have been a political 
impossibility before the spill he said everybody realizes the 
real truth its going to take a new perspective 
the 987foot tanker exxon valdez rammed bligh reef early on good 
friday changing forever the way alaskans view the oil industrys 
ability to sop up a major spill 
the vessel spewed into the oncepristine sound about 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude oil it has washed up on beaches spread 
over 700 miles between prince william sound to the alaska peninsula 
the alyeska pipeline service co and exxon were chastised for 
their response immediately after the spill and their inability to 
control the oil 
the weather immediately after the accident was exceptional for 
the sound it was calm but as the seas picked up the few small 
skimmers deployed could not safely handle the spreading slick 
the 3yearold vaidogubsky owned by the soviet oil ministrys 
far east maritime marine oil and gas development co normally is 
based at the soviet unions sakhalin island where oil development 
is under way rekin said it was hired on april 11 
this is the first major spill the vessel has been called upon to 
clean up 
we spent 10 days on standby the reason was there was no 
central location no point to talk to he said to have a 
quicker response you have to have a center to mobilize from you 
have to be able to tell the condition and location of the oil we 
had to try trial and error 
the vaidogubsky the only vessel of its kind in the world 
reached seward from its home base on april 19 as oil menaced much of 
the states southcentral coastline 
plagued by poor weather rough seas and crude weathered to the 
consistency of taffy the 42 million skimmer and dredge ship has 
managed to work only 40 hours since its arrival siphoning up about 
82000 gallons of oil 
we had the weather against us said rekin he said the delay 
in summoning his vessel pared its effectiveness if we could have 
gotten here even a week earlier we could have done hundreds of 
percent more 
many of these ships should be placed around to the world to 
react quickly it would be cheaper than what they are spending now 
exxon spokesman karsten rodvik said his company has spent more 
than 200 million on the spill cleanup 
the vaidogubskys skimmers could not deal with the mousse so its 
crew working 12 to 16hour days managed to jury rig the vessels 
120ton dredge assemblies to slurp up oil when the weather allowed 
and the heavy crude could be located he said 
hired by veco an exxon contractor for a reported 15000 a day 
the large ship worked on the spill until about may 12 when it was 
made available to the alyeska pipeline service co for use as an 
emergency response vessel 
alyeska is moving to comply with a state emergency order that 
among other things mandates the company be able to recover 10000 
barrels or 420000 gallons of oil an hour if another accident 
happens the vaidogubsky can gulp 200000 gallons an hour under 
optimum conditions with a storage capacity of 2 million gallons 
the soviet skimmer docked in this prince william sound community 
last week hundreds of residents and tourists clambered aboard 
children handed seamen flowers and gifts 
absorbent pads and boom littered the deck the vessels heavy 
equipment manufactured in the united states finland norway 
showed use 
its crew members attended oil spill response training in valdez 
with alyeska workers they have their own way of operating they 
just need to know what to expect from us we need to know what to 
expect from them said tom brennan a spokesman for alyeska 
the skimmer left valdez on wednesday and headed for knowles 
head 110 miles to the southwest the area is shallow and a common 
anchorage for tankers waiting to pick up cargo at valdez brennan 
said 
its assignment is basically to sit on station out at knowles 
head just inside hinchinbrook entrance brennan said its a 
sort of second line of defense in the event of an oil spill 
he said tugs and work boats hauling containment booms and other 
gear accompany tankers out of valdez under the new regulations they 
would act as a first line of defense 
eventually perhaps by mid or late july the soviet vessel will 
be replaced by a tug boat and a specially equipped barge with a 
highcapacity skimmer brennan said 
we think this is a better way to go brennan said it has a 
smaller crew and a higher capacity he said he was unsure of the 
replacement skimmers capacity 
the equipment that well have will work more effectively than 
the vaidogubsky were trying to find the best equipment for the 
job

bill seidman may be riding into dangerous 
territory but you wouldnt know it to talk with him 
as chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp seidman has 
become the central figure in the governments effort to manage and 
resolve the savings and loan crisis 
thats a risky role beyond the problem of getting the rescue 
under way lies the likelihood that what is going on now may be a 
first installment a giant one with more costs to come and the 
man who rides to the rescue one year can wind up being blamed the 
next when the problem doesnt go away 
but seidman is in a role he clearly relishes he says most 
bureaucrats operate under a flag that reads not on my watch 
sidestepping problems until somebody else arrives to deal with them 
seidman wants the sampl crisis handled on his watch 
under a bailout bill that is inching through congress seidmans 
fdic the agency that keeps supervisory watch on commercial banks 
and insures their depositors will take control of the bankrupt 
insurance fund that does the same things in the savings and loan 
industry 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp insurer of savings 
and loan depositors needs more than 50 billion just to get even 
it will take at least three times that sum to salvage the industry 
closing or reorganizing insolvent sampls and paying off their 
depositors 
the administration estimates the cost at 157 billion over the 
next 10 years the general accounting office puts the price at 285 
billion over 30 years theres never been a bailout to match it 
nor as seidman has observed have the taxpayers ever had to spend 
that kind of money without getting anything in exchange 
he blames it on a failure of the system political and 
regulatory democratic and republican 
seidman l william is the name on the letterhead is 67 an 
accountant by trade a republican by politics hes managed 
campaigns served as an economic affairs aide in gerald r fords 
white house was dean of the business school at arizona state 
university and has been chairman of the fdic since 1985 
he said one of the lessons for voters is that they should demand 
campaign spending reform and congressional ethics legislation to 
control the influence of special interests the savings and loan 
lobby was a powerful one and still is even in crisis 
here they are lobbying to do the same thing that just cost the 
taxpayer 100 billion and theyre winning at least to some extent 
theyre winning he said in an interview 
the senate passed the sampl bill on april 19 four house committees 
then had a crack at it so did the savings and loan lobby that 
produced a crop of amendments some to ease the impact on the 
industry some written in terms tailored to individual institutions 
seidman knows something about lobbying too the senate version 
of the bill would strengthen his hand beyond the administrations 
original proposal hes at work on the house bill now 
seidmans term as chairman runs until the fall of 1991 under the 
senate bill hed stay the version awaiting house action would 
entitle president bush to appoint a new chairman no one knows how 
it comes out seidman said 
in reality the chances of a change are slim to none seidman has 
his detractors in congress especially among allies of the sampl 
establishment but there is far wider support and it is one of the 
reasons the legislation puts such broad power in the hands of his 
agency 
the sampl meter is running the treasury estimates that bailout 
costs go up 10 million every day until the bill is law the 
administration has threatened a veto if the bill comes back altered 
to put 50 billion in sampl costs into the budget and therefore onto 
the deficit even without that dispute the bill probably wont 
reach the president until late july seidman said the budget issue 
isnt nearly as important as getting a bill the president will sign 
this summer theres an urgent need for it he said 
at the same time he is fighting an industry effort to let sampls 
count something called supervisory good will in lieu of capital 
which means money it involves the difference between what 
purchasers paid to take over shaky sampls and their actual value 
which was substantially lower 
to an accountant seidman said thats the opposite of good will 
its air he said and in this case its bad air 
that and scores of other issues must be settled before the 
salvage operation can even begin every word in that bill costs 
somebody money or turf or something else seidman said 
then comes the hard part what he calls an unbelievably 
difficult job in taking over the supervisory and insurance 
operation while at the same time a new regulatory operation at the 
treasury liquidates insolvent sampls thats going to be very 
unpleasant he said 
whoever gets that task probably ought not to think about 
running for president or even for dog catcher seidman said 
im sure well have a role in it

in the years following the methodical 
murders of his wife mother and three children in new jersey john 
emil list painstakingly created a new identity for himself in the 
foothills of the rockies 
he dyed his hair and used a new name to acquire new credit cards 
and a phony social security number he took a new wife to whom he 
lied about his age and personal history 
but list was finally tripped up after two decades because his new 
persona was created in his own image that of a wimpy bespectacled 
accountant whose life centered on the lutheran church 
when fox broadcasting co aired his case last month on its most 
wanted television show more than 200 tipsters thought they 
recognized the former mamas boy from bay city mich 
authorities said two of the tips one from richmond va 
another from denver led them to a mildmannered accountant in 
midlothian va a devout lutheran layman whose fingerprints matched 
those of fugitive john e list 
the balding bookkeeper arrested by fbi agents june 1 says he is 
robert p clark a former resident of denver who moved to the 
richmond area 18 months ago 
the fbi says clark is merely the identity list developed after 
fleeing to colorado after the nov 9 1971 slayings in westfield 
nj an affluent bedroom community 15 miles west of new york city 
in denver clarks acquaintances say they find it hard to believe 
he is list they remember him as a quiet kind intensely private 
man who worked first as a cook later as a bookkeeper in a series 
of small obscure companies they say he spent much of his leisure 
time in churchrelated activities 
he was a man who would never ever stand out in a crowd said 
carole burton manager of the eastside denver apartment complex 
where clark lived from september 1978 to november 1985 
flipping through his tenant file she marveled ive never seen 
anything like this in all the years ive been here the man did 
absolutely nothing to call attention to himself there are no 
complaints in his file no notices no record of repairs no 
nothing 
denver fbi agents say they received no information about the 
fugitive living in their midst for 16 years after the grisly 
ballroom murders 
even now a chill runs through james moran westfields retired 
police chief when he recalls the scene at the sparsely furnished 
18room mansion that list bought in 1966 using his mothers 
inheritance to finance the 50000 purchase 
it was so methodical so coldblooded moran said we found 
his mother up in her thirdfloor apartment she and his wife were 
still in their bedclothes he even had turned the thermostat down to 
50 degrees to preserve the bodies 
moran said the first two killings occurred sometime in the 
morning 
then he apparently did some errands while waiting all day long 
for the children to come home and when they did he shot them one 
by one the bodies of the wife and children were laid out on 
sleeping bags in the ballroom off of the kitchen they had been 
laid out in a neat row head to toe moran said 
the victims lists mother alma 85 his wife helen 45 and 
their three children patricia 16 john jr 15 and frederick 13 
werent discovered until the evening of dec 7 1971 nearly a 
month after their deaths 
by that time john emil list was long gone 
an investigation showed that list at the time a 45yearold 
accountant with an annual salary of 12000 had two mortgages on 
his house totaling 40000 moran said list had told people his 
wife was an alcoholic spendthrift who nagged him constantly 
the investigation revealed that list had for years been siphoning 
money from his mothers 200000 savings account he took out the 
last 2000 on the day of the killings said moran who found the 
withdrawal slip while searching the house 
he also found and read a rambling fivepage confessional letter 
list had written to his pastor in westfield 
he wrote of being under a lot of pressure but i cant reveal 
anything else said moran the letter will be used as evidence 
if he goes to trial list is charged with five counts of 
firstdegree murder 
he had told school officials he was taking his children to visit 
relatives moran said lists car a green 1963 chevy impala was 
found at kennedy airport three days after the bodies were discovered 
i rode in that old car lots of times going to baseball 
practice with john jr recalls robert compton now a westfield 
police officer john and i were classmates and were on the same 
baseball team his dad used to go to the ball games when they 
found him john jr had been shot nine times 
authorities arent certain just when list arrived in the denver 
area and began building his new life however a denver man says he 
met robert p clark in golden in early 1973 slightly more than a 
year after the murders 
at the time said robert wetmore a 72yearold retired ranch 
hand clark was working at the holiday inn in this cowboy town just 
west of denver 
bob was in the kitchen working as a fry cook recalled 
wetmore he was working the night shift and i cleaned the kitchen 
we became friends you might say 
wetmore said clark then lived in a ramshackle trailer park on the 
outskirts of golden 
bob didnt have a car at the time so i helped him move out of 
the trailer park into an apartment a few blocks east of the motel 
he said he didnt have much stuff then but later when i helped 
him move again he had begun to acquire more possessions

clark held several cooking jobs in the early 70s and moved 
frequently wetmore said he usually chose large apartment complexes 
where he could easily remain anonymous 
bob didnt talk much about his past wetmore said once 
when i asked him he said he was from michigan 
that was not a lie john emil list was born 63 years ago in bay 
city mich the son of a wealthy german immigrant grocer who had 
married for the second time late in life 
laura werner who rented an apartment from the family remembers 
list as a sweet little mamas boy 
he and his mother were very close werner said she had 
married in her 30s and john was her only child he was the apple of 
her eye 
she said list who spoke fluent german attended a lutheran 
elementary school and later went to public high school he joined 
the army in world war ii and attended the university of michigan 
upon being discharged 
list worked in detroit and kalamazoo mich before rejoining the 
army in the korean war he was stationed at fort eustace va when 
he met his wife who had been previously married and had a daughter 
list later worked in rochester ny and jersey city nj 
before taking his family to westfield in 1955 
little of this past did list as clark ever reveal 
once when wetmore asked his friend if he had a family anywhere 
it touched a nerve he snapped at me no family wetmore 
recalled that was the only time i ever saw bob show any anger 
gary morrison a former chef at the motel remembered clark 
saying he had once been married but his wife had died of cancer 
in 1975 clark joined st pauls lutheran church in downtown 
denver 
the pastor rev bob west said clark became a pillar of the 
church during the 11 years he attended even serving on the board 
i once asked bob how he happened to choose us and he said it 
was because we were on the bus line recalled west 
at a church singles party in 1977 clark met delores miller a 
40yearold divorcee by then he owned a 1974 volkswagen and had 
gotten back into accounting working for a company that made 
cardboard boxes 
clark moved in with miller in november 1985 they were married a 
month later 
delores never told me about bob said wanda flanery millers 
neighbor in denver i didnt meet him until he moved in 
she said the newlyweds were a lot alike both being quiet 
reserved people who were devoted to their lutheran faith 
in april 1986 clark was laid off his wifes salary as a clerk 
at the fitzsimmons army medical center was not enough to support the 
newlyweds and they began to slip in their monthly payments 
for 18 months clark kept house and always had dinner waiting for 
his wife flanery recalled in late 1987 clark answered an ad from 
a virginia employment agency that set up interviews with a richmond 
accounting firm 
clark left denver in february 1988 to take the new job just as 
the company was getting busy with tax season four months later his 
wife joined him in midlothian a suburb southwest of richmond 
delores had mixed emotions about leaving recalled flanery 
who said they had been neighbors and friends for five years she 
said she really didnt want to leave denver but bob had been out of 
work since shortly after they were married and he had finally found 
this job in virginia 
flanery received two letters from delores clark after she moved 
away her friend referred to recurring financial problems and said 
she might have made a mistake leaving denver 
to make ends meet clark had begun moonlighting for hampr block 
and his wife started working one day a week in a hairdressing salon 
delores called me on this past mothers day flanery said 
that was the last i heard from her before bob was arrested 
clark was picked up 11 days after the most wanted broadcast 
dramatized the ballroom murders the program one that clark watched 
regularly and often recommended to neighbors featured a plaster 
bust portraying list as he might look now 
i said thats bob flanery recalled i told my 
soninlaw to call the fbi and give them bob and delores address in 
virginia 
after her husbands arrest delores clark told the fbi she 
couldnt believe he was a murderer at a news conference thursday 
she described clark as a good husband who had a deep and abiding 
faith in god 
clark had told her he had been married previously but that his 
wife had died of cancer prior to his coming to denver she said he 
told her he had no children 
wanda flanery says clarks arrest shouldnt come as a complete 
shock to her friend 
a couple of years ago i bought a supermarket tabloid that 
contained an article on the list murder case she said the 
article had a sketch of how list might look now and it was a 
deadringer for bob 
i took the paper next door and showed it to delores she turned 
pale and kept looking at it saying oh my oh my 
flanery recalls asking delores clark if she thought her husband 
actually was john list 
finally delores shook her head and said thats not my 
husband i then dared her to show it to bob and ask him but i 
dont think she ever did shes not a strong person and i dont 
think she felt she could have faced the truth so she just let it 
lie 
delores clark acknowledged at her news conference that she had 
dismissed the magazine article from her mind and had never shown it 
to her husband 
does flanery have any regrets about her role in clarks arrest 
i did what i thought was best she said for all i knew 
delores was in danger if he did it once he could have done it 
again especially since they were having financial problems

we will bury you nikita s khrushchev once 
told a group of western ambassadors in moscow in 1956 but today a 
generation later the communism the late soviet leader saw as 
triumphing is showing symptoms of critical illness in the halls of 
parliament in moscow the voting booths of poland and the blood of 
beijings tiananmen square 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the killings in beijings tiananmen square and the 
ballotbox rebuff of polands communist leaders have presented world 
communism with its most dramatic challenge since the 1950s 
coming on top of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms in the soviet 
union these events have turned a crisis into a cataclysm for 
communists everywhere raising immense hopes alongside despair 
in the communist world the divide between reformists and 
hardliners is sharpening for westerners the polish election a 
week ago is an ideological triumph the chinese army shooting and 
beating students in tiananmen square its bleak counterpoint 
communist ideology is at its end declares west germanys 
conservative chancellor helmut kohl 
says david selbourne a british political analyst just back from 
eastern europe we are living in a revolutionary age 
not since the 1950s when the soviet red army quelled the 
hungarian uprising and stalins mass murder began coming to light 
has the communist world undergone such a wrenching experience as 
watching a peoples liberation army kill its own people 
meanwhile events in poland raise the possibility hitherto 
undreamed of that the country may ultimately spurn communism 
altogether and become a westernstyle democracy 
the election says timothy garton ash a british author and 
journalist who travels extensively in eastern europe has been a 
milestone in the history of the communist world since 1917 
communisms crisis had been building for a long time before it 
turned to cataclysm during the first weekend in june 
the communist monolith born of the writings of the 19thcentury 
philosopher karl marx implanted in russia by the 1917 revolution 
and then exported all over the world was already splintering in 
eastern europe 
poland and hungary were embarked on bold experiments with 
democracy and capitalism and yugoslavia threatened to disintegrate 
under the weight of ethnic rivalries 
the soviet union itself had experimented with semifree 
elections resulting in humiliation for the old guard and a 
parliament where lively debate was being heard for the first time 
since the 1920s 
until now whatever changes were taking place were within the 
confines of communism moscow and warsaw might adopt some facets of 
capitalism but there was never any question of jettisoning 
communism as the state ideology 
but under president gorbachev the very meaning of the word 
communism had become blurred he has eschewed the brutal legacy 
of a centralized police state bequeathed by stalin and instead 
voiced allegiance to leninist principles a vast and often 
contradictory corpus of doctrine that gives him more room for 
maneuver 
the election in poland in which the solidarity trade union 
movement scored a landslide victory in the seats it was allowed to 
contest demonstrated a massive rejection of polish communist policy 
asked by the independent newspaper of london whether at the next 
election in 1993 the communists could be voted out altogether party 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski replied it is logical that if you 
talk about free elections any outcome is possible 
it represented a remarkable turnaround from eight years ago when 
jaruzelski imposed martial law to snuff out solidarity 
the effect of this great geopolitical shift from communism to 
democracy as the british political commentator ferdinand mount 
described it in the london daily telegraph is felt among western 
communists too 
their agony over tiananmen square was undisguised with the 
morning star british communisms daily newspaper drawing comfort 
only from the fact that the students confronting the chinese army 
were singing the internationale the anthem of communism 
in italy the communist party sees its support slipping and 
openly discusses dropping the word communist from its name in 
france veteran communist leader georges marchais worries aloud that 
events in china might hurt his partys election prospects 
gorbachevs policies of openness and perestroika or 
restructuring are highly popular with western public opinion and 
the western communist parties have wholeheartedly boarded the 
bandwagon 
gorbachev has meant a far more positive development in the 
soviet union than we thought possible just a few years ago says 
kenneth kvist secretary of the swedish communist party 
achille occhetto secretary of the italian communist party says 
in the countries of the east communism is a term that no longer 
has any relation with its own historic origins they are regimes 
that will lead to catastrophic ends if they dont move toward 
parliamentary and pluralistic democracy

communisms decline is accentuated when compared with the 
decadelong ascendancy of conservatism in the west led by ronald 
reagan in the united states and margaret thatcher in britain 
mrs thatcher has led nothing less than a conservative 
revolution in which her attack on longcherished institutions like 
free health care and trade union power have painted her as the 
reforming radical 
political analyst selbourne who recently visited poland and 
hungary says he was astonished to find leaders there who are 
honest enough to admit that their system isnt working economically 
and who are not embarrassed to admit their admiration for mrs 
thatcher 
says martin jacques editor of the british journal marxism today 
the systems produced after the second world war are up for grabs 
the conservative decade has coincided with the global explosion 
of high technology the field in which communism now lags most 
seriously in a world of instant communication and computerized 
knowledge regimes that jail people for unauthorized use of a 
photocopying machine cannot but fall behind 
even vietnam which spilled so much blood to give its people 
communism is trying to open its economy to the west and government 
economists there express open contempt for staterun enterprises 
not all however 
cuba east germany czechoslovakia and bulgaria rigidly resist 
change romanias policy of forced urbanization of the peasantry has 
provoked worldwide outcry albania continues to plow its lonely 
stalinist furrow spurning both the soviet union and china 
while the official media in poland hungary and yugoslavia were 
denouncing the killings and beatings in beijing cuba and east 
germany were cleaving to the official chinese line of blaming the 
violence on counterrevolutionaries who attacked the army 
some western rightwingers are inclined to gloat at communisms 
predicament 
cartoonist jacques faizant of the paris newspaper le figaro 
pictured a middleclass frenchman demanding an apology from the 
selfstyled maoists who broke his shop windows and burned his 
car during the paris student uprising of may 1968 
but the more prevalent sentiment is shock incredulity and a 
sense that historic events are unfolding one of the great 
punctuation marks of 20thcentury history as londons 
leftofcenter guardian newspaper put it 
how should the west react 
selbourne believes it is torn between jumping in to shore up the 
reformist regimes with aid and standing aside and waiting for 
communism to die 
garton ash writing in the independent suggests western europe 
should show the way by setting up a european development agency 
offering the poles advice and business loans 
but mount in the telegraph said the chinese bloodbath has 
vindicated the cautious approach led by mrs thatcher reagan and 
now president bush 
mrs thatchers admiration for mr gorbachev is 
undiminished her confidence that he will succeed is rather 
dimmer he wrote and tiananmen square makes it harder to 
believe in the inevitable peaceful transformation of communism

he promises to write thankyous to everybody 
when he gets home using the new fingers on his right hand 
but now its time to go for 10yearold karen kocharian who came 
here for four months of treatment after being badly hurt when an 
earthquake struck his native armenia last december 
he cries for his mother every night as his father sarkis 
spoke those words karen nodded and looked away 
when father and son leave tuesday on an aeroflot flight karen 
will leave behind the uncertainties he arrived with four months ago 
would surgeons be able to transfer two toes from his left foot to 
his fingerless right hand would the delicate joining of blood 
vessels and the connecting of nerves really work would he use the 
hand again 
dr lee osterman who conducted the transplant operation in march 
at childrens hospital of philadelphia said last week that karens 
hand is doing well progress is as expected slow but steady the 
fingers are encased in a ball of flesh and next year osterman will 
travel to armenia to cut the fingers apart 
but while hes been recovering and making friends at the 
hospital at home the boy has turned more quiet and withdrawn 
he misses his mother very much said alice ohanian whose 
family was host to the kocharians she said im happy for him 
because he will see her soon 
karen said he also wants to go home so his younger brother can 
play with all the presents he has received 
his father too is eager to get back now that karens treatment 
is finished the kocharians had been scheduled to return on june 30 
and were visiting washington dc with an armenianamerican group 
when the pressure on the 34yearold sarkis got to be too much 
they had visited some of the sights karen especially liked the 
paintings in the us capitol and were en route to arlington 
cemetery when sarkis could not go on he thought of the tens of 
thousands of armenians killed in the earthquake 
i feel guilty that we have not been able to go to the graves of 
my loved ones yet sarkis said 
he contacted the soviet embassy to see if their departure date 
could be moved up project hope which had brought karen and 36 
other children to america for treatment had said there were no 
available seats on aeroflot until june 30 the embassy arranged two 
seats for tuesdays flight 
i miss my family my wife my country said sarkis a stocky 
car mechanic with specks of gray in his hair 
people will doubt my wanting to go back but they should stay 
away from home for four months sarkis said adding especially 
in the way i left my family 
he said he is too focused on going home to think of what hell 
miss about america but he likes us cigarettes and has become 
accustomed to the great variety of items available in stores 
he likes the united states he said you can express 
yourself 
asked what he will miss karen doesnt hesitate cars 
american vehicles have fascinated him and hell return with a pile 
of photos of the ones he likes most 
people from across the country have sent karen all types of toy 
cars along with other toys and clothing 
originally there was a question of whether the kocharians would 
be allowed to take home all the presents they were given but soviet 
officials later said they could bring about 145 pounds each when 
they board the plane 
of all the presents karens prize possession is a 10speed 
bicycle from the ohanian family 
he had never been on a bike when it was presented as a birthday 
gift in april at the party he bravely jumped on using his 
bandaged hand for balancing 
a family friend ran alongside for a short while then let karen 
go alone he rode straight but landed in the ditch when he 
attempted to turn around 
laughing he jumped right back on the bike and by the end of the 
day had conquered it 
hes a fast learner said dore diberardino his occupational 
therapist and ambitious he wants to try everything 
naturally righthanded he is making progress toward becoming 
leftdominant she said 
karen now wearing untied sneakers and longer hair like american 
kids no longer hides his scarred hand 
when he walked down the hall youd see him pull his shirt 
sleeve over his hand said ms diberardino 
george ohanian alices husband encouraged him to uncover the 
hand which now looks like a thumb and a large ball of flesh hes 
got to get used to people looking at it so when he gets home hell 
be used to the kids teasing him ohanian said 
the ohanians meanwhile plan to visit the kocharians this fall 
sarkis insisted my family wants to show them the same hospitality 
they have shown us 
and karen would like to visit america again maybe next year 
he said 
at their last meeting dr osterman wanted to check karens hand 
movement so he asked the boy to write on a pad 
in clear letters in armenian karen wrote goodbye america

one of the more memorable remarks about communism vs capitalism 
was that of nikita s khrushchev we will bury you 
it was made at a reception for polands wladyslaw gomulka in the 
polish embassy in moscow on nov 18 1956 and was directed at 
western ambassadors present 
as reported at the time the soviet leader said 
about the capitalist states it doesnt depend on you whether 
or not we exist if you dont like us dont accept our invitations 
and dont invite us to come and see you whether you like it or not 
history is on our side we will bury you 
on sept 16 1959 during his visit to the united states he was 
asked at the national press club in washington to explain what he 
meant by his remark he replied 
the expression i used was distorted and on purpose because 
what was meant was not the physical burial of any people but the 
question of the historical force of development it is well known 
that at the present time no one social or economic system is 
dominant throughout the world but that there are different systems 
social systems in different countries and those systems change at 
one time the most widespread system of society in the world was 
feudalism then capitalism took its place we believe that karl 
marx engels and lenin gave scientific proof of the fact that the 
system the social system of socialism would take the place of 
capitalism that is why i said that looking at the matter from 
the historical point of view socialism communism would take the 
place of capitalism and capitalism thereby would be so to speak 
buried 
on aug 24 1963 khrushchev told westerners in an address at 
split yugoslavia 
i once said we will bury you and i got into trouble with 
it of course we will not bury you with a shovel your own working 
class will bury you

while takeovers and falling interest rates have 
been getting most of the credit many analysts say the stock 
markets buoyant showing in recent weeks owes a lot to the strength 
of the dollar in foreign exchange 
the dollars rise against such other key currencies as the 
japanese yen and the west german mark has helped attract 
international investors into us investments 
beyond that it has been widely welcomed as a sign of increasing 
optimism about the overall outlook for the american economy 
the big story of 1989 is certainly the almighty dollar and its 
miraculous effect on financial markets inflation expectations and 
euphoric confidence around the world said rao chalasani an 
analyst at prescott ball amp turben inc 
the dollar has become the strong commodity in short supply 
whereas real and precious commodities are heading south 
at the beginning of 1989 notes economist maury harris at 
painewebber inc the consensus of 38 forecasters polled by the wall 
street journal called for a dollar exchange rate of 121 yen by 
midyear as of late last week the dollar was worth just under 145 
yen 
one widely accepted explanation for this unexpected turn of 
events has been the perception that inflation while it is picking 
up in many other countries is starting to slow in the united states 
along with the pace of business activity 
what has surprised many observers has been the dollars continued 
advance as interest rates have dropped lately in this country while 
they have moved up in many places overseas 
money tends it is presumed to flow to wherever interest rates 
provide the most generous yields 
harris however says that misses a key point dollar investments 
have remained attractive to foreign investors he argues because 
investors were focusing on prospective capital gains in stocks and 
bonds if interest rates continue falling 
james grant editor of the newsletter grants interest rate 
observer says politics also have played an important part noting 
that the dollar and the swiss franc have been the strongest 
currencies of late 
what the world used to want was yield grant observes the 
financial significance of the chinese revolution is that the world 
at least temporarily seems to want safety 
what the united states and switzerland have in common is that 
each is hard to invade and each is creating fewer dollars and 
francs respectively than it used to 
in the past week stocks suffered an early setback but recovered 
most of their losses the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed 
friday at 251342 down 441 from the previous weeks postcrash 
high 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 088 to 18237 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
202 to 45365 and the american stock exchange market value index 
climbed 569 to 36616 reaching a record high 
volume on the big board averaged 19005 million shares a day 
against 19415 million the week before 
as big a plus as it may be analysts point out an extended rally 
in the dollar could well have some negative implications sooner or 
later for stocks 
industries with large foreign operations face the prospect of 
having their foreigndenominated earnings translate into fewer 
dollars says jack lavery research director at merrill lynch 
exportbased industries may find themselves in a less favorable 
competitive position because of a stronger dollar 
but for the moment at least the dollars gains have been in 
harriss words a bullish surprise for the us financial 
markets

chinas bloody political contortions have 
troubled millions of americans transfixed by horrific scenes on 
television but a broad economic impact also looms for the chinese 
and threatens us business relationships that have taken nearly two 
decades to cultivate 
the sudden panicky mass exodus of foreigners this past week from 
the peoples republic because of the violent crackdown on a growing 
prodemocracy movement portends a dark and chilly era for foreign 
investment and trade few are expected to quickly return even if 
things quiet down for awhile 
although the biggest us multinationals with offices in china 
arent likely to disengage themselves many smaller companies say 
they cant easily afford to risk their money in a country where 
political stability is now so uncertain 
the commercial and economic relations between the united states 
and china so carefully nurtured and developed through the efforts 
of people on both sides over the past 18 years and so clearly in the 
overall strategic interest of both our two countries have been 
disrupted and could suffer longterm damage the us china 
business council declared 
hundreds of joint ventures worth billions of dollars have 
suddenly been put on hold or severely curtailed affecting factory 
construction and exports ranging from crude oil to luggage to 
handheld hairdryers 
chinas lucrative tourist trade which earned more than 2 
billion in foreign currency annually for the chinese has collapsed 
at the busiest time of year the outlook is uncertain 
even foreignfinanced projects hundreds of miles from beijing 
have been disrupted partly because of a state department warning 
that americans should leave the country due to the threat of 
widespread unrest 
in shanghai douglas aircraft expatriates vacated a jointventure 
assembly plant and said upon arriving in hong kong they had no idea 
there was such turmoil in the chinese capital in a remote coalfield 
southwest of beijing occidental petroleum temporarily yanked its 
staff from an openpit mine although work had been proceeding 
normally 
in the south where the bulk of foreignchinese joint ventures 
have been established many us businesses reportedly started 
making contingency plans to shift production to other cheaplabor 
countries such as mexico thailand and the philippines fearing 
disruption of exports from china 
on a broader scale the chaos in china severely jolted the 
stability of britishruled hong kong the financial powerhouse 
scheduled to be surrendered to the chinese in 1997 
it sent investors fleeing for dollardenominated investments 
roiling other financial markets it forced banks to reevaluate their 
exposure to debt owed not only by the chinese but by foreign 
companies that rely on chinese trade 
millions of dollars in chineseissued bonds sold abroad to raise 
money for economic development are suddenly worth less and will 
aggravate the countrys recent efforts to raise money in world 
credit markets 
economically there is nothing about the crackdown that bodes 
well for china or companies that have banked their future on a 
market of 11 billion people with rising expectations china experts 
say 
but some argue that in the long run the consequences could prove 
beneficial by forcing the beijing government to moderate its 
hardline position in order to lure foreigners and their money back 
in other business and economic news this past week 
a battle flared for time inc threatening to derail the media 
giants merger with warner communications inc a 107 billion offer 
for time by paramount communications inc sent times stock soaring 
and resurrected a theory on wall street that no company is immune to 
a takeover 
a federal jury convicted speculator paul a bilzerian of 
securities fraud and tax violations making him the first takeover 
strategist to be prosecuted and convicted using information derived 
from the ivan boesky insider trading scandal bilzerian planned to 
appeal 
banks cut their prime lending rate to 11 percent from 115 
percent reflecting a trend toward lower borrowing costs but it was 
uncertain how long the decline would last because the government 
reported a surge in may inflation that could make the federal 
reserve tighten credit again sending rates higher

american european and japanese business 
executives believe japan will be the economic power hurt most by the 
post1992 united european market according to a survey 
the study released thursday also found that less than a quarter 
of us industrial firms have developed a strategic plan to deal 
with the coming changes in the european economic community 
more than half of the us executives and nearly twothirds of 
the japanese surveyed saw japan as most likely to be affected by 
potential protectionism in the eec which will establish free 
movement of goods services capital and labor among its 12 member 
states after 1992 
japanese business executives in particular believe their products 
will be denied entrance into the eec according to the study by 
fortune magazine and ernst amp whinney an accounting firm that 
conducts market research 
the survey was released at a twoday meeting about the 1992 
european initiative that opened thursday 
the fear of protectionism has prompted japanese companies to 
develop special european strategies including building or acquiring 
new european manufacturing facilities the survey reported 
the survey was based on 1000 responses to 1359 questionnaires 
sent to the largest japanese us and western european industrial 
firms 
merle sprinzen director of market research for fortune told the 
meeting at the cini foundation that business leaders tend to agree 
that japanese business would be most hurt far fewer believe that 
american or european business would suffer 
a majority of those interviewed in the survey said europe also 
will enact strong antidumping measures he said 
japanese executives are more convinced than their american and 
ec colleagues that import quotas will also be estabilished 
sprinzen said

despite the controversy it stirred up whittle 
communications is going ahead with plans to sign up schools for its 
advertisersupported channel one news service for teens and is 
including two new educational networks in the package 
the service which will debut in march 1990 contains some 
modifications of the channel one program whittle tested in six 
schools earlier this year whittle chairman christopher whittle said 
thursday 
but some critics were not swayed by the modifications the 
inclusion of additional noncommercial programming in the package 
and survey results that indicated students learned more about 
current events with channel one 
they sweetened the pot a little bit but they didnt change the 
essential nature of the transaction said bill honig the state 
schools superintendent in california he said whittle is still 
selling access to your kids by letting companies pay to 
advertise on a program to be shown during class hours 
honig has threatened to withhold a portion of state aid to 
schools that air the program to reflect the time channel one devotes 
to pitching products 
peggy charren who heads a national childrens advocacy group 
was also unswayed its the same deal with better packaging she 
said 
whittle said his company based in knoxville tenn expects to 
spend 200 million on startup costs involved in giving 8000 or more 
schools the video equipment needed to receive the channel one 
programming via satellite 
he intends to pay for it with the 85 million to 100 million 
hell get each year from advertisers to pitch products on channel 
ones daily news show 
we have listened to our critics whittle told a news 
conference but he said their main complaint about advertising was 
unaddressable 
he said that if schools are going to get both a daily news show 
and the equipment to show it you have to pay for it and added 
that the federal government and corporate philanthropists have 
failed to do so 
nonetheless whittle said he has modified the channel one 
service that was tested for five weeks this past spring and featured 
ads for jeans shampoo chewing gum candy bars and acne medication 
the original channel one plan required participating schools to 
show the daily program to the entire student body every school day 
but whittle said schools signing up for channel one in the future 
need not have all of their classrooms wired to receive the program 
and need not show it to the whole school 
however he said schools that participate still will be obliged 
to show the program every day in those classrooms that have the 
equipment 
he said he hopes to have schools sign up for three to five years 
and has not decided what will be done if schools want out of that 
contract 
the schools will receive television sets video cassette 
recorders satellite dishes and wiring that whittle said would cost 
40000 to 50000 each on average if they were to buy it 
themselves whittle also will maintain the equipment 
three companies are in the running for the hardware contract 
whittle said the videostar unit of electronic data systems corp 
sony corp and north american philips corp 
in addition to channel one whittle plans to offer a new service 
the classroom channel that would offer noncommercial educational 
programming such as public broadcasting documentaries and 
instructional shows 
the classroom channel would be run by a board independent of 
whittle communications but whittle would contribute 500000 a year 
for program rights schools could use material on the channel as 
they wish 
whittle said he also was developing the educators channel to 
carry programming for teachers such as briefings by national 
education groups 
no decision has been made on whether the two educational channels 
will include advertising schools could not receive them however 
without also signing up for channel one 
whittle plans to make all three networks available in 1000 
middle and high schools in march 1990 and add schools at a rate of 
500 or more a month 
channel one is not without competition and all of it is adfree 
turner broadcasting systems cable news network plans to begin a 
daily adfree news program for schools starting in august while the 
discovery channel cable network says it intends to make 
commercialfree documentary programming 
cspan the cablesatellite public affairs network that provides 
coverage of congressional proceedings to cable tv systems has been 
providing programming for use in the classroom since 1986 and said 
3400 teachers already use it cspan is expanding that service 
starting in late august 
but those networks are not donating equipment to the schools on 
the scale whittle envisions

the treasury department said a bill by rep dan 
rostenkowski dill to simplify the corporate minimum tax would 
reduce revenue collections by 28 billion over the next four years 
john g wilkins acting assistant secretary for tax policy 
endorsed the bills goal of removing some complexity from the levy 
but he told a hearing thursday before the house ways and means 
revenue subcommittee the measure may need modification because of 
budgetary restraints 
the revenue loss would come from depreciation provisions as the 
new version of a minimum tax is phased in wilkins said 
representatives of several business groups including the chamber 
of commerce the american petroleum institute and the national 
association of manufacturers praised the effort but urged additional 
changes to accommodate one industry or another 
some of the strongest criticism of the bill centered on a 
provision that would eliminate the exclusion of half of interest 
earned on taxexempt publicpurpose bonds 
wiping out that exclusion said marjorie o olaughlin indiana 
state treasurer would have the regrettable effect of 
substantially increasing the cost of state and local government 
borrowing while simultaneously destabilizing the market for such 
bonds by driving away corporate investors 
the corporate minimum tax which is designed to ensure that all 
profitable companies pay some tax regardless of deductions has 
undergone several changes since it was enacted in 1969 
rostenkowskis bill would rewrite some provisions that were enacted 
as part of the 1986 tax overhaul 
through 1989 the minimum tax is based on the concept of book 
income which is substantially the earnings that a company reports 
to stockholders but not to the internal revenue service starting in 
1990 the law drops the bookincome concept and substitutes a 
companys adjusted current earnings 
under the bill proposed by rostenkowski who chairs the ways and 
means committee adjusted current earnings would be eliminated as a 
separate item subject to the tax this would allow companies to make 
only one set of calculations in computing their minimum tax

striking pilots at eastern airlines dismissed a new 
contract proposal from the company as a public relations hoax 
saying the carrier wanted to annul the unions contract rather than 
settle the walkout 
eastern is seeking temporary pay and vacation cuts similar to 
those it imposed on nonunion workers last week the airline needs 
the concessions to emerge from bankruptcy the company said at a 
news conference thursday 
but the union complained angrily that eastern announced the 
proposal at the news conference before presenting it to union 
negotiators the parties met at their second negotiating session 
since the strike began march 4 
obviously the cameras are more important than the contract 
said ron cole spokesman for the air line pilots association its 
nothing more than a public relations hoax presented to establish a 
paper trail to the doors of the bankruptcy court where we expect 
eastern will file for abrogation of our contract 
eastern spokesman robin matell said canceling the pilots 
contract is simply an option one that we would not even address 
at this time our primary thrust is to successfully negotiate a 
pilots contract thats our focus 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy five days after it was 
crippled by the strike by machinists pilots and flight attendants 
unions have alleged that easterns parent texas air corp plans 
to use the bankruptcy proceedings to abrogate its union contracts 
continental airlines which also is owned by texas air rebuilt as a 
nonunion carrier after filing for bankruptcy in 1983 and canceling 
its labor contracts 
congress tightened bankruptcy laws after the continental episode 
to make it more difficult for companies to abrogate contracts now 
a company must show it is negotiating in good faith 
the pilots contract expired in july 1988 
even if the pilots accepted the new proposal eastern is offering 
to take back only 950 union pilots the airline had 3500 pilots 
before the strike began and will need only 1700 under its plan to 
rebuild to about 65 percent of its prestrike size 
so far 760 of spots have been filled tom matthews easterns 
senior vice president for human resources said 260 pilots have 
crossed picket lines and 500 new pilots are being trained eastern 
said it is hiring 50 to 60 new pilots a week 
the union contends that eastern cant rebuild without its veteran 
union pilots 
eastern officials said its offer includes a request that pilots 
take a 10 percent pay cut for six months and a 5 percent cut during 
the second six months after one year pay would be fully restored 
eastern also proposed canceling vacations for the rest of this 
year and suspending contributions to a pension fund through 1990 
the concessions would save the company 20 million over 18 months 
eastern said 
the airline last week cut pay for senior management and increased 
work hours at the same pay for nonunion employees vacations for 
those workers have been canceled for the rest of the year 
nonunion workers angry over the austerity measures have signed 
protest letters to us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland and 
courtappointed examiner david i shapiro 
the letters complain about a statement last week by eastern 
attorney harvey miller that most nonunion workers support 
managements plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier 
gate agent janet burgess said 170 employees in atlanta have 
signed the letters and vivian warren a reservation agent in tampa 
fla said more than 700 workers there have signed

airport screening is catching a record 93 
percent of mock weapons concealed by agents in tests of the system 
according to federal authorities but airlines still are being fined 
for letting some slip through 
the federal aviation administration announced 125 million in 
fines thursday against 28 us airlines bringing total fines for 
security lapses over the past year and a half to 52 million 
a single undetected weapon can cost an airline up to 10000 
the most lapses in the latest round of fines were cited against 
united airlines which would have to pay 167000 for 23 security 
falldowns the faa said 
continental delta northwest and trans world airlines would each 
have to pay in excess of 100000 for 16 or more failures to detect 
mock weapons or explosives the faa said fines against others 
ranged down to 1000 for single violations 
the fines which are either 1000 or 10000 per violation 
depending on the airport checkpoints overall record were proposed 
in letters sent to the airlines which can appeal the assessments 
fines at airports where detection is less than 95 percent are at the 
higher rate 
the faa does not disclose which airports it checks or where the 
security lapses occur 
in all the airlines xrays metal detectors or hand searches of 
passengers and luggage allegedly failed 179 times in tests since 
late last year 
the faa said detection has improved steadily under a program of 
steppedup enforcement begun in october 1987 the rate of detection 
then was 789 percent it increased to 856 percent during the first 
six months of 1988 to 889 percent in the julyseptember period 
and to 93 percent in tests conducted up to march 1989 the faa said 
airlines are responsible for screening all passengers and their 
carryon items and are fined for violations even though screening is 
sometimes performed by another airline or by a contracted security 
agency each airline using a screening station when a lapse occurs 
is fined 
the faa said it ran more than 6800 checks at us airports last 
year the agency does not conduct testing at foreign airports where 
screening is often performed with the direct participation of 
governments 
in addition to united five airlines were cited for a dozen or 
more lapses delta 19 violations for 136000 continental 19 for

democrats on the house ways and means committee 
say they see little movement toward cutting capitalgains taxes 
despite chairman dan rostenkowskis newfound willingness to deal on 
the issue with president bush 
what you are seeing is that rostenkowski as chairman has to get 
a bill to raise revenues and he has to find a compromise 
somehow said rep donald pease dohio a member of the 
taxwriting panel the rest of us dont have that primary 
responsibility and we can stick by what we think is good tax law 
although the committee has a solid base of support for a 
capitalgains break rep byron dorgan dnd said thursday i 
dont think the committee is anywhere near making the decision to 
cut the capitalgains tax 
the new round of talk about a lower tax on capital gains which 
are profits from the sale of stock and other investments was 
prompted by rostenkowskis statement in newspaper interviews that he 
would consider a cut if bush accepted some democratic proposals for 
raising taxes 
bush was elected president on an oftrepeated pledge not to raise 
taxes and to cut capitalgains taxes rostenkowski an illinois 
democrat has been just as adamantly opposed to a capitalgains cut 
calling it a giveaway to the rich 
according to a rostenkowski aide the chairman realizes that 
something has to give if his taxwriting committee is to find a 
mandated 53 billion in new revenues to reduce the deficit in the 
budget year that begins oct 1 
he doesnt like a lower tax rate for capital gains added the 
aide who spoke only on condition he not be identified by name 
but could it ever be acceptable the answer is yes if the 
president offered in return something so attractive to democrats 
that they couldnt turn it down 
bush insists that cutting capitalgains taxes would raise 
government revenues over the long run by boosting investment and job 
creation congressional democrats view the idea as a longterm loser 
but bushs economists and those who advise congress agree that a 
capitalgains rate cut would raise money during the first year by 
encouraging investors to sell some longheld assets 
so a popular idea being advanced by lobbyists and discussed by 
lawmakers would cut the top capitalgains rate now 33 percent to 
20 percent for only one year or maybe two the higher rate would 
return but capital gains would be indexed so that an investor 
would not be taxed on profits that were caused solely by inflation 
in return for those concessions the theory goes bush would go 
along with some kind of deficitreduction revenue boost that the 
public would not view as a general tax increase 
some democrats are cool to any capitalgains cut because 80 
percent of the benefit would go to those with incomes over 100000 
a year 
for that reason some liberal democrats on ways and means prefer 
cutting the deficit by requiring more upperincome people to pay the 
top income tax rate of 33 percent some urban members of the panel 
favor a higher gasoline tax some want to boost taxes on alcohol and 
cigarettes 
rep robert matsui dcalif citing repeal of the capitalgains 
tax break and the tax shelters it fostered as a major benefit of the 
1986 tax overhaul said he is not sure he is interested in 
restoration of the provision even to cut the deficit 
the proposed tradeoff would mortgage the nations future he 
said a multiyear capitalgains reduction would mean we would be 
sacrificing future years revenues for one year of deficit 
reduction

the future is now for the american population 
most of the people who will greet the next century already here 
pursuing educations and careers 
the americans watching the 20th century grind toward a halt are 
far different than their ancestors who greeted the arrival of the 
1900s an era that has seen the population move south and west and 
make major shifts in family life womens status and technology 
over 80 percent of the people who will make up the population 
of the united states in the year 2000 are now alive reports a new 
study by the private population reference bureau 
the next centurys first high school graduating class as well 
as its dropouts are already in grade school and the elderly of 
the 21st century are already well down paths that will determine 
their financial and healthcare needs for old age the independent 
bureau observed in a study released thursday america in the 21st 
century a demographic overview 
at the same time the census bureau issued its population 
profile of the united states 1989 looking at the current 
population status of the country 
the aging of america is likely the most discussed and documented 
trend with 298 million elderly in the country as of 1987 122 
percent of the population and twothirds of the group being women 
the census bureau reported 
the agency says the number of elderly will continue growing into 
the next century jumping to one american in five when the massive 
postworld war ii baby boom generation hits senior citizen status by 
about the year 2030 
that will critically affect health care and retirement income 
programs observes the population reference bureau study 
there will be a relative scarcity of young people to take entry 
level jobs school enrollment could shrink and employers will face a 
different mix of potential workers 
retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity 
says the private group and there may become a need to ease 
immigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from other 
countries 
the traditional family makeup of a working husband with a 
wife who stays home with the children has longsince changed in 
1987 fewer than half of all families included children in the 
majority of those that did mothers held jobs outside the home 
at the same time population reference bureau noted the 
growing incidence of divorce and outofwedlock births has fueled an 
enormous increase in singleparent families 
currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent 
compared to one in 10 in 1960 the population group said 
the growing concern over child care elder care and parental 
leave will continue well into next century it concluded 
rapidly growing black and hispanic populations have also 
attracted attention in recent years with the census bureau 
reporting that blacks now constitute 122 percent of americans while 
hispanics make up 8 percent meaning that although there is some 
overlap these two groups now include nearly one in five americans 
by 2000 nearly onethird of all schoolage children will be 
from minority populations a situation that presents a major 
challenge to our school systems the population reference bureau 
reported

the farmers home administration says it wont 
make public the names of 31 borrowers who have had milliondollar 
debts wiped off the books under new federal credit procedures 
one reason given by fmha officials is that the agencys 
headquarters in the agriculture department did not ask field offices 
for the identities of the big borrowers when debt restructuring 
statistics were compiled 
another reason the agency told the associated press in denying a 
freedom of information request is that the identities may be 
protected under the privacy act 
aimee fisher the fmha freedom of information officer said state 
offices were asked only for the number of borrowers who had received 
writedowns and writeoffs of loans the numbers were broken down 
only in ranges of debt by state 
for example the 31 borrowers each were included in a category of 
debt writeoffs of between 1 million and 5 million in 17 states 
alabama 1 arizona 1 florida 2 georgia 1 idaho 1 
indiana 3 kentucky 1 louisiana 7 maine 1 michigan 5 
mississippi 1 missouri 1 montana 1 north carolina 1 north 
dakota 1 pennsylvania 2 and virginia 1 
neither the identities of those particular borrowers nor the 
corresponding exact dollar amounts of their writedowns was 
requested fisher said this information is not compiled and is 
therefore not considered readily available 
in order to gather the information about the 31 milliondollar 
writeoffs she said the fmha would have to canvass every county 
office in each of the affected states this would constitute an 
expensive and very timeconsuming search for this agency 
the identities of the borrowers may be arguably considered 
releasable as a matter involving an appropriate accounting of public 
funds fisher said 
she added however there is the sound countervailing argument 
that these individual borrowers debtservicing relationship with 
this agency is considered protectable under the privacy act inasmuch 
as these individuals private financial situation is necessarily an 
integral part of and is disclosed by identifying this 
relationship 
under the agricultural credit act of 1987 the fmha was given 
greater authority to restructure billions of dollars in delinquent 
loans the procedures include the reduction or writedown of loans 
to fit a borrowers ability to repay 
the law also allows a complete writeoff of loans that are 
hopeless where it would cost the agency so much to liquidate 
holdings that little or nothing would be left after settling with 
banks and other institutions to pay on the fmha debt 
at the start of the fmha restructuring program last fall more 
than 84 billion was in arrears of that more than 82 billion 
was outstanding for more than one year including 66 billion that 
had been delinquent for more than four years 
a new analysis by the departments economic research service said 
this week that almost 85 percent of the fmhas delinquencies last 
fall involved nonreal estate loans suggesting virtually no 
security backing them 
many of the reportedly delinquent borrowers have probably quit 
farming the report said over 11 billion is reported 
delinquent on economic emergency loans a program that has not been 
authorized since fiscal 1984

pennzoil co dumped its 8 percent stake in 
burlington resources inc ending speculation it planned to use its 
massive 26 billion lawsuit settlement to acquire the seattlebased 
company 
ever since the houstonbased oil company received the settlement 
from texaco inc last year it has been watched closely for any sign 
it may be honing in on takeover targets 
pennzoil officials said thursday the company sold 117 million 
burlington shares to shearson lehman hutton inc in a single trade 
the company sold the stock for 4525 a share or about 530 million

preceeding days 
pennzoil said its pretax gain on the investment amounts to 
approximately 134 million harper said it had not been decided how 
the money would be used 
there is a good deal of speculation concerning how we plan to 
invest the proceeds from our settlement of litigation with texaco 
and we have refused to comment on that he said 
but in every filing we made with the securities and exchange 
commission we stated that we were making that burlington stock 
purchase for investment purposes harper said 
burlington filed a complaint in federal court in february 
alleging that pennzoil misstated its intentions and was amassing 
stock in the resourcerich company in a veiled takeover attempt 
the complaint asked the court to make pennzoil fully disclose its 
intentions restrict its acquisition of burlington stock and divest 
most of the stock already bought 
harper said thursday that pennzoil would not comment on the 
burlington action or its relationship to the stock divestiture

for the first time since he launched his hostile 
bid for prime computer inc last fall bennett s lebow held a 
facetoface meeting with primes top executives this week 
but instead of smoothing things over the session appears to have 
created more bitterness 
in a statement thursday lebow said primes directors showed no 
interest in negotiating a merger and refused to give him the same 
confidential financial information they have provided to other 
potential buyers 
prime shot back by accusing lebow chairman of mai basic four 
inc of tustin calif of grossly misrepresenting what happened 
at the meeting wednesday morning and of using baitandswitch 
tactics to try to buy the company at a low price 
last week lebow cut his offer for prime a natickbased computer 
manufacturer with 11200 employees and 1988 revenues of 16 billion 
since nov 15 mai had offered 20 a share for all of primes 
stock now it is offering 1950 a share for about 75 percent of 
the shares and suggesting a swap of securities with a face value of 
21 a share for the remaining 25 percent 
since the securities are likely to trade at less than face value 
many wall street analysts are valuing the new offer at 17 to 19 a 
share 
jay stevens who follows prime for dean witter reynolds inc in 
new york said thursday the new bid totaled about 105 billion 
down from an original offer of about 125 billion 
prime president anthony craig said the companys threemember 
executive committee entered wednesdays meeting with lebow in good 
faith without lawyers or other advisers and totally willing to 
enter into meaningful discussions 
he also said prime gave lebow and his partner william weksel 
the same financial information it has given other possible bidders 
to have mai represent us as showing no interest in 
negotiating is simply a gross misstatement he said 
we feel strongly that mai is engaging in unfair tactics and we 
do not believe they should be allowed to bait our shareholders for 
nearly six months with an allcash 20pershare offer for all 
prime shares and then switch to a lower twotier offer of less 
cash and securities of very questionable value craig said 
lebow has said he lowered his bid because primes revenue 
projections went down and he has reaffirmed his intention to wage a 
proxy fight for control of the company at its annual meeting 
mai also has filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court to try to 
compel prime to hold the annual meeting june 14 as previously 
scheduled prime announced this week it was rescheduling the meeting 
to july 26 a hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for monday 
afternoon

apple computer inc executives promised 
to prosecute anyone captured from a group of ideological software 
pirates that claims to have liberated the macintosh computers 
ultrasecret code 
this is a serious criminal offense said apple spokeswoman 
carleen levasseur on thursday the company has alerted all of its 
workers but she acknowledged that the group could include some 
apple employees 
the code is the basis of our intellectual property she 
said of the closelyguarded copyright code 
we are also alerting our software developers that they could 
jeopardize their relationship with the us if they use any of the 
proprietary codes said levasseur 
the disk was mailed illegally by the group to various people and 
was accompanied by a letter signed the new prometheus league 
software artists for information dissemination it stated 
our objective at apple is to distribute everything that 
prevents other manufacturers from creating legal copies of the 
macintosh 
as an organization the new prometheus league has no ambition 
beyond seeing the genius of a few apple employees benefit the entire 
world and not just dissipated by apple through litigation and 
ill will 
unlike some other computer makers apple has never licensed its 
source code to anyone and has aggressively and successfully defended 
its copyrights in court to prevent competitors from building a 
clone of the macintosh 
the letter also said the group plans to distribute the complete 
source code to the macintoshs filing system and all drives as well 
as codes to the computers memory and latest system software 
the group is named for the greek titan who stole fire from heaven 
and gave it to man prometheus was later chained and tortured by 
zeus for the theft 
the disks were mailed from san francisco without a return 
address apple said it first became aware of them on tuesday 
the letter advises that anyone interested in receiving our next 
mailing should place a classified ad in macweek a trade journal 
with the word new prometheus

alaskas natural resources commissioner 
has suspended the states oil and leasing program but said the 
decision was only indirectly a response to public outcry over the 
march 24 exxon oil spill 
commissioner lennie gorsuch said a shrinking budget and a 
burgeoning workload were the reasons behind thursdays action the 
suspension postpones five sales totaling 23 million acres 
it would be irresponsible to lease new oil and gas areas and 
then not have adequate funding to meet our commitments to the oil 
producers who have already bought leases from the state drilled 
exploratory wells and made discoveries she said 
the leasing program which dates back to statehood in 1959 has 
generated more than 763 million for the state over the past 10 
years and offered more than 12 million acres to oil companies for 
exploration and development 
lease sales provide the petroleum industry with the base for 
future discoveries that help to replenish reserves the state reaps 
taxes and royalties from oil production 
gorsuch said the governor supported the action and that it was 
not directly related to the 109 milliongallon spill in prince 
william sound we just had to make some tough decisions about what 
needs to be done and what programs could be set aside until there is 
more funding she said 
jim eason director of alaska division of oil amp gas said the 
lease program will remain on hold until the legislature which 
convenes in january appropriates enough money to hire staff to 
handle the increasing workload 
since 1985 the divisions budget has been cut about 1 million 
he said and staff effectively has been reduced from 67 to 44 
eason said the immediate effect of the suspension of the program 
is the postponement of five lease sales scheduled for this year and 
the first half of 1990 two in the cook inlet area and three on the 
north slope 
eason also said the suspension of the program was not directly 
related to the oil spill but the spill raised public concern over 
oil and gas development in alaska 
he said he is optimistic the leasing program will resume in the 
future 
in addition to conducting lease sales the division collects the 
states oil royalties and lease rentals issues permits for 
development and geophysical exploration and handles contracts for 
the states royalty oil

under growing pressure from ecologists the 
european community friday adopted us pollution standards the 
worlds lowest for small cars 
the standards approved by the 12 eec environment ministers will 
become compulsory throughout the european economic community on july 
1 1992 for new models and on dec 12 1992 for old models 
the standards were set at 19 grams a test for carbon monoxide and 
5 grams a test for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide 
meanwhile however eec members willing to offer tax rebates to 
buyers of clean cars will be allowed to do so provided the tax cut 
is substantially lower than the added cost of the cars 
pollutionfree device the ministers decided 
an eec official explained that the tax rebates would have to be 
15 to 20 percent lower than the added cost of the cars 
pollutionreducing device 
the decision to lower standards for small cars followed growing 
pressure from the public 
several governments fearing new gains by green parties in their 
national elections and european parliament elections next week were 
pressing the eec to adopt stricter standards the european 
parliament added to the pressure by calling for lower pollution 
norms 
the netherlands was the first to announce tax rebates for clean 
cars six months ago which angered the eecs policymaking body 
which filed a lawsuit charging that the dutch incentive distorted 
competition within the eec 
but germany denmark and greece also announced tax rebates 
forcing the commission to revise its opposition to the measure 
the eec adopted pollution limits for medium and large cars four 
years ago

three faulty safety valves at seabrook 
nuclear plant have been returned to the manufacturer futher 
delaying the start of tests a plant spokesman said today 
operators of the 6 billion reactor completed nearly three years 
ago but unlicensed for lowpower tests until last month had hoped 
to start the first fission reaction several days ago but say they 
now wont be able to do so before at least the middle of next week 
engineers had worked on the valves since last friday when it was 
discovered that one of three in the auxiliary emergency feedwater 
system was opening too quickly 
plant officials decided thursday to send all three valves back to 
the manufacturer for more repairs seabrook spokesman ron sher said 
this morning by telephone from the plant 
to remove the valves seabrook operators had to bring the reactor 
down from its normal operating temperature and pressure sher said 
he said the temperature was down to 360 degrees this morning from 
557 degrees 
once the valves are reinstalled sher estimated it would take two 
days to get the reactor back to normal operating temperature and 
pressure 
after they are tested and found to work properly it could take 
as long as three days to trigger the first atomic chain reaction in 
seabrooks 100 tons of uranium fuel 
everything has worked properly except those three valves 
sher said 
seabrook originally planned for commercial operation in 1979 
has faced repeated regulatory delays cost overruns and protests 
that have made it a symbol for the nations antinuclear movement 
plant officials hope to win a commercial license by the end of 
this year though evacuationplanning and financial problems could 
stand in the way

k mart corp said will offer a doublecoupon 
promotion on saturday in all of its 2200 discount stores in an 
effort to lure shoppers and boost sagging profits 
k mart normally accepts manufacturers coupons at face value on 
saturday refunds from coupons valued at up to 50 cents will be

marx in bloomfield hills 
its unusual k marts kula acknowledged its being done 
to stimulate added sales

for investors who seek opportunities in depressed 
investments the ranks of the nations troubled banks and savings 
institutions might seem a natural prospecting ground 
there they sit stocks and bonds of numerous financial 
institutions selling at distress prices surely one might suppose 
some of these securities will sooner or later be worth far more than 
they are today 
look at what the smart money is doing the prominent 
financiers scooping up the remnants of failed banks and savings and 
loans 
maybe these bigtime operators will indeed make money says one 
analyst who specializes in depressed investments but small 
investors should resist the temptation to speculate in battered 
banks 
often a crisis is really an investment opportunity in 
disguise says george putnam iii editor of the bostonbased 
turnaround letter in this case however we think that most 
investors should steer clear of troubled banks and sampls 
troubled banks are not like other kinds of troubled companies 
when most companies get into trouble creditors and stockholders 
negotiate 
then if things get really bad the company goes into chapter 
11 and creditors and stockholders negotiate some more this time 
with the help of a bankruptcy judge 
by contrast he observes when a bank gets into trouble 
federal regulators step in and there is no negotiating 
when the federal deposit insurance corp or the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp takes up the case of a troubled 
institution putnam says shareholders almost always get wiped out 
recently bondholders have been getting wiped out as well the 
theory appears to be that when the government has to come in to 
rescue depositors no one else should get anything 
in a typical bank case of course the depositors have the claim 
of a government guarantee federal deposit insurance on up to 
100000 per account going for them 
if this assurance were ever to be compromised it would logically 
have farreaching and disastrous financial effects 
one trap awaiting the unwary speculator putnam says is the 
simple allure of a very low price say a stock that might have 
traded once for 30 or 40 a share now going for 2 1 or less 
some people think how much lower can these stocks go the 
answer at least on a percentage basis is a lot putnam says 
to prove his point he charted the performance of five prominent 
bank and savings and loan stocks from three months before the time 
they were seized by federal regulators 
all five issues were already trading below 2 at the starting 
point and their problems were well known to investors yet in the 
span since then three have fallen more than 90 percent in price 
while the other two show losses of 70 percent and 30 percent 
concluded putnam we think the only time to buy the securities 
of a troubled bank or savings institution is after the federal 
regulators have departed this usually means after a restructuring 
has been completed

the national association of securities dealers 
said friday it plans to begin trading 200 to 300 overthecounter 
stocks at 4 am eastern time with some of the trading directly 
competing with the london stock exchange 
the trading would involve the most active stocks traded on the 
nasdaq computerized system and mark another push toward 24hour 
global securities trading 
nasd president john hardiman told the wall street journal in 
fridays editions that the predawn trading was expected to begin in 
the first quarter of 1990 but plans for the system have not been 
completed 
the new system would mean trading from 4 am to 4 pm in new 
york and 9 am to 9 pm in london the us overthecounter 
market and major stock exchanges now trade from 930 am to 4 pm 
eastern time 
the nasd is the selfregulatory agency that oversees the national 
overthecounter market which does not have a centralized exchange 
or trading floor 
the otcs 5100 stocks which include many small issues are 
traded electronically over the nasdaq system the nations second 
largest behind the new york stock exchange 
according to the journal report 71 stocks are traded on both the 
london exchange and over the counter in the united states 
among the issues slated for predawn trading are all 97 european 
stocks listed on the nasdaq computerized exchange including jaguar 
plc cadbury schweppes plc and volvo ab the plan would include such 
us stocks as apple computer inc intel corp and mci 
communications corp 
we are identifying companies that have true international 
interest hardiman told the journal 
he said member firm response will determine whether the plan goes 
through 
we arent 100 percent sure but there is a strong likelihood 
that well go ahead hardiman said 
about two dozen nasdaq member firms have offices in london 
the nasd plan was approved by the associations board last month 
the nasd plans to submit a formal proposal to the securities and 
exchange commission in 30 to 60 days the plan has not yet been 
formally announced 
later this year the chicago mercantile exchange plans to begin 
futures contracts trading after normal trading hours and is 
discussing a link with the rival chicago board of trade 
the new york stock exchange also has said it is considering 
trading its stocks electronically when the floor is closed

a group of men using hightech methods of 
transferring money nearly heisted more than 69 million from a 
chicago bank a prosecutor said at the opening of their trial 
this isnt a story like bonnie and clyde assistant us 
attorney jeffrey stone said thursday as the frand trial of five men 
opened in federal court instead of guns they used telephones 
instead of masks they used computers instead of a getaway car 
they used foreign bank accounts 
defendants armand moore neal jackson leonard strickland ronald 
carson and otis wilson are charged with conspiracy wire fraud and 
bank fraud in the case 
two others herschel bailey and gabriel taylor pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy and wire fraud and have agreed to cooperate with the 
prosecution 
paul wagner moores attorney said in his opening statement 
thursday that testimony by bailey and taylor is suspect because the 
two have an interest in cooperating with the prosecution 
the plot began in march 1988 when moore asked bailey his 
cousin if he knew anyone who worked at a bank stone said bailey 
put moore in touch with wilson who worked at the first national 
bank of chicago stone said 
wilson then set up a meeting between the others and taylor who 
worked in the wire transfer department at the bank stone said 
shortly after the bank opened may 13 1988 the group transferred 
6912 million from first national to accounts in new york and then 
to two banks in vienna stone said 
according to stone taylors job was to verify whether wire 
transfers taken over the phone were authorized bailey posing as a 
representative of merrill lynch and co telephoned in a request for 
a transfer of 2437 million 
taylor then called bailey back at his chicago home to make it 
appear he was verifying the order the prosecutor said when it 
looked as if that transfer had worked the group transferred 1975 
million from brownforman corp and 25 million from united airlines 
the transfers went undetected until the following monday morning 
when the three companies called the bank to find what had happened 
to their money after the plot was discovered the money was 
returned to the chicago bank 
when bank officials checked phone records they found that the 
verification calls had been made to baileys home stone said 
adding that every criminal makes a mistake

employee stock ownership plans have mushroomed 
this year reflecting efforts by companies to put stock in friendly 
hands as a takeover defense now a government ruling may make esops 
even more common 
that is unless us rep dan rostenkowski gets his way 
two weeks ago the internal revenue service clarified its rules 
about how companies may raise cash to buy the stock that is placed 
in the employee stock plans which act as trusts to manage the 
employees shares 
previously companies were limited to private borrowings such as 
loans or notes from banks insurance companies and other 
institutions the irs ruling now makes it practical for companies 
for the first time to sell publicly traded bonds to raise the funds 
needed to purchase stock for esops 
but days after the irs ruling rostenkowski chairman of the 
house ways and means committee introduced a bill to eliminate a tax 
break now enjoyed by institutions that loan money for esops 
these institutions dont have to pay taxes on half the interest 
they earn from the loans in addition a company establishing an 
esop enjoys a tax break of its own it may deduct from its taxes 
both the principal and interest payments on these loans 
rostenkowski says he believes some companies are borrowing money 
for esops purely for the tax benefits his bill would eliminate the 
50 percent tax deduction for institutions making esop loans 
the esop association a washingtonbased lobbying group says the 
bill could severely damage esop funding should it be enacted in 
effect it would increase the cost of borrowing for esops since the 
loaning institutions would have to charge a higher rate of interest 
if they no longer had the tax break 
there are companies where the difference between the current 
rate and the higher rate they would have to pay would be enough to 
scotch the esop deal said martin staubus the groups associate 
director 
in addition the bill could lower the amount of money available 
at each company to buy stock for esops he said under the federal 
law that established the stock plans companies must limit the 
amount of money they spend on esop stock to 25 percent of the 
payroll of the employees covered by the plan if the interest costs 
on esop loans increase that would limit the amount of principal 
available for stock purchases 
the esop association says it believes rostenkowski is wrong to 
criticize the tax breaks available in forming employeestock plans 
the esop law staubus said has been effective in doing just 
what it was intended to do which is for companies to provide an 
ownership stake to their employees regardless whether companies see 
some benefits to themselves that point isnt especially pertinent 
the effect of the irs ruling if not circumvented by 
rostenkowskis bill is not clear 
what the ruling did was to clarify that esop debt doesnt lose 
its tax advantages for lending institutions if sold to an 
individual then sold again to an institution 
in effect it sanctions public trading of esop bonds before the 
ruling companies issuing esop debt were unsure whether the debt 
would lose the tax break if it were traded 
but the ruling does not allow individuals to exploit the tax 
break only qualified lending institutions may do so 
staubus says the ruling probably wouldnt result in any major 
overall increase in esop borrowing instead it might produce a 
shift in the borrowing from the privateplacement debt market to the 
public bond market 
but others are more optimistic 
i think that its a significant ruling that will lead to 
substantial public funding of esops said ross stemer director of 
investor relations at brunswick corp 
the leisure products manufacturer which is establishing an esop 
planned to be one of the first companies to issue public debt to 
finance an esop whether or not the irs made its ruling 
publicly traded bonds could lead to lowercost esop funding and 
possibly even mutual funds based on esop debt a salomon brothers 
inc vice president has estimated the potential public esop debt 
market at 20 billion to 30 billion

who owns american business 
amid the wheeling and dealing of corporate managements these days 
you might think theyre the owners but it isnt so shareholders 
still own americas public corporations although you may be 
forgiven for forgetting this fact 
sometimes managements seem to forget too in its effort to sell 
the company to itself the management of rjr nabisco inc was at 
first willing to accept 8 billion less than what became the final 
price 
the additional money was put on the table when competitors for 
the company offered shareholders a deal the rjr nabisco board 
couldnt refuse roughly 25 billion versus an initial price of 
about 17 billion 
compelled by law to attend to shareholder interests the rjr 
nabisco board would have had a difficult time rationalizing the 
lower price although important considerations other than price 
could have entered the picture 
it is roughly the same situation that the board of time inc must 
deal with in a managementproposed deal with warner communications 
time shares might have been worth about 125 paramount 
communications inc formerly gulf amp western offered 175 a share 
in making the latter offer paramount chairman martin s davis 
recognized an essential truth that in the final analysis it is 
shareholders looking after their own interests who call the shots 
it is usually not so in daytoday affairs shareholders simply 
arent consulted and in longterm matters they seldom have a real 
opportunity to oppose or educate management 
for the most part it is generally acknowledged that shareholders 
exercise their rights as owners by buying and selling if they 
disagree with management they sell if they approve they hold their 
shares or buy more 
but when wellfinanced suitors seek control of a company with a 
high cash offer shareholders have their say if not directly 
through tendering their shares then through the action of their 
representative the board 
still the highest price isnt always the best one a situation 
that it seems safe to say is recognized by most shareholders 
some suitors for example seek a company simply to break it up 
and sell off the parts shortterm this might benefit shareholders 
long term it might not since further price appreciation and 
dividends come to a sudden stop 
others too have a say in a corporations fate including 
employees the local communities to which it pays taxes customers 
dependent on its products and for reasons of market competition or 
national security uncle sam 
in the battle for time inc the national security issue could 
emerge over concern for a free press basic to this issue is a 
belief that a free flow of information is necessary for the proper 
operation of any large democracy 
viewed in that context any entry into the battle by a foreign 
suitor or by a party interested in dismembering time inc a 
journalistic giant whose magazines are american institutions might 
set off a serious debate 
in making paramounts 175 offer for time davis took careful 
note of this factor promising that if successful we would not 
only protect times journalistic independence we would insist on 
it 
money talks in takeover battles it talks loudly and often 
conclusively but not so loudly that other considerations arent 
heard especially if they are colored by patriotic or national 
security concerns

japanese and us semiconductor industry officials 
have agreed to meet on seeking better access for foreign companies 
to the japanese semiconductor market a japanese official said 
friday 
the electronic industries association of japan and the us 
semiconductor industries association decided thursday to create a 
task force to improve links between foreign suppliers and japanese 
companies that purchase semiconductors 
eiaj chairman toori sato said the panel would contain five 
japanese companies including sony corp and matsushita electric 
co and a group of american companies to be designated by the sia 
the task force is to discuss how foreign producers can better 
meet the requirements of japanese purchasers and will exchange 
technical information sato said its first meeting is expected in 
midjuly 
the eiaj also proposed forming another group to search for ways 
of encouraging foreign suppliers to participate in japans high 
definition television hdtv industry 
sato said the proposal was made in response to repeated 
expressions of interest by us producers in gaining greater access 
to the hdtv semiconductor market 
the american side said it respond later to the proposal he said 
earlier this week sia representatives told government officials 
they were dissatisfied with the current 109 percent us share of 
the japanese semiconductor market a ministry of international trade 
official said 
some us officials have claimed japan pledged in a 1986 
bilateral semiconductor pact to allow foreign chipmakers 20 percent 
of the japanese market but japanese officials have said that figure 
was only a goal 
what we would like to do is to offer more accessibility by 
creating closer ties between electronic manufacturers and foreign 
semiconductor makers starting from the productplanning stage the 
government official said 
a us electronics industry source said japan should have taken 
stronger steps earlier to open its semiconductor market but the 
agreement thursday was positive

mylan laboratories inc has filed suit against 
four of its competitors alleging they damaged its business by 
bribing federal officials for preferential treatment in the generic 
drug business 
the suit filed thursday in us district court in washington 
dc claimed the competitors violated federal antitrust and 
racketeering laws resulting in about 200 million in damage 
the suit comes in the wake of a food and drug administration 
investigation and the filing of criminal indictments last month 
against two fda officials and two pharmaceutical company executives 
the fda officials and the executives have all either pleaded 
guilty to criminal charges or agreed to plead guilty according to 
the us attorneys office in baltimore 
mylan claims it was thwarted in its efforts to bring 22 generic 
products to market in a timely fashion because of corruption in the 
approval process beginning in 1984 when a federal law regulating 
generic drugs took effect 
the suit describes the generic drug industrys highly competitive 
nature in which getting products on pharmacy shelves first is of 
paramount importance 
it contends that competing companies and executives embarked on 
a scheme of unlawfully giving cash gifts of furniture electronic 
equipment and other valuable items trips to the far east and other 
exotic places and payments for hotel rooms and entertainment in 
expensive bars and restaurants to fda officials 
at the same time mylan began experiencing unwarranted and 
unjustified delays in obtaining fda approvals of its applications 
for generic drugs the suit said 
the competitors named in the suit include akzo nv a dutch 
concern par pharmaceuticals inc of spring valley ny vitarine 
pharmaceuticals inc of springfield gardens ny and american 
therapeutics inc of bohemia ny 
also named were various officers employees and agents of those 
firms and an akzo subsidiary pharmaceutical basics inc and a 
subsidiary of par quad pharmaceuticals inc 
what were saying is that the payment of bribes in order to 
change the way the regulatory process functioned resulted in earlier 
approvals of drugs for mylans competitors said mike forscey a 
washingtonbased attorney for mylan 
greg drahuschak an analyst with butcher amp singer inc in 
pittsburgh said that even at 200 million damages would be worth 
555 per share to mylan an amount he estimated would be equal to 
the companys pretax profits for the past 13 years 
determining damages for lost business oportunities has proven 
difficult in other suits he noted 
par spokeswoman barbara manners said the company will 
vigorously defend itself but declined to respond to the specific 
charges 
officials of akzo and vitarine declined comment

the labor department reported that the producer price index of 
finished goods rose 09 percent in may substantially outpacing

the start of a move to relax its credit policy 
nevertheless some observers said they were impressed with the 
markets relatively calm reaction to the news 
unexpected jumps in the producer price index earlier this year 
touched off sharp declines in stock prices 
the blow apparently was cushioned this time by several factors

prudentialbache securities inc said friday it 
is reorganizing its investment and merchant banking operations in an 
effort to enhance client service and increase the firms competitive 
clout 
loren schechter executive vice president corporate services 
said the reorganization involves changes in the chain of command and 
will affect less than a quarter of the 2000 employees in 
prudentialbaches institutional investment and merchant banking arm 
no employees in the division called prudentialbache capital 
funding will be laid off or be required to make significant 
relocations he said 
prudentialbache a subsidiary of prudential insurance co of 
america has a total of about 17000 employees 
this is not part of a massive reduction in staff said 
schechter 
an internal memorandum distributed to staff and made available to 
the associated press on friday described a series of structural 
changes that deal with shifts in management oversight of units 
within the capital funding arm and other organizational realignments 
schechter said the changes are intended to streamline the 
businesses making them easier to run and more responsive to 
customers needs 
were very pleased with how the bank has been running 
schechter said this is the next stage of development to make it 
run better 
george l ball prudentialbaches chairman and chief executive 
officer stated in a written summary of the memo that in market 
share profitability and reputation the firm accomplished an 
enormous amount in both capital markets and investmentmerchant 
banking 
the organizational changes are designed to bring together sets 
of skills and responsibilities not to shuffle people or power he 
added 
the eightpage staff memo used mostly upbeat language to portrary 
prubaches achievements 
but in explaining the reasons for the reorganization to be 
carried out over the next few weeks the memo listed several 
difficult market conditions the volume of business in several 
categories is shrinking at a time when the number of competitors for 
that business is expanding it said 
at most firms investment bankers traders researchers and sales 
people are in different divisions and may have different perhaps 
conflicting priorities the memo said 
the reorganization is aimed at overcoming this structural 
disadvantage by grouping together employees pertinent to particular 
types of transactions in the same reporting area something ball 
termed transactional integration 
the reorganization has been planned for months according to 
schechter and wasnt triggered by the firms loss of 9 million in 
the first quarter he declined to speculate on the firms current 
financial performance prudentialbache earned a record 111 million 
last year 
wall street analysts have criticized prubache for being slow in 
building up its muscle in the merchant and investment banking 
business 
according to firstquarter figures compiled by securities data 
corp prubache ranked ninth among underwriters of us debt and 
equity securities and managed 27 billion of offerings or 39 
percent of the market by contrast merrill lynch amp co the 
industry leader managed 137 billion or 197 percent of the 
market 
separately prubache spokeswoman eleanor e mascheroni declined 
to comment friday on a published report that the firm has been 
discussing the purchase of thomson mckinnon securities inc 
the new york times said prubache is in the final stages of 
negotiations to acquire thomson mckinnon which has been hunting for 
new capital for months a deal is expected to be announced in the 
next few weeks the newspaper said 
thomson mckinnon a unit of the privatelyheld thomson mckinnon 
inc with about 5200 employees initially tried to find an investor 
for the 23 percent stake owned by the hartford accident and 
indemnity co 
howard cohen spokesman for thomson mckinnon also declined to

storehouse plc on friday rejected a proposal by 
us takeover specialist asher edelman that he make a friendly offer 
for the british retailer of 760 million pounds or about 12 
billion 
edelman said he was prepared to offer 185 pence or 289 a 
share for storehouse subject to several conditions including 
approval by storehouses board of directors 
but storehouse said it wouldnt meet with edelman to discuss his 
proposal saying his approach is neither an offer nor a firm 
intention to make an offer 
on the london stock exchange friday storehouse shares jumped 8 
pence or 12 cents to finish at 162 pence or 253 23 pence 
below the offer price suggested by edelman 
storehouse operates a total of about 900 stores on both sides of 
the atlantic under the names habitat conrans mothercare and bhs 
british home stores 
edelman already owns around 33 million storehouse shares or 81 
percent of total shares outstanding which he purchased beginning in 
late 1988 
since then the storehouse board consistently has refused to 
discuss various edelman suggestions for enhancing the companys 
stock price 
i propose that we now meet to discuss the acquisition of 
storehouse by the edelman group edelman wrote in a letter to 
storehouse directors 
edelmans proposed bid also would depend on finalizing his 
financing for the offer and a commitment from sir terence conran to 
sell edelman his shares 
conran storehouses chairman owns around 30 million shares or 
73 percent of the total 
storehouse shares have recently slumped amid mounting evidence of 
the companys difficulties 
last week storehouse said its pretax profit dropped to 113 
million pounds or 176 million in the fiscal year ended april 1 
from 1149 million pounds or 179 million the year before 
last year edelman transplanted part of his investment business 
to europe he previously had made profitable runs on major us 
companies including lucky stores inc and fruehauf corp

antonio cipollone his name out of the 
newspapers and into the lawbooks has gone back to a quiet retiree 
life strolling on the boardwalk visiting relatives and traveling a 
bit 
one trip brought the 65yearold italian immigrant to the united 
nations may 31 where the world health organization awarded him a 
medal for his landmark legal fight 
a year ago tuesday six federal court jurors here awarded him 
400000 for the lungcancer death of his wife rose the nations 
first damages judgment in a smokerdeath case 
i dont know if i could do it again said cipollone of 
lakehurst nj i was really tired lets face it it was every 
day every day it was really rough for a while 
for 4 months all eyes in the 22 billion tobacco industry and 
antismoking forces were focused on cipollones court case against 
liggett group inc lorillard inc and philip morris inc the 
companies made the cigarettes smoked by mrs cipollone for 40 years 
before she died at the age of 58 five years ago 
jurors found that liggett had violated an express warranty or 
advertising promise that its products were safe all three companies 
were absolved of conspiring to defraud the public about the health 
dangers of smoking 
but the industrys 30year invincibility had been violated and 
tobacco opponents were encouraged that a new surge of lawsuits might 
be launched 
it has not happened 
from a peak of 150 in 1987 the number of pending suits against 
the industry has dropped to around 80 cigarette companies and 
tobacco analysts say 
in a sense theyre quiet times said richard daynard a 
northeastern university law professor who heads the tobacco products 
liability project which supports lawyers suing the cigarette 
industry 
i think people are waiting for additional developments 
plaintiffs attorneys before they make their investments in these 
cases he said 
the industry and some wall street analysts see the antismoking 
litigants in retreat 
the proof is in the pudding said kurt a feuerman an 
analyst at drexel burnham lambert the number of cases is much 
lower 
he points to other numbers the continued flood of profits to the 
cigarette makers and the health of their stock 
the day after the verdict tobacco stocks retreated but have 
since come back mightily philip morris postverdict price of about 
83 for example is now around 140 
the industry also argued that the relatively small award 
discouraged other wouldbe antitobacco lawyers from suing in light 
of the years of work and millions of dollars needed to battle the 
industry 
it was an absolute masterpiece of spin control on their part 
to take a defeat and turn it into if not a victory at least a 
nondefeat countered daynard 
cipollones lead attorney marc z edell acknowledged some 
attorneys may have been discouraged 
i think the momentum of the cases has stopped basically and 
the easy pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that a lot of lawyers 
anticipated would rise out of these cases just isnt there 
whats needed is expertise in developing such cases and practice 
in trying them he said 
this fall should bring a flurry of activity three cases are set 
for trial then in beaumont texas boston and lexington miss 
daynard still believes that some day the cipollone case will 
prove a watershed in tobacco litigation 
he reports receiving requests for 150 sets of documents 
introduced at the cipollone trial the case was considered unique 
for the large quantity of damaging corporate memos and reports 
introduced at trial 
antitobacco litigants say their availability sharply reduces the 
enormous costs of waging a legal war against cigarette makers 
edell who has made about 20 lecture appearances since the trial 
said the case also led to a tremendous volume of inquiries from 
other wouldbe plaintiffs though he has taken no new cases 
we dont want to undertake the financial commitment as well as 
the professional commitment to represent people when we dont know 
what the future will bring he said referring to the pending 
appeal of the cipollone verdict he has five cigarette cases on hold 
in new jersey 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals is considering liggetts 
challenge to the express warranty verdict the state supreme court 
also is considering edells challenge of a 1987 new jersey law 
excusing cigarettes from the riskutility theory of liability that 
is whether a products risk outweighs its usefulness 
recent state court decisions favor both sides the california 
supreme court last month upheld a 1987 state law barring liability 
suits over inherently unsafe products including cigarettes 
a month earlier the minnesota supreme court found that warning 
labels on cigarette packs starting in 1966 do not give tobacco 
companies complete immunity from lawsuits as other courts have held

down friday as foreign sales continue on the light side 
the surge in the value of the dollar weighed heavily on soybean

a subsidiary of australian developer 
hooker corp said friday that it has retained an investment adviser 
to consider selling refinancing or finding partners for three of 
its us shopping malls 
lj hooker developments an atlantabased division of hooker said 
it has hired first boston corp to look into joint ventures or 
refinancing proposals for the malls the properties include the 
forest fair mall in suburban cincinnati richland fashion mall in 
columbia sc and thornton town center in thornton colo near 
denver 
hiring first boston does not necessarily mean hooker plans to 
sell the malls outright the company said in a statement 
the 18millionsquarefoot forest fair mall which opened three 
months ago has leased 87 percent of its available space the other 
two malls are scheduled to open later this year 
reports circulated earlier in the week that hooker was seeking 
buyers for the malls but glass said our preference is to joint 
venture these projects we would welcome a financial partner 
for these malls while we continue to operate them 
glass said his company plans to concentrate on retail mall 
development in the united states a field it entered three years 
ago but hooker also is seeking to cut the debt it acquired after 
rapidly expanding its us retailing properties 
company officials said any transactions involving the malls will 
not involve bonwit teller b altman parisian or sakowitz stores 
owned by lj hooker developments 
the move comes less than 10 days after hooker chairman george 
herscu announced that his company would sell 740 million of its 
assets mostly in australia to ease a cash crunch caused by its 
american expansion 
the root of hookers cash flow problems is in australia said jim 
cox hookers chief operating officer there 
hooker which is australias secondlargest home builder watched 
soaring home mortgage rates in that country soften the residential 
market that coupled with huge debt payments stemming from its us 
expansion has left the company unable to pay some creditors 
hooker officials said in late may that the company had fallen 
behind in payments to several apparel suppliers some of which 
halted shipments to bonwit teller and b altman 
but cox said wednesday that his company was not having severe 
problems in america refinancing or selling the malls is a strategic 
move he said 
hooker isnt an investment company its a development 
company he said we dont hold properties once they are 
completed we sell them 
lj hooker said it has five other mall sites including work 
recently begun in tampa fla and cary nc 
subject to getting our anchor groups together we intend to 
develop these malls glass said

a string of oil discoveries in the eastern 
desert and a new determination to encourage private business are 
helping socialist syria climb out of a deep economic trough 
with the help of western oil companies the country this year 
became a net oil exporter for the first time with revenues of 550 
million forecast by early 1990 
selfsufficiency in energy is something you really appreciate 
when youve never had it before economy minister mohammed imadi 
said in an interview 
the studies show that we have a continuous oil and gas supply 
for our needs and a surplus for export whenever we need the foreign 
exchange he said 
for the syrians whose economy has been in such poor shape it 
barely had enough foreign exchange to cover one weeks imports the 
oil flow offers the prospect of badly needed money 
the modest oil boom has come as syria struggles to reduce annual 
inflation of more than 65 percent and repay its 18 billion foreign 
debt 
threequarters of that is owed to the soviet union mostly for 
arms supplies for president hafez assads determination to make 
syria strategically equal to neighboring enemy israel 
the oil strikes have come at a critical time for syria which has 
suffered political setbacks in the region and is under pressure from 
the arabs and the soviets to moderate hardline policies hindering 
the middle east peace process 
saudi arabia this year stopped annual payments to syria of around 
540 million for its role as a frontline arab state facing israel 
other arab states have long halted aid to syria mainly because 
of assads alliance with persian iran against arab iraq in the 
8year gulf war 
oil giants royal dutch shell british petroleum occidental 
petroleum of the united states and frances total are among 10 
foreign companies involved in exploring and developing the new 
fields as quickly as possible 
its a highpressure job because the syrians are really in a 
rush to get the oil out of the ground said one exploration 
expert who spoke on condition of anonymity the better we do the 
more were asked to do 
syria has been pumping around 150000 barrels a day of heavy 
crude from the souweidieh fields in the northeast since the early 
1970s and mixing it with imported light crude for domestic use 
prospecting at that time by the countrys east bloc allies 
brought no results but advanced technology helped shell locate the 
thayyem fields in 1984 
the new wells already are producing around 200000 barrels a day 
of saleable crude raising overall output to 350000 barrels a day 
more than double the countrys needs 
but because the deposits are generally small and fractured 
exploration will have to be continuous in order to guarantee 
longterm supplies the expert said 
oil minister mutanious habib recently told the middle east 
economic survey an oil industry newsletter that another 50000 
barrels a day will be added later this year from three new fields 
he said syria was evaluating potential reserves throughout the 
country in what he called a crucial year for exploration 
the government also has signed a contract with marathon oil of 
the united states to develop natural gas deposits south of ancient 
palmyra to be used instead of oil and hydropower for generating 
electricity 
imadi said the increased oil output and a record harvest 
following higherthanaverage rainfall helped the economy grow by a 
staggering 107 percent last year 
this year agricultural production will fall sharply because of a 
winter drought that is already causing water shortages in damascus 
but officials estimate that the oil boom will still fuel growth of 
around 72 percent a year 
syria is negotiating barter deals to settle accounts with foreign 
creditors and cut import bills phosphate exports for example will 
pay for importing antibiotics from france and italy 
a senior government official said that a crackdown on smuggling 
is working but that incentives for private businessmen are more 
effective for curbing the black economy 
contraband ranging from bananas and french cheeses to clothing 
and computer software arrives in syria by the truckload from 
neighboring lebanon foreign residents of damascus say 
under the new incentives businessmen can use up to 75 percent of 
their export earnings to finance imports they can also go into 
partnership with the government in tourism transportation and 
agricultural business projects 
to attract expatriate syrians to invest at home tax incentives 
and a law allowing businessmen to transfer earnings abroad are being 
prepared there are plans too for reviving the damascus stock 
market after a quartercentury gap 
its common sense to have the private sector more actively 
involved in the economy imadi said 
but western diplomats predict it will be a while before the 
syrian economy takes off 
theres a great commercial tradition here but because of the 
complex bureaucracy and corruption it cant be revived from one 
day to the next one commented 
syrians say they find it hard to manage on salaries that range 
from about 63 a month for a taxi driver to 125 for a university 
professor 
the government recently hiked wages by 25 percent but that only 
seemed to intensify the inflation problem gasoline prices 
immediately jumped by 50 percent and some food costs rose by 30 
percent

the stock market suffered a small setback today 
faced with news of a biggerthanexpected increase in producer 
prices 
the labor department reported that the producer price index of 
finished goods rose 09 percent in may substantially outpacing 
advance estimates by brokeragefirm economists 
analysts said the news dampened hopes that the federal reserve 
would continue any time soon with what looked in recent days like 
the start of a move to relax its credit policy 
nevertheless some observers said they were impressed with the 
markets relatively calm reaction to the news unexpected jumps in 
the producer price index earlier this year touched off sharp 
declines in stock prices 
the blow apparently was cushioned this time by several factors 
including continued strength of the dollar in foreign exchange and a 
strong bond market 
yields on longterm government bonds which were above 9 percent 
less than three months ago fell below 82 percent in todays 
trading

opec may have reached a new accord among 
its members for limiting crude oil production but analysts say the 
cartel failed to tackle tough problems that have been weakening its 
influence in the world oil market 
at this past weeks meetings opec settled on raising its 
production cap from the current 185 million barrels a day to 195 
million barrels to support a benchmark price of 18 a 42gallon 
barrel 
it divided the 1 millionbarrel increase in production 
proportionately raising each members supply quota a certain amount 
but still at issue despite the new pact are continued demands by 
kuwait the united arab emirates and several others in the 13member 
organization of petroleum countries for a larger share of the 
cartels daily output 
kuwait pressed the issue so strongly at the organizations 
justended meeting that the talks nearly collapsed 
a lot of problems were swept under the carpet said fergus 
macleod analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london 
opec ministers plan to meet again in september and take a hard 
look at some persistent woes indonesias oil minister ginandjar 
kartasasmita predicted the meeting would be crucial for the 
history of opec 
kuwaits ali khalifa alsabah endorsed only parts of the 
agreement reached late wednesday after six days of bargaining but 
said the nation refused to meet its alloted limit 
sabah said kuwait immediately would slash production to 135 
million barrels a day that would be well above kuwaits 
julydecember quota of 109 million barrels a day but sharply under 
its estimated current output of nearly 2 million barrels 
analysts estimate opec already is producing about 21 million 
barrels a day so the cartel would have to rein in output to meet 
the new target 
the oil markets initially reacted skeptically to the pact with 
us crude futures tumbling before stabilizing at lower levels 
michael rothman senior energy analyst at merrill lynch capital 
markets in new york said the agreement injects a dose of 
pessimism because it signals opec is unable to deal with the quota 
issue 
it does not bode well for prices in the short term he said 
he said prices for west texas intermediate the benchmark us 
crude could slip into the range of 15 to 17 a barrel in the 
julyseptember quarter 
the july contract for west texas intermediate fell 12 cents to 
1988 on friday up from the lows of less than 13 a barrel reached 
late last year 
but macleod said prices would hold fairly steady if kuwait and 
others did not cheat too much on their quotas although sabah said 
kuwait would not obey its quota macleod said he is suggesting he 
will show more restraint than expected 
paul mlotok head of energy research at the investment firm 
morgan stanley amp co in new york estimated actual cartel production 
would be just under 21 million barrels a day 
that level of production could lead to some erosion from 
todays price level but nothing too serious he said 
as a result there should not be much impact on gasoline prices 
at the pump mlotok said 
in addition to kuwait the united arab emirates a persistent 
cheater was expected to continue producing more than its share 
its new quota is about a million barrels a day but it has been 
producing an estimated 16 million barrels 
gabon and ecuador also tend to exceed their quotas 
to control the leakage the producers would have to do something 
about the sensitive quota issue but to give more oil to one country 
means the cartel would have to make the unpopular move of taking 
away some from another 
every member probably considers itself to be a special case 
for a higher quota said ian graham analyst at the londonbased 
county natwest

the nuclear industry said it couldnt 
happen but some scientists now believe the 1986 accident at the 
soviet unions chernobyl power plant exploded like an atomic bomb 
an article in fridays technology review a journal published by 
the massachusetts institute of technology says similar accidents 
could happen at 13 other nuclear reactors in the soviet union 
however the possibility of such an accident in a us reactor 
is vanishingly small wrote william sweet a reporter for physics 
today published by the american institute of physics 
sweet gathered his information in interviews with scientists and 
specialists at the nuclear regulatory commmission and the us 
department of energy 
a runaway nuclear reaction set off a chain of events that 
severely damaged the reactor core and surrounding structures 
sweet wrote 
this damage set the stage for a second explosion which was much 
more violent than the first and almost certainly was a fullfledged 
nuclear explosion 
some scientists say the article accurately reports current 
thinking but others say it is causing unnecessary alarm 
to call this a nuclear explosion is very misleading said 
themis speis deputy research chief at the nrc 
the reactor went out of control but the time it took to raise 
the temperature and pressure is many orders of magnitude smaller 
than it takes to get an atomic bomb going he said 
john ahearne former nrc chairman said i wouldnt call it a 
nuclear explosion 
harvard university physics professor richard wilson said in the 
article it was a nuclear explosion theres no doubt because the 
ultimate source of energy was nuclear 
to ever say it was not a nuclear explosion is just plain 
wrong 
the argument is one of semantics said gregory van tuyle a 
nuclear engineer at the brookhaven national laboratory 
the plant was not destroyed by a steam explosion as scientists 
had believed but power grew to very large levels very rapidly 
he said the phrase nuclear explosion is not inappropriate 
the accident blamed for the deaths of at least 31 people 
injured many more and spread radiation for thousands of miles 
sweet acknowledged that the reactor at chernobyl exploded far 
more slowly and with much less energy than a bomb but he said 
official reports suggest the reactors fuel formed a critical mass 
reacted uncontrollably melted and vaporized 
it would be deeply misleading to say that the plant did not 
blow up like an atomic bomb he said 
ever since the first nuclear power plants were built in the 
1950s the industry has insisted they cant explode like bombs 
sweet said chernobyl casts doubt on whether that is true of all 
power reactors 
of the plants operating in north america however only the 
canadian plants are susceptible to a chernobyltype accident 
in an interview friday from his new york office sweet said a 
chernobyltype accident is unlikely in the united states because 
us commercial reactors have safer designs

the head of a national teachers union said friday 
that whittle communications plans for the national launch of its 
advertisersupported news show for high schools represent a 
significant improvement over the experimental version of the 
program 
but albert shanker president of the 700000member american 
federation of teachers stopped short of endorsing the project 
which is called channel one and is scheduled to debut in march 1990 
we are encouraged by the fact that whittle communications has 
taken such extensive steps to address the problems associated with 
its pilot project he said in a statement 
there are still problems however commercial advertising is 
still on and it is very questionable whether a fastpaced program 
can truly help students to think more critically and thoughtfully 
about news events skills students desperately need he said 
shanker was one of several national educational leaders that have 
criticized the channel one plan for giving advertisers an avenue for 
pitching products to students in the classroom 
knoxville tennbased whittle announced thursday it planned to 
launch channel one in 1000 schools across the country next march 
the program was tested in six schools earlier this year 
schools will be asked to sign a contract that will give them 
about 40000 or more worth of color televisions satellite dishes 
and videocassette recorders in exchange for showing a daily 
12minute news show that includes two minutes of paid advertising 
during the school day 
in the test participating schools were required to show the 
program in every classroom so the entire student body sees it each 
day 
whittle said schools participating next spring would not be 
required to show it to every student and could designate which 
classrooms will be wired to receive the program 
kate krell a spokesman for shanker said the union also liked 
whittles plan to include smaller schools among those eligible to 
participate

k mart corp hoping to attract customers and 
rejuvenate sluggish sales is borrowing a marketing tactic more 
common among supermarkets a doublecoupon day on saturday at all of 
its 2200 discount stores 
k mart normally accepts manufacturers coupons for face value 
saturday coupons worth up to 50 cents will be doubled in value 
said teri kula senior marketing coordinator 
the nations secondlargest retailer after sears roebuck and 
co is trying to jumpstart sales after a disappointing first 
quarter in which profit slumped 22 percent 
our experience has told us if you want to bring in traffic 
theres nothing like a doublecoupon sale said mike wellman vice 
president of marketing 
double coupons are relatively expensive promotions because the 
retailer must absorb the cost of the extra discount 
they wont cost k mart as much as the normal grocery store where 
large numbers of products are promoted through moneyoff coupons 
wellman said in our area its basically health and beauty 
aids he said 
k mart has used the technique before in selected markets but 
never nationwide it will be a onetime only thing this year 
wellman said 
industry analysts said k marts move suggests the retailer is 
anxious to keep its cash registers ringing as much as possible 
it indicates their traffic is off and they need people to 
swing in those doors again bloomfield hills marketing consultant 
frederick marx said 
new pricing policies at industry giant sears are believed to have 
steered customers away from competitors stores 
analysts say however that it is difficult to quantify how much 
business may have been lost by discounters such as k mart to sears 
since it launched its everyday low prices strategy on march 1 
k marts kula conceded that retailers are confronting competitive 
challenges which call for special approaches 
theres no getting around the fact that its an extremely 
competitive environment kula said retailers need to do what 
they can to get people into the stores it indicates were 
maintaining our competitive stance in the marketplace 
wellman of k mart said he didnt expect the move to touch off 
immediate responses by other discounters each one has their own 
strategy he said 
sears doesnt use promotions involving coupons and spokeswoman 
kathy gucfa said the retailer wouldnt comment on k marts strategy 
another retailer target stores inc intends to stick with its 
weekly circular of sales items and also has no plans for 
couponoriented promotions said spokesman george hite at target 
headquarters in minneapolis 
analyst paul alexandrakis of argus research in new york said k 
marts sales have been a bit slow this might be an experimental 
way to see if they can shore them up 
alexandrakis also didnt foresee a bandwagon effect unless such 
a promotion showed results over a longer period 
if its a onetime thing just to experiment i wouldnt see 
the others jumping in he said

energy futures prices fell in slow trading friday 
as the markets began to digest the results of the latest opec 
meeting 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil settled at 1988 per 42gallon barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange down 12 cents from thursday when 
the contract gained 33 cents 
wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices also fell 
unleaded gasoline slipped 028 cent to 6372 cents a gallon while 
home heating oil was off 163 cents to 4703 cents a gallon the 
drop in heating oil was attributed in part to sluggish demand 
typical for this time of year 
traders were feeling a lot of postopec meeting depression 
said james fiedler an oil market analyst with edampf man 
international futures inc 
fiedler called such a reaction by the market normal following a 
meeting by the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
opec ministers agreed late wednesday to boost the cartels 
overall production ceiling to 195 million barrels a day during the 
julydecember period the new ceiling is 1 million barrels a day 
higher than the current level but below the estimated daily output 
in recent weeks of about 21 million barrels 
people just wanted to catch their breath and go home for the 
weekend and try to figure out what it means fiedler said 
he described trading as quiet 
the opec ministers who reached the agreement at their 
semiannual meeting in vienna agreed to divide the extra 
production proportionately among all members 
analysts said this means some countries will have to curtail some 
pumping to keep within their selfimposed quotas

a boeing co official friday confirmed 
speculation that the company is interested in making a stretched 
version of the boeing 767300 to fill a market niche for planes a 
bit smaller than the 747 jumbo jet 
richard albrecht boeings senior vice president of marketing and 
finance told a news conference at the paris air show in le bourget 
that the company would like to offer a model larger than the 767 but 
smaller than the 747 the new model would compete with mcdonnell 
douglas corps new md11 and airbus industries new a330 both of 
which seat about 300 passengers 
boeings stock has been falling all week because industry 
analysts suggested that an estimated 2 billion development cost for 
the new plane would hurt profits of the seattlebased aircraft maker 
among the alternatives being considered are a further stretch 
of the 767300 or an allnew nineabreast fuselage with a new wing 
and larger engines albrecht said 
the 767300 has sevenabreast seating for up to 261 passengers a 
mid1995 target date has been set by boeing for certification of a 
stretched plane dubbed the 767x 
albrecht said boeing is in discussion with potential customers 
for the 767x but hasnt yet received a target number of firm 
orders needed to officially launch the plane 
analysts have said united airlines and british airways plc may be 
the launch customers

the dollar soared against major foreign 
currencies friday in a powerful buying wave touched off by an 
unexpectedly high us inflation reading strength in the bond 
market and continuing tension in the far east 
gold prices sank as much as 15 an ounce amid profittaking 
john mccarthy chief dealer at the new york office of amsterdam 
rotterdam bank said currency dealers drove the dollar past several 
psychologically significant thresholds against the west german mark 
at the end of trading in new york the dollar stood at 2010 
marks up from 19725 late thursday 
a key catalyst for the buying was the labor department report of 
a 09 percent increase in the producer price index in may 
the figure which exceeded economists estimates revived 
speculation that us interest rates might have to remain high for 
now to prevent inflation from veering out of control high us 
rates make returns on dollardenominated investments attractive 
which tends to encourage dollar buying 
prior to the report a belief was spreading that the federal 
reserve board soon would relax its guarded credit stance and allow 
interest rates to recede 
currency dealers were heartened by the credit markets attitude 
toward the inflation news 
bond traders who normally react negatively to rising inflation 
shrugged off the numbers and bought partly on the grounds that us 
government securities offered a safehaven in a time of uncertain 
investment conditions in several countries 
the unrest in china has made some investors jittery about the 
entire far east while political troubles in japan have weighed down 
the yen 
mccarthy said dealers bought dollars despite being wary about the 
possibility of central bank intervention 
no government authorities were detected buying and selling 
currencies in the market friday except the bank of japan which 
intervened during the european trading day to slow the dollars 
advance dealers said 
the dollar began its trading day in tokyo and rose 045 yen to a 
closing of 14350 yen later in london it was quoted at 14605 
yen and in new york the dollar rose to 14649 from 14325 thursday 
in london the dollar gained sharply against the british pound 
it cost 15545 to buy one pound cheaper than 15735 late 
thursday later in new york sterling declined further against the 
dollar to 15485 compared to 15773 thursday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
thursdays levels included 17475 swiss francs up from 17085 
120145 canadian dollars up from 11973 67987 french francs up 
from 66910 and 145775 italian lire up from 14355 
late dollar rates in europe compared with thursdays rates were 
20025 deutsche marks up from 19770 17402 swiss francs up from 
17100 67810 french francs up from 67040 22510 dutch guilders 
up from 22220 145050 italian lire up from 143950 11999 
canadian dollars up from 11967 
bullion dealers said the market reacted to the higher dollar by 
selling to collect profits on the precious metals gains made 
earlier in the week 
gold fell in london to a late bid price of 36325 a troy ounce 
compared with 37325 late thursday in zurich gold closed at a bid 
36805 compared with 37435 late thursday 
later on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for 
current delivery fell to 35810 a troy ounce from thursdays 
settlement of 37350 republic national bank of new york said gold 
was bid at 357 an ounce as of 4 pm edt down from 37280 late 
thursday 
gold closed in hong kong at 37253 down 408 from wednesdays

starting an upswing

bond prices surged friday pushing longterm 
interest rates to their lowest level in more than two years despite 
a biggerthanexpected rise in a key inflation indicator 
the bellwether 30year treasury bond climbed by about 1 points 
or 1625 for every 1000 in face amount 
the bonds yield which moves in the opposite direction from 
price skidded to 814 percent the lowest since it finished at 
806 percent on april 9 1987 and down from 829 percent late 
thursday 
what we were treated to today is what sometimes happens in bull 
markets where everything becomes good news said william griggs a 
partner in the investment firm griggs amp santow inc 
the government reported inflation at the wholesale level shot up 
09 percent in may an increase was twice as big as many analysts 
expected 
an indication that inflation is growing more rapidly than 
expected normally depresses bond prices because it increases chances 
the federal reserve may to boost interest rates to curb inflation 
traders said prices of some 30year issues plunged a full point 
immediately after the report was released but within minutes 
prices began retracing lost ground 
mitchell held chief economist with smith barney harris upham amp 
co said traders decided to continue buying bonds for fear of 
missing out on the rally 
this shouldnt be happening but it is he said 
a strong dollar helped fuel the bond rally as foreign investors 
attracted to the currency by the uncertain international situation 
due to events in china plowed their dollar holdings into government 
notes and bonds analysts said 
but steven a wood economist for bankamerica capital markets 
group in san francisco said there was substantial interest by 
domestic buyers as well 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm governments rose by between point and point 
intermediate maturities rose by between 716 point and point and 
longterm issues picked up as much as 1 1516 points the financial 
information service telerate inc said 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 717 to 118070 
in corporate trading industrials also were higher moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures total return 
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 259 to 32533 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose point the average yield to maturity 
fell to 730 percent from 733 percent late thursday 
yields on some shortterm treasury securities edged higher 
however reflecting what analysts called speculation that the 
inflation report would limit the feds inclination to ease credit 
for the time being 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 846 percent as the 
discount rose 7 basis points to 818 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 828 percent as the discount advanced 8 basis points 
to 785 percent yields on oneyear bills slipped to 828 percent 
and the discount fell 1 basis point to 770 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
nonetheless the federal funds rate slipped to 9 percent down 
from 9 percent late thursday the funds rate is the interest that 
banks charge each other for shortterm loans the federal reserve 
can influence the rate by buying or selling securities in the open 
market thereby adding to or draining the reserves within the 
banking system 
a decline in the fed funds rate from 9 916 percent last friday 
has been interpreted as a sign that the fed has adopted a more 
generous credit policy

fred ricarts 127 salespeople managed to 
sell a record 24000 fords last year partly because of the zany 
antics of their boss a selfconfessed ham who pitches cars in 
television commercials by strumming a guitar and crooning lyrics 
written by his 10yearold daughter 
ricart with 2326 million in sales last year says that minus 
fleet sales he is the no 1 auto dealer period although industry 
accounts and rankings vary 
he chides competitors who include fleet sales when tallying up 
their sales figures ricart includes only automobiles sold to 
individual customers for cash 
others say theyre the biggest but i dont believe in 
comparing apples and oranges we dont include fleet sales period 
no one has ever topped 230 million dollars in sales he said 
cherubfaced fred were dealin ricart is a local celebrity 
in the countrys 26th largest auto market although much of the 
guitartouting auto moguls business comes from out of town 
many of his 66 television commercials feature ricart strumming 
his sixstring and singing words penned by his daughter this van is 
your van this van is my van whole lotta dealin goin on he 
plays 19 instruments and has a recording studio in his home 
ricart admits he couldnt carry a tune in the back of a pickup 
but i really am a pretty good guitar player 
people tell him his television pitches are annoying but ricart 
believes they actually enjoy them and according to the sales 
figures they certainly remember them 
a 30 million inventory including his nearby van land sprawled 
out on 77 acres on columbus east side makes ricart ford look more 
like a small city than an auto dealership 
weve made this a big disneyland complex said ricart 38 
who left college to help rescue his fathers ailing ford business 16 
years ago you dont see someone silly on tv and then come in and 
see some snubnosed salesman we want to make it fun 
parents can soon shop for a new set of wheels while their 
children play video games at ricarts day care center now under 
construction customers who are everfearful of the auto mechanic 
can order a videotape of any repair work done on their cars 
people just dont trust mechanics you dont know if they do 
what they say theyre doing so well videotape it just to be 
sure said ricart a former biology student at case western 
reserve university in cleveland 
the service center is open 24 hours but if youre still too busy 
to take in the tbird a 23000 diagnostic van will pull into your 
driveway or office parking lot and a technician clad in coat and 
tie will fix it there 
ricart admits his prices arent the lowest he says however his 
dealer also fixes many cars for free even when theyre no longer 
under warranty 
success magazine which called him the biggest dealer of american 
autos in the world said ricart gave away 380000 in service not 
covered by warranty last year 
people dont really care what they pay for a car were more 
concerned with the human factor says ricart 
part of that approach is a welcome center where youre greeted 
by a harmless person who asks the customer what hes looking for 
then pages a salesman says ricart 
ive walked in some dealerships and seen a pack of wolves in 
the corner he said this was a rebellion dealership from the 
beginning 
he said 66 percent of his business comes from outside columbus 
and 18 percent is out of state in columbus ricart said he has 714 
percent of the market and the average customer drives 50 miles to 
see his inventory 
the average person figures im a normal guy not a shyster 
lawyer or a cunning cpa and thats why i keep calling it the human 
factor

wholesale inflation came roaring back in may 
after a twomonth respite as prices soared for gasoline fresh 
vegetables and automobiles the government reported friday 
the labor departments producer price index jumped 09 percent 
last month and is up at an annual rate of 94 percent so far this 
year more than double the 4 percent increase last year and 
quadruple the 22 percent gain in 1987 
however michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser 
attributed most of the inflation this year to special factors 
and predicted better numbers ahead 
he said food price increases will ease with the expected return 
to normal weather following last years drought he added that crude 
oil prices have stopped climbing and that should steady energy 
prices 
we want to remain vigilant but we expect inflation to 
stabilize in the second half of the year and decline thereafter 
he told reporters at a white house briefing 
private economists said fridays report means the federal reserve 
will wait at least a month before following up on its first 
tentative step to loosen credit after 15 months of fighting 
inflation with higher interest rates 
the central bank nudged a key interest rate the rate banks 
charge each other for overnight loans down early this week in the 
hope that slower economic growth would soon dampen price pressures 
financial markets had rallied in response to that move but they 
dipped slightly in early trading friday after traders interpreted 
the price report as an indication the fed will hesitate before 
loosening again stock prices generally recovered by midday 
i was guessing before that we might get another easing move 
sometime in early july but my view now is that the fed will stop in 
its tracks and hold for the next month or two said economist 
david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer in new york 
prices at the wholesale level had risen by 04 percent in both 
april and march after rising 11 percent and 09 percent in january 
and february the worst twomonth performance in eight years 
the labor department identified three factors as big contributors 
to the may price jump gasoline automobiles and vegetables 
gasoline prices rose 52 percent following an april climb of 134 
percent the steepest in more than two years energy prices overall 
rose 33 percent in may natural gas prices increased 34 percent 
but heating oil costs declined 77 percent 
food prices which had posted a rare 06 percent decline in 
april rebounded 08 percent in may the price of vegetables 
skyrocketed 264 percent as celery and tomato prices doubled and 
cabbage prices rose by onethird 
there were also significant increases for eggs rice pasta and 
chicken prices for beef pork and fish declined 
craig howell a labor department analyst said tomato prices rose 
strongly because of a temporary shortage after florida growers 
finished shipping their crop 
the price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy 
sectors a figure often taken by analysts as a truer reflection of 
underlying inflationary pressures rose 05 percent last month 
following an unusual 01 percent decline in april 
the increase in may was largely driven by a 18 percent rebound 
in auto prices following a 28 percent decline a month earlier 
howell said auto manufacturers rolled back some of the rebate 
programs they had been offering also several manufacturers 
announced price increases for options and for some specific models 
he said 
price gains also were posted for childrens clothing glassware 
mobile homes toilet paper and tires 
the overall may increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1142 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11420 last month up 
from 113 in april 
measures of inflation earlier in the production process were 
mixed with the price of intermediate goods rising only 01 percent 
and the price of crude goods jumping 09 percent however excluding 
food and energy intermediate goods rose a modest 02 percent and 
crude goods prices fell 04 percent 
to the extent that crude and intermediate prices work their way 
through to the finished goods level that would suggest good news 
for the months ahead said dirk van dongen president of the 
national association of wholesalerdistributors 
an example of the three processing stages finished 
intermediate and crude would be wholesale bread flour and wheat

paramount communications inc lost a round friday 
in its 107 billion buyout bid for time inc when a delaware judge 
denied paramounts request to block a key provision of times merger 
agreement with warner communications inc 
delaware chancery court judge william p allen said paramount had 
not produced enough evidence to support its request for a temporary 
restraining order against a stock option agreement that allows time 
and warner to buy each others shares 
allen said it has not been shown to my satisfaction that 
paramount has legal rights that will be irreparably injured by such 
exercise of the stock swap or that the legal and equitable rights 
of time shareholders will be irreparably injured by such an act 
those issues could be better addressed during a more fully 
developed trial allen said in an eightpage ruling adding that it 
was likely to take paramount months to complete any takeover of time 
anyway 
time and warner both issued statements that they were pleased 
with the decision and believed the stock swap arrangement was in the 
best interests of their shareholders 
paramount said in a statement that it found the decision an 
extremely satisfactory one even though it did not get the 
temporary order it sought 
the court has fully protected our position by assuring the 
status quo the court denied a tro solely because it has the power 
after a full hearing to undo any timewarner stock swap the 
paramount statement said 
the provision which was included in the agreement to block a 
possible unwanted bid from a third party would further dilute the 
companies stock and make a takeover of either company more costly 
paramount sued in delaware where time is incorporated after 
announcing its 175ashare cash bid earlier this week the 
companys lawyers said in court friday they would be satisified if 
time and warner agreed not to amend the stock swap option and gave 
paramount five business days notice if they decided to trigger it 
lawyers for time and warner argued that the stock swap would not 
damage any buyout offer and there was no need for the restraining 
order or advance notice time and warner shareholders who earlier 
filed suit to block the merger of the two communications giants 
joined the paramount action saying they feared parts of the 
agreement could a chilling effect on other bids 
they also asked for postponement of the june 23 meetings at which 
time and warner shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger 
if allen grants the restraining order he would then hold 
hearings on whether to hand down an injunction against the stock 
swap 
time stock was up 150 to 16950 a share in late trading on the 
new york stock exchange paramount stock was up 12 cents to 5850 
and warner shares were down 50 cents to 56 
under the merger plan that would create timewarner inc the 
worlds largest communications concern time shareholders would get 
a share in the new company for each share they own and warner 
shareholders would get 0465 share of the new company for each 
warner share 
analysts have said time has several options to fend off 
paramount formerly called gulf amp western inc the options include 
launching times own tender offer for warner or turning the tables 
on paramount by making its own takeover bid for the uninvited suitor 
in a socalled pac man defense 
besides the stockswap provision in the agreement with warner 
time has several takeover defenses including a poisonpill 
stock plan the poison pill involves issuing new stock to existing 
shareholders thereby making a hostile takeover more expensive 
the new york times reported friday that times board of directors 
met thursday to discuss the companys options a time spokesman did 
not immediately return a reporters call seeking further information 
about the meeting

the municipal government friday pitched an 
incentive package to sears roebuck and co to try to keep the 
retailers 6000employee merchandise group from leaving town 
later mayor richard m daley said chicagos assets should be 
reason enough for sears to stay the comments came the same day two 
city newspapers reported sears already has decided to move the bulk 
of the groups workers elsewhere 
varying estimates have put the value of the citystate incentive 
package which includes land near ohare international airport a 
tax abatement and site improvements at between 100 million and 
200 million 
you have to be optimistic when you look at chicago daley 
said listing the citys lakefront schools churches and hospitals 
as advantages few cities could match we have a quality of life 
equal to any other part of the country 
but he said he was concerned sears might refuse the incentive 
package put together by the city and the state and accept a 
lucrative offer from another municipality 
dallas and charlotte and raleigh nc have been mentioned most 
frequently as chicagos chief competitors 
after a meeting between sears and city officials sears 
spokeswoman kathy gucfa denied any decision had been made about 
relocation 
they gave us some more information about the site about 
transportation and a host of other details she said our 
position is the same as it has been all along we will announce the 
decision sometime this month 
the relocation of the merchandise group comes as part of a 
restructuring plan announced by sears earlier this year 
in addition to costcutting sears has shifted its retailing 
strategy to include brandname products specialty stores and an 
everyday lowpricing policy 
the company also put its landmark sears tower the worlds 
tallest building up for sale and plans to move the merchandise 
employees out of the office complex over four years 
the chicago suntimes quoted sources as saying monday was the 
deadline for proposals to buy the property and that potential 
buyers of the building valued at between 900 million and 14 
billion included sports and real estate tycoon edward debartolo and 
press magnate robert maxwell 
the paper said sears will announce next week that 4000 employees 
will be transferred to either north carolina or texas with the 
remaining 2000 jobs staying in chicago but those 2000 jobs will 
be phased out gradually a source said 
the chicago tribune meanwhile suggested sears may be thinking 
about breaking up the merchandise group and moving parts of it 
around the country 
one source said apparelrelated workers would be relocated in new 
york and furniturerelated workers in north carolina while hardware 
and appliance workers would stay in chicago

an eastern airlines union leader told a rally of

effort that has come forward except last week bryan told the 
rally for the first time the creditors committee was thoroughly 
impressed they had a lot of confidence in it 
bryan said the committee rejected ritchies bid which is 
supported by the unions only because bankruptcy law gives eastern 
until early july to submit a reorganization plan 
about 1000 striking machinists pilots and flight attendants 
attended the rally in a parking lot adjacent to machinists 
headquarters afterward they marched along a street that goes past 
eastern corporate headquarters 
pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground workers 
represented by the machinists in a walkout that started march 4 and 
virtually grounded the airline eastern sought bankruptcy protection 
from creditors five days later and has since tried to rebuild as a 
smaller company 
the proposal presented saturday by ritchies group included a 
100 million equity investment and 210 million in union wage 
concessions 
bryan said negotiators representing frank lorenzo chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp requested 500 million cash and 
300 million on paper so obviously what the lorenzo people were 
saying was get lost they were not dealing in good faith and 
thats clear now to the court 
easterns matell described bryans comments as absolute 
nonsense there is no basis whatsoever for those statements 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland on monday said eastern should 
begin negotiating with creditors about the companys plan to sell 
18 billion in assets and reorganize 
but bryan and henry duffy national president of the air line 
pilots association told the rally that ritchie and his backers 
still hope to buy eastern 
they are continuing very aggressively to pursue the 
acquisition bryan said they think theyre getting stronger 
each day in putting the transaction together 
duffy predicted that the creditors committee will not approve 
easterns reorganization plan 
the orenzo plan overestimates revenue underestimates expenses 
and has the most fatal flaw of all it doesnt have any people 
duffy said to cheers from the crowd

paul a bilzerian the high school dropout and 
vietnam veteran who rose to takeover strategist and singer co 
chairman has a new though unwanted title convicted felon 
a federal court jury convicted of all counts in a tax and 
securities fraud trial friday 
the jury took just eight hours over two days of deliberations to 
reach its verdict despite bilzerians testimony in his own defense 
the case was the first prosecution of a corporate raider using 
information derived from the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
that broke in 1986 
defense lawyer arthur mathews who said he planned to appeal 
contended that prejudicial rulings by the trial judge hurt the 
defense case especially concerning bilzerians testimony 
but us attorney benito romano said the verdict would suggest 
that it was not something that the jury thought much of 
bilzerian 38 a tampa fla investor who won control of singer 
last year was charged with breaking securities and tax laws and 
making false statements in connection with three failed takeover 
attempts involving apparel maker cluett peabody amp co building 
supplies maker hh robertson amp co and hammermill paper co and 
another transaction of armco inc stock in 1985 and 1986 
none of the charges involved bilzerians 106 billion takeover 
of singer the stamford conn defense contractor 
the key prosecution witness was boyd l jefferies founder of a 
california brokerage that bears his name 
jefferies who was implicated by boesky and in turn implicated 
bilzerian pleaded guilty to securities law violations in 1987 
he has testified twice before at the stock manipulation trial of 
gaf corp and one of its top executives both times the case ended 
in a mistrial it is to be retried again in november 
jefferies who faces a maximum 10 years in prison testified that 
he agreed to help bilzerian circumvent disclosure laws by letting 
him park stock that is conceal its true ownership with 
jefferies amp co allowing him to secretly accumulate large stock 
positions in potential takeover targets 
a jefferies employee michael landy corroborated much of 
jefferies testimony 
in five days of testimony near the end of the sixweek trial 
bilzerian admitted supplying misleading information to the 
securities and exchange commission but explained his actions as 
either inadvertent or mistaken interpretations of the law he also 
denied engaging in bogus securities trades to obtain illegal tax 
losses 
but jury foreman paul oneill said the panel found both jefferies 
and landy credible while to bilzerians testimony they gave 
not too much credibility particularly where he disagreed with 
jefferies 
bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison and 225 
million in fines bilzerian was freed on 250000 bond pending 
sentencing aug 16 
originally indicted on 12 counts bilzerian got one count 
dismissed in april and us district judge robert ward combined four 
conspiracies into two counts on wednesday 
the tall mustachioed bilzerian showed no emotion as he stood to 
hear the six man six woman jurys verdict his wife terri also 
sat expressionless in the spectators section 
the couple left the courthouse without comment
