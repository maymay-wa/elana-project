a leukemia patient whose plight prompted 50000 
people to step forward as possible bonemarrow donors will undergo 
a transplant of bone marrow from her mother thursday a hospital 
spokeswoman said wednesday 
the operation on allison atlas 20 is expected to take at least 
four hours and could last six hours or more said fred hutchinson 
cancer research center spokeswoman alice burgess 
doctors are scheduled to extract the marrow from miss atlas 
mother at 9 am the spokeswoman said 
the marrow from her mother matches only four of six antigens or 
cell identifiers but the new york university student from 
bethesda md decided to undergo the operation while she is still 
strong enough 
she began chemotherapy july 31 and has responded well burgess 
said 
doctors said a patient with miss atlas type of leukemia can 
expect a 60 percent chance of recovery if the transplant marrow is 
perfectly matched without a transplant they say the disease is 
100 percent fatal 
in leukemia a form of cancer white blood cells multiply 
uncontrollably bone marrow produces blood and doctors can combat 
the cancer by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy tissue 
miss atlas condition prompted a campaign by her family last 
fall to find a perfectly matched donor they were unsuccessful but 
the effort raised 3 million to process blood samples from the 
50000 people in the united states and israel who volunteered 
ten patients found perfect donors

france will there as elsewhere continue to exist in 
solidarity and coordination with countries like the united states 
but only under french officers mitterrand told reporters 
in canberra australian prime minister bob hawke said his 
country will send two frigates and a supply ship as part of the 
international force 
he said they will be used to enforce the blockade on iraq and 
kuwait and protect the exports from other oilproducing 
countries he said 
western leaders have talked of a blockade if a unorganized 
global embargo against iraq fails 
i believe the gravity of the situation warranted this 
action hawke told a news conference 
he said the ships will be able to leave australia within five 
days and arrive within 22 days 
president saddam hussein of iraq whose forces invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 has denied any intention of attacking saudi arabia 
however western reports say his troops have massed on the saudi

carrier groups are positioned in the red and arabian seas he said 
mideastern diplomatic sources said the us buildup would total 
at least 40000 troops backed by more than 100 jet fighters 
italian premier giulio andreotti on thursday told british prime 
minister margaret thatcher that italy has not been asked to join 
the multinational force in saudi arabia according to the italian 
news agencies ansa and agi they cited unidentified sources in the

a young soldier offered to plead 
guilty to a burglary he said he didnt commit so he could ship out 
for saudi arabia with his unit but a jury quickly found him 
innocent thursday and he was on his way 
pfc joseph cufferi 20 was accused of breaking into a 
neighbors house in october 1989 while home on leave 
cufferi said he got together with friends drank approximately 
10 beers and had some trouble getting into what he thought was 
his parents home 
he was actually two doors down at the home of robert anthony 
keller 
i remember ringing the doorbell and going around and saying 
let me in i thought that was my house cufferi said 
but when keller heard the backyard gate open and saw the 
darkclothed man trying the french doors he thought cufferi 
intended to hurt his family assistant state attorney thomas lawson 
told the palm beach county circuit court jury on wednesday 
he spent about 15 minutes knocking said assistant public 
defender karen ehrlich burglars dont knock 
keller said he told cufferi to leave but the soldier kept 
banging doors and windows so keller grabbed a shotgun pointed it 
through the window at cufferi and threatened to shoot keller said 
cufferi ran but was later caught by police and charged with 
attempted burglary 
im sorry i went to the wrong house but it was a mistake 
cufferi said wednesday but now i need to go do my job i defend 
the united states of america 
some members of his unit the 24th infantry based at fort 
stewart ga were due to leave thursday 
prosecutors agreed earlier in the week to allow cufferi to plead 
guilty to the lesser charge of trespassing but he rejected the 
deal however he changed his mind after learning his unit was 
shipping out apparently believing hed be allowed to go after 
pleading guilty 
but the kellers refused to go along with the deal and cufferi 
went on trial 
on thursday a hopeful cufferi parked his packed car near the 
courthouse 
the jury took only 15 minutes to decide his fate 
the first thing we did was take a vote and it was unanimous 
not guilty said juror tim kelly 
thursday night cufferis father said his son called from fort 
stewart to say hed arrived in time to catch up with his buddies 
im glad that at least through all of this he was able to be 
where he wants to be said jospeh cufferi sr

soldiers packed and shipped out to the middle east on wednesday 
leaving behind frightened civilians and tearful wives and fiancees 
others rode the rumor mill wondering if they would be the next to 
be mobilized 
theyre going they are definitely going there is no doubt in 
my mind that this is another war said effie parsons 23 a clerk 
at a convenience store near fort bragg nc home of the 82nd 
airborne division 
president bush ordered us forces to saudi arabia to help it 
repel a potential attack by iraq which invaded neighboring kuwait 
last week 
bush specifically mentioned the 82nd pentagon sources speaking 
on condition of anonymity said they also expected deployment of 
the 24th division mechanized from fort stewart ga and the 101st 
airborne division from fort campbell ky elements of those three 
units would be deployed with the 18th airborne corps a control 
unit at fort bragg that directs the combat divisions the sources 
said 
a soldier at fort bragg who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said about 2000 soldiers from there were to go to saudi arabia and 
that some of that force had left tuesday night 
on wednesday truckloads of soldiers and supplies were seen 
driving toward pope air force base which adjoins fort bragg at 
least two large civilian jetliners that could be used to haul 
soldiers landed at pope 
around 850 pm a steady stream of c141s began leaving the 
air base and continued leaving for at least 30 minutes at 
intervals of a few minutes about two hours later at least four 
planes were heard leaving or landing 
early in the week convenience store clerks said sales of 
chewing tobacco batteries and insect repellent were brisk as 
soldiers hurriedly stocked up 
a lot of fathers are coming in with their kids holding them 
real tight and many wives are in tears as they make their 
purchases said ms parsons 
assistant store manager wade felman comparing this deployment 
with the panamanian deployment of december 1989 said the 
atmosphere now is much more tense and wives coming in are more 
nervous 
the panamanian thing i guess seemed so small to them he 
said i think this thing is a little more worrisome 
one of the 82nds soldiers pfc mark ohmer was to marry angela 
nelson 19 in suburban detroit this saturday the 6000 wedding 
was postponed when he was called back to base 
it happened so fast im so upset nelson said iraq does 
a lot of chemical warfare and marks job is to deactivate chemical 
weapons and deactivate contamination of soldiers he also was 
taught to dismantle bombs 
while the pentagon sources said the 101st airborne also was 
going spokesmen for the 14000soldier division at fort cambpell 
continued to deny that wednesday 
that didnt convince people just outside the post gates in 
clarksville tenn and fort campbell ky 
everybodys a little nervous you never know what can 
happen said tammy bradford whose husband mike is a 101st 
infantryman mrs bradford at work at a restaurant said she tried 
not to think about the possibility that he could be ordered to the 
middle east 
i think we should be out there to stop iraq she said but 
i dont want my husband to go 
i feel somethings going on on the base at fort campbell that 
were not aware of and we shouldnt be aware of said morrell 
boyd owner of a cleaning shop in clarksville 
boyd said the number of soldiers bringing in uniforms to be 
cleaned or mended had not increased over the past two days but 
those that are coming in are needing it in a rush he said 
at fort stewart army officials tightened security wednesday 
night as members of the 24th infantry loaded their gear into 
deserttan trucks and bradley fighting vehicles 
army officials refused to say whether the division would deploy 
to saudi arabia to help protect the oil kingdom from an iraqi 
invasion but relatives braced for their departure and expressed 
concern for their safety 
maj ron keeling a fort stewart spokesman said the division 
was conducting a routine emergency deployment exercise 
some soldiers had been called back from leave 
helmeted soldiers armed with m16 rifles could be seen trudging 
through motor pools with rucksacks and duffel bags wives and 
girlfriends huddled with soldiers in parking lots a telephone 
operator said longdistance circuits were jammed with calls from 
fort stewart soldiers 
military police set up checkpoints at some entrances to the post 
spec 4 norman aimes 24 part of the infantry division said 
earlier that he was called back from leave in utah they called 
and said there is a 99 percent chance that we are going aimes

to do then the waiting wouldnt be so bad then you could prepare

a federal administrator appointed two years ago 
to help drive organized crime out of the fulton fish market said in 
a court report filed wednesday that racketeering remains rampant at 
the huge market 
in the report filed in us district court frank h wohl said 
the market was controlled by a few people who set rules for 
delivering seafood and practiced extortion 
he told the new york times in an interview published in thursday 
editions that strongarm tactics by some companies discouraged 
suppliers from sending fish to new york driving up retail prices 
for local consumers 
he told the times that city officials worsened the problem by 
abdicating their responsibility to regulate and police the market 
he said he would soon impose rules to help suppliers and businesses 
operate at the market without intimidation 
about 90 million pounds of seafood with a retail value of 2 
billion are sold each year at the market in lower manhattan 
wohl said in the report that city officials told him they feared 
for the safety of city employees involved in the market and also 
feared attempts to corrupt police officers if the city enforced 
regulations more strictly 
he said that although the city had the authority to license and 
regulate deliveries arriving truckers are assigned by some 
unknown authority to unload their trucks under this system his 
report said it costs as much to transport a pound of fish 50 feet 
at the market as it does to transport it from new england to new 
york city 
the unloaders charge the wholesalers 135 per 100pound box if 
truckers unloaded supplies themselves wohl said they would be 
subject to physical abuse 
drivers must pay extra to have their fish unloaded promptly he 
said 
jeanne nathan a spokeswoman for the city office of business 
development told the times wohls report was old news and 
reflected his inability to correct the problem despite a budget 
of 750000 and a staff of a dozen investigators and researchers

a federal judge wednesday ordered a conservative 
religious organization to distribute a correction to a pamphlet 
used to press its case that the national endowment for the arts is 
supporting pornography 
the ruling by us district judge william c conner came in a 
lawsuit by artist david a wojnarowicz against the american family 
association of tulepo miss and its executive director david e 
wildmon 
the judge said the pamphlet used cropped images of wojnarowicz 
work to suggest he created sexually explicit images its 
distribution had likely harmed the artists professional and 
personal reputation he said 
conner made permanent an earlier injunction that barred any 
further publication of the pamphlet titled your tax dollars 
helped pay for these works of arts 
the judge also awarded 1 in damages to wojnarowicz who had 
sought up to 1 million he said wojnarowicz had not proven 
financial damage because no galleries or museums had canceled 
exhibits of his work 
conner said wildmon must send a courtapproved corrective 
communication to all who received the pamphlet the association 
sent the pamphlet to 4000 churches members of congress and other 
individuals as part of its campaign against the endowment 
wildmon had objected to several of wojnarowicz works exhibited 
earlier this year at the illinois state university galleries a 
catalog of reproductions of 60 of his paintings collages and 
photographs was partly financed by the nea 
tim wildmon the executive directors son said the association 
had not made a decision on whether to appeal the order to 
distribute a correction 
he praised the judges decision to award 1 in damages saying 
the action showed the lack of validity of his lawsuit 
paul weiss one of wojnarowicz attorneys said he believed his 
client should have received more money because the controversy 
could affect his ability to show and sell his work in the future

lindiwe phillip an 
antiapartheid activist fled into exile and expected to return 
triumphantly in a few months that was 14 years ago 
she came home in june when the government granted temporary 
amnesty to dozens of african national congress leaders so they 
could return and prepare for talks on ending apartheid the racial 
policy that gives 5 million whites supremacy over the nations 28 
million blacks 
ms phillip now 32 was among thousands of young blacks who 
left after the the 1976 student uprisings hundreds of people were 
killed in 1976 and the uprising helped shape a generation of 
militant activists 
i thought exile would be very temporary about three 
months she said as time went on i had to grapple with the 
fact that i am in exile and that i can no longer go home 
the anc south africas leading black opposition movement has 
an estimated 20000 members in exile the anc and the government 
agreed monday to clear the way for their return starting in 
september 
while ms phillip was in exile in zambia her parents died 
after she was in touch with her brother about the deaths he was 
killed and then her younger brother was found stabbed to death 
she still does not know who killed either of them 
i was just heartbroken she said i was almost on the 
verge of going nuts crazy 
during her exile ms phillip received military training and 
studied in cuba and tanzania she also worked in the anc womens 
section and the department of information and publicity in lusaka 
zambia the ancs exile headquarters 
her feelings were mixed when she returned in june with a group 
sent to recruit members for the anc womens league 
we had so longed to be back home but at the same time we were 
not sure it was the correct time she said 
african national congress members began trickling out of south 
africa when the organization was banned in 1960 
president fw de klerk lifted the 30year ban in february a 
law passed at that time empowers de klerk to grant immunity but so 
far he has given only temporary amnesty to a few dozen anc leaders 
and officials 
officials say that under mondays agreement the cases of all 
exiles will be reviewed and disputed cases will be handled by a 
special commission 
mathews phosa a lawyer on the anc negotiating team fled south 
africa five years ago when he was told his life was in danger but 
had to leave his wife and 3yearold daughter behind 
it is one of the most traumatic decisions one could take in 
ones life a very very painful experience shattering 
terrible he said 
what sustained exiles phosa said was unshakeable belief in the 
struggle to end apartheid 
you dont know where you are going to exactly he said 
you are being uprooted from your loved ones you know you are 
going to comrades but thats not enough you still have to make 
new friends 
after the initial shock life in exile becomes normal the 
lawyer said people get married they fall in love they work 
and home is not something that haunts you every day 
finding a place to live is a major problem for returning exiles 
there is a severe shortage of housing for blacks 
many will want to catch up on education they missed while 
fighting for spear of the nation the anc military wing but black 
schools are overcrowded qualified teachers are rare and violence 
has disrupted classes for years 
recent rightwing violence against blacks and against whites 
opposed to apartheid is a source of fear for returning exiles 
phosa said but that cant be a reason for us not to come home 
with the political space being there to organize and build our 
organization it would be irresponsible for us not to deploy our 
cadres inside the country he said 
i think i am optimistic that we will get over the stumbling 
blocks there is a willingness on the part of the government they 
are very slow hesitant but i think they are moving forward and 
they should be credited for that

scientists today said they have cloned a 
button marijuana presses in the brain a step that may lead to 
medications that mimic the drugs therapeutic effects without 
affecting mood or thinking 
new treatments for pain high blood pressure epileptic 
convulsions nausea asthma and the eye disease glaucoma may 
result other scientists said 
the new work revealed the chemical makeup of a protein structure 
on the surface of brain cells marijuanas main ingredient called 
a cannabinoid binds to this structure to exert its effects 
the study is presented in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by scientists from the national institute of mental health 
in bethesda md 
their paper describes the braincell structure as it appears in 
rats but further study showed the human structure is virtually 
identical said study coauthor tom bonner 
marijuana is best known for producing a calm mildly euphoric 
state time seems to slow down and users become more sensitive to 
sights sounds and touch ideas may flow rapidly through the mind 
while shortterm memory is suppressed 
the new work opens the door to developing derivatives that 
produce medicinal effects without marijuanas undesired ones said 
dr solomon snyder director of the neuroscience department at 
johns hopkins medical school in baltimore 
the newly cloned structure is called a receptor many drugs and 
natural substances bind to particular receptors to exert their 
effects on the body 
previous studies suggest that cannabinoids exert a variety of 
effects because they bind to a variety of receptor variants called 
subtypes snyder said 
so if you could get a derivative that works on the therapeutic 
subtype but not the subtype that makes you high then you would 
have an effective drug without the possibility of being a drug of 
abuse he said in a telephone interview 
drug companies have been working on this for years but have 
been unsuccessful because they didnt have any way to look at these 
receptor subtypes that we think exist 
researchers should now be able to use the cloned cannabinoid 
receptor to search for related subtypes he said 
then a drug company can synthesize lots of chemicals and check 
them out on receptor a and receptor b and then gradually sculpt a 
molecule that fits receptor a and not receptor b and then you have 
a super drug he said 
bonner said the existence of the receptor suggests that the 
brain naturally contains some sort of cannabinoidlike substance 
the receptors not there just so that people can go out and smoke 
pot and get high he said 
finding the brain chemical would shed light on the workings of 
the central nervous system and might give clues to developing new 
medications he said 
in the nature paper scientists said they found genetic material 
that tells brain cells how to make the receptor 
when they inserted the genetic material into hamster ovary 
cells the cells produced receptors that behaved as expected when 
exposed to cannabinoids

an outbreak of a sometimes fatal blood disease 
among users of ltryptophan was blamed by scientists today on 
impurities introduced during manufacture of the diet supplement in 
japan 
us researchers believe the contamination resulted from changes 
in the way ltryptophan was made by showa denko kk one of six 
companies worldwide that manufacture the overthecounter 
supplement in bulk 
we believe that some of the agent has been getting into 
ltryptophan for years said dr michael t osterholm but 
there was a series of circumstances that may have increased the 
agent in the product in late 1988 and at the same time resulted in 
lowering the amount removed in the finished product 
osterholm the minnesota state epidemiologist said researchers 
are trying to pinpoint the contaminant 
showa denko spokesman alan wachter acknowledged that statistical 
evidence pointed to the companys product as the cause of the 
outbreak but he said it is uncertain whether the fault lies in 
changes in its manufacturing process 
ltryptophan was ordered off the market in the united states in 
march after it was linked with an outbreak of eosinophiliamyalgia 
syndrome that has struck more than 1500 people killing 27 the 
painful disorder can cause high fever rash weakness and shortness 
of breath among other symptoms 
ltryptophan is an amino acid it has been sold as a treatment 
for insomnia depression and other disorders 
osterholm is senior author of the report in todays new england 
journal of medicine he worked with other researchers from the 
minnesota health department and scientists from the centers for 
disease control and the mayo clinic 
while most of the cases of the blood disease associated with 
ltryptophan were spotted in 1988 and 1989 osterholm said others 
occurred in the early 1980s 
ltryptophan is made in fermentation vats by the bacteria 
bacillus amyloliquefaciens the researchers believe that the 
tainted product may have resulted from two changes in showa denkos 
manufacturing process 
they found that the problems began after the company began using 
a new strain of the microbe and cut in half the amount of carbon 
used to filter out impurities 
what we were able to demonstrate without a doubt was that 
there were changes that occurred that let more of it be in there 
said osterholm

hes been fixing typewriters for 
students secretaries and the literati for more than half a century 
in his dusty shop near yale university but time and technology 
have overrun manson h whitlock 
the typewriter is going the same way as the horse and buggy i 
guess it just isnt meant to be any more said whitlock 73 who 
will close his doors at the end of the month 
whitlock has worked on the typewriters of some of the countrys 
best known writers pulitzer prizewinners robert penn warren 
archibald macleish and john hersey biographer and historian 
william manchester and love story author erich segal 
before word processors and personal computers whitlock was part 
of a spring ritual at yale at the end of each school year 
hundreds of students would drop off their typewriters for storage 
and servicing over the summer 
we used to sweat it out when september got close that doesnt 
happen any more this past summer i didnt have a single request 
whitlock said 
im just so darn worn and weary with it now he said 
but closing wasnt so easy 
longtime customers have been rushing to get their machines in 
for repairs before he shuts his doors hes got a backlog of at 
least two dozen repair orders 
manchester a fan of manual typewriters has been coming to 
whitlocks since the 1950s 
ive never known anyone who works on typewriters that can 
match him in any way hes in a class by himself said 
manchester writer in residence at wesleyan university in nearby 
middletown 
whitlock started his repair business in 1934 at the age of 17 
working out of his fathers book store itself a new haven 
institution for years 
ive always liked mechanical challenges and with typewriters 
every one has its own personality and characteristics he said 
whitlock has never worked on electronic typewriters which have 
computer chips he hired an assistant to take care of those 
newfangled machines 
the work has taken its toll he can no longer fully extend his 
right hand which has spent thousands of hours clutching a 
screwdriver 
his dark cluttered store with shelves of vintage jetblack 
manual typewriters has become an anachronism on its block now a 
fashionable home of several eateries a nightclub a copying 
center an art shop and morys the storied yale dining club 
reluctantly whitlock has begun getting rid of his stock he 
recently threw away over 200 cannibalized machines that had served 
as sources of hardtoget parts and has sold most of his antiques 
dozens have also gone home with him 
but there are still some oldies in the store like the midget 
collapsible typewriter weighing less than 7 pounds used by news 
correspondents during world war i and the blueandwhite 
typewriter that his father had smithcorona make for yale students 
in the 1920s 
whitlock refused to entertain any offers to buy the business 
i dont want someone else to have the chance to spoil what 
ive done he said

long wary of saddam hussein saudi arabia 
has for the first time turned to the united states for protection 
because of the threat posed by the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
not since the early 1960s when saudi arabia responded to the 
egyptian presence in north yemen has it made such a major military 
commitment to a perceived threat 
knowledgeable saudi officials and arab diplomats based in the 
persian gulf said the saudi leadership has been fearful of saddam 
since he wrested power from ahmed hassan albakr in 1979 
most of saddams neighbors have appeased him to ensure their own 
preservation they said noting saddams decision to wage war on 
iran in 1980 
the saudis tried to placate saddam accepted his promises 
about nonaggression and exerted themselves to arrange an 
understanding between him and the kuwaiti government said one 
arab diplomat speaking on condition his name not be used 
saddam did the same thing with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak who felt insulted when he realized the iraqi leader was 
lying the saudis felt not merely insulted but also threatened 
apart from fighting for their own survival the saudis feel 
indebted to the invaded kuwaitis for harboring them in the latter 
part of the 19th century the arabian peninsula was then part of 
the ottoman empire whose leaders had denied the house of saud 
their throne in riyadh 
but on jan 15 1902 a young warrior prince called abdelaziz 
ibn abdelrahman al saud led 40 desert fighters by camel from 
kuwait to retake riyadh 
aided and encouraged by the benevolent kuwaitis of the alsabah 
family abdelaziz retook riyadh and instituted the monarchy that 
in subsequent decades spread across a vast area covering hidden 
treasures 
the advent of oil transformed both kuwait and saudi arabia 
almost simultaneously into rich countries the two ruling families 
began vying for political distinction jealousies and political 
rivalries often overshadowed their kinship 
but the shock of invasion and the flight of the ruling family 
pushed to the fore the question of survival said one arab 
diplomat the saudis had to choose one of two bitter options 
either to back down and wait for their turn to go down under the 
heavy boots of some neighboring dictator or to resort to the 
americans and defy the iraqis 
the saudis won a denunciation of iraqs invasion from its allies 
on the gulf cooperation council the council said exiled sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah was the only legitimate ruler of kuwait 
born in the summer of 1981 the gcc groups join saudi arabia 
kuwait the united arab emirates bahrain qatar and oman in a 
military and economic pact 
staterun radio and television stations along with 
governmentguided newspapers in all gcc countries condemned saddam 
as us troops headed to saudi arabia the gcc foreign ministers 
met in jiddah saudi arabia denounced the invasion and called for 
iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
during the 196267 yemen war the saudis poured massive weapons 
stocks and vast sums of money into yemen and recruited mercenaries 
to evict the egyptian armies of the late president gamal 
abdelnasser 
the net gain for the saudis was the ouster of the forces of 
revolutionary regimes from north yemen 
at one stage during the yemeni war the egyptians sent their 
warplanes raiding the southern saudi border regions of najran and 
jaizan with poison gas 
iraq is known to possess vast quantities of chemical weapons 
which saddam has said he would use if attacked

few areas of the planet are more forbidding 
for the american warrior than saudi arabia home of the worlds 
largest sand desert where the summer heat often tops 120 degrees 
and can sap even the native tribesmen 
drinkable water is scarce sand and dust can debilitate not only 
armies on the march but also aircraft supply vehicles and gun 
sightings on tanks and rifles 
add to that the threat of being attacked with poison gases you 
can neither see nor smell and you have a picture of the 
peculiarities of mobilizing on the arabian peninsula to defend the 
worlds largest oil reserves from the iraqi army 
president bush told the nation wednesday that american forces 
were landing in saudi arabia to protect the desert kingdom from a 
menacing millionman iraqi army the president said us troops 
would not initiate a conflict but would respond if attacked 
government sources said at least 5000 paratroopers from the 
82nd airborne division and other highly mobile units were en route 
or already taking positions on saudi soil backed by a swelling 
armada of naval air and seapower 
diplomatic sources in saudi arabia said 4000 marines already 
had been moved to a oilterminal saudi town close to the kuwaiti 
border those sources said the total us troop strength could 
reach 30000 while the washington post and the new york times 
quoted estimates of 50000 
iraqi president saddam hussein has vowed to crush any resistance 
to his occupation of kuwait 
the saudi desert itself is a formidable foe for the americans 
the name alone the empty quarter speaks volumes about the 
inhospitable conditions 
the heat can be defeating temperatures in august often top 120 
degrees on tuesday as the first us air and ground units readied 
for their mission it was 110 degrees in riyadh the saudi capital 
even without the physical strain of combat us soldiers in 
saudi arabia would have to drink at least six gallons of water a 
day while their bodies adjusted to the climate said an army 
planner who spoke on condition of anonymity 
deliveries of drinking water become nearly as important as 
armaments 
also on the equipment list for this deployment plenty of 
sunscreen lotion and sunglasses 
the desert environment presents these other challenges to the 
americans there 
distortion of all optical systems including binoculars and 
sighting optics on tanks by surface heat waves 
damage to weapons other vehicles and aircraft from the effects 
of blowing sand and dust the sand can grind down helicopter rotor 
blades much like the effects of sandpaper on light metal sand also 
can clog engines and air filters 
transport of troops and supplies is more risky particularly 
over the great distances in the saudi desert because of a lack of 
ground cover that gives added importance to air power and in turn 
puts a greater onus on air defenses 
besides the dangers of exhaustion and dehydration the heat also 
hurts the us troops ability to cope with the threat of a 
chemical attack by iraq according to military officers 
the use of chemical weapons is outlawed by the 1925 geneva 
protocol but iraq has admitted to using poison gas during its 
eightyear war with iran hundreds of civilians in an iraqi village 
that fell into iranian hands were burned to death in an iraqi gas 
attack in 1988 
the washington post reported wednesday that iraqi forces 
appeared to have loaded gas munitions aboard combat aircraft us 
officials would not confirm the report 
its a threat were concerned with gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told reporters wednesday 
the intelligence is somewhat ambiguous on whether the iraqis 
are preparing to use chemical weapons he said 
maj joe padilla an army spokesman at the pentagon said the 
soldiers heading to saudi arabia are equipped with gear to defend 
against a chemical attack this includes protective clothing such 
as boots gloves masks and special trousers and jackets as well 
as equipment for decontaminating clothing and gear 
they also are carrying special sensing devices including 
batteryoperated devices that sample the air for indications of 
poisonous gas as well as medicines to counteract the effects of 
exposure to chemical agents officials said 
padilla said all soldiers routinely are trained in chemical 
protective measures but most are exposed only to a simulated 
chemical attack not the real thing 
its something we train for on a regular basis he said 
the harsh climate combined with the vast nearly featureless 
open spaces of the saudi desert presents extraordinary problems for 
soldiers ability to hide from the enemy 
theres less area to camouflage yourself said maj john 
wagstaffe of the armys national training center at fort irwin 
calif in the mojave desert

the kgb has determined that a bomb that killed 
five people on a moscowbound passenger train last month was made 
by a debtridden embezzler who may have wanted to fake his own 
death a newspaper reported 
the kgb secret police identified the bombmaker as asker 
askerov 34 who investigators believe was killed when the device 
went off in his hands while he was drunk the newspaper rabochaya 
tribuna reported wednesday 
the story said not much was left of the corpse but forensic 
tests led investigators to conclude that the body was askerovs 
a youth aged 1012 who was traveling with askerov was among the 
five killed in the july 20 explosion which also injured 12 people 
the newspaper said

southern russia just south of the ukrainian border near the sea of 
azov the train had departed the day before from tshkaltubo in the 
republic of georgia 
askerov who had worked in a cooperative or private venture 
embezzled more than 636000 and ran up huge debts the newspaper

askerov of naberezhniye chelny about 550 miles east of moscow 
made the bomb himself in a hotel in the russian town of bataisk in 
the northern caucasus according to the kgb investigators 
as for motive the newspaper quoted the investigators as saying 
askerov may have wanted to fake his own death to foil his 
creditors or he might have been planning to threaten them with the 
bomb 
before the blast passengers on the train recalled seeing a man 
fitting askerovs description walking through the cars obviously 
drunk and muttering that there would be an explosion the newspaper 
said

the producer of miss saigon has canceled the 
broadway musical rather than bow to an actors equity demand that 
he dump a white actor cast in the role of a eurasian brothel owner 
the debate is no longer about the casting of miss saigon but 
the art of acting itself producer cameron mackintosh said 
wednesday in announcing the london hit will not open in new york 
next march 
equity acting on a complaint from an asian playwright and an 
asian actor on tuesday barred englishman jonathan pryce from 
recreating in new york the role he originated in the shows london 
version 
the actors union which has veto power over foreign actors for 
roles in the united states said it turned down pryce because the 
casting of a caucasian actor made up to appear asian is an affront 
to the asian community 
pryce said from london that he supports mackintosh 
what is appropriate is that the best person for the job play 
the role and i think its completely valid that i play the role 
he said if the character is half asian and half european youve 
got to drop down on one side of the fence or the other and im 
choosing to drop down on the european side 
mackintosh canceled despite 25 million in advance sales the 
largest in broadway history about 600000 had already been spent 
on the production he said 
the entire creative team and i do indeed feel totally defeated 
artistically by this turn of events and in no way do we wish to 
practice our art in the horrible atmosphere which has now been 
created by equity mackintosh said racial prejudice does seem 
to have triumphed over creative freedom 
the controversy arose after actors equity received complaints 
from playwright david henry hwang and actor bd wong about the 
casting of pryce 
it has certainly never been my intention to see a show 
canceled i simply felt that an important point had to be made and 
this has clearly been achieved hwang author of the broadway hit 
m butterfly said wednesday 
the economic fallout on broadway from the cancellation could be 
enormous 
george wachtel of the league of american theaters and producers 
said a show the size and caliber of miss saigon could have 
ticket sales in its first year of 30 million to 35 million 
salaries alone would be 200000 a week wachtel said the show 
would have employed about 182 people including 34 performers of 
asian descent the musical is a love story set during the closing 
days of the vietnam war 
mackintosh declined to take the union ban to arbitration 
i think actors equity misjudged cameron mackintosh said 
richard maltby jr colyricist of the musical they didnt 
understand that if the show wasnt done to camerons standards 
hed just as soon not have it done

the white house says it will give congress a 
formal notification of the deployment of us troops to saudi 
arabia under the war powers act which limits american involvement 
in foreign conflicts 
a spokesman for the senate foreign relations committee frank 
sieverts said wednesday that the panel was notified by the white 
house that we will be given information that we will regard as 
notification under the war powers act 
administrations traditionally do not formally acknowledge the 
act which they regard as an unconstitutional infringement by 
congress on the presidents powers as commanderinchief of the 
armed forces rather than tackle the issue headon however 
notification usually is given in a way that congress regards as 
compliance with the law 
the act requires that the president consult with congress 
formally when us forces are introduced into hostilities or into 
situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly 
indicated by the circumstances notification also is required 
when combatequipped troops are sent to the territory of any 
foreign nation 
the notification must include the presidents explanation of why 
the move is necessary and the estimated scope and duration of the 
deployment 
the law requires that the president terminate the military 
deployment within 60 days unless congress has specifically 
authorized its continuation the 60day period can be extended to 
90 days if the president certifies that such a move is an 
unavoidable military necessity 
rep lee hamilton dind said while the deployment might not 
meet the imminent hostilities test of the law at least the 
spirit of the act should be observed

from the moment that word flashed back to the 
white house that iraqi tanks were storming across the kuwait 
border president bush kept up a frenetic schedule orchestrating 
the response of america and its allies 
aides say the president made the decision to send us forces to 
the persian gulf on saturday and orders were cut for the military 
sunday night 
bush got little sleep last wednesday night as the invasion 
unfolded in kuwait 
he met with his top generals and civilian advisers thursday 
morning in the cabinet room denouncing iraqs naked aggression 
and calling for its immediate withdrawal 
then he flew to aspen colo to confer with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and give a speech to the aspen institute 
outlining plans to shrink the military by 25 percent 500000 
soldiers over the next five years 
in a concession to the crisis bush canceled plans to spend the 
night on the rocky mountain ranch of henry catto the us 
ambassador to britain and instead flew back to washington getting 
home after 2 am friday 
he spent the weekend at camp david md meeting with national 
security advisers saturday to map his response to iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
on sunday morning bush was occupied with the evacuation of 
americans from the civil strife in liberia when he arrived back 
from camp david in midafternoon he told reporters about his 
telephone conversations with saudi arabias king fahd and others 
but he was testy and one reporter who felt bushs bite received 
a handwritten note of apology from the president the next day 
bush met sunday evening with his national security advisers and 
was on the phone repeatedly with foreign leaders at least 20 
times to a dozen different presidents and prime ministers 
he dispatched defense secretary dick cheney to the middle east 
to talk with fahd egyptian president hosni mubarak and moroccos 
king hassan ii bush himself spoke several times to fahd and 
turkish president turgut ozal through whose countries ran the 
pipelines that carry 90 percent of iraqs oil to market 
on monday as the united nations security council voted 130 to 
impose stiff sanctions on iraq bush was in the oval office with 
mrs thatcher and later with nato secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner canadian prime minister brian mulroney flew in for dinner 
on tuesday bush briefed his cabinet and headed off for two 
hours to visit central intelligence agency headquarters in nearby 
langley va at one point he ducked out of the cia briefings to 
call mulroney in toronto to follow up their conversation from the 
night before 
bush resolutely fended off reporters questions as word filtered 
out that american soldiers and warplanes were on their way to saudi 
arabia 
with his wife in kennebunkport maine with their grandchildren 
bush invited national security adviser brent scowcroft and other 
senior aides to dinner tuesday night it was a quiet relaxed 
affair and the guests left bush on his own by 9 pm 
he headed into the oval office by 640 am wednesday tieless 
and relaxed when a reporter encountered him as technicians readied 
the cameras for his 9 am address to the nation 
if the president appeared somewhat tired and tonguetied at his 
subsequent news conference it was not from working late tuesday 
but just the accumulation of things over the past week an aide 
said 
by wednesday afternoon however things had calmed down enough 
for bush to quit work early and head for the white house tennis 
courts

when rep jerry costellos son wanted a break 
from college his parents never imagined he would join the army 
but nine months after he enlisted jerry f costello ii is now a 
paratrooper in the middle east his father says 
im concerned for his safety and wellbeing costello 
dill said wednesday by the same token im very proud that he 
chose to go in and defend his country 
last november after two years at lincoln college the younger 
costello 21 joined the army he was assigned to the 82nd 
airborne whose members were ordered to the middle east to stop 
iraq 
costello and his wife georgia called fort bragg nc but no 
information was released because of security concerns 
given the fact that there have been 5000 soldiers from the 
82nd airborne deployed from fort bragg theres no question in our 
minds that he is either in saudi arabia or on the way there 
costello said 
the parents saw their son over the weekend 
he fully expected that if the aggression by the iraqis 
continued and if there was a threat to saudi arabia he would go 
whenever we send ground troops in normally the 82nd airborne will 
go in either to secure airports or rescue hostages costello 
said 
he said his sons army stint is rooted in a desire for public 
service 
one of the things hes always said since he was a little boy 
was that everyone should have to serve their country in one form or 
another he believes there ought to be a draft costello said 
although his son is at risk the father believes president bush 
made the right decision 
its in the interest of the american people costello said 
im glad we have made a major commitment and not just sent a few 
troops

when congress goes back to work next month 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says hell be ready to work 
with lawmakers on a final version of the 1990 farm bill 
the house and senate have each passed a version of the fiveyear 
bill but a conference committee will have to iron out differences 
and those will have to be acceptable to the bush administration 
yeutter said wednesday 
probably the biggest obstacle will be adjusting farm program 
benefits to fit within federal budget rules which are still being 
negotiated 
there are other hurdles too yeutter told reporters he wished 
that congress had ironed out many of the problems while the bills 
were still in committees or when they came up for floor debate 
yeutter said he was hopeful sen patrick leahy dvt chairman 
of the senate agriculture committee and rep kika de la garza 
dtexas head of the house agriculture committee would do some 
streamlining when the bills go to conference 
he said he hoped the two chairmen would be willing to jettison 
undesirable provisions that may have been added for political 
purposes during development of the house and senate bills 
yeutter labeled as pure bunk absolute political year 
nonsense charges that he had shied away from the farm bill to 
spend more time on uruguay round negotiations under the 
international general agreement on tariffs and trade 
if theres anything that reflects demagoguery those kind of 
comments do he said weve been fully involved in that farm 
bill process from the very first day 
yeutter said the agriculture department sent congress a green 
book of more than 70 major recommendations on the farm bill and 
had mailed 20000 copies all over the country to promote the 
administrations plan 
further he said two senior usda officials were assigned 
fulltime to the house and senate as the farm bills developed 
some members of congress wanted to have the secretary of 
agriculture on site so that they could use him as a whipping boy in 
the congressional debate he said we had sufficient 
perspicacity to avoid that temptation 
yeutter said he probably will spend much time on capitol hill 
during the conference negotiations 
this is crunch time in the farm bill and i will certainly 
make my personal views known to all the conferees as we proceed the 
rest of the way he said 
yeutter said the administration will obviously seek a number 
of changes in the farm bill versions as they now stand but he 
declined to spell out what those would be 
however yeutter said his earlier threats of a veto 
recommendation to president bush still stand if the 1990 farm bill 
doesnt meet budget and market requirements he did not elaborate 
further 
yeutters remarks were at a telephone news conference with farm 
broadcasters and with reporters afterward he was joined at the 
usda news conference by us trade representative carla hills 
both officials decried recent moves by the european economic 
community or eec to step up export subsidies of agricultural 
products 
what the eec has done recently is a good indication of what 
theyll do if we dont get some disciplines negotiated in the 
uruguay round of talks yeutter said 
the negotiations due to conclude at the end of this year 
include us proposals for ending or phasing out tradedistorting 
practices such as export subsidies 
yeutter said recent eec subsidies on wheat shipments for 
example are appalling and are higher than the value of the 
underlying product 
weve again reached a situation where they can undersell us in 
the world markets if we price our wheat at zero he said 
the eec also has sharply boosted its export subsidies for some 
other agricultural products including dairy and beef he said 
mrs hills said the eec policies of high domestic farm supports 
which encourage surplus production and huge export subsidies to 
unload that surplus cannot continue 
at some point thats going to cause the system to crash she 
said 
asked during the news conference what might happen if the 
current round of gatt talks fail to gain the global trade 
liberalization sought by the united states mrs hills said she was 
not prepared to speculate on failure 
yeutter was leaving today for two weeks of meetings in the far 
east to talk about trade negotiations the 1990 farm bill and other 
agricultural matters of mutual interest 
in japan yeutter said he plans to give away packets of 
industrydonated us rice as a gesture to encourage relaxation of 
tokyos ban on rice imports he said this should be done if japan 
wants to have credibility as an advocate of world trade 
liberalization

one year after president bush signed landmark 
savings and loan bailout legislation the administration is trying 
to accentuate the positive about its handling of the 
stillworsening mess 
anticipating a chorus of criticism around todays anniversary of 
the bill bushs cabinet officers are emphasizing the bailouts 
benefits to depositors minimizing the rising cost to taxpayers and 
denouncing what they call the blame game played by 
congressional democrats 
the staggering size of the cost estimates understandably 
alarms taxpayers and frightens politicians into fingerpointing and 
blameavoiding the line in the political world goes since i 
dont make mistakes someone else must be making them treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady said wednesday 
overlooked in the furor he said is the fact that the financial 
institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 as it is 
formally known has so far protected 64 million deposit accounts 
averaging around 10000 each 
our job is to conduct the massive cleanup operation 
effectively and responsibly to rise above the political blame 
game and to work steadily and professionally to get the job 
done brady said 
attorney general dick thornburgh and chief white house economic 
adviser michael boskin also are defending the administration at 
other events this week 
but the record over the last year and the outlook for the next 
is decidedly mixed 
the resolution trust corp created to handle the bailout has 
closed or sold 211 insolvent thrifts and plans to deal with 126 
more this year 
but that would leave it still running 135 collapsed thrifts and 
looking ahead to an additional 230 to 550 failures among the 
remaining 2430 privatelyrun sampls 
solvent sampls lost 271 million in the first three months of 1990 
even though they are under less pressure from insolvent 
institutions desperately seeking deposits with high interest rates 
the justice department established financial institution fraud 
task forces in 27 cities and hired 118 assistant us attorneys and 
153 fbi agents but complex fraud cases take years to prosecute and 
it is too soon to tell if the added staff will make significant 
headway against a backlog of 21147 criminal referrals 
the sampl cleanup is far wider and its cost far deeper than 
envisioned on aug 9 1989 when bush signed the law in a sunny 
rose garden ceremony 
if someone would have told me the day of the bill signing that 
sampls would be the no 1 issue and the crisis would look even worse 
than it did a year ago i would have said youre crazy said 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee yet thats exactly where we are 
the cost of the bailout contributed to bushs decision to 
abandon his no new taxes pledge and led to the first serious 
congressional push since watergate to reform campaign finance laws 
the bailout also threatens to spill into the general economy as 
a credit crunch real estate developers and small businesses 
already are complaining that they cant get loans the federal 
reserve board has been forced to cut interest rates 
savings and loans barely mentioned in the 1988 presidential 
race have become a prime issue in this years congressional races 
challengers view the issue as their best chance to defeat 
incumbents especially those who received political contributions 
from the industry 
behind the firestorm is the need for more tax money to finance 
the cleanup 
the yearold act provided 50 billion to cover sampl losses and 
allowed regulators to raise additional cash by borrowing against 
the sour loans distressed real estate and other assets inherited 
from the bankrupt thrifts 
now regulators say they will need up to 100 billion for the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 that includes 30 billion to 40 
billion from taxpayers with the rest to be borrowed and repaid 
when assets of failed sampls are sold 
rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a house task force 
monitoring the bailout says taxpayers liability wont be 
contained until the resolution trust corp makes headway in selling 
failed institutions assets 
the bailout agency last week announced its great fall 
inventory clearance sale which will use an international 
satellite auction and other techniques to reduce its 165 billion 
asset portfolio by 50 billion by dec 31

ellington express carried the audience at 
lincoln center through an evening of three extended pieces by duke 
ellington and six of the songs he wrote about trains all 
brilliantly performed 
each of the train songs was from a different decade 
classical jazz at lincoln center knowing the wednesday night 
concert was special will offer a rerun thursday at alice tully 
hall 
the high point of the first piece the 1959 fourmovement 
toot suite was a long solo by tenor saxophonist todd williams 
in ready go the last movement williams who is in wynton 
marsalis band brought the audience to its feet in last years 
ellington concert with diminuendo and crescendo in blue he 
stands calmly no grimacing and escalates listeners blood 
pressure just with his steady persistent playing 
marsalis played in the band and he was a revelation as good as 
one expects him to be one doesnt expect so many styles to be done 
to perfection he went from sounding primitive and earthy in red 
carpet from toot suite to a deep growl contrasting with 
alvin batistes clarinet in bluebird of delhi from the 1966 
far east suite to a high bright use of a metal hat mute in 
happygolucky local 
alto saxophonist norris turneys romantic isfahan with the 
other instruments orchestrated to swirl around him was another of 
many special movements in the exotically beautiful far east 
suite 
act 2 started with the six train songs from choo choo of 
1924 when ellington was 25 to loco madi written at the 
university of wisconsin in madison in 1972 
david berger who transcribed the evenings music from 
recordings by the ellington band conducted for him day break 
express from 1933 is the most dazzling of all ellingtons train 
pieces he said it comes out of the night into the morning at 
100 miles an hour the band which was wonderfully rehearsed 
fresh fullbodied but never heavy rushed day break express 
past all depots 
that was followed by happygolucky local from 1946 from 
which jimmy forrest appropriated the main melody for night 
train 
final piece on the program was harlem an evocative piece 
with many miniportraits and moods obviously about a place that 
ellington loved harlem a tone poem from 1950 has a triumphal 
ending with highnote trumpets 
the audience wouldnt let the band go so they played two 
encores rockin in rhythm and things aint what they used to 
be ellington music sounds as good as it used to

during a meeting with iraqi president saddam 
hussein two months ago a group of us senators were startled to 
see the official interpreter rush into the room late quivering in 
fear 
the translator had been held up briefly in an elevator and the 
meeting had been delayed by a few moments the poor guy was 
terrified he looked like he was afraid he was going to die said 
one of those present 
fear and terror surround the 53yearold iraqi president and 
us intelligence officials and other analysts believe that climate 
could be his undoing 
everybody around him tells him what he wants to hear said 
one congressional source who has concluded that saddams invasion 
of kuwait was a severe miscalculation based on poor information and 
a failure to foresee the international fallout that would result 
but the us intelligence profile of saddam also is of a 
risktaker who is not afraid to gamble against long odds concern 
is heightened by the arab leaders profile as one without respect 
for common human values or the normal rules of diplomacy use of 
chemical weapons terrorism and hostagetaking all are 
possibilities they say 
the picture of saddam shows a man with a strange duality tough 
yet fearful inspiring fear in his own people yet also basking in 
a kind of populist veneration from many of the regions arabs 
the portrait is one of a poor orphan who rose to power through 
opportunism and brutality whose antiwestern views were shaped in 
childhood and who now commanding the worlds fourthlargest army 
is trying to deliver on his nationalist dreams 
saddam say intelligence sources and americans who have met with 
him is a ruler without finesse but with keen political instincts 
and welldefined goals 
foremost among those goals the sources say is to become the 
nasser of the 90s the dominant figure in the arab world and 
the chief controller of opec oil 
driving saddam is a devotion to arab political and cultural 
supremacy and a deepseated hatred for israel and for any western 
infringement of his independence particularly from the united 
states and great britain the two countries that have publicly 
committed troops to saudi arabias defense 
but while jealously guarding arab independence saddam also 
covets western technology and education and has sought to modernize 
his country he has been able to work well with the french who 
have supplied many of the weapons that are the basis of iraqs 
military might 
the son of peasants who was orphaned at an early age saddam 
grew up with an uncle in the iraqi town of takrit which was known 
as a hotbed of ferment against the british rule of iraq his uncle 
was arrested for participating in an uprising against the 
government 
he later joined the arab baath socialist party and became 
devoted to the cause of ridding his country of foreign influences 
his rise to power has been facilitated by execution of his 
opponents and he has used chemical weapons against iran and 
against his own kurdish minority 
there is strong evidence that saddam personally shot to death 
one of his cabinet ministers in 1982 after the official said aloud 
at a cabinet meeting that the invasion of iran had been a mistake 
unlike leaders of other moslem countries saddam appears to be a 
purely secular head of state he doesnt seem to value human 
life or to have any moral standards said one congressional 
source who has met with saddam 
he has got certain views that dont appear much amenable to a 
lot of negotiation you didnt come out thinking we can probably 
work out a deal the source said 
saddam frequently states his conviction that there is a 
conspiracy among israel the united states and britain to topple 
him and visitors are left with the impression of someone who is 
insecure saddam who has been the target of assassination 
attempts surrounds himself with military bodyguards 
he wore a gun during a meeting with sen arlen specter rpa 
in january an aide to the senator said 
he relies on terror to maintain his power he is often compared 
to adolf hitler and senate intelligence committee chairman david 
boren dokla called the iraqi security apparatus the most 
effective internal police state in the world 
iraqi citizens are afraid to speak their rulers name said 
boren for fear it will be misunderstood as criticism an offense 
that is punishable by execution 
his sense of face and dignity is extremely important said 
another us analyst he governs by ruthlessness and fear and 
awe if he is thought to lose face thats losing a good half of 
his capacity 
intelligence sources said saddam saw in the conquest of kuwait a 
chance to meet several needs and tried to calculate the risks 
before moving ahead he wanted to gain greater access to the 
persian gulf to gain new wealth to offset his countrys debt from 
its eightyear war with iran and to punish what many arabs see as 
kuwaiti arrogance 
but analysts said he probably had no idea that his invasion of 
kuwait would bring the broad condemnation trade sanctions and 
military response that have resulted 
saddam is limited in his ambitions only by threats to his own 
power at home say us analysts 
he goes for the jugular on power said one government 
analyst he understands how to get it how to wield it and how to 
keep it

in a gesture to a friendly and important 
customer mexico will send an additional 100000 barrels of oil a 
day to the united states to help ease shortages caused by the 
embargo imposed against iraq and kuwait 
the mexican commitment scheduled to last two months is 
expected to restore about 15 percent of the more than 700000 
barrels a day the united states is no longer receiving as a result 
of the embargo 
the mexican decision was announced wednesday by foreign 
secretary fernando solana who headed his countrys delegation to a 
daylong meeting of mexican and american officials convened to 
discuss crossborder issues 
saudi arabia and venezuela also announced plans wednesday to 
increase oil production 
while the mexican move could ease concerns about domestic 
supplies in this country it also will provide added cash to 
mexico with a bonus resulting from the higher prices caused by the 
persian gulf crisis 
treasury secretary nicholas brady praised the mexican action 
saying it exemplifies the spirit of relations between the two 
countries 
this aid by mexico is much appreciated at this time brady 
said solana said he felt it was necessary to meet the needs of 
an important and friendly customer 
total us oil imports average an estimated 4 million barrels a 
day solana indicated that the mexican increase would have been 
higher but that oil production in mexico is running virtually at 
capacity 
mexico exports about half of its 25 million barrel daily 
production of oil 
more than 70 mexican officials accompanied solana for 
wednesdays meeting which was held under the auspices of the 
usmexico binational commission all told more than 150 
delegates from the two countries took part in the discussions 
which are held annually and touch on a broad range of crossborder 
issues 
the meetings took place against a background of unusual harmony 
in mexicanamerican relations 
at the ceremonial opening session secretary of state james a 
baker iii joined with solana in denouncing the iraqi conquest of 
kuwait and in calling from the withdrawal of iraqi forces 
baker had been scheduled to devote a full day to the commission 
deliberations but left in late morning for turkey to deal with the 
persian gulf crisis

abortion rights advocates are not giving up their 
fight to put the american bar association back on record in favor 
of a prochoice stand on abortion despite a setback from the 
nations largest lawyers organization 
time is on our side said estelle rogers of washington 
dc a leader of the defeated abortion rights forces she said 
that as more women become lawyers and join the aba they may 
persuade the organization to reinstate a prochoice policy 
the lawyers deeply split over the issue headed home from their 
annual summer convention after the abas policymaking house of 
delegates on wednesday reversed a 6monthold policy in support of 
abortion rights 
the delegates adopted the policy in february by a margin of more 
than twotoone but repealed it on wednesday by a vote of 200188 
a resolution favoring neutrality on abortion was approved by a 
coalition of attorneys either opposed to abortion or who believed 
the association tarnished its reputation by going on record in 
support of such a controversial position 
abortion rights supporters said they are not discouraged noting 
that about 90 percent of the delegates were men 
they said male dominance is bound to erode as more women join 
the aba 
nobody here has the illusion were going to put our tails 
between our legs and go home ms rogers told reporters 
during nearly two hours of debate sally determan of washington 
dc said the repeal measure sends a message that the aba is 
abandoning its support of womens right to choose to control our 
own bodies 
but barbara howard of cincinnati ohio said she supported 
repeal because views on abortion are deeply held individual 
religious and moral convictions 
abortion is not a legal issue its a political issue a moral 
issue she said 
the house of delegates repealed its abortion rights stand at the 
urging of a larger group of lawyers the aba assembly who voted 
885836 on monday in favor of neutrality 
it is uncertain when the next fight over the issue may occur 
but the 360000member organization holds conventions every six 
months and some officials said sooner or later there is bound to be 
another clash 
the abas new president john j curtin jr of boston held a 
joint news conference after wednesdays vote with his designated 
successor sandy dalemberte of tallahassee fla to stress the 
need for healing wounds 
the two men are on opposite sides of the issue curtin urged 
repeal of the abortion rights stand dalemberte pleaded with his 
colleagues to stand fast behind the prochoice policy calling it 
an endorsement of the principle of liberty 
both men said aba members should stay in the organization and 
hash out their differences on the issue more than 1500 quit in 
protest after the prochoice policy was adopted in february

treasury secretary nicholas f brady says 
soaring oil prices need not topple the united states into a 
recession but private analysts warn that the shock endangers an 
already weak economy 
we are not contemplating recession brady said wednesday at 
the national press club 
certainly the events of last week where the price of oil has 
gone up are going to impose additional hardships on the country 
he said but i dont think we should come to judgment quickly 
the price of crude oil soared from 20 a barrel last week 
before iraq invaded kuwait to 2596 on wednesday brady said 
increasing production outside the region will eventually help 
offset a break in oil supplies from the persian gulf 
before we wring our hands and hang our heads about the price 
of oil we should remember the system adjusts he said 
however the chief economist of the influential us chamber of 
commerce declared that the nation will be unable to avoid a 
recession later this year even if the explosive situation in the 
persian gulf eases soon 
we anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual 
standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually 
contract by 14 percent in the fourth quarter richard w rahn 
told a news conference 
our forecast shows the economy continuing to experience 
negative real growth in the first quarter of 1991 and practically 
no growth in the second quarter he said 
meanwhile the federal reserve reported wednesday that economic 
growth was slackening even before iraq invaded kuwait 
in a july 27 survey of the feds 12 district banks most noted 
that the pace was slow or had slackened recently the central 
bank said in a report known as the beige book 
rahn blamed the softness on what he views as the feds misguided 
tightmoney policy aimed at controlling inflation 
brady said he and president bush want the federal reserve to 
give economic growth a boost by lowering interest rates 
the treasury secretary said strong growth was particularly 
important now as the united states responds to iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
everybody wants lower interest rates at this point in 
time in the united states economic growth is very important he 
said 
brady expressed confidence that federal reserve policymakers 
who meet on aug 21 would lower rates in response to sluggish 
growth the economy as measured by the gross national product 
grew at an anemic 15 percent annual rate in the first half of 1990 
the fact that the country is faced with slower growth will 
almost certainly produce lower interest rates brady said 
reducing the federal budget deficit also becomes more important 
as the united states tries to exert its influence in the persian 
gulf he said 
private economists however contend that large spending cuts or 
tax increases would threaten a shaky economy and brady conceded 
that deficit negotiations with congress may produce a reduction 
other than the stated 50 billion goal 
brady also said he did not know if oil companies were taking 
advantage of consumers by raising gasoline prices so quickly after 
the invasion of kuwait but he said if people are gouging 
those that are doing the gouging will hear from the president

iraqs battlehardened 1 millionman 
army powerful air force and store of missiles and chemical 
weapons are the mightiest in the arab world 
although iraq is outgunned by the air and sea power of us 
forces now being ranged against it president saddam hussein can 
count on disciplined phalanxes fresh from the 8year war with iran 
and held in rein by fear 
saddam has repeatedly purged the officer corps since he rose to 
power in the mid1970s subordinating the armed forces to the 
ruling baath party 
if they were lucky officers that didnt fall in line were 
simply retired but many were executed sometimes on trumpedup 
charges as an example to the others iraqi exiles have said 
iraqi author samir alkhalil wrote that in once instance saddam 
drew his pistol and before several other officers shot a 
commander who made a tactical retreat because he didnt have 
the heart to order his forces to mow down an iranian humanwave 
attack 
there were constant reports during the war with iran that morale 
in the ranks was flagging not surprising in view of the 
battlefield standstill that set in after iraqs initial victories 
early in the fighting 
but none of them translated into mass desertions or major 
challenges to saddams rule and the army remains its most powerful 
bastion along with the ruling party 
by middle east standards iraqs forces have an awesome armory 
comparable only with israels 
before the latest crisis he had an army of 955000 with another 
45000 in the navy and air force since invading kuwait on 
thursday saddam has announced the creation of new army divisions 
that could add at least 100000 troops 
iraqs army has 5500 battle tanks 7100 armored personnel 
carriers and 3000 towed artillery pieces according to the 
londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
iraqs 40000man air force flies 513 combat aircraft mainly 
sovietmade migs and french mirages including some armed with 
antiship exocet missiles 
in the iraniraq war saddams air force devastated irans oil 
production facilities and shipping it was a frenchmade exocet 
that crippled the us frigate uss stark killing 37 american 
sailors in an attack iraq said was a mistake 
american officers who observed skirmishes during the iraniraq 
war judged iraqi pilots to be skillful but so wary of antiaircraft 
defenses around irans big kharg island oil terminal that they 
often launched their missiles from maximum range of about 40 miles 
this the officers said burned most of the missiles fuel and 
effectively reduced their explosive power on impact 
saddams arsenal has been bolstered by a recent buildup of 
sophisticated missiles some capable of carrying chemical weapons 
which iraq used against iran and also against its own rebellious 
kurdish minority killing thousands 
in attacks on iranian cities iraq used its al hussein missile 
which has a 400mile range iraq says it has now developed missiles 
with a 750mile range 
iraq announced in december that it had launched a 48ton 
threestage rocket capable of putting a satellite into space and 
had testfired two surfacetosurface missiles with a range of 
2140 miles 
western intelligence sources confirmed the rocket launch but 
said it was less successful than at first believed they said the 
rocket only flew for two minutes reaching an altitude of 12 miles 
before plunging to earth 
nonetheless some analysts believe it put iraq on the threshold 
of ballistic missile capability 
more fears about saddams military buildup were aroused earlier 
this year when british authorities intercepted a shipment to iraq 
of what western experts said were nuclearbomb triggers 
british customs officers also stopped shipments to iraq of huge 
steel pipes that were described as parts of a giant super gun 
capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells several hundred miles 
but analysts say iraq is still years away from a nuclear 
capability 
amid growing concern in israel and the west over his growing 
arsenal saddam in may threatened to destroy half of israel with 
chemical weapons in the event of any israeli attack 
he proudly announced that iraq had manufactured advanced binary 
chemical weapons the type that the united states has recently 
been destroying as it reduces its forces in the postcold war era 
after last weeks invasion iraq threatened to turn kuwait 
into a graveyard if any outside force were to intervene 
by comparison with the rest of his arsenal saddams navy is 
puny most of it was sunk by iranian warplanes and artillery early 
in the war clogging up the shattalarab waterway 
the shattalarab was iraqs only outlet to the persian gulf 
until its conquest of kuwait 
the iraqis have five frigates and 38 patrol ships no match 
against the fleet of us warships including three aircraft 
carriers being deployed in the region

a spokesman for geraldo rivera says a tv station 
caved in to a fort worth mother of two in dropping his afternoon 
talk show 
its certainly not a surprise because the station has made 
several announcements over the past few months that it intended to 
drop the show because of pressure being brought to bear by one 
viewer said jeff erdel 
but joe bell program manager for kdfwtv said a drop in 
ratings was the main reason geraldo was not renewed 
lynda beams has campaigned for nearly three years to have the 
syndicated show moved from its afterschool time slot complaining 
the program was unsuitable for children because it sometimes dealt 
with sex and violence 
her petition drive forced some sponsors to withdraw support for 
the show 
erdel on wednesday said geraldo has changed since december 
to become the cleanest most wholesome talk show on television 
the geraldo shows have focused on such issues as education 
child welfare gun control and very relevant social issues leaving 
the subjects of necrophilia and other sexual perversions to the 
other talk shows he said

twenty years ago saudi arabia depended 
on the annual moslem pilgrimage to mecca for a significant portion 
of its revenue 
the unprecedented oil wealth accumulated since then has helped 
it build a modern state and army but balancing traditional islamic 
political and social laws with the dizzying speed of development 
has always made the royal family feel vulnerable 
the name saudi arabia is almost synonymous with oil the 
estimated 255 billion barrels of oil lying beneath its deserts 
represent a quarter of known world reserves 
the jump in prices in the 1970s from a few dollars to more than 
40 per barrel brought staggering wealth saudi citizens are 
believed to have 200 billion in western banks the government has 
about 70 billion in financial reserves down from 130 billion a 
decade ago due to low oil prices in the late 1980s 
spending has been prolific with the annual budgets at about 35 
billion defense spending in the projected 1990 budget was 138 
billion about 40 percent of the total the alsaud rulers spent 
just 100 million on defense in 1971 fearful of spawning a 
competing power 
the vast growth in the neighboring armed forces of iraq iran 
and israel as well as the value of the oil reserves changed that 
attitude 
we are a very appealing piece of cake former oil minister 
ahmed zaki yamani once said 
geographically saudi arabia is a massive desert except for the 
mountainous areas near the red sea at roughly 873000 square 
miles it is about onethird the size of the united states 
no formal census statistics exist but the population is 
estimated at about 14 million with more than 45 million 
foreigners 
the local populaton is overwhelming sunni moslem there is a 
shiite minority in the eastern oilproducing province often 
suspected of harboring sympathies for the islamic revolution in 
largely shiite iran 
islam pervades the social political legal and cultural system 
of saudi arabia it was shaped by wahhabism named after an 
18thcentury puritan he sought to maintain islam as it existed 
when the prophet mohammed founded the faith in mecca in the 7th 
century 
women and men are strictly separated in public women are 
veiled have a separate education system and are not allowed to 
drive 
the modern state dates only to 1932 when the king known in the 
west as ibn saud unified a collection of tribal provinces the 
tribe numbers about 4000 princes the few hundred directly 
involved in running the country control all significant posts 
king fahd is head of state commander of chief of the armed 
forces and prime minister his crown prince is his halfbrother 
prince abdullah head of the national guard 
next in line is defense minister prince sultan a full brother 
of fahd interior minister prince naif is a full brother as is the 
governor of riyadh prince salman 
all nine provincial governors are royals 
other prominent family members include foreign minister prince 
saud alfeisal a son of the late king feisal and nephew to fahd 
the ambassador to the united states prince bandar ibn sultan is 
son of the defense minister 
differences rarely spill into public unless on the scale of the 
early 1960s fight to get the incompetent king saud off the throne 
decisionmaking is done by consulting the princes and other 
powerful tribes each leader confers with the people through a

the smithsonian institution has agreed 
not to interfere with this seaside towns plan to use a 1 million 
bequest to convert an old school into a public library 
the dispute was over the will of franz denghausen a sculptor 
and poet who lived in rockport for 36 years he died childless in 
1987 and left 1 million to the town to replace the 
turnofthecentury carnegie library the smithsonian gets at least 
3 million more from denghausens estate 
ambiguous wording of one phrase in the will had led the 
smithsonian to argue that the town had to spend its own money for 
the renovations and use the bequest only for operating and 
maintaining the new library 
the smithsonian on friday agreed to drop its challenge 
this is really a terrific resolution to what was a thorny and 
complex problem said attorney general james shannon whose 
office supported rockports position and tried to settle the 
dispute 
because rockport cannot afford the renovations without the 
bequest the 1 million would have gone to the smithsonian if the 
museum had prevailed shannon said 
smithsonian spokeswoman madeleine jacobs said the museum simply 
wanted good relations with the town it was just getting to be a 
very very unhappy story she said 
jacobs said the smithsonian had received about 40 letters 
criticizing its position we were greatly distressed that our 
motives were misinterpreted she said

jim wells is used to snickers over his 
boots for bovines but he doesnt care so long as dairy farmers 
keep snatching them up 
thats everybodys first reaction its comical to see a cow 
wearing a boot said wells they come over make a joke about 
it then ask what the boot is for then ive got them 
the clothing store owner introduced his shoes for moos a year 
ago in eight countries including canada the soviet union and 
japan 
since then he has sold more than 15000 of the boots at 50 
apiece to help the hooves of dairy cows heal from corns ulcers 
hoof rot and other infections 
paul larkin a dairy farmer from hamilton grinned as he looked 
over the boot recently at a farm trade show in seneca falls he 
walked away with one under his arm 
its bad news when you have a cow with hoof rot or some other 
kind of foot infection im always looking for the better way and 
this looked like one larkin said 
the boot is a shorter version of a firefighters boot its made 
of fabricbacked rubber with two bright yellow straps and buckles 
it has a pebbletextured bottom for traction 
usually when a cow develops hoof trouble the animal is given 
antibiotics and the foot is bandaged and wrapped in plastic bags to 
keep the dressing dry 
plastic bags as you can imagine arent the best fit cows 
will rub them chew at them or whatever until they come off 
wells said they cant do that with the boot 
some farmers use old galoshes but they wear out easily others 
use disposable diapers 
there are 2 million dairy cows in canada and 11 million in the 
united states capturing just 1 percent of the market would mean 
sales of 65 million 
three years ago i didnt know a thing about cows but a 
couple of mennonite farmers came into my store and bought rubber 
boots for their cows he said after talking to them i 
realized there was an untapped niche there

a third of americans spend so much for housing 
they cant afford other necessities of life according to a new 
study 
the report issued wednesday by the economic policy institute a 
liberal economic research organization said 27 million households 
are unable to meet their nonshelter needs at even a minimum 
level of adequacy because of high housing costs 
those households contain 78 million people or 32 percent of the 
population the organization said 
the study said 42 percent of all who rent their homes were 
shelter poor in 1987 the last year of the study twentytwo 
percent of homeowners were in that category it said 
the studys author michael e stone professor of community 
planning at the university of massachusetts in boston used an 
index that assumes a family pays its rent or mortgage first then 
uses what income is left to pay for basic needs such as food 
clothing transportation and medical care 
he concludes that people are shelter poor if their household 
has too little left after paying the housing costs to afford the 
minimum basic necessities as defined by the federal governments 
bureau of labor statistics low budget standards 
his report contends that growth in one and twoperson households 
since 1970 has concealed an increase in housing affordability 
problems experienced by families with children 
the shelter poverty rate for one and twoperson households 
declined from 32 percent to 26 percent during the period while the 
rate for households with three or more people rose from 29 percent 
to 34 percent 
the problem is worst among the poorest onethird of households 
but also affects some middleincome households particularly 
renters the study said 
the study said the average shelter poor household faced a 
gap of 290 a month between what they were paying and could afford 
for housing

scientists claim to have found a tiny 
skull of a shrewlike mammal that lived 10 million years before the 
oldest mammal on record 
a team of paleontologists from the new mexico museum of natural 
history found the fossil near lubbock texas 
what weve done is pushed back the record of mammals worldwide 
by 10 million years said spencer lucas curator of paleontology 
at the albuquerque museum and head of the team 
scientists hope the fossil which is smaller than a dime will 
be an important link in the evolutionary chain between reptiles and 
mammals 
the skull apparently belonged to a shrewlike animal with some 
features common to reptiles and mammals and is 220 million years 
old lucas said 
thats 10 million years older than the morganucodon a british 
fossil believed to be that of the oldest mammal in the world and 
25 million years older than the previously oldest mammal fossil 
found in north america 
ten years from now this mammal will be included in mans 
understanding of the origin of mammals and the history of 
life lucas said 
university of chicago professor james hopson considered an 
authority on the link between reptiles and mammals saw the fossil 
at the american museum of natural history in new york and said it 
probably belongs to the oldest known mammal 
the area it comes from is older than beds in other parts of 
the world where early mammals came from such as in china england 
south africa and arizona hopson said wednesday 
openings in the brain casing indicate the mammal had a more 
complex inner ear and circulatory system than reptiles lucas said

kitty dukakis says if her husband had become 
president the pressure of life in the white house would have sent 
her over the edge 
i am certain the first crisis would have sent me out of 
control the wife of gov michael dukakis said in her book now 
you know excerpted in the current issue of good housekeeping and 
reported in todays boston globe 
i am equally certain that thrust into the smothering 
protective confines of the white house i would not have been able 
to seek proper help 
mrs dukakis acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction and 
blamed many of her problems on her mother jane goldberg dickson 
and on her discovery that her mother was an adopted child of 
illegitimate birth mrs dickson died in 1977 
mrs dukakis said she panicked before the new hampshire primary 
in 1988 when she realized her husband might win 
michael was good enough to be president for sure but was i 
worthy to be his partner in my despair i turned to alcohol she 
said 
mrs dukakis wrote of periods of heavy drinking during the 
campaign and after her husbands loss to george bush as well she 
said she began a typical day at 9 am by canceling her 
appointments and downing three or four ounces of straight liquor 
then id go upstairs shut the blinds unplug the phone and 
read till i passed out a process that usually took no more than 
10 minutes two and a half hours later i would wake up and repeat 
the process she said 
the book written with jane scovell is due out in the fall 
mrs dukakis said she was 18 when cousin revealed that her 
mother had been adopted 
she said she was thunderstruck when she learned that the 
couple she knew as her grandparents were her mothers adoptive 
parents and that the woman who lived with the couple as a nanny 
was actually mrs dukakis grandmother 
as far as i was concerned there had been an enormous breach 
of trust that traumatic moment haunted me for years mrs 
dukakis wrote 
within a year mrs dukakis said she started using 
amphetamines or diet pills discovered in her mothers room she 
said her mother took a lot of pills including moodaltering 
ones and also was fond of alcohol 
my mother was an extraordinary cook but she never cooked a 
meal without a glass of vermouth sitting on the counter next to 
her it was continuously filled mrs dukakis said 
in the book mrs dukakis wondered if her 20year addiction to 
pills may have been responsible for four miscarriages she had 
during her two marriages 
she said her moods changed quickly whenever she stopped using 
pills causing her to fight with her husband and children 
mrs dukakis who is taking lithium for manic depression wrote 
that when she was hospitalized for drinking rubbing alcohol last 
year she was not suicidal

the new government of president alberto 
fujimori has announced a harsh austerity plan aimed at ending 
hyperinflation and rebuilding a collapsed economy troops were 
deployed to head off any food riots 
subsidy cuts and a lifting of price controls mean peruvians will 
pay a lot more for food gasoline and basic services economy and 
prime minister juan hurtado miller said in a nationally televised 
speech wednesday night 
hurtado said a gallon of gasoline would cost 30 times more 
today the price of milk and bread were to triple while noodles 
were to cost five times what they did wednesday he said 
this is the price we must pay said hurtado this is the 
period for cleaning up and detoxifying 
the tough policy is a switch from the campaign platform of 
gradual reform that helped catapult fujimori from a virtual unknown 
at the beginning of the year to the victor in the june election 
his opponent acclaimed novelist mario vargas llosa had backed 
speedy marketoriented reform 
but fujimori who took office july 28 has been told by 
international creditors that he must control inflation before 
theyll lend him more money 
soldiers and police took up positions throughout the capital 
before hurtados speech on tuesday the government declared a 
state of emergency in lima and 10 large cities fearing food riots 
would break out after the austerity measures were announced 
mobs on tuesday looted the central markets of both lima and the 
nearby port of callao before being controlled by police and 
soldiers 
bread noodles beans sugar cooking oil and milk have all 
disappeared from store shelves in recent days this was due to both 
panicbuying by consumers and hoarding by merchants who were 
awaiting higher prices 
most stores and market stalls remained closed in the hours 
before hurtado spoke 
in his speech hurtado vowed to cut inflation to less than the 
latin american average by the end of the year he said the 
government will increase its income and spend only what it earns 
all price controls and subsidies will end he said 
the austerity measures also include emergency taxes on the 
wealthy and a restructuring of import duties hurtado said 
press reports have said the government plans to devalue perus 
inti by at least 50 percent though hurtado made no mention of such 
a move wednesday 
to soften the effects of the measures on perus millions of poor 
people the government will set up soup kitchens and directly 
subsidize water and bus services hurtado said 
fujimori has said that harsh measures are needed to stop perus 
fall into economic chaos annual inflation tops 3000 percent four 
of five people lack steady work and the economy has shrunk 20 
percent in two years 
fujimori has taken office with peru in the midst of its worst 
drought this century with up to 70 percent of the yearly 
production of many basic crops destroyed he must also deal with a 
worsening guerrilla war that in the past 10 years has claimed 
20000 victims 
tension in the capital increased in the days leading up to 
hurtado millers announcement 
the dollar doubled in value in the first three days of the week 
with its price jumping from 200000 intis to 400000 
many stores doubled their prices even before hurtado spoke 
wednesday getting a jump on the expected end of price controls 
other stores remained closed for fear that looting would break 
out most market stalls were shuttered and those were open 
displayed vastly reduced stocks 
drivers formed lines dozens of cars long to fill up before 
gasoline prices jumped 
the state of emergency declared in lima and 10 other large 
cities means that most of peru is now under special law 
a state of emergency is already in effect in half the country 
due to guerrilla activity it suspends constitutional guarantees of 
freedom of travel and assembly and allows authorities to detain 
people without hearing and search houses without warrant

25 1987 when the key index closed at 2742149

profits between spot and the futures markets before todays 
expiration of august options

interested in buying stocks said yoshio ogawa chief trader at 
nikko securities co 
he said investors had become increasingly pessimistic about the 
middle east conflict which they believe will be prolonged 
the tokyo stock market already vulnerable due to higher 
interest rates has lost 434801 points since july 20 
it is rather natural for the index to plunge said masahiro 
yagi deputy director of the capital trading department at sanwa 
bank the japanese stock market has been suffering from 
increasing interest rates and thats the fundamental problem 
yagi said the bank of japan will have to raise its discount 
rate now 525 percent at some point 
he said the nikkeis 85607point surge on wednesday was too 
much considering the middle east situation and rising interest 
rates here the market has not bottomed out he added

section estimated at 380 million shares down from wednesdays 580 
million about 5 percent of the issues remained unpriced with no 
buy orders during the day

the dollar closed at 14968 yen down 032 yen from wednesdays 
15000yen finish it opened at 14950 yen and ranged between 
14950 yen and 14990 yen

get much worse because many countries are jointly putting pressure 
on iraq said minori takeuchi a dealer with chemical bank in 
tokyo 
the un security council voted monday for a worldwide economic 
boycott of iraq the major industrial nations have already begun 
sanctions including an oil boycott 
as higher prices and other negative effects of the iraqikuwaiti 
conflict have been gradually factored into the market investors 
began selling the dollar which they had overbought as a safe haven 
in the wake of the iraqi invasion last week ms takeuchi said 
she said a declining trend in oil prices which had surged to 
about 28 a barrel earlier this week also encouraged the yens 
strength against the dollar 
traders said the slide in oil prices resulted from prospects for 
higher oil production by saudi arabia and other producers 
at about 3 pm 2 am edt brent crude oil for october 
delivery was valued at about 23602370 a barrel down from 
26002620 wednesday

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today that 
iraq would be inviting a heavy tragedy if it attacked israel 
over allegations the jewish state was sending forces to assist the 
us defense of saudi arabia 
the concern was triggered by iraqs claim on wednesday that 
camouflaged israeli planes were participating in the us military 
buildup in the persian gulf the israeli army vehemently denied 
the allegations 
media reports suggested preparations were in full gear to defend 
against a possible strike by iraq which invaded kuwait a week ago 
and is reported to have massed 100000 troops on the saudi border 
whoever plots to attack israel must know that israel has the 
capability will and readiness to defend its security absolutely 
and whoever tries to hurt it is liable to bring on himself a heavy 
tragedy shamir said on israel radio 
he assured arab nations israel has no intentions whatsoever to 
attack any of its neighbors 
but he added israels defense and security forces are aware 
and alert and devoting their efforts to prevent any danger to the 
people and state 
defense minister moshe arens and other leaders also said they 
took the iraqi threat seriously newspaper editorials called for 
distribution of gas masks to defend against a possible assault by 
chemical weapons 
shamir also ordered cabinet ministers traveling abroad to 
prepare to return officials in his office said 
since iraq invaded kuwait israelis have remained glued to their 
radios hoping that their ally the united states would rein in 
saddams aggression 
jerusalem and baghdad traded threats in april when saddam said 
he would torch half of israel with chemical weapons if attacked by 
the jewish state 
the iraqi statement wednesday was widely seen as a possible 
pretext for such an attack 
israeli warplanes were painted with american colors and 
israeli pilots were provided with american identity papers in order 
to avoid iraqs reaction against israel said a statement 
broadcast on baghdad radio 
we hereby warn that we will answer back to any aggressive 
act by israel as we would to any such act by the united states 
the iraqi statement added 
israel today was faced with the delicate dilemma of warding off 
iraqs threats while trying to refrain from involvement in the 
persian gulf conflict analysts said there was concern that any 
israeli intervention could also run the risk of israel getting into 
a war with iraqs arab allies 
on wednesday shamir expressed support for the us move into 
saudi arabia as a show of force against iraq whose 1millionman 
army poses the most dangerous arab threat to israel 
but officials also said the united states had not asked israel 
to commit troops to the persian gulf and that such a request was 
not expected 
the army has decided in principle to distribute gas masks to the 
entire population over the next six months army officials said 
israelis increasingly anxious over iraqs military expansion had 
already begun stockpiling canned goods in their attics and looking 
for gas masks to purchase 
israeli generals held an emergency meeting last weekend and 
decided to step up the distribution of gas masks nationwide but 
some israelis are too jittery to wait for the armyissued equipment

the persian gulf 
gold prices rose more than 350 an ounce in london but were

fighting he said the dollar could jump several pfennigs if 
hostilities are reported 
in milan one trader said the dollar has completely lost its 
role as a safe haven currency 
he added that the us currency is poised to move lower in the 
near term because of soft us interest rates but in the longer 
term he said there will be physical demand for dollars to pay 
for higher oil prices and this will push the dollar back up 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 032 yen to a closing 14968 yen later in london 
it was quoted at a lower rate of 14960 yen

two soviet cosmonauts returned safely to earth 
today ending a sixmonth mission during which they grew 
milliondollar crystals for industry and survived a nearfatal 
space walk trying to repair damage on their capsule 
the soyuz tm9 capsule carrying cosmonauts anatoly solovyev and 
alexander balandin landed near the town on arkalyk on the central 
asian steppes the official tass news agency reported 
the landing one minute ahead of schedule was not shown live on 
soviet television but at the midday news showed pictures of the 
cosmonauts waving goodbye to their replacement crew aboard the 
orbiting mir space station 
solovyev and balandin were launched into space feb 11 in what 
was billed as the first manned mission in the 33year history of 
the soviet space program to turn a multimilliondollar profit 
their hundreds of experiments included photographing 84 million 
square miles of the earths surface and growing 23 pure crystals 
for use in semiconductors and computer chips 
each crystal is worth about 1 million tass said 
the cosmonauts also made two space walks last month the first 
to repair damage caused to the spacecraft on takeoff 
on july 17 they spent seven hours repairing torn thermal 
insulation surrounding the soyuz capsule which would bring them 
back to earth the repairs took longer than expected and soviet 
media reported the two cosmonauts could have died because their 
oxygen was running so low 
their spacesuits soaked with perspiration from the exertion 
they were forced to leave the capsules reentry hatch slightly 
ajar and return to the space station through an emergency porthole 
they left behind handrails attached to the exterior of the capsule 
a second shorter space walk on july 26 was needed to close the 
hatch and retrieve the handrails 
tass quoted ground control officials as saying solovyev and 
balandin had opened the hatch before the airlock was completely 
depressurized and it swung outward with such force that a key joint 
was damaged 
it was the latest in a series of problems for the soviet manned 
space program which for decades had been a source of intense 
national pride 
for the past two years the program has been plagued by docking 
equipment malfunctions human error and budget cuts 
the replacement crew of gennady manakov and gennady strekalov 
docked with the mir on friday two days after blasting off from the 
baikanor space center in kazakhstan they will remain in space 
until dec 10 conducting an estimated 250 experiments including 
the production of more crystals 
under president mikhail s gorbachev pressure has grown on the 
space program to prove its worth in a shortageplagued society 
some soviet lawmakers have raised the once taboo topic of cutting 
the space budget since many soviet people dont have decent housing 
or enough to eat 
manakov and strekalov will return to earth with a paying 
customer a japanese cosmonaut who will have been brought to mir on 
dec 2 by their replacement crew 
two employees of the tokyo broadcasting system are vying for the 
seat television camerawoman ryoko kikuchi and former washington 
bureau chief toyhiro akiyama 
future flights in 1992 will carry british austrian west 
german french and spanish passengers

air raid sirens wailed in amman today a 
government security official said israeli jets had violated 
jordanian air space but the official news agency said it was an 
unannounced test 
the official who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said he had no immediate additional information 
the siren warning came at 115 pm as the streets of the 
capital were jammed with traffic during the lunchtime break the 
petra news agency report said the sirens also sounded in the cities 
of irbid and zurka 
in the capital people rushed to balconies and into the streets 
to scan the skies for a few minutes they returned to whatever they 
were doing when they saw nothing 
despite the sirens there was no apparent move by citizens to 
rush to air raid shelters 
amman is only 30 miles from the israeli border only a few 
seconds flying time for a warplane 
the warning added to the tension created by the weeklong crisis 
that began when iraq invaded and annexed kuwait 
there is fear that any clash between us troops now being 
deployed in saudi arabia and iraqi troops just across the border in 
kuwait could spark a full blown middle east war 
israeli forces were on alert today israel has said previously 
that it would move into jordan if iraqi forces crossed the 
iraqijordanian frontier 
concern markedly following king husseins warning late wednesday 
that an arab summit scheduled to start in cairo later today was 
the last chance to avert the outbreak of war

the us coast guard began to cut back crews 
today as the cleanup of a 700000gallon oil spill in galveston bay 
nears an end 
coast guard chief petty officer rich muller said salvage crews 
were sopping up remaining pockets of sludge near houston point in 
the bays northernmost part but coast guard officials believe the 
3 million cleanup should be complete by friday 
we still have some people up there muller said of the 
houston point area that operation will be shutting down just 
because there isnt that much left to do 
other crews meanwhile continue to take apart a battered barge 
that remained outside the houston ship channel 
crews began cutting the barge one of two ruptured in a july 28 
collision with a greek tanker with blow torches on wednesday so 
that the pieces can be moved to a galveston scrap yard 
once the barge is severed the coast guard plans to reopen the 
ship channel to twoway deep draft ship traffic for the first time 
since the accident 
the greek tanker shinoussa collided with two of three barges 
being towed by the tugboat chandy n through the ship channel in 
the bay the tanker although damaged lost none of its cargo of 
jet fuel because of a double hull but the two barges spewed 
700000 gallons of a heavy catfeed oil used in petroleum refining 
the accident near redfish island created a slick that at one 
time measured 17 miles in length and threatened most of the 
sensitive wildlife areas of the bay the texas department of health

a salesman says he developed suicidal impulses 
while taking the antidepression drug prozac and he once 
intentionally smashed his car into a truck 
in a lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court ralph 
langer of suburban chicago is seeking more than 1 million in 
damages from the drug manufacturer eli lilly amp co of 
indianapolis and its subsidiary dista products co 
langer contends in the lawsuit that eli lilly has failed to warn 
doctors about what the suit said is a link between prozac and 
suicidal or aggressive behavior 
an eli lilly spokeswoman refused to comment on the lawsuit but 
defended the drug as safe 
the us food and drug administration has no evidence of the 
drug being linked to specific deaths and still considers the drug 
safe spokeswoman eva kemper said in a telephone interview from 
maryland 
langer contends he began experiencing suicidal and 
selfdestructive impulses after his therapist prescribed prozac in 
september 1987 to treat his depression 
other lawsuits also have been filed involving the drug 
a new york woman sued lilly last month in addition the widows 
of three victims of a kentucky man who murdered eight people before 
shooting himself are each suing the pharmaceuticals company for 50 
million saying the aggression was linked to prozac 
langers lawsuit says that at one point while on the drug he 
intentionally drove his car at high speed into the rear of a truck 
he suffered broken bones and bruises in the crash 
his attorney aron d robinson of chicago said his client had 
never had suicidal impulses before being prescribed prozac 
he said this was the pattern in other prozac cases studied by 
his law firm 
the aggressive or suicidal behavior began when the person 
first began taking the drug and ended when the person was taken off 
the drug he said 
lilly spokeswoman mari abbott said the drug was tested on more 
than 11000 people before it was marketed it has been prescribed 
for more than 2 million patients without evidence that it was 
linked to suicidal impulses ms abbott said 
all of the data we have does not show a causeandeffect 
relationship between our product and suicidal thoughts and acts 
she said the safety and effectiveness of this product has been 
tested

the superintendent of cook county schools 
continued to deposit millions of dollars in state and federal funds 
into accounts that pay no interest after promising to stop a 
newpaper reported today 
superintendent richard martwick had made the pledge after a 
lawsuit in 1985 and criticism from prior state audits according to 
todays chicago tribune 
but a partially complete audit for 1989 shows martwick continued 
putting the money into the noninterest accounts said spokesman 
lee milner of the state board of education 
more than 135 billion went into the accounts costing 
taxpayers as much as 400000 a year in lost interest the tribune

banks general counsel william dunn declined to comment on the 
deposits 
state officials say the average daily balance in the account 
martwick keeps at amalgamated trust and savings bank is 65 
million to 7 million 
state audits in 1987 and 1988 revealed the practice after the 
1988 audit martwicks office said the money would be invested in 
an interestbearing account 
in the 1985 lawsuit four school districts filed a classaction 
suit in us district court charging the noninterest deposits 
violated state and federal laws and deprived school districts 
access to money to which they were entitled the suit is still 
pending 
last year cook county clerk stanley kusper deposited 68 
million in a noninterest account at amalgamated 
amalgamated has been the depository of state government funds 
and has made loans to prominent politicians including gov james

is two months pregnant with their first child york said 
president bush on wednesday said us troops were sent to saudi 
arabia to deter an attack from iraq also wednesday iraq annexed 
kuwait 
poor telephone connections and confusion in baghdad have made 
contact difficult if not impossible since the invasion some 
americans said they heard about relatives through employers or the 
state department 
thirtyeight americans remain in a baghdad hotel from which they 
are not allowed to leave state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said wednesday the hotel is under guard but the americans

kuwait the task force is tracking 1468 people in kuwait and iraq

us troops to saudi arabia has increased her fears for the safety 
of her son and his family trapped in kuwait 
im dreadfully upset today more so than i was up to now 
she said wednesday she said the state department has told her that 
her son paul pawlowski his wife ingrid and their 6yearold 
daughter tess are safe

leave the country boucher said we are certainly working to 
see that all americans including these people at the rashid hotel 
are free to go and are able to leave the country

residents keep their windows shut and an 
inn has closed as the stench from thousands of rotting fish fills 
the air 
in the waters of quahog bay maines latest menhaden kill has 
suffocated thousands of lobsters crabs snails and other sea life 
the eels are even dead and theyre hard to kill said linda 
webber who owns webber and sons lobster co with her husband in 
this seacoast town of 2500 about 15 miles from portland webber 
said the company has lost about 10000 worth of lobsters 
robert waddle owner of quahog lobster inc the other lobster 
dealer at quahog bay said he has lost at least that much lobsters 
generally sell for less than 4 a pound in maine this time of year 
wholesalers commonly keep the crustaceans in holding pens in bays 
or harbors 
the overall loss is tremendous not just my loss but 
everyones loss because everything in the bays been killed 
waddle said 
vast schools of menhaden or pogies first were chased into 
quahog bay by feeding bluefish about a month ago waddle said 
wednesday the schools severely depleted the oxygen in the water 
killing lobsters and other aquatic life 
dead pogies can be seen floating in clumps throughout the cove 
and are caked onto rocks along the shore 
its been like this for almost a month but the past few days 
have been unbearable said marianne lavine who has kept a summer 
home at quahog bay for 20 years weve had the doors and windows 
closed for three days now it irritates your throat and nose its 
disgusting 
the smell is so bad that a bedandbreakfast on the bay closed 
one of the inns owners said he and his wife will not reopen until 
the odor is gone 
fish kills have happened along maines coast several times in 
recent years but this is certainly a large dieoff said 
marshall murphy spokesman for the state department of marine 
resources 
pogies are oily fish that can weigh up to two pounds and are 
used for lobster bait fertilizer and cat food 
an estimated 3000 pounds of pogies or 50 bushels washed 
ashore in belfast bay in september 1987 in august 1985 about 
8000 bushels of pogies washed into a cove in southport and 
officials brought in a huge vacuum cleaner to suck the rotting fish 
out of the water in 1984 about 25000 menhaden and 500 bluefish 
died in the kennebec river also from oxygen deprivation 
murphy said the state wont attempt a cleanup in quahog bay he 
said past cleanups have proved to be very expensive and less than 
totally successful 
at this point our decision is to allow nature to continue the 
decomposition process of the menhaden he said it takes about 10 
days for the fish to decompose 
there is no river is at the head of the bay to flush the cove 
so only winds and tides may help 
a northerly wind last week carried some of the pogies away but 
a southwesterly wind this week carried the dead fish back into the 
bay murphy said

kingdom so demands 
he stressed that inviting western and arab forces to the kingdom 
was not directed against anyone but a purely defensive measure

saudikuwaiti border and to help saudi arabia in its duty to defend 
its territory 
the iraqis massed large numbers of troops on the border of the 
kingdom the king said faced with this bitter reality and out

nation has known in its modern history and demanded a withdrawal 
of iraqi troops 
saudia arabia calls for a return of things as they were before 
the iraqi invasion and that the ruling family be allowed to be 
reinstated he said in reference to the exiled alsabah family 
the invasion has caused kuwaitis to become refugees to 
suffer the kingdom of saudia arabia is very upset at this attack 
this invasion from iraq fahd added

egypt and morocco have refused to join the us and other 
western forces arab leaders were meeting in cairo in a lastditch

39yearold man who claims in a federal lawsuit that the music 
television network stole his copyrighted idea for a rock n roll 
game show

its parent company viacom inc over the networks 3yearold game 
show remote control and a 1990 show called turn it up

of a song 
he said he went to new york in 1986 to discuss the idea with mtv

earlier he was asked by reporters if iraq had been preparing 
for chemical warfare since its invasion of kuwait last week 
khazreji said that no special preparations had been made but 
acknowledged that baghdad has chemical arms 
president bush has promised severe retaliation if president 
saddam hussein used chemical weapons against american soldiers 
thousands of american troops have arrived in saudi arabi to

weapons in the event of an israeli attack 
as we have declared for the last couple of months we have said

the case of the central park jogger was sent to 
a jury after the prosecutor reminded jurors of the brutal gang rape 
and beating endured by the victim 
imagine what went through the mind of the jogger as the 
attackers surrounded her and started ripping off her clothes 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer said in her fourhour 
summation wednesday 
antron mccray yusef salaam and raymond santana had their fun 
in central park on april 19 1989 she said referring to the 
teenage defendants today they have no one to blame for their 
predicament but themselves they showed no sympathy or mercy 
the only fair and just verdict is guilty 
justice thomas galligan instructed the jurors who began 
deliberating this morning 
salaam 16 santana 15 and mccray 16 are charged in 
manhattans state supreme court with attempted murder rape sexual 
abuse riot assault and robbery in attacks on the woman and on two 
male joggers during a gang rampage 
about 10 minutes into lederers summation a row of family and 
supporters of the defendants walked out of the courtroom together 
without speaking 
the defendants dragged her into the cover of darkness about 
78 feet into the woods from the area where she took her nightly 
run and there beat and raped her lederer said 
these defendants wanted her to die the prosecutor said 
and they took the steps to make that happen these defendants had 
every reason for not wanting her to survive 
the woman lost threefourths of her blood in the ordeal 
the jogger is back at work as a vice president at salomon 
brothers investment bankers but she testified that she still 
suffers from impaired sight balance and smell as a result of the 
attack 
the fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a 
miracle lederer said 
defense lawyers summed up tuesday with one attorney suggesting 
the victim was not gangraped and another accusing detectives of 
lying about how incriminating statements were obtained from the 
three defendants those statements are the prosecutions chief 
evidence 
referring to salaams contention that he was tricked into 
confessing the crime lederer noted salaams confidence when he 
testified 
this is not a person who is manipulated this not a person who 
has words put in his mouth lederer said 
she called salaams claim that he entered the park with a gang 
of youths but spent his time there wandering around by himself 
absolutely incredible 
lederer reminded the jury that in mccrays videotaped statement 
the youth freely offered information and corrected details the 
police were trying to pin down

iran which fought a brutal eightyear 
war with iraq today said that tehran will not tolerate baghdads 
annexation of kuwait the islamic republic news agency reported 
a foreign ministry statement on irna condemned the iraqi 
takeover of its small oilrich neighbor and said the incursion 
has made the persian gulf region the middle east and the islamic 
world face an increasing crisis making the future prospects for 
this sensitive part of the world more ambiguous 
the irna report monitored in nicosia said the statement added 
that as the major power of the persian gulf region iran will not 
tolerate any alteration of the political geography of the region 
iraq which invaded kuwait on aug 2 annexed it on wednesday 
the statement called for an immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait and said the situation 
must come to an end as soon as possible the news agency said 
irna quoted an iranian newspaper as saying today that washington 
had failed by sending troops to defend saudi arabia to adopt a 
clearcut stand on baghdads aggression which amounted to a 
tacit approval of the iraqi invasion or at last acceptance of 
the invasion as a tolerable act 
the radical farsilanguage jomhuri islami added that the united 
states was looking to use president saddam hussein of iraq as a 
scarecrow in the region to scare off antiamerican islamic 
movements in the region 
the newspaper was skeptical that international embargoes aimed 
at strangling the iraqi economy and forcing saddam to retreat from 
kuwait would work therefore regional regimes and sheiks of the 
southern persian gulf in particular must seriously contemplate 
their future the paper said 
the more moderate englishlanguage tehran times called the 
international response to the invasion acceptable but added 
that only drastic action can adequately respond to the actions of 
baghdads adventurism 
the newspaper close to the foreign ministry which is known to 
favor better relations with the united states said such drastic 
action should necessarily come from the united states 
the times editorial was the first to encourage american military 
action against iraq the iranians had up until now urged a regional 
solution to the problem and vehemently condemned any foreign 
intervention 
washington has disclosed it is seeking help from iran and syria 
two countries the united states has previously denounced for 
encouraging terrorism in forcing an iraqi withdrawal 
the tehran times did stress however that after the end of 
the crisis such a force should leave the region and leave the 
responsibility of peace and security of the region to the regional 
countries 
but president hashemi rafsanjanis prowestern inclinations 
contrast sharply with those of his hardline vehemently 
antiamerican opponents rafsanjanis pragmatic government has been 
locked in an increasing power struggle with radicals led by former 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
rafsanjanis efforts at improving ties with the west have been 
repeatedly frustrated by the hardliners

israel today launched the first test of a new 
usfinanced missile developed to combat shortrange ballistic 
missiles and state radio called it a direct response to an iraqi 
threat a day earlier 
the radio report said the missile was launched at 340 pm 
840 am edt at an undisclosed location it left a short trail 
of fire and underneath a small ring of smoke said one of the 
radios reporters 
israel radio said the launch was a direct response to iraqi 
president saddam husseins threat on wednesday to launch a missile 
attack on israel saddam made the threat after alleging that 
israeli warplanes had been painted with american colors in 
preparation for an attack on iraq 
prime minister yitzhak shamir today said saddam invited a 
heavy tragedy if he launched such a strike 
citing foreign reports israel radio said the missile is 12 
yards long has a range of 42 miles and can fly up to 18 miles 
overhead 
todays missile launching was attended by officials from israel 
aircraft industries which is developing the arrow and by american 
representatives the report said 
industry and d13 egg yolks and organ meat are the foods highest 
in cholesterol 
9 false while consuming only 20 percent of calories as fat is 
perfectly healthful the japanese do it and suffer less heart 
disease than americans it is a hard change to implement for that 
reason you are advised to aim for a diet that contains 30 percent 
calories as fat presently the fat intake of the average american 
is closer to 40 percent of total calories 
10 false a few years ago the theory that low cholesterol level 
may predispose the body to developing cancer gained momentum in a 
few scientific and lay circles it now appears that the 
interpretation of the data was complicated by the fact that low 
blood cholesterol often results from rather than predicts cancer 
probably due to weight loss and other outcomes of cancer

two men were charged with conspiring to 
murder a neighbor they thought was a witch authorities say 
karina singer 61 said she had no idea some of her neighbors 
wrongly suspected she was a witch until two armed men were arrested 
on her farm last week 
im stunned my neighbors could believe these things when weve 
lived here 21 years mrs singer said and that instead of 
calling me to find out if they were true circulating them around 
until they became like an atomic blast mushrooming out of the 
prairie 
jim reppen who works for a tire service company and farmer 
dean unterseher were charged with conspiracy to commit murder the 
charge carries a possible life term both were freed on 5000 bond 
after their arrests by police officers acting on a tip 
mercer county states attorney alan dupplier said rumors about 
mrs singer have circulated in the county for years this summer 
they also included two visiting friends he said 
there have been rumors flying around mercer county that these 
three ladies are witches and theyre sacrificing animals and doing 
general culttype of things dupplier said 
the two arrested men he said apparently decided they were 
going to go down and eliminate the problem 
a search of the singer farm uncovered nothing witchlike 
dupplier said 
mrs singer said she did not know the two men who authorities 
said hatched the alleged murder plot at a bar in nearby hazen 
since the arrests neighbors have told mrs singer of hearing 
stories of firelight rites at the farm 
what really has been going on mrs singer said was a plan she 
developed with her late husband john to turn the farm into a 
place of beauty and peace that friends could visit for extended 
vacations her husband died of cancer in april 
last fall the couple laid down two indian medicine wheels 
or rock configurations for the healing of the land during the 
spring and summer several old frame buildings were torn down a 
pit was burned in the yard and a guest house was erected 
but rumors circulated that the guest house was a church and that 
visitors were seen dancing around a pit fire 
the dancers mrs singer said actually were workers from a 
hazen construction company that tore down the buildings and put out 
grass fires started by sparks from the pit 
all in all she said it was probably too fast a change for 
the neighbors

a bill awaiting president bushs signature 
would reverse a recent law denying unemployment benefits to 
temporary census workers when their jobs end 
congress approved the provision providing the benefits to census 
workers when it passed an unrelated trade bill last week in its 
rush toward august recess the house approved the bill early 
saturday following senate approval 
the provision had been added by house and senate conferees on 
the trade bill as a way to reverse the exemption from jobless 
benefits that congress adopted as a costcutting move when it 
passed an appropriations bill in may 
it was intended to save an estimated 70 million set aside for 
unemployment claims once the census workers lose their jobs 
the law had set an april 20 cutoff for temporary census workers 
to receive job credit toward later unemployment compensation work 
after that date would not count when they eventually apply for 
unemployment benefits 
repeal of the provision had been sought by rep tom downey 
dny who said the census workers were being unfairly singled out 
as a way to save money

of fires in parched oregon idaho and utah but scattered rain was 
expected to cool off some areas next week 
four major forest fires in eastern oregon including one that 
scorched 80000 acres and forced evacuations continued to grow 
today and lightning sparked new blazes in the southwestern corner 
of the state 
in central idaho crews reined in a forest fire at frank 
churchriver of no return wilderness area on wednesday evening but 
a fire in southern idaho advanced into the sawtooth national 
forest another was fanned by strong winds through sagebrush north 
of shoshone and timberland further north was hit by new 
lightningcaused fires 
the most dangerous fire in oregon was the pine springs 
combination of fires including a blaze which grew to about 80000 
acres overnight fueled by winds up to 60 mph 
it was within three miles today of the towns of burns and hines 
in southeast oregon and about 20 people were evacuated overnight 
from riley and nearby ranches after flames crept to the edge of 
town said greg thayer a spokesman for the us forest service 
they returned after the fire reversed course and no buildings

the movement of tens of thousands of us 
soldiers sailors and airmen to saudi arabia will take days to 
accomplish and may last for months defense secretary dick cheney 
says 
cheney described the deployment as a major commitment of us 
forces that included elements of the 82nd airborne division and 
f15 fighter jets 
the breakthrough that paved the way for their deployment came 
during a crucial twohour session between king fahd and cheney in 
jiddah on monday night 
the discussion was a significant moment cheney recalled 
to reporters wednesday 
at president bushs behest cheney had flown to saudi arabia 
armed with graphic descriptions provided by us intelligence 
agencies of iraqs blitzkrieg drive through kuwait and its 
buildup of troops tanks artillery and surfacetosurface missiles 
the saudis had rejected many us requests to base american 
forces in the strategic country the source for much of the worlds 
oil 
however this time it had become abundantly clear that the 
iraqis had in fact committed an act of infamy in their 
aggression against kuwait having told the saudis they had no 
intention to invade they did in fact invade cheney said 
the message was that preparation was the best way to deter 
further aggression and that if us military assistance was 
requested we would stay only as long as the saudis wanted us to 
said a senior pentagon official familiar with the talks 
the king reminisced about his familys long ties with the united 
states but it was the realization of iraqs naked aggression 
coupled with bushs personal diplomacy and saudi arabias historic 
ties to the united states that convinced the royal ruler to 
request us military assistance cheney said 
military officials said wednesday that us warplanes and combat 
troops backed by an armada of navy ships had taken up defensive 
positions in and near saudi arabia some air national guard members 
in new york new jersey tennessee west virginia and wisconsin 
were called up for active duty 
cheney declined to provide a specific number of the troops 
involved citing security concerns a senior military official in 
the pentagon said the deployment was openended and the numbers 
of troops airmen and sailors deployed would depend on saddams 
reaction 
some mideast diplomatic sources put the troop level at about 
30000 and several other estimates ranged even higher on the first 
day of deployment at least 5000 ground troops were being 
dispatched officials said backed by an armada of air and 
seapower another 4000 marines were moved close to the 
saudikuwait border diplomatic sources said 
nearly 40 warships and escort vessels some armed with 
sophisticated cruise missiles programmed to destroy specific iraqi 
targets will be in mideast waters by next week the sources said 
squadrons of f15 jet fighters from langley air force base in 
virginia were flown to the region as were the 82nd airbornes 
ready brigade aboard huge transport planes 
fb111 fighterbombers were in position at nato bases in turkey 
and b52 bombersthat had arrived for longplanned exercises on the 
indian ocean island of diego garcia were held in position 
rep john spratt dsc said a10 airtoground attack jets 
from myrtle beach air force base sc had left for saudi arabia 
unlike the f15 an air superiority fighter designed to tangle 
with other planes the a10 was designed to attack ground targets 
the aircraft carriers independence and eisenhower were being 
moved into position to do serious damage to iraqs strategic sites 
pentagon sources said it would take several days for the troops 
to converge on saudi arabia but that the initial units would be in 
place by early today 
the length of their stay remains a question cheney said 
the situation is uncertain we dont know how long it will 
last we dont know when it will end he said 
we do not know how events will unfold over the next few 
months but obviously the president had made it very clear that 
this is a part of the world thats of absolute strategic 
significance to the united states and we are prepared to use us 
military forces if necessary to protect our interests and those 
of our friends in the area cheney said

the decision followed a daylong parliamentary debate in which 
the opposition social democrats made clear they would not let kohl 
have the twothirds majority needed for a necessary constitutional 
change 
kohl had originally planned elections for an allgerman 
parliament on dec 2 but last week east german prime minister 
lothar de maiziere after consultations with kohl said the date of 
the elections and of formal german unity would be moved up to oct 
14 
it was not immediately clear what date kohl has decided on for 
formal german unity the opposition social democrats want it to 
occur on sept 15 with elections on dec 2 
during a stormy bundestag debate lawmakers from kohls 
governing coalition and his rivals charged each other with slowing 
up the unity process and sowing uncertainty among the beleaguered 
east german populace 
otto lambsdorff head of the free democrats junior partner in 
kohls coalition government accused the social democrats of 
sinning against the people of the ddr east germany 
he maintained that holding elections in october rather than 
december would improve the psychological situation in east 
germany and thereby create better frameworks for the east german 
economy 
herta daeublergmelin a highranking social democrat accused 
kohls christian democrats of sowing uncertainty among east 
germans 
during the west german parliamentary session today lawmakers 
postponed a key vote regulating the allgerman election treaty the 
treaty lays the groundwork for the first pangerman elections since 
1933 
on wednesday evening east german lawmakers called for 
allgerman elections and unification on oct 14 but that vote does 
little good without approval of a new election treaty 
east germany is suffering from fastrising unemployment while it 
shifts from 40 years of communism inefficient businesses exposed 
to the free market have begun to fail or lay off excess workers 
economic unification began last month with east germany trading 
in its currency for west german marks but lower east german wages 
have not kept up with the cost of living and east germans have 
suffered from a loss of communist subsidies

secretary of state james a baker iii 
assured turkey today that it would receive full support from nato 
if it suffers for taking a forthright stand against iraq 
baker and turkish officials discussed ways in which the two 
countries could cooperate to deter iraqi agression 
however he steered around the issue of whether the united 
states would be able to use turkish military bases as staging areas 
for any operations in the gulf 
i dont plan to get into the specifics of any discussions we 
might or might not have had on matters of defense cooperation 
baker told reporters before departing for brussels belgium 
he said they also discussed the economic hardships turkey will 
face in the loss of oil revenue by cutting off pipelines from iraq 
the ousted kuwaiti leaders have offered to do what they can to 
minimize those financial loses baker said 
it goes without saying that turkey is strategically very 
important baker said earlier 
he assured the turks they would have the support of the nato 
alliance of which turkey is a member 
earlier baker disclosed that he dispatched john h kelly the 
assistant secretary of state for the near east to damascus syria 
to see if we can coordinate with the syrians on collective 
efforts regarding iraqi aggression 
kelly also will go to saudi arabia where thousands of american 
troops are being deployed to protect the oilfields for talks with 
saudi officials and with kuwaiti leaders who took sanctuary there 
after iraq overran their small country 
baker said before his meetings with turkish officials that he 
had received new assurances of soviet support in enforcing the 
economic boycott of iraq ordered by the un security council 
baker spoke for about a half hour by telephone from his us air 
force jetliner with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze their 
third conversation in two days and then told reporters 
they continue to support enforcement of the un resolution 
we can look toward continued soviet cooperation to carry out the 
resolution 
specifically baker said moscow had dispatched naval forces to 
the persian gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce 
the sanctions approved unanimously monday by the security council 
the soviets view this aggression in the same way that we do 
baker said 
on friday he will meet in brussels with nikolai afanasyevsky 
the soviet ambassador to belgium and to nato 
bakers main purpose for going to nato headquarters is to plot 
with the 15 allied foreign ministers their possible participation 
in military deployments to enforce the economic boycott of iraq 
voted unanimously monday by the un security council 
despite some reservations expressed privately by moscow about 
the economic boycott of iraq and public disquiet about mounting a 
military blockade the cooperation between washington and moscow is 
unprecedented in recent history 
it is especially striking since iraq has received a sizable 
portion of its weapons from moscow officials said the kremlin 
agreed to suspend further deliveries without hesitation 
bakers ninehour visit to ankara underscored both us 
gratitude for the actions turkey has taken against iraq and the 
additional demands that may be placed on natos only predominantly 
moslem member 
risking commerce with iraq valued at 3 billion a year turkey 
effectively ordered a shutdown tuesday of iraqi oil pipelines by 
banning ships from loading iraqi crude at offshore terminals in the 
eastern mediterranean 
the pipelines carried more half of iraqs total exports from its 
northern fields turkey also banned trade with iraq and froze 25 
million in iraqi and kuwaiti assets 
baker has stressed turkeys strategic situation besides sharing 
a border with iraq there is concern in ankara for an estimated 
60000 turkish construction workers in iraq 
it is important that we make clear to them that they will 
continue to enjoy the collective defense support that is afforded 
to each and every member of the nato alliance he said 
probably the most dramatic step taken by the bush 
administration however was its willingness to solicit syrian 
participation in undercutting iraqs hussein 
the enmity between the syrian and iraqi governments is intense 
syrian president hafez assad and saddam hussein are longtime rivals 
within the arab world the two countries are ruled by rival 
baathist parties each considering the other outcasts 
baker declined to say what collective efforts syria and the 
united states might undertake against iraq 
i really dont want to get into the specifics of that he 
said 
at the same time baker verified reports the united states also 
has been in touch with iran through third party contacts 
iran and iraq fought a bloody war in the persian gulf for a 
decade iranian antipathy of iraq may actually surpass syrias and 
is of much longer standing 
a senior us official demanding anonymity said it was up to 
saudi arabia to decide whether syria and iran would participate in 
defense of the country against iraq

iraq has started beefing up its forces 
along the border with turkey a news agency reported today two 
days after turkey effectively shut down pipelines carrying iraqi 
oil through its territory 
however turkeys defense minister safa giray denied the 
report telling the associated press we have received no 
intelligence indicating iraq has added to troops already deployed 
in the area 
giray also denied turkish news reports that turkey has increased 
its military readiness by moving some air force fighter planes to 
bases close to the border with iraq but he said the government has 
canceled the leaves of all high levelmilitary officials and the 
vacations of civilian officials 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency which quoted villagers 
on the iraqi side of the border said the iraqi reinforcements 
included armored units 
anatolia which did not say how large the iraqi force was said 
about 1500 turkish sentries had been sent to border guard stations 
that had been unmanned since last year when a ceasefire took 
effect in the iraniraq war

frank lorenzo a central figure during a 
tumultuous period in the airline industry and the bane of organized 
labor announced today he was getting out of the business 
lorenzos continental airlines holdings inc said he was selling 
most of his stake in the company formerly known as texas air 
corp to scandinavian airlines system he also will quit as 
chairman and chief executive but will walk away with nearly 30 
million in severance payments and sale proceeds 
lorenzo told reporters at a new york news briefing that he 
decided to resign partly because the barrage of negative publicity 
about his management practices was hurting the companys overall 
performance 
its been obvious to me that ive become a lightning rod for 
many of the attacks the companys taken lorenzo said this 
transaction allows me to step aside 
his departure marks the end of an era in the us airline 
industry which has undergone sweeping changes since deregulation 
more than a decade ago 
using billions of dollars in borrowed money cheap fares and 
bankruptcy laws to restructure highcost airlines continental and 
eastern lorenzo expanded his company to the nations biggest 
airline operator with about 20 percent of the domestic market 
but lorenzo has been bitterly criticized by airline unions 
which were driven from continental and waged a bitter strike at 
eastern 
both airlines are under extreme financial pressure and doubts 
are widespread about easterns ability to survive 
lorenzo 50 said he will be replaced as chief executive by 
hollis l harris president of rival delta airlines he called 
harris one of the industrys most experienced and highly regarded 
executives 
delta confirmed today that harris 58 left the company 
effective wednesday to assume a position with continental delta 
said ronald w allen its chairman would take on harris duties 
lorenzo will immediately get about 1713 million in cash he 
also will get 27 million over three years and 10 million from 
sas for his stake in continental but the 298 million total is 
still only a franction of what he was worth a few years ago when 
his airlines were in better shape 
sas which first bought a stake in lorenzos business a few 
years ago said it was spending 50 million on the transaction 
which already was approved by continental holdings board of 
directors 
lorenzo became one of the most despised figures among union 
groups in the 1980s because of what they called his brutal 
treatment of organized labor 
the most dramatic result a strike at eastern airlines in march 
1989 that prompted the carrier to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors while it reorganized 
lorenzo lost control of eastern in april when federal bankruptcy 
judge judge burton lifland placed the airline in the hands of a 
trustee martin shugrue 
following that move lorenzos company changed its name from 
texas air to continental airlines holdings borrowing the name of 
the airline that lorenzo acquired in 1982 and continues to run 
the sale of lorenzos stake would boost sass interest in 
continental holdings to 168 percent in terms of equity and 184 
percent in terms of voting control sas already holds 98 percent 
of continental holdings and has a seat on the board 
the transaction will require approval of the us department of 
transportation it does not appear to violate laws limiting foreign 
carriers to no more than a 25 percent stake in a us airline

the kremlin has agreed to let armenian authorities 
try to disarm thousands of militants in the republic and will not 
resort to sending in troops the new president of armenia said 
thursday 
levon terpetrosyan also said it is time to expand state 
sovereignty of his republic and he said he is ready to negotiate 
with neighboring azerbaijan over the bitter dispute involving 
control of the territory of nagornokarabakh 
speaking at a news conference in moscow terpetrosyan said he 
had positive talks with soviet kgb and interior ministry chiefs 
wednesday about thousands of armenian national army volunteers 
defying president mikhail s gorbachevs order to turn in their 
weapons and disband 
gorbachev had threatened to send in soviet army and interior 
ministry troops to forcibly disarm militants if they did not turn 
in their weapons by thursday 
soviet interior minister vadim a bakatin had suggested the 
deadline be extended neither terpetrosyan nor bakatin who spoke 
in a tass interview defined the new deadline 
terpetrosyan also dismissed kremlin estimates of up to 160000 
members in the armenian national army as grossly exaggerated 
saying there are not more than 5000 
the 45yearold nationalist once jailed by the soviets for 
organizing demonstrations over nagornokarabakh was elected 
armenian president on saturday he said he agreed with moscow that 
armenian authorities will carry out gorbachevs order to disarm 
militants 
as regards the deadlines we talked about the fact that i am a 
new leader of the republic and i cannot be held responsible for the 
sins of the previous leadership terpetrosyan told reporters 
speaking in a pink marble hall at the armenian government mission 
in moscow 
but there was quite clear agreement it the decree will be 
implemented by our own means without any interference from the 
soviet army or the interior ministry troops he said 
bakatin told tass that armenias new leaders agreed on the 
need to strengthen law and order protect citizens and rule out the 
unlawful bearing of arms 
gorbachev trying to quell violence in this ethnically diverse 
nation on july 26 gave militants across the soviet union 15 days 
to turn in their weapons 
many militants especially those in armenia have refused to 
comply armenias parliament which this week is considering a 
declaration of independence rejected gorbachevs decree as 
interference 
although no specific republic was mentioned in the decree it 
clearly was aimed chiefly at armenia 
terpetrosyan said he had a warm conversation with the 
vacationing gorbachev by telephone this week 
he expressed his readiness to cooperate with the new 
leadership hence my visit to moscow said terpetrosyan who 
also met with kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov and soviet premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov 
terpetrosyan told reporters the main goal for armenia is to 
expand state sovereignty and radically democratize social life 
he also said it is possible for armenia to have goodneighborly 
relations with its traditional enemies the moslem azerbaijanis 
turks and iran 
terpetrosyan said he is ready to open talks with azerbaijan 
over nagornokarabakh a mainly armenian enclave that is part of 
azerbaijan he said there is a basis for compromise 
the first step to be taken which will satisfy both sides is 
to restore soviet power and operation of soviet laws in karabakh 
he said that is the only territory in the soviet union where 
there is no soviet power it is an occupied land ruled by the 
army 
terpetrosyan also said he and bakatin agreed that the state of 
emergency in nagornokarabakh will be eased 
ethnic battles between armenians and azerbaijanis over who 
should control the mountainous region have killed more than 200 
people in the past two years 
he said his administrations priorities are settling the 
nagornokarabakh crisis restoring the area devastated by the dec 
7 1988 armenian earthquake and easing the plight of the 
thousands of armenian refugees fleeing ethnic unrest

the justice department filed suit under the 
voting rights act today challenging georgias runoff election 
system that requires candidates to receive a majority of the vote 
to win an election 
the law similar to legislation in eight other southern states 
gives white candidates an extraordinary power said john r 
dunne assistant us attorney general for civil rights 
the law has stymied black candidates who may win the most votes 
in a threeway race with two white candidates but cant gain a 
majority in the ensuing twoway runoff 
dunne said the law has had a demonstratively chilling effect 
on the intent and willingness of blacks to become candidates for 
office across the south 
the other states with similar runoff systems are alabama 
arkansas florida louisiana oklahoma mississippi south 
carolina and texas 
georgias majority vote law requires a runoff election in every 
state local and federal election in which a candidate does not 
receive a majority of the vote 
the suit filed in atlanta is the first challenge of a majority 
vote runoff system brought by the justice department under the 1965 
voting rights act 
perry michael assistant state attorney general said georgia 
officials only learned of the suit today and would not comment 
until they have reviewed it 
dunne said the lawsuit was similar to one filed earlier in 
georgia by state rep tyrone brooks but unlike the brooks suit he 
said the justice department action does not seek to invalidate the 
entire runoff law 
dunne said the justice suit would challenge only those elections 
in which the majority vote requirement has been used to dilute the 
voting strength of minorities that would include all statewide 
elections and many local elections where blacks comprise a majority 
of the voting population but have been unable to elect black 
candidates 
although 24 percent of georgias voting age population is black 
dunne said blacks hold fewer than 10 percent of elected offices in 
the state and most of those are at the local level 
the higher the office and the broader the constituency the 
smaller the number of black elected officials he said 
dunne said the department waited until after georgias tuesday 
runoff election in the democratic primary for governor to file the 
suit so the action could not be interpreted as a challenge to those 
results

arab territories and waters to attack iraq he told reporters in 
baghdad before leaving for cairo his comments were distributed by 
the iraqi news agency

aides from the summit would dim the chances of effective action by 
the arab heads of state 
kuwaits deposed emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah also 
arrived today to take kuwaits seat at the summit egypt and most 
arab states recognize the ousted government as the legitimate ruler 
of kuwait 
arab nations were initially slow to denounce the invasion and 
have been reluctant to join in the usled multinational military 
effort egypts president hosni mubarak instead suggested an 
allarab deterrent force 
but the lone arab member on the un security council yemen 
joined in the 150 vote declaring iraqs annexation of kuwait 
null and void 
the resolution calls upon all states and international 
organizations not to recognize the annexation and not to take any 
action that might be interpreted as inderect recognition of the 
annexation

iran and nigeria have indicated they will pump more crude to make 
up for the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti production which experts say 
totaled 4 million barrels daily before the crisis

dropping

president bush is deploying thousands of troops and scores of 
warplanes in the saudi desert and has send three aircraft carrier

and sea power 
diplomatic sources in riyadh the saudi capital said us 
marines arrived early today near khafji a coastal city seven miles 
south of the kuwaiti border that includes an oil terminal 
bush declined to discuss the size of the us military force 
but government sources said wednesday at least 5000 ground troops 
were en route or already taking up positions on saudi soil along 
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers 
diplomatic sources said the us force buildup would total at

usled effort though other countries have offered support such 
as use of bases britain said today it would send two squadrons of 
warplanes and a number of groundtoair missiles along with three 
mine sweepers to be deployed initially to the eastern

two cosmonauts whose mission was plagued by 
technical problems and a perilous spacewalk returned to earth on 
thursday with a multimillionruble payload of spacegrown crystals 
the soyuz tm9 capsule carrying anatoly solovyev and alexander 
balandin landed on the central asian steppes at 1134 am one 
minute ahead of schedule 
the landing was not broadcast live on soviet television but the 
midday vremya tv news program showed the cosmonauts waving 
goodbye to their replacement crew before leaving the orbiting space 
station mir 
back in the landing spaceship we felt the slightly bitter 
smell of absinthe in the kazakh steppe solovyev told reporters 
after landing and ending his sixmonth stay in space 
i also dreamed that my wife would bring me fresh delicious 
apples when i was back on earth he said in remarks carried by 
the tass news agency 
solovyev and balandin were launched into space feb 11 in what 
was trumpeted as the first manned mission in the 33year history of 
the soviet space program to turn a multimilliondollar profit 
they conducted hundreds of experiments photographed 84 million 
square miles of the earths surface and grew 23 pure crystals for 
semiconductors and computer chips tass said 
tass said they also studied the influence of space flight on the 
development and behavior of birds and that this would help develop 
lifesupport systems for future manned spacecraft 
crystals grown in the zerogravity environment of space tend to 
have far fewer imperfections such as ripples or other impurites 
than those produced on earth the crystals are sliced into thin 
sheets and etched to create tiny circuits or semiconductors with 
optimum conductivity 
tass said each of the 23 crystals grown on the mir station was 
worth 1 million but the news agency did not say how big the 
crystals were or what material they were grown from 
a 23 million profit from the space venture likely would help 
the cashhungry soviet government fend off criticism about the cost 
of its space program 
under president mikhail s gorbachev pressure has grown on the 
costly but once sacrosanct space program to prove its worth in a 
society where many people do not have decent housing or enough 
quality food to eat 
future expeditions to mir will carry paying passengers the 
first will be an employee of the tokyo broadcasting system who 
will have a seat on an eightday mission beginning dec 2 
the japanese passenger will return to earth with the two 
cosmonauts currently aboard mir gennady manakov and gennady 
strekalov 
manakov and strekalov who replaced solovyev and balandin 
docked with the space station aug 3 two days after blasting off 
from the baikonur space center in kazakhstan 
they will conduct an estimated 250 experiments over the next six 
months including growing more crystals and making two spacewalks 
solovyev and balandin made a lifethreatening spacewalk july 17 
to repair their capsules thermal insulation which was torn on 
takeoff the repairs took seven hours longer than anticipated and 
their lifesupport supplies nearly ran out 
having damaged the exitandentry hatch at the beginning of the 
spacewalk the cosmonauts were forced to return through an 
emergency porthole in their haste they left behind handrails 
attached to the exterior of the capsule 
a second spacewalk was required july 26 to retrieve the 
handrails and fix the hatch

in the name of god the beneficent the merciful 
brother citizens gods peace mercy and blessings be upon you 
no doubt you know by following the sudden and regrettable 
events in the arabian gulf region during the past few days the 
extent of the dangerous situation confronted by the arab nation 
under the present circumstances 
no doubt you know that the kingdom of saudi arabia has exerted 
all it could in efforts and attempts with each of the governments 
of the republic of iraq and the state of kuwait to contain the 
dispute that developed between the two countries and i undertook 
in this connection a number of telephone contacts and brotherly 
talks as a result a bilateral meeting of iraqi and kuwaiti 
delegations was hosted by the kingdom in the attempts to heal the 
rift and prevent an escalation of matters 
some of the brothers kings and heads of state of the arab 
states contributed vastly and commendably to this end impelled by 
faith in the unity of the arab nation and bolster its march toward 
solidarity and cooperation in a way that achieves complete success 
in these matters of destiny 
but most regrettably matters took a course contrary to what 
we the islamic and arab nations and the entire peaceloving world 
were seeking 
the painful and regrettable events developed as of the dawn of 
aug 2 in a manner that took the entire world by surprise when 
the iraqi forces overran sister kuwait in the most horrible 
aggression the arab nation has known in its modern history this 
rendered the people of kuwait homeless and afflicted them with 
insufferable pains 
the kingdom of saudi arabia expresses its deep denunciation of 
the the aggression on sister state kuwait and declares its 
categoric rejection of all the measures and announcements that 
followed the assault likewise statements from arab leaderships 
the arab league the organization of islamic conference and the 
gulf cooperation council and all arab and international 
organizations and authorities rejected them 
the kingdom of saudi arabia affirms its demand that the 
situation in the sister state of kuwait be restored to what it was 
before the iraqi invasion and the return of the ruling family led 
by his highness sheik jaber alahmed alsabah the emir and his 
government 
we hope that the emergency arab summit called by president hosni 
mubarak of sister egypt will achieve the aspirations of the arab 
nation and bolster its march toward solidarity and unity 
following that regrettable event iraq ventured to amass large 
numbers of troops on the border of the kingdom of saudi arabia 
faced with this bitter reality and out of the kingdoms keenness 
to safeguard its territory and protect its vital and economic 
potential and desirous of bolstering its defensive potential and 
enhance the level of training for its armed forces and out of its 
interest in peace and nonresort to arms in settling differences 
the kingdom of saudi arabia expressed its desire for the 
participation of sister arab forces and other friends 
the governments of the united states of america and britain and 
other states hastened by virtue of the bonds of friendship between 
the kingdom of saudi arabia and these states to send air and land 
troops to help the saudi armed forces perform their duty in defense 
of the homeland and the nation against any aggression while 
affirming that this measure is not directed against any one but is 
a purely defensive measure dictated by the circumstances that the 
kingdom of saudi arabia is confronting 
it is worth noting that these forces will participate in joint 
exercises with the saudi armed forces and their presence on saudi 
territory will be temporary they will leave here as soon as the 
kingdom so demands we ask god to guide our steps for the good of 
our faith and the safety of our lands 
gods peace mercy and blessing be upon you

the white house issued a fresh call today for 
other nations to join the united states in a military buildup to 
defend saudi arabia from possible attack by iraq more us forces 
arrived in the persian gulf and the pentagon said iraq was beefing 
up its forces in kuwait 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said an estimated 120000 iraqi 
troops are now in kuwait and that iraq also had improved air 
defenses in kuwait as part of what appeared to be defensive 
measures 
theyre holding on to what they have acquired williams said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush is 
very satisfied with the course of events in the last 24 hours he 
declined to criticize egypt or other arab nations for failing to 
join the united states and britain in the defense of saudi arabia 
the united states acted in the interest of our country and 
other western nations fitzwater said we would always like to 
see others participate but the organization of that is up to the 
saudis 
fitzwater said the gulf cooperation council countries kuwait 
oman qatar and the united arab emirates as well as saudi arabia 
have a 3000member force in saudi arabia 
the pentagon declined to detail the size of the us deployment 
but williams did say all f15 fighters sent to saudi arabia had 
arrived as have five awacs planes six us ships are in the 
mediterranean and two aircraft carrier groups are positioned in the 
red and arabian seas he said 
fitzwater told a white house briefing that bush would exempt the 
military operation from mandatory spending cuts that could be 
triggered if the president and congress do not reach agreement on 
cutting the federal deficit 
the middle east crisis notwithstanding bush planned to leave 
washington on friday for a 25day vacation at his oceanfront home 
in maine bush likely will return to the white house for a day or 
so next week for military briefings fitzwater said 
the bush administration has urged americans to leave iraq and 
kuwait but fitzwater said iraqs borders remain closed and only 
diplomats are being allowed to leave the state department said 
iraq turned over a 10yearold girl penelope nabokov of albany 
calif to us diplomats in baghdad but kept 38 other americans 
confined to a hotel under armed guard 
by air and sea additional us troops and equipment headed for 
the saudi kingdom and elsewhere in the gulf region diplomatic 
sources in saudi arabia said us troops arrived today near khafji 
a coastal oil city seven miles south of the kuwaiti border the 
saudi sources had identified the troops as us marines but the 
pentagon today said no marines are among the forces deployed in 
saudi arabia 
even more troops still on us soil were placed on alert for 
possible mideast duty and air national guard members in a handful 
of states were activated 
at the united nations the security council voted 150 to 
declare iraqs annexation of kuwait null and void the us 
ambassador to the forum thomas pickering said the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait and the large military presence on the saudi 
frontier creates grave risk of further aggression in the area 
fitzwater characterized the vote as one more block to the 
growing international foundation of condemnation 
the presidents actions are winning broad support in congress 
but concerns were raised today about the lack of clear support from 
other arab nations 
if it appears that its the united states and saudi arabia 
versus the rest of the arab world then that is not going to be in 
our longterm interest or saudi arabias interest senate armed 
services committee chairman sam nunn said 
while expressing support for the deployment nunn cautioned that 
a longterm protracted presence of 50000 to 100000 people is in 
my view not desirable either militarily or certainly 
psychologically or politically in that part of the world 
hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis rested largely on 
a gathering of arab leaders in egypt but a summit meeting planned 
for today was postponed until friday 
the effort to win regional support for its campaign against 
iraqs saddam hussein has the united states sounding out unlikely 
partners including iran syria and the soviet union also 
secretary of state james a baker iii was in turkey today for 
consultations with its leaders and told them the deposed kuwaiti 
leadership had promised to help turkey make up for revenues it 
expects to lose because it shut down two pipelines that carry iraqi 
oil 
bush himself was out of the public eye this morning on 
wednesday he expressed optimism that the worldwide economic 
pressure would force saddam to abandon his conquest of kuwait and 
his threatening military position on the saudi border 
there are some indications that hes already beginning to feel 
the pinch bush said at a news conference nobody can stand up 
forever to total economic deprivation 
the stakes are high saudi arabia provided 7 percent of us oil 
last year bush is counting on increased production from the saudis 
and other oil producers to make up for the loss of iraqi and 
kuwaiti supplies 
a line has been drawn in the sand bush declared as us 
warplanes and ground forces arrived in saudi arabia however he 
said were not in a war 
top us military officials refused to reveal the size of the 
presidents commitment to saudi defense but some middle east 
diplomatic sources put the troop level at about 30000 other 
estimates ranged up to 50000 those totals would include ground 
and air forces as well as sailors aboard ships in the region on 
the first day of deployment at least 5000 ground troops were 
being dispatched officials said backed by an armada of air and 
seapower 
no one was guessing how long they would be away from home 
the situations uncertain we dont know how long it will 
last we dont know when it will end defense secretary dick 
cheney said 
baker told reporters the soviet union sent naval forces to the 
persian gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce a 
united nations trade embargo following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
last week 
baker also dispatched an aide to syria to see if we can 
coordinate and added the united states has been in touch with 
iran through third party contacts 
both nations are bitter foes of iraq but syria is on the 
official state department list of states supporting terrorism and 
iran has long been accused of pulling the strings behind the 
holders of american hostages in lebanon 
bush said us forces would safeguard the saudi oilfields but 
would not attempt to drive iraqi troops from tiny kuwait 
bush warned saddam not to use his arsenal of chemical weapons 
saying that would be dealt with very very severely us 
troops were equipped with medical supplies and protective clothing 
to counter a chemical weapon attack 
bush explained why he ordered the largest military deployment 
since the vietnam war saying america imports half its oil and 
could face a major threat to its economic independence if 
saddam took over the oilfields of the persian gulf 
military sources said the us contingent included 140 jet 
fighters and bombers as well as battleships that carried 32 
tomahawk cruise missiles programmed to destroy specific targets in 
iraq 
you can be sure that for the mission we have been given we 
will put in adequate forces gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff told a pentagon briefing 
he expressed confidence that american forces were prepared for 
battle in the hostile desert environment if called upon 
weve trained for it weve exercised in it powell said he 
said the battlehardened iraqis are not invincible they are not

the soviet union refused thursday to join a 
usled multinational force to stem iraqi aggression but said it 
might go along if the united nations organized a similar operation 
at this stage we do not consider the possibility of 
participating in either the international force or naval 
blockade foreign ministry spokesman yuri d gremitskikh told 
reporters 
he coupled the soviet restraint with a fresh demand that iraq 
restore the sovereignty national independence and territorial 
integrity of the state of kuwait iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
the soviet determination to refrain from military involvement 
showed how stringently the kremlin was sticking to president 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of new thinking in foreign 
affairs that policy which calls for nonviolent means of settling 
conflicts and respect for other nations positions has been most 
evident in the soviet decisions to withdraw its troops from 
afghanistan and to refrain from force to keep communist regimes in 
place in eastern europe 
in another development the soviet unions point man in 
diplomatic contacts over iraqs invasion of kuwait deputy foreign 
minister alexander belonogov met thursday in moscow with 
representatives of warsaw pact nations tass reported the news 
agency said belonogov and yuri kvitsinsky another deputy foreign 
minister told the representatives about soviet efforts to resolve 
the crisis in the persian gulf 
the soviet people began speaking out publicly as well and 
state television aired a panel discussion by political commentators 
about the situation 
we warn the danger of neonazism hitler began the same 
way read posters bearing a picture of iraqi president saddam 
hussein and displayed at a demonstration outside iraqs embassy in 
moscow about 100 people took part in the protest and burned the 
posters 
stanislav kondrashov an analyst for the government newspaper 
izvestia said in the tv discussion that the soviet union is 
joining a worldwide boycott of iraqi oil the soviet union a major 
oil producer received iraqi oil as payment for goods then passed 
the crude on to bulgaria and india kondrashov said 
alexei vassilev deputy director of the soviet institute of 
africa said on the tv program the soviet union would benefit 
financially overall because the iraqi crisis had driven up oil 
prices including those of soviet crude 
gremitskikh told a news briefing that gorbachev had contacted 
saddam by telegram hoping to persuade the iraqi leader to adhere 
to the un security council resolution to withdraw from kuwait 
gremitskikh said unfortunately our hopes were not fulfilled 
he said 
he signaled the soviets have no intention of sending troops into 
saudi arabia as the united states has done 
the soviet position is that the settlement in connection with 
the iraqi invasion into kuwait must be coordinated within the 
un security council gremitskikh said 
if the united nations approved a multinational force or naval 
blockade then we would think about it and would take our own 
sovereign decision about what to do he said 
the soviet union has taken some protective military action 
however 
the spokesman said two soviet warships a destroyer and an 
antisubmarine vessel were dispatched from the indian ocean to the 
persian gulf to protect soviet maritime traffic 
gremitskikh said foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze spoke 
to secretary of state james a baker iii by telephone twice 
wednesday and received assurance the americanled troops massing in 
saudi arabia would leave as soon as tensions eased 
baker told reporters traveling with him to turkey that he spoke 
to shevardnadze again thursday he quoted the soviet minister as 
saying moscow had dispatched its warships to the gulf for use in 
any international blockade 
gremitskikh would not elaborate on their conversation 
he read a foreign ministry statement that shied away from direct 
criticism of the usled multinational force but appeared to be 
referring to the operation when it called for prevention of 
actions that may pour oil on the flames 
the experience of many years shows that the most correct and 
sensible way of acting in conflict situations is through collective 
efforts and the utmost use of un mechanisms the statement said 
gremitskikh said the soviet union which had been iraqs main 
arms supplier has a special responsibility for ending the crisis 
moscow suspended all arms sales to baghdad shortly after the 
invasion

in a dramatic response to an iraqi threat 
israel on thursday launched the first test of a new antiballistic 
missile prime minister yitzhak shamir warned of heavy tragedy 
for any nation attacking israel 
the launch of the usfinanced arrow missile came a day after 
iraqi president saddam hussein threatened to start a missile attack 
on israel saddam made the threat after alleging that israeli 
warplanes had been painted with american colors in preparation for 
an attack on iraq 
observers said the timing of the launch was a clear signal to 
saddam who in april threatened to burn half of israel with 
chemical weapons if attacked that israel is a power to reckon 
with 
the arrow left a trail of fire and smoke and shot many miles up 
and westward in less than a minute then fell in an arc into the 
mediterranean witnesses said 
the arrow was developed to combat the shortrange ballistic 
missiles of the kind possessed by iran washington provided 80 
percent of the 158 million cost of the first phase of the project 
defense minister moshe arens praised the arrow as an important 
technological achievement but noted it was only a developing 
program at this stage it is not expected to be operational until 
at least 1992 
shamir assured arab countries israel had no aggressive plans 
but added whoever plots to attack israel must know that israel 
has the capability will and readiness to defend its security 
absolutely and whoever tries to hurt it is liable to bring on 
himself a heavy tragedy 
israels defense and security forces are aware and alert and 
devoting their efforts to prevent any danger to the people and 
state shamir told israel radio 
several israeli analysts said saddam may attack israel in a 
frustrated response to a us military move 
what he is actually saying to the americans is im going 
to consider any military confrontation between iraq and america as 
an iraqiamericanisraeli confrontation said amatzia baram an 
iraq expert at haifa university i cannot reach america i dont 
have missiles that reach that far but i can reach israel so you 
ought to know that if you launch an attack against me im going to 
press the button 
the atmosphere of anxiety was reflected in newspaper editorials 
that called for distribution of gas masks to defend the population 
against a possible assault by chemical weapons 
we dont have to panic but is this not the time to calmly and 
quietly open our antichemical warfare arsenals that are intended 
for distribution to the people yediot ahronot wrote 
the army has decided in principle to distribute the masks to the 
entire population over the next six months army officials said in 
two locations the army carried out test distribution 18 months ago 
the government can give us means of defense we dont have to 
be afraid said 11yearold roi samuel of ramat hasharon he told 
israel radio he keeps a governmentsupplied gas mask in his closet

ronald reagan says even he was taken aback by 
the 2 million the japanese paid him to make two speeches but he 
doesnt consider it improper 
i didnt have a fee it was their offer the former 
president said in the aug 12 issue of parade magazine but i 
have to say this yes it sounds a little out of line even to me 
that that much money was offered 
but it wasnt cashing in on the presidency if id been of a 
nature to cash in i would have returned to the industry that i

charlotte burnett acknowledges her transfer 
three years ago to head a bank in watts was not exactly the career 
move she had in mind 
after all for many watts is the definition of urban blight and 
racial unrest the community after which the watts riot of 25 years 
ago was named california federals watts branch is on 103rd 
street once known as charcoal alley 
but running the only bank in the los angeles community of watts 
proved a rewarding experience and greatly changed burnetts view of 
the community and its potential for the future 
what i have found is that what i see on television and in the 
newspaper about the community is basically not very true or the 
whole picture she said i see a difference i always see the 
negative in the media i see the positive here 
burnett is among a dedicated core of business people and 
community activists working to turn watts around 
from her vantage point as a bank vice president burnett sees 
the other side of watts the working people the families and 
retirees who overwhelmingly outnumber the drug dealers and school 
dropouts who always seem to make the news 
many of the people in watts have lived there for 40 or more 
years in homes from the 1940s with neat lawns and freshly painted 
fences on treelined streets many blocks away from the housing 
projects and vacant lots 
the calfed branch which opened in 1970 symbolizes for many 
residents watts rebound from the riot of 1965 and offers an 
example of where the community can go 
the branch employs 13 people 10 of them from watts and handles 
a wide variety of services from checking to mutual funds 
as a local business person burnett often has duties outside the 
office from giving investment seminars to working on community 
advisory programs 
i see people who have pride in their community an attitude 
of were going to make this work its going to be as good a 
community as any other community she said but most important 
thing is i see families the pictures they media never show of 
the mother the father and the children i see it every day

king fahd in his first address to 
the nation since the iraqi invasion of kuwait said thursday his 
decision to seek foreign military help was a defensive move forced 
by the iraqi aggression 
it was the first time the saudi government had explained to its 
people the arrival of tens of thousands of american troops 
fahd called the takeover of neighboring kuwait the most 
horrible aggression the arab nation has known in its modern 
history and said his request for foreign military help was aimed 
at restoring peace to the region 
fahd demanded that in addition to an iraqi troop pullout the 
alsabah royal family return to power in kuwait 
following the invasion of kuwait on aug 2 the iraqis massed 
large numbers of troops on the border of the kingdom fahd said 
faced with this bitter reality and out of keenness to 
safeguard its territory and economy the kingdom expressed a 
desire to arab and friendly forces to participate in the defense 
task he said 
the king spoke as us airborne rapid deployment forces and 
fighter jets poured into saudi arabia 
an official statement later distributed by the saudi press 
agency said the troop buildup was to be completed friday 
it expressed the kingdoms deep appreciation to all states 
that were sending troops their involvement reflected keenness to 
see security and stability prevail in the arabian gulf region until 
normal conditions are restored as well as the legitimate authority 
in the sister state of kuwait and all consequences of the iraqi 
invasion are eliminated 
diplomatic sources noted this would coincide with the emergency 
arab summit being held in cairo the summit was expected to take up 
egyptian president hosni mubaraks proposal to line up a panarab 
force which would replace the iraqi occupation troops inside 
kuwait until the differences over land oil and money that sparked 
the invasion could be settled 
referring to the foreign troops in saudi territory the king 
said these forces from friendly powers are here temporarily 
they are to help defend the kingdom participate in joint 
exercises and will leave here as soon as the kingdom so demands 
he said 
fahd stressed that inviting western and arab forces to the 
kingdom was not directed against anyone but a purely defensive 
measure 
the landing of the thousands of foreign troops has been cloaked 
from ordinary saudis since they were being deployed at the 
northeastern desert edge of the kingdom 
the area is known as hafr albaten where one of the worlds 
biggest military cities was completed in 1985 the city can 
accommodate up to 70000 officers and soldiers aside from 
dependents 
a 10000strong fledgling rapid deployment force from saudi 
arabia kuwait and the other four partners in the gulf copperation 
council alliance bahrain oman qatar and the united arab 
emirates is also based at hafr albaten 
we feel them but we dont see them said a resident reached 
by telephone in the vital oil center of the eastern province where 
the troops were headed 
aside from a run on newspapers and portable radios residents 
went about their lives remaining mainly indoors as usual as the 
summer temperatures soared to about 100 degrees 
there has been no panic or mass evacuation of the estimated 45 
million foreign workers and their dependents in the kingdom but 
some foreigners especially dependents were leaving if their stay 
was not necessary 
many workers from the indian subcontinent were lined up seeking 
visas 
regional shipping executives and the londonbased lloyds 
shipping intelligence unit which monitors the maritime navigations 
of the persian gulf said that saudi gulf ports of dammam ras 
tanura juaymah and jubail were operating normally

iraqs massive war machine is largely a ground 
force whose true military capabilities are less than its size and 
armament would suggest according to us analysts 
while president saddam husseins 5500 tanks and millionman 
army are the arab worlds largest force and the worlds 
fourthlargest military the united states believes they can be 
kept at bay and eventually starved by a much smaller contingent 
that relies on air and sea power 
it is true that an eightyear war with iran that ended in 1988 
and a 34 billion military buildup over that period left iraq with 
hardened battletested forces but a conflict over saudi arabia 
would be of a far different character and much of that experience 
might be less relevant according to us officials 
we treat them and view them as a capable military force 
said gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
but they are not invincible and theyre not 10 feet tall 
against iran iraqi troops became adept at building massive 
earthworks constructing tank traps and flooding land as a defense 
against the human waves sent by the ayatollah khomeini they 
learned to move elite units quickly to hot spots along the border 
and developed an extensive fleet of armored troop transports 
iraq also acquired scud missiles a relatively clumsy 
groundtoground weapon from the soviet union and improved their 
range with help from private engineers in the west and saddam has 
developed an independent capacity to make mustard gas and nerve 
gas and deliver them in artillery shells and on missiles 
on paper iraq also has a substantial air force and formidable 
defenses against possible sorties by us fighters and bombers but 
the numbers lie said one congressional military expert 
except for about 50 of them iraqi pilots are thirdrate 
said the source who spoke only on the condition of anonymity the 
fifty pilots went through a threeyear training course in france as 
part of iraqs purchase of french mirage fighter planes 
some of those planes are equipped with french exocet missiles 
one of which hit the uss stark and killed 37 sailors 
it was those four fighter squadrons which carried out the most 
effective raids during iraqs eightyear war with iran attacking 
oilloading facilities at kharg island in the persian gulf said 
the source 
while the air force includes 450 other combat planes some of 
them soviet migs they have not been a threat the pilots are 
chicken and not very imaginative said the source bombing runs 
on tehran during the war were carried out from 30000 feet because 
of fear of antiaircraft fire and did little damage the analyst 
said 
the iraqis have more than 300 surfacetoair missiles which 
could be used against american pilots but are said to be 
unprepared to use them there was little need for air defense in 
the war with iran so skilled personnel were not committed to those 
areas 
the iraqi navy is almost nonexistent which is why military 
strategists see a naval blockade to starve saddam into submission 
as a leading option the iraqi leader can deploy only five ships of 
any size and his primary waterway to the persian gulf remains 
choked with the wreckage of ships sunk during the war with iran 
even saddams millionman ground force is not as formidable as 
it appears fully half of those troops are reserves less well 
equipped and minimally trained some forces must be kept to watch 
the countrys borders with iran and turkey 
the elite republican guard seven divisions numbering about 
120000 men are the most experienced and are all positioned in 
kuwait any reinforcements would have to come from what one expert 
called secondrate troops 
and even the elite units are not experienced in sustained 
combat the analyst said the iraniraq war was made up of a series 
of short skirmishes with only two or three major battles a year 
the longest conflict was less than two weeks

an emergency arab summit to discuss iraqs 
invasion of kuwait was postponed one day until friday because some 
arab leaders did not arrive in time president hosni mubaraks 
spokesman said 
the spokesman mohamed abdelmoneim said mubarak would host a 
dinner tonight for arab presidents and kings who already had 
arrived and who had expected the summit to begin today 
of the 21 arab league countries tunisia mauritania yemen and 
djibouti had not sent delegations by the scheduled early evening 
opening time 
egypt hopes the summit will forestall a western military attack 
on iraqi forces in kuwait and along its border with saudi arabia 
both iraq and kuwaits ousted government have sent representatives 
to the meeting 
the emergency arab summit will start tomorrow friday 
egypts middle eastern news agency said today will be limited to 
side talks among the kings and presidents participating in the 
summit they will meet tonight at the dinner until the rest of 
the delegations arrivelater thursday 
iraqs presence at the meeting could be a breakthrough for 
moderate arab leaders who have refused to join a usled force 
that was deployed to defend saudi arabia following iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
the moderates hope for a diplomatic solution 
the iraqi delegation chief taha yassin ramadan said he was 
attending the summit to confront the overt us threats he 
said us forces have taken up positions on arab territories and 
waters to attack iraq 
ramadan first deputy premier and member of president saddam 
husseins ruling military junta warned against an attack on his 
country by the united states which is building up forces in 
neighboring saudi arabia 
any aggression on iraq regardless of its source will be 
answered decisively ramadan said and when iraq says 
something it is capable of following it through 
he spoke before his departure from baghdad and his comments were 
distributed by the iraqi news agency 
iraq invaded kuwait a week ago and annexed it wednesday the 
un security council today declared the annexation null and 
void 
kuwaits deposed emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah also 
arrived today to take kuwaits seat at the summit egypt and most 
arab states recognize the ousted government as the legitimate ruler 
of kuwait 
i find myself obliged to warn of the extreme danger 
mubarak the summit host said wednesday 
he called for a joint arab force that would keep the iraqis from 
taking more territory specifically saudi arabia such a force 
would be unlikely to be used to try to push iraqi troops from 
kuwait 
finding an arab solution would be better than having a 
solution forced on us by foreign powers mubarak said in a 
nationally televised speech 
i appeal to president saddam and the iraqi leadership to 
respond to the idea of an arab umbrella withdraw its forces from 
kuwait restore legitimacy then there would be no objection to a 
joint arab force serving as a buffer between the two sides then 
negotiations can follow mubarak said 
us officials had said egypt would join the united states in a 
multinational force defending the saudis from iraqi aggression but 
egypt said it would not participate in an americanled force 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said one 
of the summits options was to support mubaraks idea of a joint 
arab deterrent force 
their other main alternative would be to join the world in 
imposing sanctions on iraq hoping the seige would force iraq to 
withdraw the very least they will do is reiterate their 
condemnation of the incursion and urge western powers not to 
intervene the diplomatic sources said 
president bush seeking to dispel fears of an impending us 
attack against iraqi forces said in washington on wednesday that 
us forces being sent to saudi arabia were aimed only at 
preventing an iraqi incursion 
jordans king hussein was asked at an amman news conference on 
wednesday if the summit was the last opportunity to avoid fighting 
he responded without hesitation yes i see it as a last chance 
libyan leader moammar ghadafi was the first arab leader to 
arrive for the summit he was greeted wednesday at cairo 
international airport by mubarak who later welcomed lebanese 
president elias hrawi 
those arriving today included leaders of algeria bahrain 
jordan qatar saudi arabia sudan and the united arab emirates as 
well as palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
senior officials attended from morocco and oman

the cost of maintaining and overhauling the 
nations naval fleet exceeded original estimates by about 30 
percent with expenses rising to 37 billion over a threeyear 
period congressional investigators say 
the general accounting office the watchdog agency of congress 
found cost growth and schedule overruns at the eight public 
shipyards and 44 private shipyards across the united states between 
fiscal 1985 and fiscal 1988 
public shipyards generally work on more sophisticated ships 
including submarines carriers and nuclearpowered surface ships 
private shipyards usually handle auxiliary and amphibious ships 
the gao blamed the problems at private shipyards on an inability 
to determine beforehand what repair work must be done unplanned 
work added after the government contract has been awarded and 
difficulty in obtaining materials 
in the study released the end of july the gao also found that 
the market for ship maintenance and modernization is highly 
competitive forcing contractors to submit low bids to obtain navy 
work 
similar problems also existed at public shipyards where the gao 
found that in some cases the companies did not have enough labor to 
do the work properly 
at the private shipyards the gao said that over a threeyear 
period contract costs increased from 28 billion to 37 billion 
with the final prices exceeding the contract award prices on 357 of 
402 projects 
the cost increase at public shipyards was about 3 percent as 
estimates rose from 84 billion to 87 billion over the same 
threeyear period 
completion dates for the projects at the private shipyards 
overran the original schedules by an average of 43 days while at 
the public shipyards completion dates overran the original 
schedules by an average of 81 days 
the navy is aware of the problems but past efforts to correct 
them have not been fully successful as evidenced by the continued 
cost growth and schedule overruns the gao said 
a new plan to correct depot maintenance problems was recently 
approved by the secretary of the navy lawrence garrett iii this 
plan is a step in the right direction but more corrective actions 
are needed 
in comments included in the gao report the defense department 
largely concurs with the gao findings but cites a number of 
unusual reasons for the cost increases 
schedule overruns at public shipyards for the last four years 
are directly attributable to an unusually high number of submarine 
overhaul starts beginning in the fiscal 1985 to fiscal 1998 time 
frame which created a serious imbalance between workload and 
shipyard trade and management skills the department said 
both the gao and the department note that since the early 1970s 
the navy has changed its strategy for maintaining and modernizing 
ships by scheduling fewer regular overhauls and opting for 
shorter more frequent repairs 
the gao report was requested by rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee

weak commercial real estate markets have 
spread from the northeast and southwest to the midwest and even the 
booming west coast a federal reserve board member said thursday 
real estate problems have been most pronounced in new england 
john p laware told the house banking committee but weakness now 
exists along much of the east coast 
market conditions in some midwestern cities have also begun to 
show a marked loss of strength and even the western states of 
california oregon and washington long the beneficiaries of strong 
real estate markets have begun to report increased office vacancy 
rates in at least some areas he said 
as a result the number of delinquent real estate loans at 
commercial banks are mounting up 37 percent in 1989 and 8 percent 
to 32 billion in the first three months of 1990 he said 
however laware and comptroller of the currency robert l 
clarke whose office oversees nationally chartered banks said 
regulators were on top of the trend and insisting on sound lending 
standards 
the comptrollers office has been sounding the alarm on real 
estate lending for the past three years clarke said 
members of the committee reacted skeptically likening the 
deterioration in bank profits and the regulators reactions to the 
early phases of the savings and loan mess 
during the 60s 70s and 80s the regulators said pretty 
much what youre saying today said rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas chairman of the panel 
im worried said rep charles schumer dny some of the 
very same fundamentals that caused problems in the sampl industry are 
going to continue to cause problems in the banking industry until 
we examine it and change the way banks operate 
however private analysts appearing before the panel said that 
banks position while serious cannot be compared with that of 
savings institutions 
us commercial banks are in varying degrees under 
considerable strain said james j mcdermott jr of keefe 
bruyette amp woods inc nevertheless banks in the aggregate 
should avoid the plight of the savings and loan industry and manage 
their way through the current stresses 
gonzalez also rebuked the regulators for refusing to answer 
questions about 2 billion in bank loans to donald trump who is 
struggling to preserve his real estate empire 
the savings and loan scandals grew in the dark basements of 
official government secrecy and the facts did not reach the 
american public until the problems became massive and 
unmanageable gonzalez said asking how depositors were to know 
where to put their money 
clarke replied that there was a longstanding regulatory 
tradition to keep information about bank customers confidential 
i think it would be a terrible mistake for bank supervisors to 
come up here and present financial information about individual 
bank borrowers in a public forum he said 
trump and representatives of citicorp chase manhattan bank 
manufacturers hanover trust co and bankers trust new york corp 
all declined invitations to address the committee trump in a 
letter to gonzalez said he did not want to reveal proprietary 
business information and the bankers said they were obligated to 
preserve customer confidentiality

has already called for a worldwide economic embargo against iraq 
the move was considered one of the strongest security council 
actions combined with the two earlier resolutions of condemnation 
and sanctions it indicated that after years of division and 
ineffectiveness the body was performing its original peacemaking 
role 
yemen the councils sole arab member voted with the rest of 
the council it abstained in previous votes that condemned the 
invasion and ordered global economic sanctions 
iraq scorned the resolution which is considered legally binding 
on all un members 
my government reaffirms that the unity between iraq and kuwait 
is an indestructible one it is eternal and irreversible iraqi 
ambassador ameri alanbari said after the vote 
alanbari blamed the us military presence in saudi arabia and 
in the region for causing instability and said it had delayed the 
promised iraqi withdrawal from kuwait he said his government has 
no intention of invading saudi arabia 
the resolution introduced by kuwait and sponsored by 
nonaligned nations says annexation of kuwait by iraq under any 
form and whatever pretext has no legal validity and is considered 
null and void it demands iraq rescind its annexation and urges 
all states not to give even indirect recognition to the kuwaiti 
government installed by iraq 
we cannot allow sovereign state members of the united nations 
to be swallowed up us ambassador thomas r pickering told the 
council 
pickering said iraq repeatedly had lied about its intentions and 
demonstrated its scorn for the international community and 
disdain for international law 
pickering emphasized that the us presence in the area is 
strictly defensive under provisions of the un charter and 
intended to help protect saudi arabia 
pickering and other speakers likened iraqs behavior to that of 
dictators in the 1930s referring indirectly to hitler at that 
time pickering said the result was global conflagraiton 
we here will not and cannot let this happen again he said 
british ambassador crispen tickell said this is an important 
day in the history of this un institution he said it set a 
precedent for the kind of security council envisioned when the 
united nations was formed in 1945 
as the council met the soviet foreign ministry said soviet 
participation in an international force in the crisis was 
contingent upon un auspices 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he respected 
the soviet position that it deserved consideration and that the 
security council would have to decide whether to call for a un 
presence in the region 
the council includes the five permanent members the united 
states britain china france and the soviet union and 10 other 
members canada colombia cuba ethiopia finland ivory coast 
malaysia romania yemen and zaire

a leukemia patient received her mothers bone 
marrow thursday after doctors failed to find a perfect match among 
50000 people who volunteered as donors 
allison atlas 20 had the transplant at fred hutchison cancer 
research center in seattle her mother arline 54 was the donor 
the plight of miss atlas a new york university student from 
bethesda md prompted 50000 people to volunteer for bone marrow 
tests there was no perfect match for miss atlas but 10 other 
leukemia patients got donors 
mrs atlas marrow matched four of six antigens or cell 
identifiers from her daughters marrow 
doctors said miss atlas would have had a 60 percent chance of 
recovery if the donated marrow was a perfect match her chances are 
reduced somewhat but other patients with the same degree of 
mismatch have recovered said hospital spokeswoman alice burgess 
said 
without the transplant she would live less than a year burgess 
said 
leukemia causes white blood cells to multiply uncontrollably 
bone marrow produces blood and doctors combat the cancer by 
replacing the diseased marrow 
the atlas familys public campaign last fall raised 3 million 
to process blood samples from the 50000 people in the united 
states and israel who registered with the national marrow donor 
program

red cross relief worker emanuel 
christen appearing thin but healthy had an emotional homecoming 
thursday after 10 months in captivity in lebanon 
but joy at his release was tempered by concern for fellow swiss 
hostage elio erriquez who was abducted oct 6 along with christen 
christen was the first western hostage released since two 
americans were freed in april 
christen 33 bounded down the steps of a red crosschartered 
aircraft that arrived at zurichs kloten airport after a fourhour 
flight from the syrian capital damascus his parents and four 
brothers and sisters rushed onto the tarmac to embrace him 
swiss foreign minister rene felber and cornelio sommaruga 
president of the international committee of the red cross also 
greeted christen who was turned over late wednesday to syrian 
officials 
dressed in white shirt and beige trousers christen was clean 
shaven and showed few signs of his ordeal he smiled at dozens of 
waiting reporters and photographers but declined to answer 
questions 
a hitherto unknown group calling itself the palestinian 
revolutionary squads announced on tuesday night that both of the 
swiss red cross workers would be freed within 24 hours 
there was no explanation from the kidnappers for the delay in 
freeing erriquez 
before being abducted both men worked as orthopedic technicians 
at a red cross hospital in the southern lebanese port of sidon 
the swiss foreign minister told swiss tv he was confident 
christens release was a signal for the next liberation 
we are happy that emanuel is free but we are also concerned 
that elio is still a captive christens mother marianne 
christen said in a separate television interview 
she said she was shocked earlier when she saw a photo of her son 
released by the kidnappers shortly before he was freed she said he 
seemed thin and has such a sad look 
a swiss embassy staff member in damascus claudine zbinden said 
christen had lost about 30 pounds but he is in relative good 
shape if one may say so ms zbinden said thursday in a 
telephone interview 
both the swiss foreign ministry and the genevaheadquartered 
international committee of the red cross denied any deal was made 
with the kidnappers to win the hostages release 
in their statement tuesday the palestine revolutionary squads 
said they decided to free the two swiss captives after we 
acquired guarantees that our demands will be met 
erriquezs brother antoine said he was convinced there had been 
a deal between the kidnappers and swiss officials 
they had to make a concession even if they deny it he 
said but it is also possible that the terrorists after 
releasing one hostage are now waiting whether all of their demands 
are being met before also freeing my brother 
in paris the french foreign ministry said the release may have 
been a result of frances decision last month to pardon anis 
naccache and four other members of a proiranian assassination team 
a ministry spokesman said france was informed immediately after 
naccaches release july 27 that iran would pursue efforts to free 
hostages held in lebanon and that two europeans would be freed soon 
christens release brought to 15 the number of foreigners held 
hostage in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16

after six weeks of testimony the jury in the 
central park jogger case began deliberations thursday weighing the 
charges against three teenagers in one of the citys most infamous 
crimes 
yusef salaam 16 raymond santana 15 and antron mccray 16 
are charged with attempted murder rape sexual abuse riot 
assault and robbery in attacks on the woman and on two male joggers 
during a rampage on april 19 1989 
the woman was dragged into the woods gangraped bashed with a 
brick and a pipe and left to die in a pool of blood after going 
into the park for her nightly run the brutality of the attack and 
her surprising recovery caught the attention of the city and the 
nation 
defense lawyers summed up tuesday with one attorney suggesting 
the victim was not gangraped and another accusing detectives of 
lying about how incriminating statements were obtained from the 
three defendants 
the three were tried as adults but if convicted would be 
sentenced as juveniles limiting the length of any prison terms 
videotaped statements by mccray and santana were shown during 
the trial and again during the closing argument wednesday 
the jury thursday requested the written statements the three 
defendants gave police the defense has charged the statements were 
coerced from the defendants 
the panel also asked the judge about the admissibility of any 
statement made by a minor without a parent or guardian present 
the fact that a parent was not present during the questioning 
of a juvenile does not automatically mean the statement is 
involuntary justice thomas galligan told the jurors 
the 30yearold jogger is back at work as a vice president at 
salomon brothers investment bankers in a dramatic appearance at 
the trial she testified that she still suffers from impaired 
sight balance and smell as a result of the attack 
the fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a 
miracle prosecutor elizabeth lederer said

chancellor helmut kohl dropped plans 
thursday to advance allgerman elections by six weeks a major 
political defeat for the leader who until now had set the pace of 
german unification 
still uncertain however was whether formal unity would proceed 
on oct 14 apart from parliamentary elections now set for dec 2 
kohl and east german prime minister lothar de maiziere had wanted 
to hold elections and declare unity the same day 
kohls decision followed a daylong parliamentary debate in 
which the opposition social democrats insisted they would not give 
him the twothirds majority necessary for a constitutional change 
needed to move up elections 
in addition the east german parliament failed thursday to 
approve new electoral rules for an oct 14 election 
also thursday kohl said the cost of bailing out beleaguered 
east germany is exceeding expectations 
up until thursday kohl had been able to set the pace of unity 
more or less according to his own plans to ensure continued control 
for his conservative coalition in the new germany 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced kohls change in 
position during a meeting of the german unity committee of 
government ministers according to participants who spoke later on 
condition of anonymity 
the west german social democrats welcomed abandonment of what 
they termed kohls and de maizieres nonsensical plan for 
elections and unity oct 14 
a spokesman for the east german social democrats said the party 
was pleased to see dec 2 confirmed as the date for allgerman 
elections 
it is not an earlier election date but quick unity that 
creates the necessary framework for secure investments said 
social democrats spokesman juergen itzfeldt 
the social democrats demand unity first then elections dec 2 
west germany has previously said that unity should not occur 
before the sept 12 meeting in moscow of the four world war ii 
allies and the two germanys to wrap up the twoplusfour talks 
on international aspects of german unity 
the two germanys are finishing work on a unification treaty that 
paves the way for the legal merger of the two countries it is 
expected to be finished by late august or early september 
kohl had also hoped to have a treaty regulating allgerman 
elections ratified by both parliaments by thursday evening 
but the measure just barely failed to get the needed twothirds 
majority in the east german parliament and west german lawmakers 
decided to postpone their own vote until aug 23 east german 
lawmakers are to consider the measure again aug 22 
the treaty in all likelihood will be passed on those dates but 
the delays put a time squeeze on the west german chancellors hopes 
of making the constitutional change necessary for oct 14 elections 
the social democrats had charged that kohl wanted to speed up 
elections out of fear voters will turn against him as east 
germanys economy further unravels but kohl maintained that 
earlier elections would be best for helping ensure economic and 
social stability in east germany

farmers are looking at a potential 1990 corn 
harvest of 785 billion bushels up 4 percent from last year the 
agriculture department said thursday 
at 785 billion bushels this falls harvest would be the 
largest since 825 billion bushels in 1986 the record was the 1985 
crop of nearly 89 billion bushels 
dry conditions in the southeastern states have reduced yields 
in most areas from the record levels of 1989 said the 
departments agricultural statistics board 
but the report added that late plantings in the corn belt have 
been offset by excellent growing conditions in july 
farmers harvested 753 billion bushels in 1989 and the 
department a month ago projected this years output might be 785 
billion bushels based on yield trends and normal weather 
thursdays figures were the first of the season by usda based on 
yield estimates and surveys reflecting conditions as of aug 1 
corn yields were estimated at 1177 bushels per acre harvested 
compared with 1162 last year the record was 1194 bushels in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop it is an essential ingredient for the production of 
meat poultry and dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb 6 percent or more in 1990 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 184 billion bushels down 5 percent from 
last years harvest of 193 billion bushels 
cotton production was indicated at 149 million bales up 22 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales 
total wheat output was estimated at 271 billion bushels up 33 
percent from the 1989 harvest and fractionally more than indicated 
in july 
the departments allcrops production index was reported at 111 
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison that is the 
highest reading since the index averaged 116 percent in 1985 
last year although crop production rebounded sharply from the 
1988 drought total output averaged only 106 percent the record 
was 117 percent in 1981 and 1982 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 199091 marketing year which 
begins sept 1 is expected to be about 7975 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements 
with demand exceeding 1990 corn production that will mean a 
further drawdown of us stockpiles to about 12 billion bushels 
left over by sept 1 1991 down from inventories estimated at 133 
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year this sept 1 
but that represents only a slight dip in the us corn 
stockpile compared to last seasons decline when it plummeted 
from 426 billion bushels on sept 1 1988 to 193 billion bushels 
on hand last sept 1 
the report said us corn prices may average in the range of 
235 to 275 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year compared 
with 238 forecast for the current season 
soybean prices at the farm were forecast at 550 to 7 per 
bushel in 199091 compared with 570 in the last marketing year 
the report said farm prices of wheat may average 265 to 305 
per bushel compared with 372 the last two marketing years 
other 1990 crop estimates based on aug 1 indications compared 
with 1989 output included 
sorghum 5468 million bushels and an average yield of 591 
bushels per acre compared with 6179 million and 554 in 1989 
rice 1581 million hundredweight and a yield of 5611 pounds 
per acre compared with 1545 million and 5749 
peanuts 418 billion pounds and a yield of 2449 pounds per 
acre compared with 399 billion and 2426 
tobacco 152 billion pounds and a yield of 2102 pounds per 
acre compared with 137 billion and 2016 
sugar beets 281 million tons and a yield of 204 tons per 
acre compared with 251 million and 194 
sugar cane 249 million tons and a yield of 351 tons per 
acre compared with 294 million and 345

iraq announced thursday its borders were closed to foreigners 
apparently meaning both arriving and departing arab evacuees 
reaching jordan said thursday a group of westerners trying to leave 
iraq had been stopped just before the jordanian border 
about 400 americans are believed stranded in iraq and 3000 in 
kuwait their plight raised fears the iraqis might seize them as 
hostages 
the americans in baghdad include 38 who were transported from 
kuwait to the iraqi capital after the invasion in washington the 
white house said the 38 still were not being allowed to leave their 
hotel which was ringed by armed guards spokesman marlin fitzwater 
also said we have been told that diplomats only will be 
allowed to leave 
meanwhile some misgivings began to emerge in washington about 
the us role on the front line of the arab crisis particularly in 
the absence of broad arab backing 
if it appears that its the united states and saudi arabia 
versus the rest of the arab world then that is not going to be in 
our longterm interest or saudi arabias interest said sen sam 
nunn dga armed services committee chairman he expressed 
support for the deployment but said a large longterm us presence 
is not desirable

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday it will require an 80 percent reduction of sulfur in 
diesel fuel starting oct 1 1993 
the new requirement is expected to add from 18 to 23 cents per 
gallon to the cost of the fuel the agency said 
diesel exhaust has been identified as a potential cause of 
cancer epa administrator william k reilly said the sulfur 
reduction requirement and new standards to reduce particulates 
beginning in 1991 will virtually eliminate the black smoke from 
diesel tailpipes cutting particulates by 90 percent 
the most impact will be felt in urban areas where pollution is 
heaviest and the most people are exposed reilly said in a 
statement 
however the private environmental defense fund said the epa 
plan doesnt go far enough because it does not reduce aromatics 
chemicals the defense fund says are responsible for almost half the 
particulate emissions in some cities 
the epa said it will control aromatics at about current 
levels by requiring a performance rating for diesel fuel or an 
optional maximum aromatics content standard 
that plan doesnt take advantage of a major strategy to help 
clean up polluted cities thats relatively cost effective and 
cleans up emissions from every vehicle on the road that burns 
diesel said bob yuhnke a senior attorney with the defense fund 
he said epas steps will result in a 15 to 20 percent reduction 
in particulate emissions from diesel fuel compared to a 35 to 40 
percent reduction in california which has reduced both sulfur and 
aromatics 
the new epa sulfur rule is based on a 1988 proposal developed 
jointly by the dieselengine manufacturing and petroleum refining 
industries 
it requires refiners to reduce the sulfur content of diesel fuel 
used on the road from 25 percent by weight to 05 percent 
cost to refiners is expected to range from 380 million to 910 
million in 1995 and 540 million to 13 billion by 2010 
those costs will be at least partially offset for the consumer 
by cheaper emission control devices fuel savings from catalytic 
devices and possibly less wear on the engine epa said 
small refiners have until 1995 to phase in the new standards as 
they install equipment needed to remove the sulfur they will have 
to meet interim standards during that period 
from 1993 to 1995 fuel produced under the interim standards 
will be sold only for pre1994 engine equipped vehicles or to 
offhighway markets the epa said that is in order to protect 1994 
and later modelyear engine designs that will require only 
lowsulfur fuel 
the sulfur reductions are expected to help diesel engine 
manufacturers meet tighter particulate exhaust standards that will 
take effect in 1991 and 1994 the epa said the lower level of 
sulfur will reduce direct emissions of sulfate particulates and 
also reduce secondary formation of particulates in the atmosphere 
by 1995 particulates are projected to be down by 196000 tons a 
year sulfur dioxide levels should decrease by 580000 tons per 
year the agency said

secretary of state james a baker iii received 
pledges wednesday from turkey that its air bases could be used as 
staging areas for us military strikes against iraq in the event 
of war 
baker then flew to nato headquarters in brussels seeking a 
reaffirmation the allies would rush to turkeys defense if iraq 
attacked its neighbor 
bakers meetings in ankara with president turgut ozal and other 
turkish officials will expand military and intelligence cooperation 
with the frontline state which fears iraqi intimidation for 
effectively shutting down two oil pipelines and freezing trade with 
baghdad 
us and western diplomats said the turks took those steps 
reluctantly and that some 60000 turkish workers in iraq could be 
vulnerable as the usorganized economic boycott tightens 
turkey which stands to lose an estimated 3 billion a year in 
commerce with iraq received through baker an offer of some 
compensation from the oilrich kuwaiti royal family that was 
overthrown in the iraqi invasion 
for his part baker promised the united states would back turkey 
in its request for development loans from the world bank and would 
provide credits for turkey to import industrial machinery 
also an administration official said baker wrote a letter to 
the european community supporting turkeys application for 
membership in the 12nation european community 
as baker left ankara after a ninehour visit he was reluctant 
to discuss his request for permission to use an air base near the 
southern city of adana or smaller posts as a staging area in the 
event of a us attack on iraq 
the united states has a military force of 2400 at the 
turkishoperated training facility and rotates up to two dozen 
f111 bombers there similar to the planes used in a 1986 raid 
against libya 
turkey is also strategically located for gathering intelligence 
on the soviet union iraq and other middle eastern countries 
the use for which we can utilize those bases is well 
understood baker said im not going to speculate about 
possible hypotheticals 
later on the flight to brussels an administration official 
briefing reporters on bakers meetings said that in the event 
there were to be fullscale hostilities i am quite confident that 
we could count upon our allies the turks 
the official who demanded anonymity added weve long had 
cooperative military relationships with turkey i think the turks 
see the threat that president saddam hussein represents and i 
think they see the threat his longrange missile capability and his 
chemical weapons capability presents to many many nations 
describing turkey as exposed to a potential iraqi attack 
the official said i think they know that the allies are going to 
be there and that the united states is going to be there and they 
are going to be there for the united states 
on the other hand baker said turkey had not committed itself to 
join the multinational force the united states is organizing to 
enforce the economic sanctions approved by the un security 
council 
turkey has not and thats a question that the turkish 
government will have to consider baker said 
the strategy of the bush administration is to encircle iraq with 
a diverse group of nations including turkey a staunch us ally 
in nato and two bitter adversaries syria and iran 
baker was cheered by the unanimous un security council vote 
condemning iraqs annexation of kuwait 
our strategy from the very beginning is to try to bring about 
as much of an international consensus in condemnation of this 
action and support of an immediate withdrawal as we could an 
administration official said 
asked if he would like saddam hussein to look at a map and see 
all those countries lining up against him the official broke into 
a grin 
yeah you bet he said 
in brussels on friday baker will meet with the 15 nato foreign 
ministers to try to organize a military blockade to back up the 
uns economic boycott 
the crisis over iraq apparently will benefit saudi arabia in at 
least one way 
the official said the bush administration would revive a plan to 
sell 20 f15 jet fighters to saudi arabia hoping the threat iraq 
poses to saudi oil fields would convince congressional critics not 
to try to block the deal

the eerie silence is often broken by the 
sound of gunshots in the deserted streets of kuwait city where 
soldiers of the iraqi invasion army squat and sleep on the 
sidewalks travelers reported thursday 
after reaching manama the travelers told of beatings 
humiliations and looting they said were committed by iraqi soldiers 
they said the iraqis often knock on doors and ask frightened 
kuwaitis for cold water sometimes they ask for food mainly beef 
and fruit 
kuwaiti refugee youssef alrashidi 26 told the associated 
press in an interview at the plush diplomat hotel that in the 
sweltering summer heat profusely sweating iraqis soldiers look 
tired and i would say ashamed of themselves 
a number of iraqi soldiers came to us and tried to calm us 
down saying we will do you no harm we have nothing against 
you we only carry out orders he said 
but my companions here have different things to tell you 
about not all iraqi soldiers are good some of them are sons of 
disgrace 
he pointed to four other young kuwaiti men who quickly nodded 
approval one claimed that iraqi soldiers were not begging for 
but forcing local residents to give them bottles of cold water and 
fruit 
i saw iraqi soldiers heap in trucks sacks of money and bits of 
furniture stolen from the gulf bank said another my brother 
essa saw iraqi soldiers loot the alghanem and albabtain car 
showrooms 
another kuwait refugee who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity claimed he saw from a distance jewelry shops being 
looted 
i saw iraqi soldiers armed with rifles stop uniformed kuwaiti 
soldiers force them to remove the uniforms and then order them to 
return home in their underwear he said 
kuwaiti businessman mohsen alajmi 28 said he took part in 
garbage removal and maintenance operations to help housewives whose 
husbands were stranded outside kuwait when the iraqis struck 
we supplied these families with food and gas cylinders for 
cooking he said we also took part in minor resistance 
operations knocked down two iraqi soldiers with our speeding car 
and distributed antisaddam leaflets 
he was referring to iraqi president saddam hussein 
there are committees at district and suburb levels to help out 
kuwaiti families in many ways i saw a number of palestinians take 
part in street patrols alongside the iraqis these must be 
palestinians loyal to arafat but there are other palestinians who 
curse saddam and arafat and fight alongside kuwaiti resistance 
many kuwaitis accuse plo chairman yasser arafat of backing the 
invasion and denounce him 
alajmi said iraqi soldiers at an intersection stopped him and 
others two days ago for questioning 
they did not search us in fact they apologized and cursed 
saddam one said why are we here we have been hurting kuwaitis 
and drinking warm water in this heat when saddam sits there in his 
airconditioned palace he said 
alajmi said the iraqis spotted two egyptian workers passing 
nearby called them asked them to show identity cards and then 
said egyptians you dont deserve to live 
they beat the two egyptians so savagely that we implored them 
to stop they let the egyptians go they were hurt quite badly 
most expatriate workers have left kuwait a shipping company 
executive said 
he said he communicated with contacts in kuwait by radio earlier 
thursday i was told that probably more than 70 percent of the 
kuwaitis have left the country he said 
even before the invasion kuwaitis were a minority in their own 
country making up about 27 percent of the total population of 19 
million the rest are expatriate workers mostly palestinians 
egyptians iranians indians and pakistanis 
alajmi said resistance was getting weaker 
resistance is not really organized he said a number of 
kuwaiti soldiers and civilians have banded together in resistance 
nests and occasionally harass the iraqis 
but their stocks of weapons and ammunition not to mention 
food and other necessities are steadily getting scarce resistance 
can grow but not before we ensure adequate and secure supply 
routes to them from wherever allah deems fit 
travelers said iraqi soldiers scared away a group of stubborn 
kuwaiti women who demonstrated in the suleibikhat area the women 
were shouting long live jaber kuwait will never die down with 
saddam 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah is the deposed emir 
the iraqis thretened to shoot and scattered the women when 
they attacked and hit with rifle butts said one kuwait woman 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
other kuwaitis said they saw from behind window shutters iraqi 
women shouting down with jaber long live saddam hero of arab 
unity 
i saw that demonstration said 16yearold rasha alfaraj 
the womens accent was unmistakably iraqi they were guarded and 
protected by iraqi soldiers

even if other oilproducing nations start 
pumping to capacity the world will still have a million barrels a 
day less oil than before iraq invaded kuwait analysts said 
thursday 
prices this fall could double or even triple the june level 
they said 
the embargo imposed by the united nations on iraq after it 
invaded kuwait last week has removed 45 million barrels of oil 
from the market more than 9 percent of production in the 
noncommunist world 
if saudi arabia and the united arab emirates together increase 
their production to full capacity a big if analysts say 
together they could replace only 25 million barrels daily 
the energy department said thursday that iran also is 
considering increasing production by as much as 500000 barrels a 
day hoping to replace iraq as a key supplier to india and japan 
outside the middle east venezuela nigeria the united states 
and possibly great britain together could add another 1 million to 
15 million barrels to daily world production over time but that 
would still leave at least a 1 million barrel shortage 
if this offsetting surge capacity were brought on line it 
could reduce the temporary loss of iraqi and kuwaiti oil to a net 
loss of only 145 million barrels per day the energy department 
said in a statement 
prices of west texas intermediate crude soared from an average 
1770 last week to more than 28 on tuesday before settling around 
2585 thursday after president bush dispatched 5000 troops to 
help protect saudi oil fields 
but analysts predict prices will rise to the 3035 range in 
september and october if consuming countries dont fill the gap by 
tapping their emergency government stockpiles some maintain prices 
could rise above that range until the increased production is 
flowing 
prices will undoubtedly go higher possibly reaching 40 to 
50 per barrel in the absence of action by consuming nations 
said philip verleger an oil analyst for the institute of 
international economics 
the situation will only get worse if the embargo continues into 
the winter when cold weather will push the worldwide demand up 
another 3 million barrels experts say 
the fourth quarter is going to be a problem no matter how you 
slice it said adam sieminski an oil economist for washington 
analysis corp 
everybody seems to be hoping that this production will be 
coming on real fast but what if theres a hitch and a cold 
winter he said the system already is going to be stretched 
everywhere 
meanwhile the international energy agency meeting in paris 
took the first step thursday to what could result in a draw down of 
government stockpiles in europe the united states and japan to 
help fill temporary shortages 
although the agency traditionally has looked upon a 7 percent 
drop in supplies as the trigger point for scheduling a 
coordinated draw down the government energy officials stopped 
short of ordering one thursday doing it in response to the 9 
percent supply loss represented by kuwait and iraq 
instead they agreed to begin collecting daily statistics on 
stocks usage supplies and prices in what was described as 
gearing up to be capable to do something 
the united states has 587 million barrels of crude stored in its 
strategic petroleum reserve in texas and louisiana enough to 
replace the 750000 barrels of the country had been getting daily 
from iraq and kuwait for 800 days iraq and kuwait had supplied by 
5 percent of the us daily oil consumption of 176 million barrels 
japan which had relied on iraq and kuwait for 14 percent of its 
oil imports has 206 million barrels and germany 189 million 
barrels in reserve 
the bush administration contends that because of recent cuts in 
production by members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries enough producing capacity is available without tapping 
the emergency reserves as a price control mechanism 
cheating by member nations on quotas imposed by opec had 
contributed to oil prices dropping from 23 a barrel last january 
to 1550 in midjune 
in response to an opec meeting then when exporting countries 
agreed to quit cheating on the quotas totaling 225 million barrels 
a day prices had risen back to 20 by the end of july

magellan the first us planetary 
spacecraft launched in 12 years reaches venus on friday raising 
nasas hopes for a major success after its woes with the hubble 
space telescope and the shuttle fleet 
were just thrilled to be here and are rarin to go were 
just as excited as we can be said john mccarthy magellan 
program manager for hughes aircraft co hughes built the science 
instruments on the 21footlong spacecraft 
at noon pdt thursday magellan was only 242009 miles from 
venus speeding toward the cloudshrouded planet at 10398 mph it 
was 144 million miles from earth but had traveled 9463 million 
miles since it was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 
the 413 million spacecraft centerpiece of a 744 million 
mission was scheduled to zoom over venus north pole and then drop 
into orbit after it fires its braking rocket at 932 am pdt 
friday the spacecraft will be behind venus at the time so 
engineers wont know if all went well until about half an hour 
later 
after a few weeks of tests magellan will start using its radar 
by sept 1 to penetrate the thick venusian clouds and make pictures 
and maps of the planets surface 10 times more detailed than those 
returned by the soviet venera 15 and 16 spacecraft which were 
launched in 1983 
during a news conference thursday at the national aeronautics 
and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory engineers and 
scientists expressed confidence that magellans rocket will fire 
properly and place the vessel in orbit 
magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary 
exploration kicking off a decade in which unmanned craft will 
study jupiter mars asteroids comets and saturn said wesley t 
huntress jr nasas director of solar system exploration were 
looking forward to the drama 
magellan is the first us planetary spacecraft launched since 
1978 when nasa sent the pioneer 12 orbiter and the pioneer 13 
probes to venus 
if magellans rocket fails to ignite the spacecraft would fly 
past venus uselessly and wouldnt encounter the planet again for 
100 years said tony spear magellan project manager at the 
laboratory 
nasa has been plagued by trouble lately including temporary 
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen fuel leaks and a 
defective mirror that largely crippled the 15 billion hubble 
space telescope 
the major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed 
huntress said id prefer not to speculate on what failure might 
mean 
if magellan works as planned it will return more data than all 
previous nasa missions combined said steve saunders nasas chief 
scientist for magellan 
venus is similar to earth is size density and position in the 
solar system magellan will studys the planets geology and 
geography to learn if its geological processes are similar to those 
on earth which is shaped by volcanoes and largescale movements of 
gargantuan plates of the planets crust 
venus really is our sister planet saunders said we need 
to know a lot more about that planet to understand more about our 
own 
the raw radar echoes collected by magellan will be returned to 
nasa deep space network antennas in california spain and 
australia then converted into pictures at the jet propulsion 
laboratory 
nasa expects to release the first pictures next month unless a 
major discovery is made during radar tests this month 
magellan is named for portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan 
who circumnavigated the world in the early 1500s

reporters life goes on 
barbara bush has been staying at the summer home by herself 
since july 27 she flew to washington for the day thursday and will 
return to kennebunkport with the president friday 
the president will be conducting the business of the 
presidency at kennebunkport just as he does every year and every 
vacation press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
that goes on 24 hours a day every day of the week wherever 
he is the spokesman added 
but bush is also expected to make a quick trip back to the 
capital on wednesday for a comprehensive briefing from military 
planners on the status of the us forces sent to saudi arabia

sophisticated communications equipment and is heavily protected on 
land by the secret service and at sea by coast guard ships hovering 
offshore 
the president has hosted world leaders during past vacations 
top advisers shuttled back and forth from washington last august as 
bush readied his national drug strategy 
while the president has not announced a vip guest list for this 
vacation fitzwater said bush will have full access to one of his 
favorite instruments of diplomacy the telephone 
we believe that the communications system is excellent for 
maintaining liaison with anyone in washington or around the world 
that the president should need to get in touch with the 
spokesman said 
he said the white house never seriously considered cancelling 
the vacation plans 
asked if the president was not concerned about being 
photographed out boating or on the golf course while american gis 
in saudi arabia are worried about a possible chemical weapons 
attack by iraq fitzwater answered no 
bush has gone to kennebunkport every summer of his life except 
1944 when he was off in the pacific flying bomber missions for the 
navy against the japanese in world war ii 
either bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft or his 
deputy robert gates always accompanies bush to kennebunkport and 
provides daily briefings on the latest us intelligence from hot 
spots around the world 
our forces are in saudi arabia on a defensive basis theyre 
not involved in conflict and theres not the need for any kind of 
minutebyminute or hourbyhour update that might be necessary if 
they were actually involved in combat said fitzwater 
he said bushs budget advisers also may make the trip to 
kennebunkport at some point to prepare for the resumption of 
deficitreduction talks with congressional democrats in early 
september

arab leaders gathered thursday for an 
emergency summit seen as a lastditch diplomatic effort to end the 
persian gulf crisis without outside military intervention 
the summit originally planned thursday was postponed a day 
the official reason for the postponement was some late arrivals 
however unconfirmed reports said the summit hit a snag because 
the iraqi delegation brought its own representative for the new 
baghdadinstalled kuwaiti government most delegates to the summit 
reject that government 
one of those arriving the ousted kuwaiti emir who is still 
recognized by most arab governments as the sheikdoms ruler wept 
as an egyptian military band played the kuwaiti national anthem 
senior iraqi officials are representing iraqi president saddam 
hussein who appointed a kuwaiti cabinet loyal to him after his 
troops swept away the royal government 
president hosni mubaraks press secretary mohamed abdelmoneim 
told reporters that representatives to the summit would be arriving 
as late as friday forcing delay of the meeting 
organizers said that of 21 arab league countries only tunisia 
and mauritania were still absent late thursday 
mubarak organized the summit to discuss last weeks invasion of 
kuwait by iraq he said he hoped the meeting would forestall any 
western military attack to punish saddam 
the united states has sent troops and materiel to saudi arabia 
as part of a multinational force to guard against possible threats 
from iraq 
a source close to the summit told the associated press the arabs 
want to give saddam a final chance to resolve the crisis peacefully 
the arab leaders want to do their duty by iraq once and for 
all to give her a final chance to reverse what she has done 
said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
if this effort fails and there is no response from iraq then 
he saddam deserves what he will get we are almost certain that 
there will be an external strike against him the question is 
when 
on wednesday when he requested the emergency summit mubarak 
warned iraq would be the target of a harsh strike by western 
powers if it refused to withdraw from kuwait 
he said in the nationally televised speech that the summit 
would be better than having a solution forced on us by foreign 
powers 
answering his call arab leaders swarmed in thursday their 
private jetliners lined up at cairo international airport like 
limousines in a parking lot 
included in the iraqi delegation were taha yassin ramadan first 
deputy premier and a member of the ruling junta and foreign 
minister tarek aziz 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah kuwaits deposed emir looked 
weary and thinner than usual as he stepped in his white robes from 
a blueandwhite kuwait airways jetliner 
the playing of the anthem evoked tears from the emir and his 
entire delegation it symbolized the refusal of egypt and most 
other arab states to recognize iraqs appointed government in 
kuwait 
on wednesday iraq said it had annexed kuwait the un security 
council declared the move null and void on thursday 
the conference source said egypt would demand that iraq withdraw 
from kuwait and return alsabah to the throne held by his family 
for more than 230 years 
egypt also would propose possible formation of a joint arab 
force to serve as a buffer between iraq and kuwait after saddams 
troops withdraw the source said 
he said the proposed arab force would not interfere with the 
usled multinational force 
the gathering is the first arab league summit in egypt since 
october 1976 egypts membership was suspended in 1979 to retaliate 
for its peace treaty with israel mubarak has attended two arab 
summits since cairo regained its league seat last year

federal regulators moved thursday to recover 
409 million from charles h keating jr and five associates for 
losses the regulators claim the failed lincoln savings and loan 
suffered from sour business deals 
the office of thrift supervision also demanded a complete 
accounting within five days of keatings personal assets as it 
seeks restitution from the arizona businessman and his associates 
ots director timothy ryan said regulators do not believe 
keatings repeated claim that he went broke when his american 
continental corp the phoenixbased holding company that owned 
lincoln filed for bankruptcy protection 
there was just too much money available to him and to short a 
time for it to disappear ryan told reporters at a news 
conference we believe mr keating and his associates profited 
from the improper use of depositors funds and we want that money 
returned to lincoln 
the 409 million is sought from keating and the five executives 
either individually or as a group ryan said it is the largest 
amount sought in a thrift restitution proceeding 
the administrative charges also seek to permanently bar keating 
and the five executives of american continental from the thrift 
industry and to remove them from the phoenixbased company 
the restitution is being sought to cover losses to the savings 
and loan from three business deals that ots attorney richard 
delliveneri said were evidence of blatant disregard for the 
safety and soundness of lincoln savings 
these include the 242 million lincoln lost when a subsidiary 
invested in a moneylosing detroit hotel and 44 million it lost 
from the purchase and resale of arizona desert land that regulators 
say falsely inflated the thrifts profits 
ots also seeks to recover 123 million lincoln lost to finance 
the purchase of american continental stock from keating and others 
by an employee stockownership plan 
the business deals allowed keating and his associates to take 
tax deductions and enjoy other personal financial benefits 
regulators charges ryan said ots was investigating other 
transactions involving lincoln and may file charges to seek more 
restitution from keating 
the irvine calif thrift made heavy investments in the junk 
bond market losing 2 billion before it was taken over by federal 
regulators on april 14 1989 american continental which keating 
chairs filed for bankruptcy protection a day before lincolns 
seizure 
keating could immediately challenge in federal court the 
temporary ceaseanddesist order which directs him to account for 
his assets and bars him from transferring anything worth 5000 
without first informing ots 
the ots charges will be heard by an administrative law judge in 
late october ryan said a final ots decision can be appealed to 
federal circuit courts 
besides keating the ots charges were also filed against judy j 
wischer president and chief executive officer of american 
continental robert j kielty a director senior vice president 
and general counsel of the company keatings son charles h 
keating iii an executive vice president and director and two of 
keatings sonsinlaw who are vice presidents robert j hubbard 
and robert m wurzelbacher jr 
ots also seeks their removal as american continental officers 
bradley boland keatings soninlaw and a spokesman for 
american continental said thursday that the six executives will 
take every legal opportunity that is available to fight the 
charges 
boland scoffed at the allegations calling them the same old 
wine from the same old bottle and accusing ots of political 
grandstanding 
a 11 billion racketeering and fraud suit filed in september 
against keating and his associates by the federal deposit insurance 
corp and the resolution trust corp charges they fraudulently 
diverted depositors money for business dealings 
separately a federal grand jury in los angeles is investigating 
keatings dealings at lincoln 
the justice department is also examining whether keating 
improperly donated 13 million to five senators who met on his 
behalf with federal regulators in 1987 law enforcement sources say 
the senate ethics committee is reviewing allegations of improper 
intervention with regulators by the five senators dennis 
deconcini dariz john mccain rariz alan cranston dcalif 
donald w riegle jr dmich and john glenn dohio

a black fbi agent who charged in civil suits 
he was racially harassed by white agents will receive full pay and 
pension benefits possibly worth more than 1 million under a 
settlement of the case his lawyer said thursday 
attorneys for donald rochon 40 and the fbi signed an agreement 
this week that settles the threeyearold legal battle arising from 
the black agents charges he was harassed by white colleagues when 
he worked in the fbis chicago office 
the settlement is a further admission by the fbi of racial 
problems in its ranks 
officials earlier this year acknowledged that the fbi had 
settled three other racial discrimination suits including one 
involving 30 employees of the fingerprint identification division 
the fbi announced the settlement with rochon on wednesday but 
declined to give details 
rochon who has been on disability leave since april because of 
emotional stress will receive full compensation and full pension 
benefits under the terms of the settlement said his attorney 
david kairys of philadelphia 
rochon will remain on disability leave until he is eligible to 
retire in 11 years kairys said as a result of the emotional 
strain he never wants to go back to the fbi the lawyer said 
the fbi has also agreed to award rochon some back pay for a 
promotion the agent claims he was unfairly denied kairys said it 
will also pay rochons former wife susan a sum of money as 
compensation kairys said the attorney declined to disclose the 
amount of that sum 
but overall the lawyer said the entire settlement could be 
worth more than a million dollars 
the fbi also agreed to conduct a full investigation of rochons 
claims and make public its findings by next april rochon said 
under the terms of the settlement rochon will receive disability 
payments under a finding by the labor department that he is 
entitled to federal workmens compensation for his emotional 
distress kairys said 
in addition the fbi will pay the difference between the 
disability insurance and what rochon would earn if he remained with 
the fbi after a year of further leave rochon will be formally 
separated from the bureau but will continue to receive raises and 
get a pension when he reaches retirement age in 11 years kairys 
said 
agents become eligible to retire on their 51st birthday 
rochon will be paid the average salary of fbi agents who joined 
the bureau when he did in 1981 taking into account promotions that 
some of his colleagues received kairys said this provision of the 
settlement gives rochon the socalled front pay allowed in 
civil rights law for employees who are forced to leave hostile work 
environments 
rochon also received as 6000 award to cover moving expenses 
that the fbi originally refused to pay when he was transferred at 
his request from chicago to philadelphia 
kairys said weeklong negotiations ended with the signing of a 
settlement agreement on wednesday motions to dismiss the 
complaints will be filed in federal courts in both chicago and 
washington where rochon had suits pending 
kairys expressed surprise that the fbi had agreed to settle the 
case after refusing to do in the past 
several years ago the federal judge who presided over the 
washington case had urged justice department lawyers and attorneys 
representing individual agents named in the complaint to settle the 
case but those talks broke down quickly 
rochon claimed his family received threatening telephone calls 
and letters including one that contained a picture of the 
dismembered body of a black man another contained a bulls eye 
superimposed with a picture of a black man 
one white fbi agent gary w miller acknowledged in a 1985 
affidavit that he forged rochons signature on an application for a 
death and dismemberment insurance policy for the black agents 
family 
another chicago agent richard ganslein was recently added to 
the suit in that city after the plaintiffs had discovered he had 
admitted participating in the harassment kairys said

had michael dukakis become president two years 
ago kitty dukakis believes the pressure of life in the white house 
would have sent her out of control 
in excerpts from her new book now you know mrs dukakis 
blames many of her problems on her mother who was illegitimate 
learning that fact was the turning point in her life she said 
now you know describes in greater detail the extent of mrs 
dukakis already known addiction to drugs and diet pills her bouts 
with depression and her struggles with these problems also are 
futher revealed 
i am certain the first crisis would have sent me out of 
control i am equally certain that thrust into the smothering 
protective confines of the white house i would not have been able 
to seek proper help she writes in excerpts from septembers good 
housekeeping magazine the autobiography written with jane scovell 
will be available early next month 
mrs dukakis said there were periods of heavy drinking during 
the 1988 presidential campaign she said she panicked before new 
hampshires democratic primary because she realized her husband 
might win 
michael was good enough to be president for sure but was i 
worthy to be his partner in my despair i turned to alcohol she 
wrote 
at one point after dukakis lost to george bush she said her 
son john found her unconscious in a bedroom lying in my own 
vomit 
the book describes her drinking habits after the election 
on a typical day i would rise wait till my husband left and 
by 9 oclock in the morning cancel all my appointments i would go 
to the liquor cabinet in the dining room measure out three or four 
ounces of straight spirits and drink it down then id go 
upstairs shut the blinds unplug the phone and read till i passed 
out a process that usually took no more than 10 minutes two and 
a half hours later i would wake up and repeat the process 
mrs dukakis blames her late mother jane goldberg dickson for 
much of her alcohol and drug addiction and for a long history of 
low selfesteem

grandmother had given up her daughter on one condition that she be 
allowed to live with the adoptive couple as a nanny

she discovered in her mothers room the start of a 26year 
addiction

last year she was not suicidal but depressed she also said that 
last december when she took a handful of tylenolwithcodeine

security forces shot and killed three rioters 
thursday during unrest over austerity measures that sent the cost 
of food soaring by 300 percent or more 
soldiers patrolled the capital city of lima in armored cars 
brandishing automatic weapons and wearing ski masks for fear of 
retribution from rioters the violence broke out after prime 
minister juan hurtado miller announced economic austerity measures 
wednesday night in a bid to ease the worst economic crisis in 
perus history on thursday the government announced a new 
measure saying it has decided to float perus currency the inti 
the price of gasoline a government monopoly jumped from 7 
cents a gallon to more than 2 private bus lines halted runs 
thursday stranding thousands of people commuters fought one 
another for room in the back of pickup trucks 
police reported looting in a dozen small street markets in 
shantytowns that ring lima 
police and soldiers opened fire and killed a man and a woman 
among about 130 protesters who were burning rubber tires to block a 
highway 10 miles east of lima 
in ancon a beach town 25 miles north of lima a peruvian marine 
shot to death a man involved in a fight with other shoppers at a 
municipal food market 
tension in the capital had mounted in the days leading up to 
hurtados announcement many shops doubled their prices even before 
his address bread noodles beans sugar cooking oil and milk 
disappeared from store shelves 
the emergency economic package included elimination of subsidies 
to cut a huge budget deficit which hurtado blamed for perus 3000 
percent annual inflation 
the decision to let the currency float means its value will be 
determined by supply and demand the subsidized dollar cost only 
about onesixth of the freemarket dollar in the final days of the 
previous government of president alan garcia 
perus inti is expected to quickly fall on the open market 
lowering the price of the countrys exports on the world market 
however the move will bring much higher prices for imported goods 
the government must exercise leadership even if it means a 
loss of its popularity said hurtado who also is economy 
minister in the new centrist government of president alberto 
fujimori 
fujimoris predecessor garcia was a populist who spent the 
countrys last dollar reserves before leaving office july 28 
what we are suffering today was originated by a government 
that treated us all like guinea pigs to try out its wonderful 
theory that a nation can indiscriminately increase its deficit by 
printing money without affecting prices hurtado said in a 
television address 
weighed down by hyperinflation perus economy shrank 20 percent 
in the last two years four of five people are out of work 
starting now hurtado said perus new government would not 
spend more than it receives in tax revenues he said public 
services must charge enough to cover their costs 
the emergency package also includes special taxes on the rich 
reduction of import duties to open up the economy to competition 
from foreign goods and a wage bonus for workers equivalent to 
their july pay 
some observers have suggested fujimori will have to use the army 
to keep order in the face of the harsh economic measures he named 
two army generals to head the defense ministry and the interior 
ministry which controls the police forces 
most public markets in the capital were closed thursday troops 
were sent to huancayo a major commercial center 120 miles from 
lima to prevent looting shops stayed closed in arequipa perus 
secondbiggest city 465 miles southeast of the capital 
the dollar doubled in value on limas parallel street market 
jumping from 200000 intis to 400000 in three days on thursday it 
fell back to about 350000 intis 
during a brief visit wednesday vice president dan quayle said 
the united states supported fujimoris austerity measures and 
expressed confidence the reforms would put this country back on 
the road to economic recovery 
he said the bush administration was seeking congressional 
approval for 160 million in military and economic aid for peru in 
1991

americans strongly support president bushs 
decision to send troops to saudi arabia even though most believe 
the united states is headed toward war with iraq according to 
polls released thursday 
survey respondents also supported the embargo of iraqi oil and 
many said they would accept higher gasoline prices to make it work 
but most blamed last weeks jumps in gasoline prices on oil company 
greed not the embargo 
iraq invaded neighboring kuwait last week and annexed it 
wednesday bush dispatched us troops to deter an iraqi attack on 
saudi arabia explaining his move in a televised address to the 
nation wednesday 
usa today in a survey of 610 people wednesday found that 81 
percent supported sending troops to saudi arabia cbs news 
surveying 773 people tuesday and wednesday found 63 percent 
approval and a poll of 769 people wednesday by abc news and the 
washington post found 74 percent support 
however the cbs poll indicated military action was not 
americans first choice asked the best response to iraq 42 
percent said hold off for the time being and 35 percent favored 
using diplomatic and economic weapons just 13 percent favored 
military force the rest favored some combination or were unsure 
the bottom line is basically this is a popular action said 
kathleen a frankovic pollster for cbs while there may be 
clouds over the horizon right now theyre still in the distance 
polls conducted on breaking news events tend to measure visceral 
reactions and the surveys found immediate fears of war were high 
seventythree percent in the usa today poll said us forces are 
likely to end up in combat against iraqi forces 
similarly 66 percent in the cbs poll called it likely that the 
situation in the middle east will lead to an extended war involving 
the united states twentytwo percent called that very likely 
44 percent somewhat likely 
in the usa today and cbs surveys 49 percent favored using us 
troops to try to force iraq out of kuwait support for economic and 
political sanctions was considerably higher 
in the abcpost survey 69 percent favored a naval blockade of 
iraq but strong majorities opposed us military strikes against 
iraq 
on the oil embargo 68 percent told cbs it was a good idea even 
if it meant higher prices and 50 percent said they would support 
the embargo even if it made gasoline prices reach 2 per gallon 
fortynine percent told usa today they would pay an additional 50 
cents or more per gallon to make the embargo work 
but most said the embargo was not the culprit in recent price 
increases eightyseven percent in the abcpost poll and 84 percent 
in the cbs poll said gasoline companies were using the crisis as an 
excuse to raise prices 
the telephone surveys had error margins of plus or minus four 
percentage points

however an administration official speaking privately said 
theres a certain minimum force we have to put over there as a 
deterrent for now were marching ahead with it 
a pentagon source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united states was prepared to put many divisions in saudi 
arabia 
we have contingency plans that could result in the insertion 
of up to 200000 to 250000 ground forces before its all done

examination of the spacecraft friday said agency spokeswoman lisa 
malone 
the newly repaired columbia which took atlantis place at the 
launch pad was not affected by the high winds and heavy rain 
atlantis 3mile trip back to the hangar for repair of a 
hydrogen leak took nearly six hours and ended around 4 am 
thursday just outside the doors of the crowded vehicle assembly 
building shortly before 6 am columbia was rolled from the 
structure and out to the pad 
it was the first time two shuttles had passed one another in 
upright launch positions 
nasa intended to roll atlantis into the hangar thursday 
afternoon after columbia had been secured at the launch pad 
lightning in the area however prevented atlantis from being moved 
until thursday night

hydrogen leak that was detected during fueling for a may 30 launch 
attempt the faulty fuel lines were replaced with components from 
the new shuttle endeavour under construction in california

thousands of american combat troops took up 
defensive positions thursday in the heart of saudi arabias vital 
oilproducing province as us military strategists prepared to 
fight a high intensity war on a vast scale 
the bush administration kept its official silence on details of 
the us troop deployment codenamed desert shield president 
bush ordered the operation monday saying he hoped to deter iraqi 
president saddam hussein from sending his millionman army into the 
kingdom the worlds largest oil exporter 
at least 2300 american ground troops landed in saudi arabia on 
the first day of the deployments wednesday and pete williams the 
chief pentagon spokesman said theres much more to come over 
the next several days and possibly weeks 
this is an operation that is going to continue for several 
days one might say many days williams told reporters 
as the buildup of iraqi forces in occupied kuwait swelled 
pentagon and administration sources revealed that military leaders 
have prepared longrange plans that could put 200000 to 250000 
us troops on saudi soil 
we have contingency plans that could result in the insertion 
of up to 200000 to 250000 ground forces before its all done 
said a pentagon source who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
united states is prepared to put many divisions on the ground 
the sources said the plan would be evaluated at each step and 
such a large force might never be necessary 
husseins response will determine exactly how much combat 
power we put on the ground the source said the idea of 
deterrence is to place your forces so that they never have to be 
used 
if deterrence fails and we fight it will be a highintensity 
war with many casualties many chemical casualties much equipment 
destroyed the oficial said it will mean warfare on a scale 
that we havent seen since world war ii 
a force of 250000 ground troops would account for a significant 
fraction of the fighting power of the 940000 activeduty troops in 
the army and the amrine corps it would also require thousands more 
in warships and airplanes in the theater of operations and in the 
supply train stretching back to the united states 
williams said us intelligence reports from the middle east 
indicated that saddam was sending additional troops into kuwait 
the tiny but oilrich country his forces seized a week ago 
prompting international sanctions and the us military response 
williams added however that there were no signs of offensive 
operations by the iraqis who numbered about 120000 in kuwait 
in a lateafternoon update the pentagon said if all iraqi 
combat units that were moving south in iraq went as far as kuwait 
they would increase the number of troops there to about 170000 
the statement said there seems to be some gathering of iraqi 
troops on the turkish border but no significant gathering is 
noted on the jordanian border 
the iraqi troops in kuwait seem to be in a defensive 
posture he said theyre holding on to what theyve 
acquired williams also said he could not confirm reports that 
iraq had readied chemical weapons in the border area 
the us forces though greatly outnumbered by a battlehardened 
iraqi army have sophisticated air and naval weapons designed to 
shatter advancing armored columns that would have to cross desert 
wastelands to reach saudi oil fields

preventing thousands of foreigners from leaving that country and 
kuwait western european diplomats said thursday 
some us british and other western nationals trying to leave 
iraq by road were stopped near the iraqi desert border post of 
rutbah said arab travelers who reached jordan 
a jordanian news report said a group of americans who had been 
transferred from kuwait to iraq were trying thursday to cross into 
jordan however there was no independent confirmation of that 
report 
despite earlier assurances that foreign tourists could leave 
reports reaching rome indicated they were being turned back said 
an italian foreign ministry spokesman 
at the moment the situation isnt very encouraging said 
the italian official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
british foreign office officials in amman said only foreign 
diplomats will now be allowed passage across iraqi borders 
in london a british foreign office spokesman said he believes 
the borders of kuwait which was annexed wednesday by iraq are 
also being closed by the iraqi order 
these were iraqi frontiers which i assume in iraqi terms now 
includes the frontiers of kuwait said the spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
iraqi officials on thursday notified italian diplomats of the 
border closing western european diplomats said italy holds the 
current presidency of the european community 
italy had asked that iraq observe the geneva convention 
providing for the protection of civilians in occupied territory in 
this case kuwait the request filed on behalf of western countries 
including the united states also asked baghdad to assure that any 
foreigner who wanted to leave could do so 
the aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq has trapped thousands of 
westerners in both countries 
there are about 2600 citizens of ec countries in iraq about 
3700 are in kuwait including about 3000 british according to 
the italian embassy in baghdad there are about 3000 americans in 
kuwait and 580 in iraq 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
thursday that iraqi officials have refused exit visas to americans 
and other foreigners in the two countries 
us officials have focused their concern on 38 americans at the 
hotel rashid in baghdad almost all were bused from kuwait by iraqi 
authorities last week and are confined to the hotel under armed 
guard but the state department is refusing to call them hostages 
jordans official petra news agency said earlier thursday that a 
small group of us citizens who had been transferred to baghdad 
from kuwait last week were waiting at rutbah for transport to 
jordan 
the petra correspondent allowed to reach rutbah quoted michael 
sabah a stranded american as saying he was rounded up with other 
us citizens in kuwait after the occupation and taken to baghdad 
we stayed at one of the baghdad hotels and we were free to 
leave any time i am here with other americans to find a us 
embassy official to arrange our transportation to jordan his 
home town was not given 
there was no report of their situation late thursday 
a state department spokesman in washington said he knew of no 
other group of americans transferred from kuwait besides the 38 at 
the baghdad hotel however he said it was possible another group 
exists 
the italian official said iraq initially agreed that foreign 
tourists and those in transit at the time of the invasion could 
leave he said an initial wave of people including many japanese 
had been allowed to depart 
jordanian officials said thousands of foreigners mainly arabs 
had fled kuwait in recent days they entered saudi arabia and then 
crossed the border into jordan 60 miles southeast of amman 
the italian official said however that foreign residents and 
businessmen were considered to be in another category from 
tourists requiring special exit permits he said those permits 
were not being granted 
arab evacuees arriving in jordan told the associated press 
thursday that westerners trying to leave iraq were stopped at 
traibel a few miles before the rutbah border post rutbah is 590 
miles west of baghdad the iraqi capital 
in turkey harry cole head of the us consulate in the 
southern city of adana said he waited at the nearby habur border

award in maritime history a japanese shipping company was ordered 
to pay 21 underpaid filipino sailors 32 million in back wages and 
punitive damages 
us district judge jack tanner said the delica shipping co 
which admitted underpaying the mv pine forests sailors on voyages 
between japan and the united states had acted in a flagrant 
malicious indifferent and unconscionable manner 
in his ruling monday tanner awarded the sailors 150000 in 
back pay 15 million in compensatory and penalty wages and 17 
million in punitive damages 
it was by far the largest wage award in maritime history said 
jim lafferty director of the new yorkbased center for seafarers 
rights the previous highest award was 26 million he said 
the vanuaturegistered pine forest carries douglas fir logs from 
weyerhaeuser co docks in tacoma and longview to ports in japan 
the seamen were recruited last year with employment contracts 
that left blank a space indicating their wages and later signed 
shipping articles promising them higher wages under a collective 
agreement with the worldwide international transport workers 
federation tanner said 
the sailors never got the higher pay 
us law gives federal courts jurisdiction over wage cases 
involving foreign vessels and crews whose voyages end in us

not long after a drug pusher was shot 
outside the nearby grammar school the woman who runs the newsstand 
in dos de mayo square caught her young son playing with a bloody 
syringe 
thank god the needle was capped otherwise he would have 
jabbed himself she said her eyes on the drug dealers sitting at 
their regular cafe tables ive seen everything here but that 
really scared me 
consumption of illegal drugs in spain has grown to the point 
that the government is drafting laws to punish users for the first 
time since democracy returned in 1977 laws passed three years ago 
provide tough penalties for traffickers and money launderers 
in 1983 soon after gaining power the socialist government of 
prime minister felipe gonzalez lifted restrictions on the 
possession of vaguely defined small amounts of drugs for 
personal use 
by deciding to change the rules the government is tacitly 
admitting spains drug problem is out of control it also is a 
response to pressure from other members of the european community 
partners to strengthen drug laws before the 12nation trading bloc 
abolishes internal borders in 1993 
we are heading for a new situation in europe and we need to 
bring our laws more in line with those of other ec countries 
said santiago de torres deputy director of the government 
antinarcotics program 
spain is one of the main european entry points for colombian 
cocaine moroccan hashish and heroin from turkey drugs confiscated 
by spanish police in 1989 made up 40 percent of the total in 16 
major european countries 
so far this year spanish police have seized more than 3800 
pounds of cocaine 480 pounds of heroin and 10 tons of hashish 
they describe it as a small portion of the total entering the 
country 
the drug bill which parliament is expected to pass in 
september imposes fines for consuming narcotics in public 
discarding syringes or allowing drug use in public places like bars 
and discos 
unlike italy which passed a new law earlier this year spain 
does not plan to imprison drug users 
we wont throw addicts in jail and scare them away from 
treatment centers de torres said he predicted italy also would 
not send drug users to jail whatever its new law says because 
theres no room in the jails and they dont believe its the 
definitive solution 
some spaniards want to give police more leeway to clean up 
druginfested neighborhoods they say dealers caught with small 
quantities of drugs now avoid conviction by claiming it is for 
their personal use 
half the 20000 people at a recent protest in barbate southern 
spain threatened smalltime heroin dealers and painted drugs 
sold here on pushers homes 
people who live in towns near gibraltar a british colony 
demand that heroin dealers and addicts be expelled from the 
country they say gibraltar is the base for drug smugglers who 
supply spains southern mediterranean coast 
agustin sahagun the conservative mayor of madrid called for 
tougher public consumption laws after the owners of archy a 
fashionable disco claimed police had no grounds to close it for 
alleged use of cocaine on the premises 
sahagun and other centrist and conservative politicians have 
criticized the initial permissiveness of the socialists 
gonzalez and many other socialist party leaders came of age in 
the 1960s when drug use was considered a protest against the 
authoritarian rule of gen francisco franco 
enrique tierno galvan the venerable socialist mayor of madrid 
after francos death in 1975 once told a youthful audience to 
turn on and tune in 
francos tight control was enough to dissuade most spaniards 
from taking such advice now few dealers in dos de mayo bother to 
leave their tables when a patrol car pulls up at a cafe 
somebody would have to be pretty spaced out to do a deal here 
now but they can always go to some apartment a woman officer 
said we cant go in there without a judicial order

if mariah carey had never been born some record 
company executive would have surely invented her 
she has a sevenoctave voice and looks and ambition well beyond 
the whisper range she also can write and arrange songs 
the only question is why she had to wait until age 20 to hit it 
big 
for a year i couldnt pay someone to listen to my tape 
explained carey whose debut single the 1950sstyled ballad 
vision of love quickly topped the charts 
they think if you dont have a highpowered manager or dont 
have a record company thats already interested in you youre no 
good i had no connections and i was running with my writing 
partner ben margulies who was also new and didnt have any 
connections either she said 
after working in bars and restaurants around new york carey was 
signed by columbia records she had been singing backup for brenda 
kay starr a columbia artist and managed to get herself into a 
party attended by company president tommy mottola 
someone grabbed him and told him to listen to the tape 
carey recalled he got out in his car played it and turned 
around and came back to find me everything worked out 
dog owners beware careys range is so powerful that the two 
highest octaves are unintelligible to human ears this is a voice 
that can probably shatter glass and then put it back together that 
sounds as if shes taking the words and twirling them over her head 
like a cowboy with a lasso 
i was using my upper register on all in your mind she 
said of one song from her selftitled album what happened was at 
the end of it i did these vocal flips when i was doing it my 
voice split and went into a harmony if you hear it it splits i 
was saying get rid of that but everyone said no way were 
keeping that 
mariah carey includes 11 songs most of them cowritten by 
carey and margulies but if her life seems like a cinderella story 
youll have to listen hard for any prince charming here 
i dont wanna cry all in your mind alone in love 
and you need me are all about breaking up 
so when the morning comes you know ill be gone she sings 
in prisoner in vanishing and love takes time its 
already over 
a lot of those songs were written when i was kind of 
struggling before i had a record deal she said it was a 
harrowing emotional time in my life i was doing odd jobs and going 
towards this goal they werent necessarily all about 
relationships but they were about things happening in my life 
narada michael walden whose credits include aretha franklin and 
whitney houston produces along with rhett lawrence and ric wake 
carey whod just assume look after herself decided to accept the 
outside help for now 
they did put me with different producers that they wanted to 
have me work with and this being the first album i took a certain 
amount of direction from the record company she said you 
know they are taking a chance ideally though id like to be 
involved with everything 
carey born and raised in new york is the daughter of patricia 
carey a former singer with the new york city opera and a vocal 
coach her parents divorced when she was young 
childhood was a waiting game for mariah a gospel fan who knew 
she wanted to sing for a living at a time her classmates were 
dreaming of being doctors or astronauts 
id hang out with my friends and go to parties and just be 
stupid and goof off but when i was at home i was listening to 
music and writing songs she said i would go and work with ben 
or whoever i was working with i wasnt like an outcast being a 
musician i was like everyone else but really i wasnt 
you can find aspiring singers or actors in just about any new 
york restaurant but carey pushed for it just a little bit harder 
while her fellow employees were out partying after work carey was 
writing songs 
maybe she didnt make a lot of close friends that way she 
admits but there was business to take care of sweet destiny to 
achieve how long can you sit tight when seven octaves are just 
bursting to get outside 
i was doing all that because i wanted to get a record deal and 
make an album she said i can hang out and do things that 
arent productive or i can make an album 
now i like to take time out to go to a beach whenever i can 
spend time with my friends and family i just wanted it all to 
happen before it was too late

herman leonards admiration for jazz and his 
fascination with the people who play it led him to spend many late 
nights photographing the musicians in dark and smoky clubs 
i love to photograph interesting people musicians artists 
writers leonard said i get to know them and photograph them 
as i see them this is my passion 
the results of that passion are the 45 photos capturing jazz 
greats such as duke ellington dizzy gillespie billie holiday and 
charlie parker now touring the country in leonards images of 
jazz exhibit 
the exhibit will be in chicago at the catherine edelman gallery 
until aug 18 on the fourth stop of a 10gallery us tour the 
photos also will be shown in seven cities in europe 
leonards photos capture the 1940s and 50s jazz scene his 
backlighting technique plays light off the skin of many of the 
musicians highlighting the sweat on their foreheads an occasional 
smile of joy and frequent frowns of concentration 
i wanted to get images that for me personally were 
representative of the atmosphere leonard said in an interview 
leonard took the pictures in clubs around the world from new 
york to paris to los angeles but it wasnt until the 1980s when 
he was living in paris and a french publisher approached him about 
putting together a book of his jazz photos that he pulled them out 
after almost 20 years of neglect 
id put them in a cardboard box and stuck them under the 
bed said leonard whose photos were compiled into the 1985 book 
the eye of jazz 
the 67yearold photographer said age plays a big part in the 
reaction people have to his photo exhibit 
for the grayhaired guys it kind of revives a memory 
leonard said its different for the teenagers theyve heard 
and loved the music and it gives them a chance to feel what it was 
like to be there 
the exhibit has attracted everyone from jazz buffs to parents 
who try to explain who the musicians are to their small children 
said catherine edelman owner of the chicago gallery she added 
that leonards photos have such a mass appeal they are bringing a 
new audience into her gallery 
jazz crosses barriers its a concept they respect edelman 
said 
but nothing really prepared me for the amount of love coming 
out of people she said its not just dealing with fine art 
people go up to each other and ask hey have you ever seen dizzy 
play 
edelman said she also sees leonards photos as a kind of visual 
history 
i think they capture a special time a period well never be 
able to return to edelman said its nostalgia a record of 
time gone by

responding to the dramatic changes in eastern 
europe roman catholic bishops are sending factfinding goodwill 
delegations to that area renewing ties and checking on ways to 
help 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati said three 
delegations will fan out to various parts of eastern and central 
europe to ascertain needs and coordinate aid efforts 
these delegations represent the first major step in what the 
bishops envision as a substantial program of aid by american 
catholics to the longsuffering church in those countries 
equally important the delegations will be a key part of a 
process of renewing and deepening bonds of solidarity bonds 
that had been broken or severely weakened in the past decades due 
to government interference 
one delegation led by archbishop roger m mahony of los 
angeles visited hungary romania and bulgaria in early august a 
second led by archbishop theodore e mccarrick of newark nj 
will visit poland czechoslovakia and yugoslavia aug 1830 a 
third led by cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago and archbishop 
john l may of st louis will visit the soviet union aug 27 to

southern baptist moderates have called a national 
meeting aug 2325 to consider what to do in the face of a 
fundamentalist wing gaining fullscale control of the huge 
denomination 
the gathering in atlanta was called to explore ways to uphold 
principles that differ with the new fundamentalist directions and 
to consider alternate means for channelling giving to missions 
i think we are ripe for god to use us in creating something 
new and visionary and historic said the rev daniel vestal of 
dunwoody ga the moderates defeated candidate in june for the 
denominations presidency 
that victory by fundamentalists for the 12th year in a row 
completed their gradual control over agencies of the 149 
millionmember denomination 
a houstonbased moderate organization baptists committed and 
dunwoody called the atlanta meeting as a growing number of 
congregations across the country planned limits on giving to the 
denominations cooperative budget 
moderate discontent was intensified by the recent firing of the 
top editors of the denominations news agency baptist press 
indicating moderates have given up regaining influence over the 
denomination vestal said they dont plan to enter a presidential 
candidate in 1991

once it became a public matter united methodist 
bishops intervened and stopped it but church blessing of samesex 
unions still goes on some ministers say but quietly 
that is the nebulous aftermath in that denomination with 
similar inklings in others after bishops in washington dc and 
wisconsin blocked plans for sanctioning such unions 
by and large its done very quietly rather than publicly for 
obvious reasons said the rev george mclain of new york 
executive secretary of the methodist federation for social action 
despite such general statements specific cases are hard to pin 
down in mainline denominations but it happens and a woman pastor 
in san francisco says she implements it in her own way 
the rev kim a smith pastor of bethany united methodist 
church said she has led several celebrations of commitment 
between couples of the same sex and has talked with many pastors 
who provided similar services 
they have to be private about it she said in a telephone 
interview declining like others to identify them they have to 
do it in secret it can be dangerous for the pastor 
however she said the particular terminology used was part of 
the difficulty with church authorities against phrases seen as 
equating such ceremonies with holy matrimony or marriage 
there are a lot of semantics around the issue she said 
its very technical a very fine line thats what is being 
tested its a wideopen question 
ms smith chairs the national board of a reconciling 
congregations program in which 46 united methodist congregations 
so far have committed themselves to provide full ministerial 
services to homosexuals 
she said she requires the same standards for homosexual as 
heterosexual couples seeking church affirmation of their 
partnership whatever its called insisting that they go through 
preliminary counseling 
some homosexuals exchange rings while others dont she said 
they commit themselves to longterm relationships theyre active 
christians work go to camp pay their water bill all they want 
is what straight people have 
she noted four couples in her congregation have been together 
for more than 30 years two of them homosexual couples however 
she said the dominant culture doesnt acknowledge this longterm 
commitment between homosexuals 
the issue came to a head last may when dumbarton united 
methodist church in washington approved a new congregational 
policy affirming samesex unions and announcing two lesbians would 
exchange vows in a holy union ceremony 
however washington bishop joseph h yeakel strongly objected 
and the planned ceremony was canceled 
about the same time bishop david j lawson of sun prairie 
wis blocked a policy adopted by university methodist church at 
madison wis for celebrating holy union of samesex couples 
what was happening now was outside the pale of the church 
he said in a telephone interview 
some services there previously had joined samesex couples under 
a 1986 congregational policy recognizing samesex relationships 
but disavowed that the joining of the couples was a substitute 
for marriage lawson said 
he said 1988 changes in the churchs book of discipline made it 
definite that the congregation had overstepped church law in a 
planned liturgy for samesex holy union which was ruled out 
like most major denominations united methodism bars 
selfavowed practicing homosexuals from the ministry and 
specifies that marriage occurs only between men and women 
however the church terms homosexuals individuals of sacred 
worth who need the churchs ministry part of which includes 
validating marriages but that service was blocked for homosexual 
couples in the two cases 
in boston last february the episcopal parish of st john the 
evangelist blessed the covenanting of relationship between a 
lesbian couple despite the opposition of bishop david e johnson 
remonstrating parish priests for that service johnson said it 
was not an act of the episcopal church which does not sanction 
such relationships 
homosexual ties are openly condoned in some smaller 
denominations notably the unitarian universalist association and 
the mainly homosexual metropolitan community church it coined the 
term holy union for such services considering it equivalent 
to marriage 
similar services with various wordings go on sporadically behind 
the scenes in congregations of most major denominations ms smith 
said attributing that conclusion to conversations with other 
ministers 
however as to the number of such congregations she said she 
couldnt guess it may be a dozen it may be a hundred she 
said 
asked if any united methodists congregations were doing it now 
that the washington and wisconsin churches had been stopped from 
it robert lear the churchs washington information director said 
you can always find among the denominations 38000 
congregations a methodist preacher that has done everything 
irregular there is to do

leaders of all three countries have approved 
the integration of singapore with parts of indonesia and malaysia 
in a compact economic growth triangle designed to attract 
foreign capital 
the idea is to present singapore the southern tip of peninsular 
malaysia and several nearby indonesian islands as a single 
investment center not separate areas competing for capital 
no formal treaty or europeanstyle common market is planned 
officials said but cooperation would mean uniform standards of 
economic management and safeguards for investors in individual 
projects 
deputy prime minister goh chok tong of singapore proposed the 
idea in december his affluent citystate would seem at first 
glance to gain more than its poorer neighbors from such an 
arrangement 
singapore has only 27 million people and no hinterland its 
growth is limited by insufficient labor water and room to expand 
goh suggested the triangle could boom in the 1990s by combining 
the land labor water and gas of malaysias johor state and 
indonesias batam island with the managerial talent available in 
singapore 
as an added attraction the area could be promoted as a sort of 
caribbean tourist playground goh said with beach resorts on 
johor and batam and singapore for shopping 
president suharto of indonesia and malaysias prime minister 
mohamad mahathir endorsed the idea in june when suharto visited 
kuala lumpur 
we agreed that we should work together mahathir told 
reporters it will be beneficial for all three of us we can 
benefit from the prosperity and spending power of singapore and the 
spillover effect of its tourism industry 
singapore had 48 million tourists last year 
government and private planning groups were set up last year 
between johor and singapore and earlier this year between 
indonesia and singapore to expand cooperation and streamline 
customs procedures 
as operating costs in singapore soared in recent years many 
manufacturing firms shifted laborintensive operations to johor 
which is linked to singapore by a causeway that carries a highway 
railroad and water pipeline 
another bridge is planned electronic components and other goods 
shipped into johor and later exported are not taxed 
with costs increasing in johor singapore manufacturers have set 
their sights on batam island a dutyfree zone only 12 miles to the 
southeast by ferry 
industrialists estimate the labor cost in johor is about half 
that of singapore and in batam only half that of johor 
two stateowned singapore companies announced in january they 
would put 220 million into a joint venture with an indonesian firm 
to build an industrial park mainly for computer assembly plants 
the promoters said it would employ 40000 people when completed in 
five years 
politically the triangle could help forge closer ties between 
singapore most of whose people are ethnic chinese and its big 
malay neighbors which experienced antichinese bloodshed in the 
1960s 
prime minister lee kuan yew said the joint planning showed 
singapores neighbors realized they had more to gain by plugging 
into the citystates success than by trying to go it alone goh is 
scheduled to replace lee in november 
not everyone is so confident muhyiddin yassin head of the 
johor government likes the idea in principle but insists his state 
be a full partner not a mere supplier of primary resources 
tosrin jarvanthi a johor state legislator questioned 
singapores sincerity we have to examine the proposal very 
closely to make sure that we will not lose out in future 
bj habibie an indonesian government minister who oversees 
batams industrial development praised the triangle concept but 
said singapore probably stood to gain more than jakarta 
frans seda a former indonesian finance minister saw great 
benefits for singapore some gain for batam and uncertainty for the 
rest of indonesia 
the straits times took note of such sentiments in an editorial 
the underlying fear no doubt is that singapore would have not 
have come out so enthusiastically and at such high level in favor 
of the idea if it did not stand to benefit disproportionately from 
it 
the government may thus have no choice but to maintain a 
watchful eye over the whole project to ensure that singaporeans 
venturing to johor and riau batam are good envoys as well as good 
businessmen

within what is called the russian compound in 
the heart of jerusalem are two jails that symbolize the struggle 
for this ancient land 
one held jewish guerrillas who fought british rule in the 
palestine of the 1940s it is a museum now with a plaque dedicated 
to the heroes who fought against foreign rule 
the other 300 yards across the compound remains a jail mainly 
for palestinians fighting israeli occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip it has no plaques just prisoners tales of beatings 
torture and overcrowding 
in the 1860s the russian orthodox church built the two yellow 
brick buildings as part of a complex of hostels and a greendomed 
church for pilgrims to the holy land 
one day in july dozens of palestinian families crowded outside 
the jail a blocklong onestory building topped by rolls of 
barbed wire the arabs call it moskobiyeh or muscovite 
an officer shouted the names of families who would be allowed to 
visit prisoners four families at a time 15 minutes per visit 
many waited for hours some in vain any who asked questions 
were pushed aside by officers 
sayra al hamoni a gaunt 50yearold woman from the silwan 
district of jerusalem said she had come to see her 17yearold son 
bader who was picked up two months ago 
mrs hamoni her hair covered by the white scarf of observant 
moslem women said bader confessed to throwing stones at police 
after being beaten for 19 days his nose was broken and he was 
often unconscious said mrs hamoni who has eight other children 
i brought him new clothes one day and they gave me the old 
ones they were all bloody she said wiping away tears i get 
sick each time i see him 
betselem an israeli human rights group issued a report 
recently that said interrogators beat prisoners in the jail to 
extract confessions it said the report was based on affidavits 
from palestinians aged 18 and younger 
almost all the minors testified that they had been beaten 
generally very severely slapping punching kicking hair 
pulling beating with clubs or with iron rods pushing into walls 
and onto floors according to the report 
it said some prisoners who were 16 or older told of 
interrogations by the shin bet security service after being locked 
in one of three special cells 
prisoners have given each of the cells a name the closet 
three feet wide and the height of a man the grave a box in 
the ground covered by an iron door and the lockup a cubicle 
about less than five feet square with a toilet inside 
najib a 30yearold palestinian from dheishe a west bank 
refugee camp told an associated press reporter he spent three 
months in the moskobiyeh including several days in the lockup 
it was very dark i was forced to sit in the lockup with my 
hands tied behind my back said najib who is tall and thin he 
said he refused to confess to charges that he was recruiting for a 
radical plo faction 
police spokesman uzi sandori denied the existence of the three 
solitaryconfinement cells the shin bet has no spokesman to 
question about its role in the jail 
when asked about reports of beatings sandori cited a police 
response to the betselem report that was published with it in june 
superintendent elinoar mazuz said in it that all complaints of 
police brutality were being investigated she said police had not 
finished investigating six of the eight alleged beatings of minors 
betselem cited and that files of the other two cases had been given 
to the state prosecutor 
sandori would not let the ap reporter see any of the jails 22 
cells he said only humanitarian groups were allowed to visit 
philip veerman a childrens rights activist who toured the 
youth wing in march said it was seriously overcrowded 
eightythree younsters were held in four cells with 34 beds 
veerman said and in one of the cells 39 minors shared 12 beds and 
one toilet two israelis were held separately in one cell he said 
i almost fainted from the terrible smell said veerman who 
represents defense for children international the air is stuffy 
and it is difficult to breathe in the night mattresses are spread 
out but there is still not enough room 
in her response to the betselem report ms mazuz acknowledged 
extreme overcrowding and blamed it on the increased number of 
prisoners since the palestinian uprising began in december 1987 
she said the building was being renovated to create more space 
jews call the former jail across the compound bevingrad for 
ernest bevin britains antizionist foreign minister of the late 
1940s 
as a museum it is named the shrine to heroism school 
children visit it on tours and stare at the pictures of jews 
executed by the british before israel was founded in 1948 
like the moskobiyeh the british jail originally was a hostel 
for christain pilgrims its 10 solitaryconfinement cells are still 
there and the gallows has been preserved along with a death row 
cell where two condemned jewish guerrillas committed suicide 
on april 21 1947 meir feinstein and moshe barazani embraced 
and ignited an explosivesfilled orange pressed to their hearts 
they died two hours before their scheduled hanging 
another famous prisoner was yisrael eldad who was coleader 
with yitzhak shamir now the prime minister of the stern gang 
guerrilla group 
eldad 80 said in a telephone interview from his home in 
jerusalem that he spent six months in bevingrad in 1944 and was not 
mistreated 
lots of lehi people were there he said using the hebrew 
name for the stern gang i was not even investigated i was just 
sitting in the cell with my friends

you say its the long hot nastygrindy part of 
august and you dont know where to turn for a good movie 
you say youve seen die hard 2 total recall is sexist 
trash arachnophobia isnt scary you read presumed 
innocent your spouse is a seal and tom cruise hasnt done 
anything decent since taps 
you say your clothes are sticking to you and you cant face the 
crowds in the downtown cinema hell octoplex you say poogie the 
wonder tot just stunned the cat with a sickening underhand blow 
cheer up america dont hit the kid hit the video store 
its not a lack of imagination keeping you away from network 
television and the movie theaters really its not most of what 
theyre offering you this summer really is dreadful claptrap 
home video on the other hand whether rented or storebought 
is better than ever 
you can own a 995 preowned copy of the warren beattydustin 
hoffman comedy ishtar or for about the same price the 
equally funny good housekeeping video colors and shapes for 
young viewers like poogie 
even if you bypassed vhs for an 8mm camcorder the big video 
stores are starting to offer new releases and old classics in 8mm 
from the star trek movies and tucker to moscow on the 
hudson and gigi 
the 8mm format also offers digital stereo sound higher 
resolution than vhs a smaller cassette and new releases priced to 
sell at 2995 
thanks to a glut of product and sellthrough where a hit 
movie is released at a bargain price usually from 1495 to 
2495 prices for most vhs releases are very reasonable most 
popular movies on vhs are 1995 
for those of us who cant live without our own copies of dr 
strangelove dog day afternoon or the producers this is 
good news 
if you simply must own a copy of driving miss daisy its 
available at 7295 in vhs stereo and the superior letterbox 
format that maintains the widescreen viewing aspect its a lot 
cheaper to rent it though 
two other new vhs releases worth mentioning are blood alley 
with john wayne and lauren bacall and a summer place with troy 
donahue and sandra dee priced to sell at 5995 and much cheaper 
to rent 
new vhs releases youll have to nag your rental video dealer for 
are pier paolo pasolinis accattone at 7995 hiroshi 
teshigaharas woman in the dunes and federico fellinis i 
vitelloni are 5995 
hold onto your money awhile if its foreign film you crave 
fellinis satyricon akira kurosawas ran and jacques 
tatis mon oncle are selling for 2995 this summer 
regrettably the aptly titled stuff stephanie in the 
incinerator is holding at 7995 but slumber party massacre i 
and ii you bring the pizza ill bring the drill are 
priced at 1995 
laser disc releases in the stores this summer are more tempting 
than ever if you love movies and havent bought a disc player 
youre missing out on crisp clear images and crystalline dynamic 
cd quality sound 
batman which was too dark and cramped in its hastily dubbed 
vhs version sells for 3995 on a beautifully transferred disc 
version in letterboxed format with a digital stereo soundtrack 
and danny elfmans score 
theres also a wideformat star wars out there for 6995 
and who framed roger rabbit in cutdown panandscan laserdisc 
is only 2995 
vhs colorized classics priced at 1995 include the 
magnificent ambersons now theres an orson welles movie that 
cries out for colorization even louder than citizen kane eh 
the maltese falcon and white heat 
if you want to see an arnold schwarzenegger summer movie why 
not rent predator or the terminator two excellent 
suspenseful action movies that take to the little screen as if they 
were made for it 
if you insist on a bruce willis actioner go rent the original 
die hard it sells for 1995 and is available in wideformat 
laser disc 
if you want a spike lee movie go rent do the right thing or 
shes gotta have it 
then rent poogie the delightful willie wonka and the chocolate 
factory in which all sorts of nasty fates await wicked children 
inside the wonderful chocolate factory heh heh 
its not nice to slug mr kitty poog

elsewhere in television 
we accept you one of us that haunting refrain will engrave 
itself into the bad dreams of a whole new generation in september 
when mgmua home video releases tod brownings freaks for home 
video at 1998 
the 1932 horror classic was disowned by mgm because it used real 
side show folk it was banned in great britain for 30 years it 
ranks with george romeros night of the living dead for dumb 
dialogue and scary sequences 
its a fable about the circus and of how a little man from the 
side show falls in love with the beautiful trapeze artist who 
deceives exploits and abuses him and its about payback 
its also for its 1930s ambience a remarkably sensitive 
treatment of the lives and feelings of exceptional people and the 
payback will scare the living willies out of you

thirty soviet american and polish teachers 
spent two weeks discussing educational alchemy how to turn the 
leaden classrooms of preperestroika eastern europe into golden 
laboratories of democracy 
they talked about ways teachers can run their classrooms 
democratically and how students could be taught skills and 
attitudes needed in a democracy and they basked in the changes 
brought on by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
gorbachev himself has said we are a people who dont know 
how to carry on a discussion we are used to giving orders said 
alan shapiro director of the soviet education project of educators 
for social responsibility which cosponsored the gathering here 
whats missing is the culture of democracy people are not 
really accustomed to what the democratic process means how long it 
takes authoritarianism can be much more efficient 
schools reflected that authoritarianism 
classes have been conducted more like a catechism the teacher 
asks the question and the student must give the right answer you 
could go through a lot of soviet classrooms and never hear a 
student ask a question he said 
at one point in the workshop which ended last weekend the 
teachers sat in a circle trying to name the worlds most populous 
countries with give and take they came up with the answers 
such a freewheeling exercise as common in american classrooms 
as chalk was formerly unheardof in polish and soviet classrooms 
in the 1960s and 1970s i may have had that but it would have 
been risky said valentina mitina who taught for 22 years and is 
now a researcher in comparative education at moscows academy of 
pedagogical sciences 
the flint meeting the third sponsored by the academy soviet 
educators for peace and mutual understanding and educators for 
social responsibility based in cambridge mass took place at a 
time of rapidly increasing contacts between us and eastern 
european educators 
the americans want to help us students appreciate the 
historical significance of changes in eastern europe the europeans 
are looking to america for lessons in how to teach democratic 
concepts and foster an inquiring attitude among students accustomed 
to accepting lessons unquestioningly 
the american federation of teachers has been particularly active 
in fostering such contacts through the international federation of 
free teachers unions based in the netherlands the union has been 
working with emerging free teacher unions in czechoslovakia 
poland bulgaria romania and hungary 
american universities have also been increasing their east bloc 
ties clemson university announced plans in july to set up an mba 
program in moscow the university of michigan announced in june it 
is establishing a center for social research in warsaw poland 
changes do not come easily educators who want to shed 
dictatorial ways often face opposition from parents and students 
said alexander bannov a school principal in the siberian town of 
novosibirsk 
they are afraid to have choices and participate in 
decisionmaking because they dont want to take responsibility for 
poor decisions he said in the old days they could blame the 
leaders 
people are just not prepared for that the process of 
preparing our people to live in a democracy is a very difficult 
pedagogical problem 
if we just declare a democracy nothing happens it can lead 
to anarchy it democracy must be in every minute in every 
detail we should not teach about democracy we should live 
democracy he said 
gennady belyaev a moscow teacher is helping students write a 
peace dictionary in which children develop their own definitions 
for words such as trust and understanding 
the class openly discusses the use of soviet weapons by the 
iraqis on the kurds for example as it shatters the assumption 
that everything done by the soviet union automatically is good 
we try to call a spade a spade he said he confessed his 
main problem is freeing students from the fear of repercussions for 
expressing their views 
no one is going to go to the headmaster and report them he 
said 
but ruth bowman executive director of the cambridge group said 
there are unexpected similarities between american and soviet 
students and american teachers also are searching for ways to 
teach citizenship 
what ive learned from being with the soviets is we seem to 
have very common problems bowman said 
this surprised me they use the word apathy quite a bit one 
of the soviet educators said her students want to be spoonfed they 
dont want to work for their learning were asking the same kind 
of questions 
that made the institute a twoway exchange rather than a 
seminar taught by americans for soviets she said 
one specific thing i have learned is we are not as democratic 
as we think we are and they are not as undemocratic as we think 
they are said arthur marquardt an adrian mich high school 
teacher

for years philadelphia schools have offered students a chance 
to study latin as early as fourth grade but this fall fewer kids 
will learn their amo amas amats a tight budget has forced 
the layoff of six out of 26 itinerant latin teachers 
an awful lot of them wont even finish high school and the 
only language they are exposed to is street language this is the 
one opportunity they have to get a little something beyond 
thatsaid one laidoff latin teacher h michael dunn 
many such cuts affecting both innovative programs and 
daytoday operations await bigcity districts across the country 
this fall a check by the associated press found that districts 
from philadelphia boston and new york to dade county fla and 
los angeles face the worst fiscal problems since the mid70s 
its going to be tough to innovate when youre trying to 
survive said james fleming associate superintendent of dade 
county schools a district that gained national notice for school 
reforms but now faces a 108 million deficit that will likely lead 
to more crowded classes 
with a possible recession looming and worsening state finances 
putting a squeeze on school budgets bigcity school officials 
everywhere are bracing for teacher hiring freezes layoffs and 
larger classes 
its a very bleak fall said jewell gould research director 
of the american federation of teachers 
he and others believe next spring could bring even worse news 
when districts customarily send out layoff notices 
one leading reformer called this falls cutbacks fresh evidence 
that political leaders give more lip service than resources to 
school improvement 
if snow is piling up in city streets you get a greater sense 
of emergency than if half the kids drop out of school year after 
year said ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation 
for the advancement of teaching 
on the one hand we say education is at the center of what we 
hope for and dream about and we almost get maudlin about it but 
then if something happens it gets put off as kid stuff he 
said 
this is easily the worst fiscal crisis i have seen in the last 
20 years said fleming of dade county 
state funding fell 44 million less than expected said dade 
county school spokesman andy gollan its already meant elimination 
of a merit schools program where schools devised innovative 
programs to help students achieve educational goals 
philadelphia anticipating deficits of 68 million for fiscal 
year 199192 170 million in 1993 and 275 million in 1994 has 
put on hold reforms including fullday kindergartens lengthening 
the school day and year and more classroom computers 
its come to a period where we have to make hard choices 
which are not necessarily popular choices said leontine d 
scott associate superintendent 
in boston a 397 million budget approved last week is 64 
million lower than last years cuts include 100 fewer nontenured 
teachers fewer school police reduced extracurricular and 
afterschool programs less funding for a cityfinanced parent 
organization and reductions in a private industry council that 
provides jobs for highschool students 
the citys schoolchildren are treated like secondclass 
citizens because they dont have the political clout that other 
communities have said boston school committee member peggy davis 
mullen 
in los angeles a 220 million budget gap earlier this year 
forced extensive administrative cuts the crisis worsened last week 
when gov george deukmejian announced he was withholding 465 
million in school funds statewide compelling the district to cut 
77 million more from the 199091 budget 
school officials havent decided yet how to parcel out the cuts 
but a number of reform ideas have already been shelved or reduced 
a bilingual master plan designed to help nonenglish speaking 
students in all major subject areas has been only partially funded 
the district is also postponing expansion of its schoolbased 
management program in which more than 60 schools participate 
devastating would not be too strong a word said school 
board member rita walters it just socks it to us 
new york citys school board must come up with 268 million in 
instructional cuts this fall after having already eliminated some 
350 jobs at the central board 
how that will be done is the unanswered question said susan 
amlung a spokeswoman for the united federation of teachers 
the district is likely to cut school aides and 
paraprofessionals measures that the union fears will put more 
students in alreadyovercrowded classes school officials insist 
that wont happen kindergarten classes currently average 248 
pupils and highschool classes of 40 or more are not uncommon 
seattles 2436 million school budget has meant eliminating 165 
teaching administrative and other positions mainly through 
attrition 
its been a difficult time said seattle schools budget 
manager george steinhofer weve taken a number of reductions in 
central administration and this year we took reductions in special 
education and bilingual programs the only place left to look is in 
basic educational programs 
new orleans is closing two of its three centers for problem 
students and 60 school employees were laid off to balance the 358 
million budget said superintendent everett williams 
thats been the story of our life in this school district for 
the past four or five years i have had no budget thats been an 
even budget where i have been able to start off the year with no 
cuts at all he said 
in houston superintendent joan raymond is pushing for a record 
18 percent tax rate hike to fund a 7979 million budget the 
proposed budget would provide a 10 percent pay raise for teachers 
31 new principals and deans a dropout prevention program beefed 
up security a principal performance incentive program and funding 
of a massive construction program 
but some taxpayers are resisting 
by no extent of the imagination is the public going along with 
this said john pellicciotti a board member of the taxpayers 
coalition of greater houston 
not all cities are in such dire straits 
in atlanta public schools comptroller lawrence thompson said 
the district has not had cuts next years budget is 3313 
million compared with 3193 million this past school year 
weve been pretty fortunate thompson said 
newark with a 421 million school budget has an 85 million 
shortfall but has largely avoided layoffs some assistant 
principals and other administrators may be demoted to save money 
said spokesman kirk smith 
next year the district will get as much as 50 million in 
additional funds as part of a state plan to boost the quality of 
new jersey city schools but another state plan to shift teacher 
pension costs entirely to local districts could cancel out those 
gains smith said 
in detroit an 889 million budget for the 199091 school year 
includes such reform initiatives as expanded preschools and special 
schools meant to help troubled ninthgraders avoid disciplinary 
problems 
a 5mill property tax increase and a bond issue approved by 
voters last september wiped out the districts 160 million deficit

theres gold in them thar peaks and mark 
frost and david lynch are not above trying to mine it 
the richly textured twin peaks laden with 14 emmy 
nominations and unchecked praise from tv critics is going 
commercial as in books tapes records cherry pie and coffee 
yes executive producers frost and lynch who have tended to put 
art above profit want to make a bigger buck from their surreal 
nighttime soap opera 
the way they figure it someone is going to cash in on the cult 
following surrounding their saga of sex and murder and dancing 
midgets and a woman who carries around a log all the time and it 
might as well be them 
like their show however lynch and frosts approach is slightly 
off kilter this is not your average merchandising campaign of 
tshirts hats and buttons 
but then there is precious little that is ordinary about 
television advertising and marketing campaigns these days with 
changing federal network regulations and an increasingly fierce 
battle for viewers the landscape of tv promotions is being plowed 
under 
cbs and nbc are launching mammoth commercial campaigns in 
concert with such bastions of the american middle class as k mart 
and mcdonalds 
simon and schuster will publish the secret diary of laura 
palmer the high school homecoming queen whose murder propelled 
twin peaks 
the book written in 1 months by lynchs 22yearold daughter 
jennifer will hit the stands in time for the sept 30 premiere of 
the second season of her fathers show but thats not all 
the twin peaks tapes of agent cooper chronicling 
coffeeguzzling fbi agent dale coopers rambling cassette 
dissertations to his secretary will hit stores at about the same 
time 
also in the works a line of twin peaks coffee and cherry 
pie 
and while networks and individual programs are selling 
themselves with an unprecedented fervor it is for entirely 
different reasons 
the networks want to lure viewers program producers want to 
make money 
no one involved in primetime television merchandising for shows 
such as twin peaks or cartoon superstars the simpsons would 
say how much they make from program products 
but playmates toys inc sold 115 million last year in teenage 
mutant ninja turtle items ranging from pizza to underwear trade 
estimates put last years income from merchandise inspired by 
television and movies at 3 billion 
in the case of twin peaks we had some serious debate over 
whether we should get into the commercial aspect of 
merchandising said ken scherer chief operating officer and 
camp counselor of lynchfrost productions we figured look 
other people are doing it so we might as well do it 
the other people scherer was referring to are the unlicensed 
sellers of twin peaks tshirts cropping up in los angeles and 
new york that read i killed laura palmer and who shot agent 
cooper 
added scherer theres an awful lot of money out there for 
other people who are illegally selling twin peaks 
merchandise when independent production companies such as his 
launch merchandising campaigns scherer said profits are used to 
enhance the quality of programming 
the money that comes back you can put on the screen scherer 
said independent production companies dont have the money that 
big networks do 
such producers may not have networksized budgets but they do 
for the most part own the licensing rights to their shows abc 
cbs and nbc produce only a limited number of programs broadcast on 
their networks thus they have been barred from merchandising 
specific shows 
in november that will change with the lifting of federal 
communications commission regulations that ban networks from 
producing more than five hours of primetime programming each week 
when the fcc ceiling is obliterated abc cbs and nbc can produce 
as much of primetimes 22 programming hours as they want 
television executives said the fcc rules change is likely to 
result in networks playing a much larger role in merchandising 
campaigns 
until then however the primary focus of the networks 
marketing strategy is getting viewers to watch their programs not 
selling them books toys key chains or coffee mugs 
the power of advertising and television will reach thousands 
and thousands of more people than will ever see a twin peaks 
mug said george schweitzer senior vice president of 
communications for cbs broadcast group 
cbs is repeating its behemoth campaign with k marts 2300 
stores this fall last year in the biggest television contest of 
its kind the eye network gave away 6 million prizes from cars to 
vcrs to coffee mugs 
attention k mart shoppers this year cbs has upped the ante 
more cars will be given away along with 10 million twolitre 
bottles of pepsi and a grand prize of 250000 in mastercard funds 
according to schweitzer last years campaign increased fall 
premiere viewership by 28 percent players matched the numbers on 
game cards obtained at k mart stores with figures broadcast during 
certain cbs programs 
the new campaign which begins sept 26 is part of the 
networks strategy to lure moneyspending babyboomers cbs has 
even signed the temptations to sing their motown hit get ready 
but with eye network lyrics in commercials promoting the fall 
season 
product merchandising schweitzer said is lucrative for only a 
short time and only with giant hits such as foxs the simpsons 
these things are interesting as gimmicks schweitzer said 
but they pale in comparison to the power of a summers worth of 
television commercials 
and schweitzer added networks dont have to pay for their own 
air time each network spends about 40 to 50 million a year 
on advertising in addition to production costs for inhouse 
commercials promoting their shows schweitzer said if we had to 
pay for air time that would cost about 400 to 500 million 
next month nbc begins a 35 million contest with mcdonalds 
tied to its fall schedule said john miller executive vice 
president of marketing for the network weve never done anything 
quite this large before he said 
probably because competition between the four networks cable 
and video rentals has never been this intense nor has viewership 
in general ever dropped so much according to ratings vehemently 
disputed by cbs nbc and abc from the ac nielsen co 
still abc has hung back from the contest route taken by its 
competitors 
ultimately its our philosophy that people watch the show 
because theres something in the show that intrinsically interests 
them said mark zakarin vice president of marketing for abc 
entertainment our fall campaign really focuses on the stars of 
our shows no one watches a television show because of a singing 
group 
the bottom line for network marketing strategies is that 
contests and advertisements help get viewers to sample a new show 
but new car or no viewers wont come back unless they like the 
program 
people watch tv shows they dont watch fall campaigns 
zakarin said 
meanwhile independent and studioproduced shows continue to 
exploit merchandising as a way to make more money 
there is a limit however to how far lynchfrost productions 
will go in selling twin peaks scherer said 
we wouldnt sell firewood he said because the log lady 
would never burn her log

kansas gov mike haydens nearloss in a 
threeway republican primary last week is the latest evidence that 
1990 is turning into a mean campaign season for incumbents 
voters have lots of reasons to be dissatisfied with government 
among them the savings and loan crisis the federal budget deficit 
and the weakened economy their discontent already is shaping some 
of the 36 governors races this year 
theres a loss of confidence in government said arkansas 
gov bill clinton who is having his own difficulties as he seeks a 
fifth term 
theres a reserve of cynicism in the electorate for a variety 
of reasons said mark gearan director of the democratic 
governors association theres a concern among incumbents but 
every state takes on a different hue and cast 
hayden won renomination in kansas by fewer than 8000 votes and 
3 percentage points after trailing through most of a long night of 
vote counting tuesday 
haydens political troubles stemmed from changes in the property 
tax system that had resulted in big tax increases for many kansans 
his predecessor former gov john carlin who shared some of the 
heat for tax changes dating back to his term lost a comeback bid 
and the democratic nomination by fewer than 1800 votes to joan 
finney veteran state treasurer 
an incumbents advantage is strong through the ability to raise 
money generate publicity and use the powers of government yet 
kansas is hardly alone in its unease with incumbents 
next door in nebraska republican gov kay orr is at the top of 
the gop endangered list as she seeks a second term 
shes in trouble over tax increases and her belated admission 
that taxes had indeed been raised to bolster her campaign shes 
hosted visits from president bush barbara bush and vice president 
dan quayle ronald reagan is expected to show up too 
another shaky republican florida gov bob martinez is 
considered vulnerable because of his opposition to abortion his 
vacillation on taxes and general doubts about his management 
ability hes presented the democrats with an opportunity to 
capture the governorship of one of the largest states and one that 
will be a redistricting battleground next year 
democratic governors are having difficulty too clinton in 
arkansas james blanchard in michigan and rudy perpich in minnesota 
all have been in office for eight years or more and face their most 
serious challenges yet 
nearly all the new england governors have suffered along with 
the regions economy and the three democrats michael dukakis in 
massachusetts william oneill in connecticut and madeleine kunin 
in vermont all decided not to run again 
meanwhile republican govs john mckernan of maine and edward 
diprete of rhode island are trailing their democratic challengers 
in the polls 
dipretes troubles stem not only from rhode islands flagging 
economy but also from personal ethics questions his favorability 
rating has been as low as 17 percent in polls while democrats have 
yet to select their nominee diprete trails all three democratic 
contenders in oneonone polling tests 
michele davis director of the republican governors 
association says she doesnt see a wave of antiincumbent 
sentiment washing across the governors races each she says is a 
victim of individual or regional difficulties 
i dont see it as an overarching theme or problem she said 
each incumbent is judged by their own merits 
clinton however says president bushs break with his 
readmylips pledge against new taxes has contributed to an eroding 
confidence in government at all levels 
he said x and now hes doing y clinton said its hurting 
not just him its hurting all of us 
in clintons case and a few others another factor may be at 
work voters are just getting tired of the same names and faces 
clinton has been on the arkansas political scene since 1974 
and hes only 43 years old hes been governor for 10 of the last 
12 years including three twoyear terms and one fouryear term 
that ends this year 
now seeking a fifth term clinton is facing a strong challenge 
from republican sheffield nelson himself the victor in a tough 
primary polls show clinton ahead but republicans say he fails to 
get more than 50 percent in their polls giving them reason to 
believe he is vulnerable 
blanchard won reelection in michigan four years ago with 68 
percent of the vote but he faces a tougher test this time 
hes leading republican john engler majority leader of the 
state senate but republicans believe engler is within striking 
distance blanchard vetoed a restrictive abortion bill this year 
and abortion could emerge as a big issue in the race to top off 
his problems his exwife paula blanchard whom he divorced while 
in office has written a book about their marriage and has embarked 
on a promotional tour

it looked like a television game show 
setup replete with hundreds of spectators a gavelbashing host 
and a raucous band that exhorted the audience to applaud the best 
players 
but the business at hand in the newport marriott hotel wasnt a 
contest for winning cash cars or washerdryers the players were 
homebuyers and investors and the prizes were prime pieces of new 
england property sold at auction by developers under pressure 
because of a weak real estate market 
auction day was a saturday afternoon in late july with about 
500 people jammed into the ballroom of the hotel in this quaint 
waterfront town known for its swank mansions sailboat racing and 
summertime jazz 
most prospective buyers already had toured the properties to be 
auctioned two fancysounding subdivisions named butterfly estates 
and weekapaug bluffs in nearby rhode island communities the units 
for sale ranged from empty lots to townhouse condos 
prospective bidders came to newport with the plot numbers of 
their favorite sites in hand hoping to win one at a fraction of 
the original asking price 
the bar outside the ballroom didnt do much business just a few 
beers and glasses of wine inside a threepiece combo played while 
auctiongoers milled about discussing the sites 
after company president steven l good outlined the proceedings 
auctioneer gordon green led the group through a mockauction as 
bidspotters worked the crowd the practice auction involved 
newport mansions and the phony bids were in the millions 
green managed to keep the crowd for the most part quiet and 
reserved laughing and interested 
with a name like weekapaug bluffs these lots have got to be 
good he said 
weekapaug in the coastal town of westerly was built in 1988 
when the value of oceanfront property was rising dramatically the 
units are within walking distance of two golf courses and have a 
view of block island sound 
bidding started at 65000 on the weekapaug bluffs condos 
originally priced at 285000 to 325000 offers shot up to 
140000 in 25 seconds two minutes later the first auctioned unit 
sold for 142000 
the next went for 140000 and after that prices leveled off 
around 138000 fortyfive minutes into the auction the units 
were being snapped up for about 131000 
to the auctioneers left signs representing the auctioned units 
were moved from the available board to the sold sign 
after each winning bid the band would strike up a jaunty tune 
as the buyer moved to the front of the ballroom like a gameshow 
contestant receiving a prize the crowd clapped 
after the buyer filled out the necessary paperwork and put down 
deposits he was escorted to the mortgage rooms on the other 
side of the floor to work out details with representatives from 
rhode islands fleet national bank which offered financing 
dennis and debra rider of enfield conn claimed the seventh 
unit sold for 137500 the newport auction was the first for the 
riders who bought the weekapaug bluffs property as an investment 
and dont plan to move there 
we got caught up in the excitement of it all dennis rider 
said later he ended up paying about 2500 more than he wanted to 
but we got the style we wanted 
why did they do it the price and the willingness of the banks 
to work with us he said 
when the day was over sheldon good amp co had pulled in 46 
million in total sales said company spokesman terrence kaye that 
included 21 condos sold at the weekapaug bluffs site and 31 of 34 
plots of land at butterfly estates 
the butterfly lots in the town of lincoln originally were 
priced at 100000 to 400000 but went for 50000 to 82000 
some prospective buyers left disappointed they hadnt ventured 
any bids 
we considered buying said cleve elswick of warwick ri 
but it was a little bit higher than what we wanted to pay of 
course the prices went down 
nonetheless elswick who works in real estate and his wife 
ruth came away with a newfound admiration for property auctions 
mainly because there werent any pushy real estate agents in bright 
blazers shoving contracts in their faces 
here you have total control of yourself he said

heres a general buyers guide to real estate auctions based on 
advice from experts in the field 
read the papers get on a list the sunday newspapers are 
usually jammed with advertisements in real estate sections for 
property up for auction also auctioneers can put you on their 
mailing lists and provide a calendar of sales get a brochure 
the auction company will send you material that provides basic 
information on the property such as total square footage and the 
latest asking price photos are included 
learn the lingo auctioneers have a language of their own for 
instance an absolute auction means the property will be sold 
to the highest bidder regardless of price while an auction with 
reserve means the owner can reject even the highest bid a good 
real estate lawyer or accountant can help inspect the property 
most auction companies have open houses at least a week before the 
auction date if none is planned ask for permission to see the 
property beforehand in cases of multiple units up for auction find 
out if youll be seeing more than just models 
ask questions youll want to know whats included in the 
property such as kitchen appliances or carpeting or how long 
any remaining tenants will be occupying a residence at the site 
youll get even more information like a sales contract an 
engineers report floor plans or financing details its a good 
idea to have a lawyer or accountant look the deal over 
register to make a bid you must register with the auction 
company you should do this only after you or your lawyer have 
completely evaluated the property registered bidders will get a 
bid card that entitles them to participate in the auction in 
addition auctioneers require that you bring a cashiers check or 
money order 
arrive early listen at the day of the auction usually held 
away from the property try to arrive an hour early to ensure a 
seat listen for any announcements prior to the auctions start 
such as changes in the property or terms of the auction 
hang on to your seats usually there will be a practice round 
of bidding to give firsttime participants a feel for the 
auctioneers tempo and the bidding process when the auctioneer is 
ready to begin youll hear do i have an opening bid 
be ready to pay the highest bidders are required to sign a 
real estate sales contract when the bidding is concluded your 
cashiers check is taken and used as earnest money at that 
time bidders may have to increase their earnest money to the 
required percentage amount usually 10 percent of the bid

piracy the centuriesold scourge 
of the sea is making a comeback in brazil 
brazilian authorities have been unable to stop modern buccaneers 
who raid cargo ships and terrorize crews in ports along the 
southeastern coast 
piracy is getting worse and more violent said joao 
dilermando goncalves chief fleet inspector of lloyd brasileiro 
the countrys largest shipping company pirates have attacked three 
lloyd ships in rio this year 
the new pirates are different from the sneak thieves who always 
have plagued merchant ships goncalves said 
these are highly organized gangs of up to a dozen armed men 
he said they intimidate the crew and break containers open 
real heavy assault 
although todays pirates use speedboats uzi submachine guns and 
radio communications their methods have changed little from the 
days when buccaneers prowled the south american coast in sailing 
ships 
a typical attack occurs at night when most crew members are 
ashore 
one of the gang tosses a grappling hook and rope over the side 
or climbs up the anchor chain goncalves said he overpowers 
the duty officer and lowers the ships ladder just like in the old 
days 
while some of the raiders hold the crew at gunpoint others go 
for the cargo they take cables binoculars bearings 
chronometers electronic appliances even the ships compass 
goods containers are a favorite target 
they know beforehand whats inside said helcio muniz 
president of the national union of merchant marine officers they 
only go for the containers that have valuable cargo 
crews are virtually helpless muniz said ship rules do not 
allow crewmen to carry guns and the deck watchman the unions 
require also is unarmed 
piracy became a serious problem in brazil about two years ago 
said meton soares jr president of the national union of shipping 
companies 
brazilian ports are as dangerous as singapore hong kong and 
bangkok were decades ago before economic prosperity brought 
improved security he said in an interview 
about 40 percent of pirate attacks in brazil occur in santos 
latin americas largest port about 280 miles southwest of rio 
soares said 
last year 55 ships reported losses from piracy in santos but 
many others were attacked and did not bother to file complaints he 
said 
the federal police began acting with rigor there soares 
said but piracy continues and now it has spread to rio 
rio is ideal for such marauders ships awaiting dock space ride 
at anchor for days in the middle of the guanabara bay miles from 
land and are easy prey 
pirates gravitated to brazil centuries ago because of its 
4593mile coastline and many natural ports the word buccaneer 
is from a french term for early pirates who used the boucan a 
brazilian grill for roasting meat 
english and french pirates raided portuguese coastal settlements 
in brazil as early as the 16th century and later attacked ships 
carrying gold and gemstones to europe they were not driven off 
until the 19th century 
lloyd brasileiro has strengthened its duty watches and improved 
onboard lighting to combat the latest outbreak of piracy anchor 
hatches are covered and the ships ladder is raised at dusk 
goncalves said there even was a suggestion to put left and right 
shoes in separate containers of export footwear to discourage 
pirates but he admitted the precautions were not enough 
the problem is the bays are not policed he said we need 
armed uniformed naval vigilance 
robbery on the sea is the responsibility of federal police but 
they dont have boats and patrolling harbors is difficult 
police dont have the equipment to act on the water soares 
said by the time a pirate attack is reported thats often as 
far as it gets 
vice adm sergio doherty director of coasts and ports for the 
brazilian navy said neither the navy nor police was equipped to 
fight piracy 
what we need is a coast guard like the united states or 
argentina doherty said 
the government shelved a proposal to create a coast guard in the 
early 1980s 
soares said the police have enough problems fighting crime on 
land and he sees little chance of curbing piracy soon

piracy is a terrifying threat to defenseless 
refugees fleeing indochina but the international maritime bureau 
says it is a declining nuisance to shippers in most parts of the 
world 
shipping companies face greater losses from damage to cargo or 
injuries to crews said bureau director eric ellen but piracy 
remains a risk 
pirates steal yachts in the caribbean perhaps intending to use 
them for drug smuggling vietnamese refugees are brutally attacked 
in waters off thailand and crew members on giant tankers sometimes 
are victims of armed robbery 
ellen said whole ships are stolen in the philippines you can 
steal a ship to order put the crew overboard or take them along if 
you want them he said in an interview 
government functionaries can be bribed to provide the ship with 
a new name and call sign and what you develop is a phantom 
ship ellen said these ships with new identities can pick up 
cargoes and then steal the cargo it seems incredible in this day 
and age that a ship can just disappear 
if it was an aircraft he said every airport in the world 
would be alerted there is no such system in the maritime world 
the bureau a branch of the international chamber of commerce 
is trying to update a world survey on piracy completed in 1988 but 
finds statistics hard to come by because very few incidents are 
officially reported he said 
according to ellen a truer picture emerges from reports of the 
protection and indemnity clubs shippers form to insure 
themselves against loss 
he mentioned reports he had seen of hundreds of attacks on 
yachts in the caribbean compiled by a yachting magazine 
soviet and israeli vessels generally are well armed but ellen 
said many ships have little defense other than the captains pistol 
quite honestly we dont have a good response to vessels that 
are under attack he said there is no maritime police service 
that can get to you in time 
after the palestinian hijacking of the italian passenger liner 
achille lauro in 1985 during which an american passenger was 
killed the bureau urged seaports to install airportstyle security 
only the port of london did so and there is a remarkable 
degree of complacency at many others ellen said 
the most vulnerable people at sea are refugees fleeing southeast 
asia by boat 
pirates attacked 37 boats in the first half of 1990 the un 
high commissioner for refugees headquarters in geneva reported it 
said at least nine refugees were killed and 266 were missing 
eightyfour boats were attacked last year with 18 people 
confirmed dead and 734 missing the refugee office said

what has a nutty flavor and looks like 
brown scrambled eggs 
bakuti thats nepalese for squished honeybees 
what looks like ridged french fries only with eyes and legs 
and tastes great deepfried 
bamboo worms 
yuk you say how about a nice helping of honey instead 
sorry to disappoint you but its really bee barf 
ok so maybe you can deal with the truth about honey but thats 
not all most americans dont realize theyre already eating a 
pound or two of insects every year 
you just cant see them because theyre ground up into tiny 
little chunks in your strawberry jam peanut butter spaghetti 
sauce applesauce and frozen chopped broccoli 
the insect parts even add to the protein making some products 
more nutritious said michael burgett an entomologist at oregon 
state university 
he estimates every acre of land in oregon contains about 100 
pounds of insect protein in tropical areas its about 400 pounds 
burgett bemoans the fact that most of the protein is going to 
waste except for that extra touch of tartness in the jam on your 
english muffin of course 
the us food and drug administration says there is no way to 
eliminate all bugs from our food so it sets what are called 
defect action levels to control the amount of insect parts 
rodent hairs molds and other tiny particles that pose no health 
hazard 
essentially the fda is saying you can only have enough bugs 
so you cant see them burgett said 
we have an innate bias against insects i blame on our european 
heritage for our culture insects are outside the realm of food 
the glaring exception is honey which is bee vomit essentially 
its a plant product mediated by an insect 
burgett is an internationally recognized expert on bees he 
respects bees he is fascinated with their behavior 
and he said they make delicious cookies 
a pound of bees is about 3500 bees you put them in the oven 
at low heat for eight hours then grind or blend the dry husks into 
flour makes great cookies about half my students ate the cookies 
the first year i made them most of them said they didnt taste any 
different so i cheated the second year and put in grapenuts to 
make them crunchy 
but if you really want crunchy the giant waterbug is the 
appetizer of choice roasted and eaten whole its a favorite in 
asia said burgett whos sampled a variety of insect fare 
youll find that asian cultures have incorporated insects in 
their diets for a long time one of the most popular insects in 
asia is the giant waterbug which is like a big cockroach its 
easily collected around lights at night especially around ponds 
in thailand you can judge a restaurant by the bugs on the menu 
in thailand about 50 species of insects are commonly eaten 
thats a lot and theyre eaten by a broad spectrum of society 
ive gone to very nice thai restaurants and they have excellent 
insect dishes on the menu burgett said 
american consumers are so finicky about bugs theyll never eat 
them burgett said at least they wont mass consume them in 
the numbers needed to make bug ranching a solid commercial success 
theyve talked about using termites in the northwest highly 
nutritious with high protein content per body weight but whos 
going to eat them 
bee keepers in western canada kill their bees in the fall 
because its too expensive to keep them through the winter they 
restock from southern california in the spring but all those bee 
pupae are going to waste the major hurdle again is who wants to 
eat it there is a gourmet market in japan for the male pupae of 
the honeybee but that market is small 
if people wont eat cooked bugs no matter how tasty and 
nutritious at least they could tolerate more bugs in what they do 
eat burgett said if the fda would relax the limit for insect 
parts say double it us farmers could significantly reduce the 
amount of pesticides sprayed every year 
snap beans are a perfect example the 12spotted cucumber 
beetle takes tiny little bites out of the beans it doesnt harm 
the bean but consumers want perfection so the growers spray the 
beans to rid them of beetles and bite marks when growers drive up 
to the food processing plant people sample the beans and bite 
marks and if the ratio is too high the company will tell the 
grower well have to process this batch differently so the 
growers makes less money 
farmers are spraying less because pesticides costs are rising 
and alternate pest management strategies are working burgett said 
much of the spraying that remains is for appearance and that wont 
change until consumers stop being so squeamish about bugs he said 
if you say i dont want any bugs in my food and i dont 
want any insecticide residue then well all starve burgett 
said 
id rather eat more insects and less pesticide residue he 
said 
will consumers agree burgett is a pessimist 
consumer acceptance is a big problem fifty years ago it 
wouldnt matter if an apple had a moth larva inside or if the bean 
had a beetle bite are these people shopping for flawless apples 
willing to pay the price for less insecticides i think not 
but he has advice for environmentalists and consumers who want 
to reduce the pesticides in our food bug the government

surgeons have started using a new way to remove 
a gallbladder they pull it out through a hole smaller than a dime 
patients can leave the hospital in a day or less and return to 
work much faster than after standard surgery surgeons say 
the new technique also saves money and hurts less they say 
surgeons are scrambling to learn the procedure and they may use 
it for a quarter of gallbladder removals by 1992 and 75 percent by 
1994 kenneth abramowitz a health care market analyst with sanford 
c bernstein amp co predicted 
right now patients are flocking to the physicians to get 
the new operation said nashville tenn surgeon douglas olsen a 
pioneer in the technique 
gallbladder removal used to treat gallstones is one of the 
nations most common surgical procedures done more than 500000 
times a year 
the new procedure is called a laparoscopic or endoscopic 
cholecystectomy as with a regular gallbladder removal the patient 
is put under general anesthesia 
standard surgery has then called for an incision of 4 to 6 
inches in the abdomen although recently some surgeons have reduced 
that to 2 or 3 inches olsen said 
the new procedure avoids any such incision instead the surgeon 
makes two quarterinch punctures and two halfinch punctures one 
hole goes in or near the navel one below the breastbone and two 
below the ribcage on the right side 
the surgeon slips surgical instruments into the body through 
sleevelike tubes in the holes one instrument contains a tiny 
video camera so the surgeon can watch his progress on a screen 
using the instruments the surgeon grasps the baglike 
gallbladder cuts it free with a laser or electric cauterizing 
device and performs other followup procedures then he pulls the 
gallbladder out through the navel puncture 
olsen said he usually concludes by putting a single stitch in 
the navel and a few absorbable stitches in the other puncture 
sites once the holes heal they resemble minor skin blemishes 
rather than a surgical scar so women can still wear their 
bikinis olsen said 
the surgery avoids the injury to muscle and associated tissues 
that comes from a standard incision so recovery hurts less and 
proceeds faster surgeons say 
rather than spending five to eight days in the hospital most 
patients go home in a day or less said olsen he said he does it 
as an outpatient procedure some surgeons hospitalize the patient 
overnight 
and rather than waiting four to six weeks to return to work the 
average patient needs only five days to a week olsen said 
ive had people go back to work the following day after their 
operation and thats not unusual said olsen 
patients almost immediately feel their energy return because 
the body needs not spend energy on healing tissues from the 
standard surgical incision said minneapolis surgeon leonard 
schultz 
this is a patientled revolution in health care schultz 
said insurance companies are now being deluged by patients 
saying i want this operation 
for his patients insurance companies that require presurgical 
authorization usually grant it for the new procedure he said 
about half the nations 74 independent blue cross and blue 
shield plans cover the procedure although the national association 
has made no recommendation on coverage a spokeswoman for the 
national association said 
some other insurance companies cover the procedure too said 
spokesman donald white of the health insurance association of 
america it is in fact a widely accepted technology 
he recommended that people contemplating the surgery contact 
their insurance companies 
schultz said the cost of hospitalization plus the surgeon fees 
may come to about 7000 or about 1000 less than for standard 
gallbladder removal the faster return to work also cuts disability 
payments he said 
while people talk about high technology boosting health care 
costs here technology is helping to bring down costs he said 
some surgeons express cautions dr paul ebert director of the 
american college of surgeons said about one in 20 patients who go 
under anesthesia for the new surgery wake up to find that a 
standard procedure was done instead 
that occurs when the surgeon discovers severe scarring or some 
other problem that rules out the new procedure the college 
recommends the new procedure be done by surgeons qualified to do a 
standard removal 
the odds of an unexpected switch to standard surgery may decline 
as doctors learn to identify patients with such problems ahead of 
time ebert said 
he also said complications and longterm outcome from the new 
procedure have not been documented though initial indications 
suggest they will be about the same as with the standard procedure 
the more of these i do the more i realize there may be 
certain inherent problems of this operative procedure that still 
need some refinement schultz said i think weve made it 99 
percent safe weve got 1 percent to go 
dr charles mcsherry director of surgery at new yorks beth 
israel medical center recommended selecting a surgeon carefully 
he acknowleged it is very difficult for patients to get firsthand 
information on the skills of a particular surgeon 
as best they can they should certainly do whatever they can 
to check out the individual to see that hes experienced and see 
what his reputation is in the community with his surgical 
talents mcsherry said 
while gallbladder removals have gotten much attention from 
surgeons and patients the technique has also been applied to other 
operations gynecologists use it routinely for a number of 
procedures 
surgeons have also used the technique to remove the appendix 
and following hernia repairs with the new technique schultz said 
patients take a couple pain pills and go back to work in two days 
this blows my mind he said

two days after cyndi newmans gallbladder was 
removed she was cheering at a little league game and lifting her 
toddler out of his crib 
its hard to believe you can have an operation and not need 
pain medicine said the 30yearold mother of three 
sandra ludwig 39 gave an engagement party and went shopping 
the weekend after her surgery the message on the answering machine 
at her northern virginia home says hi this is sandra a modern 
medical miracle im out venturing around 
and ken beswick a united nations official went shopping the 
day after his operation and gave a presentation in washington two 
days after that 
newman ludwig and beswick are among several thousand people 
around the country whose doctors have removed their gallbladders 
using a new technique called laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
about 500000 people twothirds of them women have their 
gallbladders removed every year 
most still are removed using traditional surgery which requires 
four to six days in the hospital and three to six weeks of 
recuperation 
traditional surgery also leaves a 4 to 6inch scar similar to 
the prominent scar president lyndon b johnson displayed to the 
press after having his gallbladder removed at the bethesda naval 
center in 1965 
bellybutton surgery was brought to this country from france a 
year and a half ago by dr eddie joe reddick of west side hospital 
in nashville tenn physicians use thin elongated instruments and 
a tiny video camera on the end of a probe to remove gallbladders 
through a halfinch incision in the navel 
ninetyeight percent of our patients are in the hospital for 
less than 24 hours theyre able to return to normal within three 
to five days said dr karl a zucker at the university of 
maryland medical center in baltimore 
last fall zucker and his colleague dr robert w bailey began 
using an electric cauterizer instead of an expensive laser to 
seal blood vessels and veins the technique using a common 
surgical tool popularized the operation they estimate about 5000 
surgeons nationally have learned the new procedure 
patients marvel at how well they feel almost as soon as they 
wake up from the anesthesia 
ludwig a therapist at a community health center in springfield 
va said she was so anxious she had called zucker frequently 
during the two months before her operation i woke up all i had 
was these little bandaids 
beswick 59 had his gallbladder removed at university of 
maryland medical center on his way back to argentina from a 
conference in canada 
three days after the surgery he gave a presentation in 
washington five days later the chief technical adviser in latin 
america for the international atomic energy agency had flown for 18 
hours back to buenos aires without discomfort 
its certainly the way to have ones gallbladder removed 
beswick said you feel a little bit tender around the navel 
thats all stiffness more than anything the first couple days you 
have to be little bit careful when you stretch and straighten up

a promising new magazine aims to combine good 
eating and eating well 
with just its premiere issue out eating well seems to have 
found a niche with an attractive format brightly written stories 
both serious and funny and recipes that should appeal to relatively 
welloff people who care about their health but cringe at tofu 
burgers and pickled seaweed 
eating well created a lot of excitement at the recent 
national nutritional foods association show in boston said sara m 
starr vice president of healthfocus a consulting firm for the 
healthy foods market 
too many health magazines she said are bland brown and 
boring they dont make food fun 
i think its a good idea and i just hope they remember that 
one of the biggest parts of eating well is tasting good new york 
restaurant consultant clark wolf said we are just recovering 
from the nubby dirty health food trends of the 70s 
well there is a story about yogurt and all the recipes include 
the nutritional content but with stories about designer beef the 
napa valley calif estate of vintner robert mondavi and even 
southern cooking the first issue could hardly be classified as for 
stereotypical health food nuts 
i am looking forward to an article on butter wolf said 
not to be found in the first issue there is however the very 
funny story of a woman who very wrongheadedly decides to go into 
the chocolate business partly to rationalize her binges and the 
distressing journey of a fish from its capture off washington state 
as a rockfish to its sale a week later as fresh red snapper in an 
iowa supermarket 
editor barry estabrook 38 became interested in food journalism 
when his doctor told him his cholesterol was too high he changed 
his diet but at the same time i dont want to give up 
interesting food he said from the magazines office in 
charlotte vt 
eating well is published by the canadian company telemedia and 
is a sister publication to harrowsmith country life it was the 
result of watercooler conversation among the staff many of them 
approaching age 40 estabrook said 
people started to talk about cholesterol levels their parents 
having heart conditions and their own childrens nutrition he 
said these are people who had been talking about club med 
vacations and real estate in the 80s 
eating well estabrook said fits between food magazines that 
blithely pour on devon cream and the health magazines that 
shoehorn a food article in if they have the space 
once the land of meat and potatoes north america is in the 
midst of one of the most significant shifts in eating habits in 
modern history publisher james m lawrence writes in his 
introduction to the first issue 
with 144 pages eating well has predicatably advertisements 
for spring water simple pleasures fancy kitchen cabinets lean 
cuisine and lands end its newsstand price is 295 and 
subscriptions for six yearly issues are 12 
the difficult market for magazines while food magazines have 
prospered cooks magazine recently folded has not dissuaded 
eating wells publishers who are guaranteeing paid circulation of 
225000 the first year estabrook said 
this may be in part a result of the audience the magazine seeks 
welleducated people who are not going to sit around and let the 
woes of middle age take over them he said 
there is a real genuine interest among people in their own 
health its one of things they have control over starr said 
you may not be able to control the economy or the environment or 
the new taxes were all going to get but you can control what you 
put in your body and how it makes you feel 
eating well starr said is not a special interest any more 
said clark lets truly eat well eating well used to mean 
fois gras and caviar now its a lot more complex lets make 
sure the well means more than just cholesterol levels

researchers have identified a new threat to the 
atmosphere with the discovery that the burning of tropical forests 
is releasing large amounts of nitrogen into the atmosphere 
tropical forest destruction has been known to contribute to the 
warming of the earths atmosphere by the release of carbon dioxide 
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the atmosphere traps 
more of the suns heat giving rise to the socalled greenhouse 
effect 
a study reported in the current issue of the journal nature 
finds that the burning of tropical forests also is releasing 
significant amounts of nitrogen some of it in the form of nitrous 
oxide a potent greenhouse gas 
nitrous oxide put into the atmosphere by biomass burning is a 
greenhouse gas 250 times more powerful molecule for molecule than 
carbon dioxide said joel s levine of nasas langley research 
center in hampton va in a commentary on the new study 
the burning of tropical forest biomass is also releasing 
nitric oxide which contributes to pollution and is the fastest 
growing component of acid rain levine said 
the study was directed by paul j crutzen of the max planck 
institute for chemistry in mainz west germany

nursing home residents became less depressed 
when their caregivers were given rosy but bogus predictions 
about their progress a study says 
the residents also became more dependent on help for performing 
daytoday tasks researchers said 
both changes may have occurred because the caregivers spoke more 
warmly to them and physically helped them more researchers 
suggested in the july issue of the journal of the american 
geriatrics society 
the study focused on 63 elderly people newly admitted to six 
nursing homes they were randomly assigned to a highexpectancy 
group or a comparison group 
nurses and aides were told that members of the first group could 
be expected to do better than average compared with other residents 
with the same sorts of problems no such prediction was given for 
members of the comparison group 
on average members of the experimental group showed a decline 
in depressive symptoms within three months while those in the 
other group showed an increase but the highexpectancy residents 
became more dependent on physical help while the other group 
became less dependent 
previous research has linked increased helping by caregivers to 
a decrease in functional abilities the researchers said 
study authors were from harvard university beth israel hospital 
in boston and the brocktonwest roxbury veterans administration

a former pro football player turned 
stockbroker has been barred from the financial industry for at 
least two years because of his involvement in the paul thayer 
insider trading scandal of the early 1980s 
an administrative law judge ruled in favor of the securities and 
exchange commission against william h mathis barring the account 
executive with bear stearns amp co in atlanta ga from any 
dealings with secregistered brokerages for at least two years 
mathis a former national football league running back who 
captained the new york jets team that won the 1969 super bowl can 
reapply for sec approval to return to the business after two years 
as long as it is in a nonsupervisory position administrative law 
judge brenda p murray said in a 27page decision 
in 1988 mathis settled sec civil charges without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing murrays decision came in an sec administrative 
action 
mathis was not at the bear stearns office in atlanta when called 
for comment his lawyers in washington also were out of the office 
wednesday 
but one of them mahlon m frankhauser issued a statement 
through his office which said in part while mr mathis believes 
two years suspension from the business to be absolutely 
unjustified in light of the fact that he did not violate the 
securities laws frankhauser said mathis probably wont appeal 
the decision 
mathis was among a wide circle of people who bought shares in 
potential takeover targets between 1981 and 1983 with inside 
information supplied by former deputy defense secretary paul thayer 
and a close friend dallas stockbroker billy bob harris 
both thayer and harris pleaded guilty in 1985 to obstructing 
justice they were sentenced to prison and ordered to pay a total 
of 1 million in penalties and restitution 
thayer was deputy defense secretary in the reagan administration 
for a year beginning in january 1983 
prosecutors said that thayer while chairman of the board and 
chief executive officer of the ltv corp and a board member of two 
other companies gave confidential corporate takeover information 
to harris who in turn bought stock for himself and friends and 
passed the information on to other associates including 
allegedly mathis 
mathis was accused of tipping others about ltvs tender offer 
for grumman corp anheuserbuschs tender offer for campbell 
taggert inc and allied corps tender offer for bendix corp 
the sec claimed he knew or should have known the information 
was confidential 
mathis lawyers had argued before murray that the sec shouldnt 
be able to suspend him for violating securities laws simply because 
he settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing

by now jim wells is used to the 
laughs evoked by his product cow boots 
but he says the number of dairy farmers who find it the perfect 
answer to serious hoof problems is increasing 
thats everybodys first reaction its comical to see a cow 
wearing a boot said wells 
they come over make a joke about it then ask what the boot 
is for then ive got them 
wells is attending new yorks empire farm days in seneca falls 
to find buyers and distributors in the united states for his 
shoes for moos since introducing the boot last august wells 
has sold more than 15000 at 50 apiece in eight countries 
including canada the soviet union and japan 
the response has been unbelievable said wells a parttime 
marketing instructor at conestoga college in elmira ontario and 
the owner of a clothing store 
paul larkin a dairy farmer from hamilton ny grinned as he 
looked over wells boot recently at the new york farm trade show 
he walked away with one under his arm 
its bad news when you have a cow with hoof rot or some other 
kind of foot infection im always looking for the better way and 
this looked like one larkin said 
the boot which looks like a shorter version of a firefighters 
boot is made of black fabricbacked rubber with two bright 
yellow straps and buckles to hold it in place it has a textured 
pebble bottom for traction on slippery surfaces 
its designed to protect the injured hoofs of cows while they 
heal normally when a cow develops hoof rot corns ulcers or 
other foot infections the cow is given antibiotics and the foot is 
bandaged and wrapped with plastic bags to keep the dressing dry 
plastic bags as you can imagine arent the best fit cows 
will rub them chew at them or whatever until they come off said 
wells they cant do that with the boot 
another benefit is that bootclad hooves dont need to be 
treated with antibiotics that saves the farmer milk which must be 
thrown away while a cow is on antibiotics and the cost of 
prescriptions which can cost as much as 170 wells said 
its a smart idea said everette bridgeman a dairy farm 
worker from bergen ny 
weve used old rubbers but they dont last long ive heard of 
other farmers using disposable diapers something thats durable 
and works is what farmers are looking for said bridgeman 
customers with problems like bridgemans gave wells the idea for 
his reusable cow boot 
three years ago i didnt know a thing about cows but a 
couple of mennonite farmers came into my store and bought rubber 
boots for their cows after talking to them i realized there was 
untapped niche there he said 
there are 2 million dairy cows in canada and 11 million in the 
united states capturing just 1 percent of those markets would mean 
sales of 65 million 
to discover what a cow looks for in comfortable footwear wells 
turned to his brotherinlaw tom byers a classifier with the 
holstein association of canada 
together they designed and tested the prototype and convinced 
amused officials at kaufman footwear in kitchener ontario to 
manufacture it 
we honestly thought this was just going to be a fad item 
said wells who has been traveling full time in recent months to 
promote his product at dairy shows throughout north america

shades of the seventies americans are being 
asked to cut down their power consumption and park their gas 
guzzlers because a middle east conflict has crimped the flow of 
arab oil 
no there arent any long queues at gas stations or oddeven 
rationing based on license plate numbers and no ones been ordered 
to adjust the thermostat to a set level 
but car clubs and utilities have endorsed president bushs 
appeal to conserve energy after cutting off iraq imports since its 
takeover of kuwait 
motorists understand action needs to be taken to guarantee 
access to gasoline supplies not only for their cars but for theirs 
jobs and employment said geoff sundstrom spokesman for the 
american automobile association 
in a leter to the white house sent wednesday the aaa supported 
the presidents persian gulf actions it also reinstituted its gas 
watchers program a collection of tips on cutting gas consumption 
first issued in the 1970s during the arab oil embargo 
aaa which has 32 million members said the average price of 
selfserve unleaded gasoline was 124 cents on wednesday an 
increase of almost four cents from the day before and a jump of 
162 cents a gallon in a week 
even carcrazed california which has an abiding love affair 
with the automobile is preaching savings 
try to make five gallons do the work of six said tom rohrer 
of the california automobile association 
none of the conservation would be needed if americans werent so 
hooked on foreign oil half the countrys oil about 84 million 
barrels a day is imported 
the dependence was first underscored with arab oil embargoes in 
1973 and 1979 it has now hit home again 
americans everywhere must do their part bush said in a 
nationally televised speech that appealed for conservation 
there were more calls and visitors than normal wednesday at the 
energy conservation center set up in 1979 by consolidated edison 
co of new york the office helps consumers chose the most 
efficient appliances and touts energysaving flourescent light 
bulbs 
you dont have to change your lifestyle but you do have to 
live smarter said harold mcshane of con ed conservation is 
important we shouldnt just wait for a crisis to do something 
about it 
the utilitys 28 million customers face higher bills because 
the companys oil costs have jumped 5 a barrel in a week about 30 
to 40 percent of its electricity comes from burning oil 
weve been urging conservation all along said utility 
spokeswoman rosalie zuckerman people can help cut their costs if 
they use energy wisely and dont waste 
one consumer who visited the center said she wouldnt mind 
cutting back because of iraq 
im willing to sacrifice why should we use their oil said 
madi argueta 30 of guttenberg nj 
conservation was also the word in sacramento calif despite 
temperatures above 100 for the second straight day 
theres not a shortage today just a fear of a shortage 
said david freeman general manager of the sacramento municipal 
utility district this latest middle east conflict is a wake up 
call to america we dare not fall asleep again 
meanwhile the us council for energy awareness which promotes 
the use of nuclear power said about 5 percent of the nations 
energy comes from oil down from about 17 percent in 1973 
but dependence on oil has grown nearly 40 percent in the past 
three years to 730000 barrels of oil per day for electricity 
we are far too dependent on foreign oil its a message weve 
been carrying for a long time said uscea spokesman scott peters 
we definitely need a strong energy strategy at the national level 
to prevent this kind of thing from happening 
nuclear power accounts for about 19 percent of the nations 
electricity

president bush wouldnt have to travel 
far from his maine retreat this weekend to get an earful about 
soaring gasoline prices talk about pricegouging and big oils 
greed surrounded the pumps at the port mobil filling station just 
down the road from the first familys seaside hideaway 
since iraq invaded kuwait a week ago prices have jumped 20 
cents a gallon angering summer vacationers and townspeople in this 
bustling tourist haunt midway between portland and the new 
hampshire line 
craig fraser an attendant at port mobil said some motorists 
arent swayed when he tells them the station is merely passing on 
increases imposed by suppliers and isnt making any more money 
you try to explain it to them and they get really frustrated 
with you they get real ugly fraser said 
at port mobil and at the highvolume gulf stations along the 
maine turnpike where prices were a few pennies lower motorists 
had no difficulty seizing on a villain 
some accused local dealers of pricegouging but most pinned the 
blame on the big oil companies 
the oil companies have taken advantage of a perceived panic to 
raise the price said gary greene of simsbury conn the 
dealers are just passing it along 
i dont fault the dealer agreed gordon feldman of 
baltimore he accused the big oil companies of profiteering as they 
had during previous periods of international tension that raised 
prices 
others questioned why prices were going up so rapidly and 
maintained that there is no reason to charge more for gasoline 
already in stock or in the pipeline 
i think the dealers are jumping the gun said jean cornwell 
of kennebunk beach i dont see any need for prices to go up 
now 
william franklin of baltimore driving his family of five home 
from picturesque bar harbor in a van with a camper that gets 11 
miles per gallon reserved his wrath for iraq 
it upsets me he said we helped iraq once and this is 
the thanks we get 
port mobil less than two miles from the presidents home in 
kennebunkport is frequented by the secret service agents and other 
members of the white house staff owner er warren co inc an 
oil distributor as well as a retailer has supplied te fuel that 
powers the presidents limousine and his speedboat as well as the 
dieselpowered generators at the bush compound 
while tourism appears to be down from last year in much of 
maine kennebunks lower village and kennebunkports dock square 
have swarmed with vacationers this summer sampling boutiques 
restaurants and art galleries made famous by their proximity to the 
bush familys summer home 
tourists account for roughly half the business at port mobil a 
twopump station overlooking the river that separates the two 
towns but manager michael taylor said most complaints about gas 
prices come from maine natives tourists seem less inclined to 
quibble he said 
theyre here on vacation and if its 2 a gallon theyre 
going to fill it up taylor said im the same way when im on 
vacation 
by wednesday port mobil was charging 1359 for regular 
unleaded and 1459 and 1559 for the higheroctane blends an 
eight cent increase that day alone

oil industry analysts blame president bushs 
reluctance to tap the nations emergency oil stockpile after the 
iraqkuwait crisis for much of the 15 cents more a gallon many 
americans are now paying for gasoline 
theres a real question why we should put the economy and 
consumers through all this pain when we have the oil available 
said adam sieminski an oil economist for washington analysis corp 
since iraq invaded kuwait last week and other nations agreed not 
to buy the 42 million barrels they had been exporting daily oil 
prices have skyrocketing faster than any time since world war ii 
including the 197374 arab oil embargo 
the united states built a 590millionbarrel strategic petroleum 
reserve for just such a rainy day at a cost of 20 billion to 
taxpayers over the past decade japan and most european countries 
also have built similar stockpiles totaling 425 million barrels 
because there are countries that can still increase oil 
production chiefly saudi arabia the united arab emirates and 
venezuela administration officials maintain there is no oil 
shortage and no need to tap the reserve to drive down prices 
theres an overhead of oil in the marketplace thank god 
bush told a news conference wednesday i hope that this rapid 
spike in oil prices will not be permanent if the world begins 
to see assurances that there will not be a dramatic cutdown on oil 
then things will return much more to normal in the market 
at a conference in washington on wednesday mexican foreign 
secretary fernando solana announced that his country would send an 
additional 100000 barrels of oil a day to the united states to 
help fill the 700000barreladay gap caused by the embargo of 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil the mexican commitment is scheduled to last 
two months 
one government official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said there is evidence on the ground that saudi arabia is 
moving to increase its oil production along with the united arab 
emirates and venezuela 
but theres been no official acknowledgement of it theyre 
keeping quiet he said well be pushing everybody who has any 
additional capacity to start using it 
amid those reports prices of brent blent and west texas 
intermediate crude fell between 150 and 190 a barrel on the 
london and new york markets wednesday from 27402830 a day 
earlier the prices averaged 1940 in july 
analysts said it would take up to a month to get all that 
incremental oil flowing particularly from the saudis 
the energy department says it can have oil flowing from the us 
strategic reserve 16 days after a presidential decision to use it 
sieminski and other analysts estimate that it would more likely 
take a month 
once oil is flowing the energy department can pump up to 35 
million barrels from the us reserve which is stored in salt 
caverns along the texas and louisiana coasts 
it would only take a fraction of that 500000 barrels a day 
coupled with similar coordinated releases from the other world 
stockpiles to douse fears of shortages and the resulting 
speculation and hoarding analysts said 
if youre going to let the market handle this youre looking 
at a 15 increase and prices between 30 and 35 and spikes well 
above that in september and october sieminski said 
at those prices he said the use of oil throughout the world 
would drop by a million barrels but it would take six months to 
accomplish it risking a worldwide recession in the process 
if september is going to be a problem and it looks like it 
is the time to make a decision to tap the reserve is now 
he said 
us japanese and european officials in charge of the 
government stockpiles scheduled a meeting today at the 
international energy agency in paris to coordinate possible use of 
their government reserves 
we will draw down the strategic petroleum reserve in 
cooperation with our allies if the severity of the situation 
warrants it said john easton a member of the us delegation 
presently i emphasize presently there is not a significant 
shortfall of crude oil in the market 
philip verleger an oil analyst for the institute for 
international economics argued that immediately after the invasion 
of kuwait last thursday bush should have announced releases of oil 
from the reserve and closed trading in oil on the futures market 
for a day 
doing nothing fanned the flames and drove prices up a 
tragic mistake that has cost the consumers billions of dollars

chairman edward a brennan of sears roebuck and 
co apparently figures if he wants it done right he better do it 
himself 
operating on this theory brennan replaced the head of the 
companys retail division and took on the added responsibilities 
himself 
he said the flagging retail operation has to move faster 
than it had under michael bozic bozic was moved wednesday from 
chairman and chief executive officer to president and chief 
operation officer for the division 
there will be no change in sears everyday low pricing 
merchandising strategy brennan said in a statement the strategy 
began 17 months ago as the company struggled to reverse a decline 
in profits 
while we have complete confidence in our strategy we need to 
move faster and step up its implementation brennan said 
the merchandise groups operating income in the last quarter 
plunged 32 percent to 110 million from 1616 million 
retail revenues rose 22 percent to 79 billion from 77 
billion but the group continued to underperform discount 
competitors such as k mart and walmart 
analysts said the realignment will give brennan more control of 
the retailing division and more responsibility for its success or 
failure 
it certainly signifies the importance of turning around the 
retail group said richard nelson a retailing analyst with duff 
and phelps inc in chicago 
brennan started his sears career in retailing and served as the 
divisions top officer for four years before ascending to the 
corporate presidency in august 1984 
leo j shapiro chief executive officer of leo j shapiro and 
associates inc a chicagobased retail research firm said brennan 
faces an enormous task 
i can see what sears sees in him but given his success i 
dont see why he wants the job shapiro said 
he has to make sears live up to its promise to be a vital 
growing part of retail industry he said right now its not

iraqs invasion of kuwait should build support 
in congress for requiring major improvements in automobile fuel 
efficiency environmentalists and consumer advocates say 
our troops in the middle east may have to pay the ultimate 
sacrifice bill magavern of the us public interest research 
group said wednesday encouraging conservation through greater 
fuel economy is relatively painless 
legislation is pending in congress to require 40 
milespergallon fuel efficiency by the end of the decade up from 
the current standard of 275 mpg 
automakers who fiercely oppose the bill acknowledge the middle 
east crisis could make their lobbying more difficult 
were afraid its going to be harder to fight said charles 
lockwood general counsel of the association of international 
automobile manufacturers we fear the senate may take action 
without considering all the consequences 
the bill sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev cleared the 
senate commerce committee on a 144 vote april 3 floor debate is 
expected next month 
we have been reminded that we squandered the breathing space 
of the 1980s not using that period of low prices constructively 
to lessen our dependence on foreign oil bryan said 
more than 50 senators support the bill and iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and its aftermath may provide the 60 votes needed to halt a 
filibuster magavern said 
under current law new car fleets all the cars a company 
manufactures in a model year are required to average at least 
275 miles per gallon the bryan bill would require each company to 
boost its average 20 percent by the 1995 model year and 40 percent 
by 2001 
the typical fleet would average 344 mpg in 1995 and 402 mpg by 
2001 
supporters say higher mileage standards are needed to force the 
auto industry to make more fuelefficient cars in addition to 
saving oil improved efficiency would reduce air pollution they 
say 
automakers say the bills targets are technologically 
unrealistic and would require drastic reductions in automobile 
weight all but the smallest cars would disappear from showrooms 
they warn and many consumers would hold onto their old gas 
guzzlers rather than crowd the family into a subcompact 
its an attempt to legislate the family car out of 
existence general motors corp spokesman bill noack said 
when the first gasoline shortages hit in the 1970s domestic 
auto companies had no fuelefficient cars to sell ford motor co 
vice president helen petrauskas said 
now however we have numerous small and midsize highly 
fuelefficient cars and trucks available she said we could 
adjust production volumes to accommodate greater consumer demand 
automakers will watch closely to see whether the latest oil 
scare rekindles interest in smaller cars chrysler corp spokesman 
richard muller said if so manufacturers will meet the demand 
but even then the bryan standards would not be feasible he said 
sales trends have been toward larger cars for the past eight 
years muller said this is the age of cheap gasoline he said 
its still priced very reasonably compared to other countries 
adjusted for inflation he said gasoline actually sells for less 
than during the early 1970s 
transportation secretary samuel skinner notified congress in 
march that the bush administration opposed the bill a spokesman 
said developments in the middle east had not altered that position

if the mideast crisis moves 
consumers toward more fuelefficient cars general motors corp 
says it quickly can increase production of fourcylinder engines 
weve got plenty of enginemaking capacity if there is a 
market shift we would be able to handle it literally overnight 
gm president lloyd reuss said wednesday during a management 
conference organized by the university of michigan 
questions about fuelefficient cars are cropping up more and 
more as gasoline prices rise stemming from iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
but one of the companys largest dealers says fuel efficiency 
isnt high on consumers preference lists 
joseph celozzi new car sales manager at celozziettleson 
chevroletgeo in chicago said gm shouldnt worry about making lots 
of fourcylinder cars 
you try to sell a fourcylinder car and you arent going 
anywhere he said very seldom will i sell a car with a 
fourcylinder i dont even stock a fourcylinder for a midsize 
the auto industry still is assessing potential effects from 
iraqs invasion of kuwait and the subsequent rise of gasoline 
prices typically as gas prices increase the balance between 
sales of large and small cars tips in favor of smaller vehicles 
with better fuel efficiency 
chrysler corp which has the best fueleconomy rating of the 
big three gave up the subcompact market when it stopped making its 
dodge omni and plymouth horizon subcompacts in february 
ford motor co is the only one of the big three that makes a 
subcompact in the united states but sales of its escort have 
slipped to the point that the company is offering incentives on its 
new 1991 models 
many of gms most fuelefficient cars are tied up in its 
fourvehicle geo line two of the cars are imported directly from 
japan and two others are made at joint ventures in california and 
canada 
as an alternative to making subcompacts reuss said gm is ready 
to increase production of its fourcylinder engines for larger cars 
theres a risk for automakers in increasing the percentage of 
small cars they sell at the expense of largecar sales they 
arent nearly as profitable as larger cars 
the big three were burned during the oil and gasoline supply 
crisis in the early 1970s and japanese companies got their feet in 
the door of the us market with small fuelefficient cars 
the us auto industry has changed since then engine technology 
during the 1980s improved horsepower and fuel efficiency at the 
same time also efficiency of exhaust emission systems has 
improved resulting in better overall fuel economy 
the big three carefully are monitoring consumer attitudes 
mainly through their dealers 
business at river oaks chryslerplymouth in houston has been 
slow during the last few days general manager alan helfman said 
possibly because of the mideast events 
sales of big cars are going down helfman said i had a 
sales increase just before this happened and in the last few days 
its gotten quiet

six to eight general motors corp assembly 
plants may have to close or cut production because of a strike by 
2800 workers at a parts plant the automaker says 
the walkout wednesday at gms ac rochester division flint west 
plant came after negotiations with the united auto workers union on 
employee grievances about health and safety issues broke off 
wednesday morning 
were obviously disappointed said gm president lloyd reuss 
reached at a meeting at traverse city he estimated the walkout 
could force production cuts or shutdowns at six to eight assembly 
plants 
i would expect the assembly plants to be impacted in the next 
two to three days reuss said declining to identify the plants 
with a typical assembly plant employing 5000 people or more 
the numbers of employees affected could be in the tens of 
thousands gm spokesman john maciarz said 
the strike will affect assembly operations more quickly because 
of the automakers adoption of the justintime parts inventory 
system 
the justintime system involves manufacturing gas tanks van 
doors and grilles pickup truck grilles and other parts and 
shipping them as they are needed rather than keeping costly 
inventories in storage there are no big warehouses out in back 
any more maciarz said 
certainly a large number of our assembly operations would be 
impacted and other supplier divisions would be impacted because of 
not being able to send parts to assembly plants he said by 
monday anyway we would begin to see an impact 
maciarz said gm negotiators were ready to continue talks with 
the union but he didnt know when they might resume 
hopefully it wont be a long strike said duane 
zuckschwerdt a uaw bargainer 
because the impact would spread rapidly to other plants and 
other employees the local is under pressure not only from gm but 
from other uaw locals said david cole director of the office for 
the study of automotive transportation at the university of 
michigan 
if a strike is a local matter and not part of a national uaw 
plan he said both gm and the uaw are going to find a way to 
eliminate them from the game

its just after dawn as david whitehead 
maneuvers his boxy milk truck up the first driveway of the day at 
the house he grabs two halfgallons as he jumps out drops them 
into the insulated box then is off to his next stop 
the thud of cartons has replaced the clatter of bottles but 
otherwise this could be a scene from the 1940s when nearly every 
gallon of milk americans drank at home was delivered to their 
doorsteps 
his reassuring presence may not be as pervasive as it was 50 
years ago but the milkman is definitely back in connecticut and 
other parts of the country 
and hes updated for the 90s with a product list that rivals 
any small grocery store 
with more women working the convenience of having the product 
delivered to the home is more appealing because they have better 
things to do with their discretionary time says michael marcus 
president of marcus dairy in danbury conn 
there are enough people out there who want the service he 
said its just a matter of getting the word out 
nostalgia is part of the appeal marcus said his customers are 
clamoring to have their milk delivered in glass bottles partly for 
ecological reasons theyre recyclable but also for the memories 
they conjure up 
his milk now comes in plasticcoated paper cartons but he plans 
to bring back bottles as soon as he can find a manufacturer 
for the same reason drivers for the palm beach milk co in palm 
beach fla wear the traditional white uniform black bow tie and 
white hat marcus drivers wear gray uniforms sans hat 
the old axiom of the milkman being part of the family were 
fostering that image said jacques von spiro who started palm 
beach milk three months ago to cater to a growing market 
in connecticut 25 marcus trucks fan out across the state six 
days a week the 110 stops on whiteheads route include fancy 
beachfront estates modest homes in middleclass neighborhoods and 
small homes in public housing projects 
orders run the gamut one family gets a halfpint of cream 
delivered twice a week another gets practically everything marcus 
dairy offers eight varieties of milk orange and grapefruit juice 
cottage cheese sour cream eggs ice cream yogurt butter bacon 
and plastic trash bags 
fatfree beef will soon be offered on some routes and the dairy 
is negotiating with an independent grocer to deliver all groceries 
marcus said 
if i could have all my groceries delivered i would said 
patricia carrubba a customer on whiteheads route who has been 
getting her milk and orange juice delivered for two years 
marcus charges 192 for a halfgallon of homedelivered milk 
compared to a dollar and change in some stores thats enough of a 
difference to make the milkman the first to go when a family 
suffers a financial crunch said whitehead a beefy bearded 
42yearold who has been with marcus dairy for 21 years business 
also slows down during the summer he said 
michael marcus whose grandfather started the dairy in 1924 
says home milk delivery started to decline during the 1950s and 
1960s with the rise of the twocar family 
his deliveries dropped to their lowest point around 1978 but 
started to rebound slowly about five years ago today they account 
for about 9 percent of his business or about 7500 accounts 
marcus whose other customers include schools hospital and 
other institutions projects growth of 1 percent a month and hopes 
home deliveries will account for half his business within a couple 
of years 
von spiro said he researched the home delivery business for two 
years before starting palm beach milk in may with 208 customers 
he now has more than 1000 customers and hopes to expand in 
florida and across the country 
his company offers 98 products including baked goods and smoked 
salmon delivered in prepackaged coolerlike boxes the milk 
which comes in glass bottles is 199 a halfgallon 
just 1 percent of the 3 billion gallons of milk produced 
nationwide is delivered to the home according to the us 
department of agriculture but dairymen like marcus and von spiro 
see a growing if modest niche for the homedelivery business 
with both husbands and wives working theres not a lot of 
time von spiro said they appreciate this 
von spiro said his typical palm beach customers arent 
spectacularly wealthy but working couples between the ages of 25 
and 50 most without children 
in addition to yuppies marcuss connecticut drivers also serve 
some lowerincome families and elderly shutins who cant get to 
the market 
for some customers like vera cole with a mansion on long island 
sound delivery simply makes life easier 
i find i spend less money on groceries because if i get milk 
and orange juice from the milkman i dont make as many trips to 
the grocery store she said

the procter amp gamble co said thursday its 
fourthquarter profit climbed 66 percent from results a year ago 
that were depressed by a big onetime charge 
the consumer products giant said it earned 284 million or 78 
cents per share in the three months ended june 30 compared with 
171 million or 50 cents a share a year earlier 
pampg said its quarterly earnings would have increased 14 percent 
excluding the effect of the 78 million aftertax reserve 
established in june 1989 to consolidate production facilities 
worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter rose 144 percent to 
622 billion from 543 billion a year earlier 
for the year the company said its earnings rose 328 percent to 
16 billion or 449 a share from 12 billion or 356 a 
share the previous year 
worldwide net sales rose 13 percent to 2408 billion for the 
year from 214 billion the previous year 
procter amp gamble said the earnings increase for the year was due 
primarily to what chairman edwin l artzt called the biggest 
worldwide unit volume increase the company has achieved in 32 years 
pampg also said a lower corporate income tax rate and the 
manufacturing consolidation reserve fund contributed to the 
earnings increase 
the growth in earnings was greater than the increase in earnings 
per share because of the november 1989 acquisition of noxell corp 
a marylandbased maker of skin care products in exchange for pampg 
common stock

the new york stock exchange today elected wall 
street veteran william h donaldson as chairman and chief executive 
officer replacing retiring head john j phelan jr 
the nyses board also expanded president richard a grassos 
duties to executive vice chairman both appointments take effect 
jan 1 
i dont think we could get a finer selection than bill 
donaldson phelan told a news conference donaldson who first 
came to wall street 35 years ago called the appointment a 
tremendous homecoming 
the announcements came after a special board meeting to select a 
new leader for the nations largest and the worlds second largest 
stock exchange 
donaldson 59 founded donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc in 1959 
with two college friends one year out of harvard business school 
he was tabbed by a ninemember search panel appointed after phelan 
in february announced plans to retire at the end of the year 
grassos additional responsibilities were described by people 
familiar with the selections as an inducement to keep him at the 
exchange it was widely known that he had wanted the chairmans job 
donaldson praised phelans administration for being responsive 
to the unexpected during such events as the market gyrations 
that followed iraqs invasion of kuwait last week 
as weve seen from the last few days new challenges come from 
unexpected places donaldson said 
he said some of the challenges facing the exchange in the 1990s 
will be keeping up with technological changes affecting global 
securities trading 
new generations of technology will have to be deployed in 
support of the soundest trading concepts donaldson said 
innovative financial products will have to be tested for their 
acceptability in the marketplace as well as their technical 
excellence 
phelan chairman since 1984 will remain a consultant for nyse 
relations with foreign stock exchanges he currently is chairman of 
the association of international stock exchanges and has traveled 
extensively during his tenure cultivating ties with markets abroad 
donaldson left dlj in the early 1970s to serve as an 
undersecretary of state to henry kissinger he later founded yale 
universitys school of organization and management before returning 
to wall street in the early 1980s 
he founded and still operates a money management and merchant 
banking firm donaldson enterprises inc in 1980 
donaldson is best known on wall street for leading and winning a 
fight to overturn an nyse ban on publicly owned securities firms 
after the exchange agreed to let dlj sell stock to the public in 
1969 many securities firms followed 
donaldson takes over one of the most highprofile jobs in the 
securities industry at a time of increased competition from 
overseas markets rapidly developing technology and controversial 
volatility that allegedly has undermined individual investors 
confidence in the stock market 
wall street executives said donaldsons strong ties in 
washington would help wall street in such fights as a bush 
administration plan to tax stock transactions

federal regulators moved today to get 409 
million in restitution from charles h keating jr and five other 
officers of a phoenix holding company that owned the failed lincoln 
savings and loan association 
the office of thrift supervision also said it also wanted to 
remove keating and five other officers from american continental 
corp which owned the irvine calif thrift before its 2 billion 
failure last year 
timothy ryan director of the federal agency called the move 
the most significant enforcement action ots has ever 
undertaken the restitution order is largest sought by federal 
regulators 
the administrative action against keating and the other american 
continental officers seeks to recover 409 million in losses from 
three business deals that one official said showed evidence of 
blatant disregard for the safety and soundness of lincoln 
if recovered the money would be returned to lincoln which was 
seized by federal regulators april 14 1989 
the restitution order applies to keating and the five executives 
and ryan said the agency is seeking the money from all six either 
individually or as a group 
keating is already named in a 11 billion racketeering suit 
filed by the resolution trust corp charging him with fraudulently 
diverting depositors money 
a federal grand jury in los angeles is conducting a criminal 
investigation of keatings financial dealings and sources say the 
justice department is investigating whether he improperly donated 
13 million to five senators who intervened with regulators on his 
behalf three years ago 
ots also issued an order demanding that keating produce in five 
days a detailed accounting of his own assets ryan said regulators 
dont believe keatings repeated claims since his company filed for 
bankruptcy protection last year that he is broke 
there was just too much money available to him and too short a 
time for it to disappear ryan told reporters at a news 
conference we believe mr keating and his associates profited 
from the improper use of depositors funds and we want that money 
returned to lincoln 
the order requires keating to identify all foreign bank accounts 
and assets and bars him from transferring any money overseas it 
also requires keating to give ots two days notice before he 
transfers any money or assets worth more than 5000 ots said 
the administrative action seeks to remove keating and the top 
executives of american continental from office and to bar them 
from ever serving in position in any federally insured 
institution ryan said 
ots also sought to remove judy j wischer president and chief 
executive officer of american continental robert j kielty a 
director senior vice president and general counsel of the company 
keatings son charles h keating iii an executive vice president 
and director and two of keatings sonsinlaw who are vice 
presidents robert j hubbard and robert m wurzelbacher jr 
the amount sought represents losses that regulators say lincoln 
suffered as a result of three business deals involving subsidiaries 
of american continental 
the transactions detailed by regulators include the purchase by 
an american continental subsidiary of the hotel ponchartrain in 
detroit and its subsequent resale at an inflated price to a limited 
partnership that included keating and his associates 
regulators contend that lincoln financed the hotel purchase 
without sufficient underwriting and continued to pour money into 
the losing detroit hotel with a line of credit that exceeded its 
market value 
the ots restitution order includes 44 million in losses from 
purchase of 1000 acres of desert land 20 miles from phoenix and 
its resale at inflated prices to westcontinental mortgage corp 
regulators contend the sales were intended to improperly boost 
lincolns profits and allow american continental to take tax 
deductions 
the order also seeks recovery of 123 million in losses that 
regulators say lincoln suffered from the misuse of an employee 
stock ownership plan the plan borrowed money by lincoln to finance 
the purchase of american continental stock from keating and others 
including the five other executives named in the order 
until today the largest restitution action was a 24 million 
suit filed earlier this year against thomas spiegel former owner 
of the failed columbia savings and loan association of beverly 
hills calif 
spiegel is accused by regulators of squandering depositors 
money on vacations wine guns and business deals with junk bond

tensions in the oilrich persian gulf 
the companies have denied allegations that they have been using 
instability in the gulf as an excuse to drive up prices at the gas 
pumps unleaded gas has risen more than 16 cents a gallon since 
iraq invaded kuwait last thursday 
the price cuts came as senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
sent telegrams to top executives of 11 oil companies on wednesday 
warning of possible legislation in response to recent gasoline 
price increases he urged the companies to delay any additional 
price increases until clear and convincing justifications can be 
presented 
i can assure you that it will be very difficult to stop 
legislation controlling the prices of petroleum products or taxing 
profits resulting from these increases should no action be taken by 
the oil industry dole said 
the telegrams were sent to chief executive officers of amoco 
mobil conoco exxon shell texaco bp america unocal pennzoil 
atlantic richfield and chevron 
bp the clevelandbased subsidiary of british petroleum and the 
9thlargest oil company in the united states said it was rolling 
back prices at the gas pumps by 3 cents per gallon the company 
cited recent easing in prices in the pretroleum markets and bushs 
request for restraint 
no 11 phillips based in bartlesville okla said it was 
cutting prices at some of its gasoline terminals by as much as 45 
cents due to market changes 
conoco a wholly owned subsidiary of wilmington delbased du 
pont co said it lowered by 3 to 4 cents its wholesale prices for 
gasoline and by a penny its price for diesel fuel 
kevin lindemer an energy analyst at cambridge research 
associaties in cambridge mass said the companies actions were 
primarily to help consumers and wholesalers take the edge off 
maybe help head off some hoarding 
it takes some of the panic and fear out of the market he 
said it helps prices take a bit of a breather 
arco said wednesday its freeze affects prices of gasoline 
diesel and jet fuel arco said it was encouraging its dealers who 
by federal law set their own pump prices to avoid increases 
the company said if crude oil prices continued to rise at the 
end of the week it would be forced to raise prices otherwise if 
we remain below the market we risk a run on our stations which 
could drain our supply and create a panic buying situation in the 
marketplace arco said 
several oil companies said they backed bushs call for 
restraint but defended price hikes on the grounds that crude oil 
prices had increased much faster than gasoline prices in the last 
month 
since the iraqi invasion of kuwait crude prices have 
increased approximately 35 percent houstonbased shell oil co 
said in a statement today 
the company promised to exercise restraint but it did not lower 
prices saying its increases had been about half of the national 
average 
the industry has come under assault in recent days from 
politicians and consumer groups alleging price gouging some took 
to the offensive against their critics 
unfortunately we are in an election year and there is a 
temptation on the part of many of those in the political arena who 
in the desire for public exposure thrash out one more time at the 
oil industry said robert mcclements chairman and chief 
executive of philadelphiabased sun co 
exxon corp said it would continue pricing its products in a 
responsible manner that reflects overall market supply 
conditions the worlds largest oil company said it buys 27 
million barrels of oil daily and must compete on world markets 
and pay world market prices 
oil companies have been criticized frequently since gas prices 
soared from about 39 cents a gallon in 1973 to 53 cents a year 
later following the arab oil embargo prices climbed to 69 cents by 
1978 before surging above 1 when iranian supplies were cut off by 
its 1979 revolution deposing the regime of us ally the shah 
more recently prices jumped after the exxon valdez spill off 
the alaska coast last year and heating oil skyrocketed during a 
december freeze despite allegations no profiteering or collusion 
by companies was proven 
herbert schmertz a senior public relations official at mobil 
corp during the 1970s oil crises said the companies should 
criticize the government for increasing reliance on foreign oil by 
balking at developing domestic sources 
the finger should be pointed right back at the people who are 
doing the screaming he said they caused this problem 
he said that in 1973 we treated those attacks as if they were 
rational attacks and we responded in a rational way you cant deal 
with irrational attacks in a rational wars funds

although the neas conservative critics are heavily financed 
lynch said we will ultimately win because it is becoming clear 
that americans recognize the value of the arts and the endowment

thursday on the chicago board of trade in a final round of 
jockeying for position ahead of an eagerly awaited agriculture 
department crop report 
corn futures fell slightly 
john frazier director of agricultural trading with gerald inc 
said the market moves reflected expectations that the government

estimates averaging 792 billion bushels compared with last years 
753 billion

billion bushels versus last years 193 billion 
in the report which was released after the close the usda 
projected corn production at 785 billion bushels and soybean 
production at 184 billion bushels 
both numbers were below market expectations and were expected to 
prompt higher openings in those markets on friday 
at the close wheat futures were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 290 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cents lower with september at 250 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to 3 cents higher with september at 119 a

royal dutchshell group of cos said thursday its 
profit fell 44 percent in the second quarter and british petroleum 
co plc posted an 89 percent drop 
they each cited weaker crude oil prices in the period that ended 
more than a month before prices rocketed higher after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
royal dutchshell said its results also reflected lower margins 
in its chemical division and the weakness of the dollar 
royal dutchshell which is based in the hague the netherlands 
and in london said its net income for the three months ended june 
30 fell to 563 million pounds or 940 million from 101 billion 
pounds a year earlier 
revenue rose 4 percent to 167 billion pounds or 279 billion 
from 161 billion pounds a year earlier 
the outlook for the rest of the year is obviously extremely 
uncertain and almost entirely dependent on how events in the middle 
east unfold royaldutch shell said 
the company said its net income for the first half fell 40 
percent to 138 billion pounds or 23 billion from 229 billion 
pounds a year ago 
revenue rose 128 percent to 342 billion pounds or 57 
billion from 3036 billion pounds a year earlier 
londonbased bp which owns clevelandbased standard oil co 
said its secondquarter net income fell to 53 million pounds or 
92 million from 477 million pounds a year earlier 
its revenue fell 1 percent to 726 billion pounds or 122 
billion in the quarter from 734 billion pounds a year earlier 
for the half year net profit plummeted to 397 million pounds 
or 663 million from 109 billion pounds a year earlier 
sixmonth revenue rose 10 percent to 153 billion pounds or 
255 billion from 139 billion pounds a year earlier 
the results for both companies are not directly comparable with 
those for american companies since they use an accounting method 
that values inventories at their acquisition costs rather than at 
current costs american companies generally use a method that 
values inventories at current costs

chrysler corp is delaying the 
introduction of a new luxury car in favor of a vehicle to succeed 
its compact dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim a company executive 
said thursday 
were going to adjust the timing of the lx said glenn 
gardner chryslers general manager of new platform engineering 
referring to the code name for the new luxury car 
the lx originally was to be introduced shortly after the 
socalled lh went into production but because a successor to the 
spiritacclaim has a potential to sell better than a luxury car 
and consequently return more profit for the investment it was 
decided to push back the lx gardner said 
he said the most pressing priority for the company is the lh a 
midsize car due out in the fall of 1992 as a 1993 model and there 
is some pressure in the corporation to bring the car out earlier 
mr iacocca said he wants six months cut from the 
introduction schedule i told him he cant have it gardner 
said referring to company chairman lee iacocca hes a very 
persistent individual 
the realignment comes about a year after iacocca said a 
billiondollar costcutting program would not alter the development 
plans for new vehicles 
our 15 billion fiveyear program remains intact and we dont 
comment on sepecific future products that are contained in that 
program chrysler spokesman tom houston said 
gardners comments came during the fourth day of a weeklong 
management conference sponsored by the university of michigan 
wall street analysts have criticized chrysler for opting to 
build the viper lowvolume highperformance sports car when the 
company should accelerate development of the lh midsize car 
between the introduction of the lh and the spiritacclaim 
successor chrysler is expected to bring out a new subcompact car 
chrysler left the subcompact segment when it shut down the detroit 
assembly plant that built the dodge omni and plymouth horizion last 
february 
the spiritacclaim successor will be introduced sometime around 
1995 gardner said those cars were introduced in the spring of 
1989 and are assembled in newark del 
also at the conference ford motor co officially unveiled its 
46liter v8 engine for the 1991 lincoln town car which goes into 
production later this year 
the engine to be built at fords 780 million revamped engine 
plant in romeo mich is the first of the companys modular 
family of engines modular engines give manufacturers flexibility 
and cost reductions by creating common basic engine structure with 
interchangeable components giving each kind of engine its own 
characteristics 
overall we estimate the new family of engines will share 
about 350 parts or about 75 percent of the engine said david f 
hagen general manager of fords engine division new v8 
variations will cost about 60 million to develop compared to about 
500 million for a typical new engine program 
he said the modular engine concept will be expanded to fords 
huge cleveland engine plant which will build a new series of v6 
engines to enter production in the mid1990s 
meantime richard donnelly head of general motors corps newly 
created engine division said the company is moving to consolidate 
its engine research development and manufacturing which could 
close an engine plant sometime in the future 
he did not say which factory may be affected

emergency oil stockpiles do not yet need to be 
tapped to make up for an embargo against iraq and kuwait delegates 
from industrialized nations decided thursday 
but the 21nation international energy agency will take steps to 
sharpen preparedness if the situation deteriorates said 
chairman ulrich engelmann we must be prepared for that 
concluding a daylong meeting to assess the impact of the 
boycott the iea decided enough oil exists on world markets to 
forestall dipping into emergency reserves 
engelmann blamed speculation for dramatic increases in oil 
prices but said the higher prices should dampen demand he 
predicted some opec members will boost production but did not say 
which ones or by how much 
conservation and switches from oilbased fuels to natural gas 
would also help to keep stocks high he said 
the iea is empowered to help its members survive the potentially 
damaging loss of loss of 42 million barrels of oil per day 
produced by iraq and kuwait 
the members are ready to use their emergency stockpiles and to 
share them with each other if necessary said a canadian delegate 
on condition of anonymity 
iea members include the united states canada japan australia 
new zealand and most western european countries except france 
finland and iceland 
oil supplies have not been affected by the boycott yet 
engelmann said because shipments from iraq or kuwait to iea 
countries normally take 10 days the united nations imposed the 
embargo monday to punish iraqs invasion of its smaller neighbor a 
week ago 
delegates will meet again in two weeks when the market could 
begin to feel the shortfall 
the ieas two main weapons are to inject emergency stockpiles 
into the market or share oil with members suffering the worst 
shortages 
the emergency stocksharing program is the groups ultimate 
weapon it is supposed to take effect when 7 percent of projected 
supplies to the entire iea or any of its members is obstructed 
once triggered the system allots oil reserves to member 
countries according to a preset formula 
us assistant energy secretary john easton said neither measure 
is immediately necessary but the united states favors putting oil 
from its 590 millionbarrel stockpile on the market as simpler 
we will draw down the strategic petroleum reserve in 
cooperation with our allies if the severity of the situation 
warrants it he said 
the iea issued a communique urging countries to refrain from 
abnormal purchases of petroleum 
companies should show restraint by avoiding abnormal spot 
market purchases or other undesirable purchases of oil during the 
period of this supply disruption the statement said 
engelmann of west germany said the group found no evidence oil 
companies had taken advantage of the invasion to boost prices 
iea executive director helga steeg said the group does not plan 
to deal with the organization of petroleum exporting countries on 
supply questions iran has shown interest in such talks 
opec president sadek boussena said in algeria on wednesday that 
individual opec members should avoid breaking ranks to increase 
production unilaterally

crosman products is recalling nearly 53000 
air rifles that may have a defective trigger mechanism the 
consumer product safety commission said wednesday 
the company is recalling its model 3100 air rifle which has 
been sold nationally since july 1986 and may contain an improperly 
hardened sear in its trigger 
if the sear is not properly hardened it may wear prematurely 
and the consumer may not be able to cock the airgun the commission 
said 
if the consumer does manage to cock a gun with a defective sear

stocks advanced solidly today in a late rally 
sparked by positive response to the treasurys latest bond auction 
and the absence of any further escalation of hostilities in the 
middle east 
stock prices seesawed in a narrow range but began a more 
decisive move upward in midafternoon nervousness surrounding the 
treasurys sale of 1025 billion in 30year bonds was alleviated 
when the government received 2596 billion in bids for the issues 
when the results of the auction were released the bond 
futures rallied and took the stock market along said alfred e 
goldman a vice president at st louisbased ag edwards amp sons 
inc 
the market was particularly nervous about the auction which 
made up the final leg of a threepart record refunding because 
wednesdays sale of 10year notes went off poorly 
traders said much of the days activity centered on retail and 
energy stocks the nations major stores reported mixed july sales 
and oil stocks continued to attract attention as us forces took 
up defensive positions in saudi arabia to protect the worlds 
largest oil exporter 
traders believe the presence of us forces there will deter 
further aggressive moves by iraq but they assumed a waitandsee 
attitude as arab leaders gathered in cairo for a highstakes summit 
on iraqs invasion of kuwait

william h donaldson a wall street veteran and 
friend of president bush was named thursday as chairman and chief 
executive of the new york stock exchange 
donaldson 59 will succeed john j phelan jr who won wide 
praise for safely steering the nations largest exchange through 
the 1987 stock market crash and helping to avert a protracted world 
financial crisis 
the nyses board also named president richard a grasso who had 
wanted the top post as executive vice chairman with expanded 
responsibilities both appointments take effect jan 1 
donaldson a cofounder of the investment firm donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette inc brings broad experience on wall street in 
government and academia to one of the most highprofile jobs in 
american business 
he arrives at a time of rapid technological change global 
market interdependence and increased competition overseas that 
threaten to redefine the basic structure of the 198yearold 
exchange a worldwide symbol of capitalism 
this is one of the most challenging jobs in the country 
today donaldson told a news conference at the exchange in lower 
manhattan the opportunity to be here at a time of great change 
appeals to my spirit 
donaldsons first job on wall street was at the old brokerage 
gh walker amp co run by bushs uncle herbert walker donaldson 
was a classmate of the presidents brother jonathan at yale 
university and is friends with the bush family 
in 1959 just one year out of harvard business school donaldson 
and two friends founded donaldson lufkin amp jenrette he left in 
1973 after the company grew from its initial 100000 investment to 
the nations 10th largest brokerage 
donaldson served in the nixon and ford administrations first as 
an undersecretary of state to henry kissinger in 197374 before 
becoming special white house counsel to vice president nelson 
rockefeller 
a yale trustee donaldson in 1975 helped create a graduate 
business school and served as dean of yales school of organization 
and management until 1980 when he returned to wall street to open 
a private investment firm donaldson enterprises inc 
hes coming from a major background said muriel siebert a 
wall street veteran who heads her own brokerage he knows the 
nyse from a business basis because he has headed a firm he knows 
his way around washington and politics 
the combination is important said primerica inc president 
jeffrey lane a board member of the competing american stock 
exchange the industry needs a strong leader who can pick up the 
baton that john phelan is passing he has all the right 
credentials 
donaldson becomes the fourth fulltime paid chairman of the big 
board since the job was created in 1972 he was tabbed by a 
ninemember search panel appointed after phelan in february 
announced plans to retire at the end of the year 
donaldson is known on wall street for leading and winning a 
fight against the nyse to lift a ban on publicly owned securities 
firms after the exchange agreed to let dlj sell stock to the 
public in 1969 many securities firms followed 
donaldson said among his main concerns will be the nyses role 
in global securities trading and the maintenance restoration and 
enhancement of public confidence in the operation of the market 
that eroded after the 1987 crash 
among other challenges he cited new forms of electronic 
trading the prospect of roundtheclock securities trading 
monitoring new regulation and wild fluctuations that have shaken 
public confidence in the stock market 
donaldson praised phelans administration for being responsive 
to the unexpected during such events as the market gyrations 
that followed iraqs invasion of kuwait last week 
phelan chairman since may 1984 will remain an advisor for nyse 
relations with foreign stock exchanges he currently is chairman of 
the international federation of stock exchanges and has traveled 
extensively during his tenure cultivating ties with markets abroad 
phelan 59 said he will serve as chairman of the aspen 
institute a policy think tank that arranges speakers on various 
issues continue his work on foreign markets at the exchange and 
serve on corporate boards 
richard c breeden chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission said the sec looked forward to working with donaldson 
he said phelan consistently demonstrated strength wisdom and 
vision and helped to maintain both the integrity and the 
competitiveness of the us securities markets 
grasso 44 is a 22year nyse veteran his additional 
responsibilities were described by people familiar with the 
selections as an inducement to keep him at the exchange it was 
widely known he had wanted the chairmans job

airline boss frank lorenzo said thursday hes 
quitting the flying empire he built in the 1980s hurt by a barrage 
of bad publicity and labor bitterness about his toughguy 
management style 
the 50yearold entrepreneur who came to symbolize a tumultuous 
decade of airline deregulation is selling most of his stake in 
continental airlines holdings inc to scandinavian airlines system 
the leading foreign carrier has held a small stake in houstonbased 
continental for two years 
lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive to be 
replaced by delta air lines inc president hollis l harris 
harris a highly respected manager was lured to continental after 
a discreet search that started four months ago 
lorenzo will receive nearly 30 million in severance retain a 
small interest in continentals stock options and keep a seat on 
the companys board of directors 
but lorenzos influence in running the company virtually will 
disappear and his compensation reflects a fraction of the value the 
airline operation used to have in better times 
houstonbased continental holdings formerly known as texas air 
corp once commanded 20 percent of the domestic airline market 
through its ownership of continental and eastern airlines 
but its business has been severely crimped by heavy debts and a 
debilitating strike at eastern thats now 17 months old last year 
the parent company lost 8856 million an industry record 
its been perfectly obvious to me that i personally have 
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has 
taken in the process of making the changes that have been 
required lorenzo said 
this transaction allows me to step aside and allows the 
company to have a new management he said asked what he would do 
now lorenzo said take a little time to catch my breath i 
havent had much time to do that 
he spoke to reporters at a new york news briefing flanked by 
hollis and sas chairman jan carlzon all three called the 
arrangement a strategic move that would strengthen continental into 
a global airline for the 1990s 
sas which is spending a total of 50 million in the deal will 
roughly double its stake to 184 percent of the companys voting 
stock carlzon said sas had no interest in gaining control of the 
airline federal law already limits foreign ownership is limited to 
25 percent 
we think continental has an interesting future carlzon 
said its better to have 184 percent than 99 percent 
wall street reacted positively to the announcement reflecting 
investor optimism that the change would help continentals business 
improve 
its stock which traded as high as 2375 a share over the past 
year but recently traded in the 45 range rose 175 on the 
american stock exchange in active trading to 675 
lorenzos exit from the airline world marks the end of an era 
that in many ways was shaped by him from his initial plunge into 
the flying business in the 1960s as an analyst for trans world 
airlines and later as an executive of a small texas airline 
company lorenzo helped pioneer innovations ranging from cutrate 
fares to the industrys first hostile takeover 
but lorenzo aroused labor hatred because of what unions called 
his brutal tactics to cut employee costs one of the biggest 
expenses in the industry besides fuel 
lorenzo called his strategies necessary to stay profitable in 
deregulated skies that allowed airlines to set their own fares and 
fly wherever they wished enormous changes in an industry unused 
to competition 
his war with labor began after he won continental airlines in a 
takeover bid in 1981 two years later he plunged the airline into 
bankruptcy court scrapped union contracts and hired lowcost 
replacements for striking workers 
lorenzos reputation among unionists worsened after he bought 
unprofitable eastern airlines in 1986 three years later angry 
unions struck accusing lorenzo of gutting the airline 
he responded by placing eastern in bankruptcy court but its 
enormous debts and enduring strike crippled the carrier and made 
creditors increasingly edgy last april an irritated federal 
bankruptcy judge gave control of eastern to a trustee which many 
strikers regarded as vindication 
unionists reacted to lorenzos announcement thursday with a mix 
of satisfaction and resentment the international association of 
machinists which has led the eastern strike from the start said 
he was largely responsible for the problems in his company 
frank lorenzo demolished eastern airlines wreaked havoc on 
thousands of workers lives and severely devalued continental 
airlines said john peterpaul iam general vice president 
those facts dampen our elation at seeing lorenzo finally leaving 
the industry he is the epitome of what is wrong with corporate 
america today 
our condolences to whatever industry he stalks next

grain analysts predicted a rally in corn and soybean futures 
prices after the agriculture department on thursday released 
harvest projections that fell short of market expectations 
soybean futures rose thursday on the chicago board of trade in 
anticipation of the report wheat futures also advanced while corn 
retreated 
on other commodity markets gold and silver futures advanced 
oil futures fell and livestock and meat futures were mostly lower 
wheat futures settled 3 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 290 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 2 cents lower with september at 250 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with september at 119 a bushel 
soybeans were cent lower to 6 cents higher with august at 598 
a bushel 
in a report released after the close the usda estimated the 
1990 corn harvest at 785 billion bushels up 4 percent from last 
years crop the government projected a soybean crop of 184 
billion bushels down 5 percent from last years harvest of 193 
billion bushels 
both numbers were below market expectations which averaged 792 
billion bushels for corn and 186 billion bushels for soybeans 
analysts predicted corn futures would open 2 cents to 4 cents 
higher friday in reaction to the report while soybeans would open 5 
cents to 10 cents higher 
joel karlin of research department inc a chicagobased 
analytical firm said soybeans would draw further support from the 
usdas projected drop in us soybean stockpile 
the government said soybean stocks are likely to fall from an 
estimated 275 million bushels at the end of this month to 225 
million bushels by aug 31 1991 the end of the 199091 crop year 
the latter estimate was 40 million bushels below the usdas july 
projection 
the government raised its projection for aug 31 1991 corn 
stocks to 121 billion bushels from last months 113 billion the 
increase reflects expectations for a 19 million metric ton increase 
in soviet union grain production over last year and a corresponding 
8 million ton drop in soviet grain imports 
the corn market will have to grapple with what the wheat 
market has been grappling with less export demand karlin said 
he said that in light of the projected decline in soviet grain 
purchases and the markets recent weakness im not so sure 
whether the positive implication will be able to hold over long 
term 
gold and silver futures ended higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange while oil futures retreated on the new york mercantile 
exchange in seesaw trading that closely followed developments in 
the standoff between iraqi and us troops in the middle east 
analyst peter cardillo who follows the oil and precious metal 
markets for jesup josephthal amp co said he believes there is a 50 
percent to 60 percent chance of an arab solution to the problem 
possibly as early as friday 
but unless the arab nations agree on a formula to end iraqs 
occupation of kuwait and bring down oil prices he said the 
economies of the western world will fall into a recession and 
severely reduce demand for arab oil 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 61 cents 
lower with september at 2567 a barrel heating oil was 36 cent 
to 12 cents lower with september at 6977 cents a gallon unleaded

scheringplough corp announced thursday 
that it was withdrawing from the market a blood pressurereducing 
drug that has been linked to isolated cases of liver damage

the company said it was halting the sale of dilevalol in japan 
and portugal the only two countries where it is sold over the

united airlines workers and stock market 
investors indicated thursday they were encouraged by a decision 
extending the life of an employee buyout bid 
but the twomonth reprieve granted late wednesday by ual corp 
uniteds parent company offered no guarantee that the 438 
billion 201pershare deal will get done 
indeed there is some concern that a provision allowing uals 
board to call off the deal at any time could hamper the buyout 
groups ability to obtain financing commitments by the new oct 9 
deadline 
steven matthews a spokesman for the unionled buyout group 
declined comment thursday on that possibility he said the group 
was going forward and hoped to arrange financing commitments as 
quickly as possible 
matthews also declined comment on a wall street journal report 
that the buyout group had requested a threemonth extension 
ual stock initially rose on the new york stock exchange trading 
as high as 123 but it closed at 11375 down 75 cents 
without the deadline extension the bid to make united the 
worlds largest employeeowned company would have expired thursday 
the buyout group blamed its failure to line up loan commitments 
on the middle east crisis which it said had slowed the progress 
of its discussions with financing sources according to a 
statement issued wednesday by ual 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait last week has caused airline fuel 
prices to soar and airline stock prices to drop presumably making 
united a greater credit risk 
airline analyst robert decker of duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
said the middle east situation provides a convenient alibi 
it certainly is a factor he said but the way events were 
unfolding it didnt seem the group would have financing arranged 
by the deadline anyway 
decker said the extension gives the buyout group more time to 
either find financing or restructure its proposal perhaps to 
reduce the 155pershare cash component of the offer 
ual indicated though that it would not accept a lower total 
bid 
skepticism about the buyout mounted in recent weeks after three 
large new york banks chase manhattan corp chemical banking 
corp and citicorp withdrew from a group of banks that had begun 
loan talks with the buyout group 
the banks indicated they might be willing to make the loans if 
the buyout group obtains other financing from nonbank sources the 
group reportedly is negotiating with a number of aircraft 
manufacturers and parts suppliers for such financing 
at least three other banks bankers trust new york corp 
manufacturers hanover corp and security pacific corp are 
continuing to discuss loan possibilities with the buyout group
