district of columbia mayor marion barry filed 
his federal income tax returns late in the early 1980s even though 
he had a refund coming each year according to the washington post 
the newspaper quoted an unnamed source as saying that barry 
waited until 1986 to file his 1982 1983 and 1984 federal returns 
other sources told the post that barry filed several returns in 
1986 but could not confirm the years 
barry declined a request by the newspaper to be interviewed 
about his tax returns his press secretary john c white released 
a statement that barrys returns are filed every year 
first my taxes are a personal matter between myself and the 
federal and district governments second my taxes are filed every 
year by my accountant in the year in which they are due third it 
is a violation of law for someone to give out my tax returns other 
than myself barry said in a statement 
the mayor who has refused to publicly release copies of his tax 
returns since he was elected in 1978 filed late largely because 
of procrastination the post in its tuesday editions quoted one 
of barrys associates as saying 
failure to file a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor and 
each count carries a possible oneyear prison sentence 
although barrys federal returns for 1982 1983 and 1984 were 
late he apparently filed his dc returns on time for those years 
the post said 
dc records show that barry filed his 1982 1983 and 1984 
returns in the year in which each return was due according a 
source familier with district tax records barry received dc 
refunds for each of the years except 1982

rape her three times 
they tied my toes thumbs and nipples with electric wires and 
then they plugged it into a socket she said they did it to me 
repeatedly and i fainted so many times 
they took off my clothes and made me sit on a wet bed i had 
my hands tied in the back and a pillow over my mouth i screamed 
and i felt like a chicken being butchered 
after three days miss aniban and her colleague were released 
she said they had signed statements saying they were rebels and 
agreeing to serve as military informants 
she said she did not file charges against her captors because 
whe felt it would be useless

assailants were progovernment militiamen

annette funicello is gone and so 
are sherry cubby darlene and bobby 
but chase hampton knocks em dead with a calypso songanddance 
number and josh tiffini lindsey albert and the gang get the 
studio jumping with a rapanddisco blend of mickeymouse 
the mickey mouse club is back and although its style has 
been updated the people at walt disney say its just as good and 
relevant as the original television show was when it began 34 years 
ago 
we had a lot of skepticism about doing the mickey mouse club 
in the 1990s said steve fields senior vice president of the 
disney channel which will carry the show but so many elements 
of the old show were terrific and kids still relate to kids 
just like its predecessor the new show is for and by kids from 
about ages 8 to 12 and features music dancing comedy skits 
celebrity guests and the mickey mouse club movie the comedy skits 
are often geared to preteens problems dating sibling rivalry 
messy rooms homework 
its trying to say hey its not easy being a kid were 
going to make you laugh and reduce some of the stress said 
steve clements executive producer 
the show is designed to provide education through 
entertainment but the accent is clearly on the latter clements 
says 
its all great fun there are no messages that are knocked 
into peoples heads no public service announcements about drugs or 
anything like that he said 
this is my dream job said head writer alan silberberg who 
has a masters degree in education from harvard university we 
take entertainment and use it to educate about kids issues the 
show gives them a sense that theyre not alone out there 
theres one big difference from the 1950s show cartoons have 
been replaced by music videos one of the early episodes features a 
jazzy songanddance number on a new york city street set 
another innovation is a segment in which club members from 
around the country are selected to spend a day with their special 
heros among the celebrities taped so far are los angeles dodgers 
pitcher orel hershiser model christie brinkley and new york 
developer donald trump 
in one segment 13yearold tom woods goes to new yorks trump 
plaza to talk with the developer about his business life and 
disciplinary problems that caused him to be sent to a military 
academy dressed in a suit and tie and calling himself a 
winner the teenager asks for advice about investing 250 he 
has saved trump tells him to put it in a bank until he is older 
at the end tom presents trump with a pair of mickey mouse ears 
which he adjusts over his carefully combed locks 
the show is being taped before audiences at the new disneymgm 
studios complex in central florida and will be televised 
exclusively on the disney channel which has about 4 million 
subscribers fields said this will give disney more control without 
having to worry about ratings 
talent scouts held auditions for about 5000 kids around the 
country before selecting the lucky dozen featured on the show 
the notsogrownup hosts are fred newman an actor writer and 
comedian and mowava pryor a former camp counselor with theater 
experience who has appeared in dozens of television commercials 
the mickey mouse club makes its debut april 24 the halfhour 
show will be shown weekday afternoons

a 3yearold girl the survivor of a 
rampage that claimed her mother grandmother two sisters two 
aunts and an unrelated man was showered with toys sunday as she 
recovered from a slashed throat 
lawmen hunted her father 28yearold winery worker ramon 
salcido from mexico to canada 
the object of compassion was 3yearold carmina salcido who was 
rescued bleeding and barely conscious saturday from a wine country 
dump between petaluma and sonoma near the bodies of her two 
sisters whose throats also were cut 
salcido has been hunted since friday morning when officers 
discovered the bodies of his wife angela 24 at their boyes hot 
springs home his motherinlaw and her two young daughters at 
their home in cotati and a coworker at the grand cru winery 
police have not yet pieced together the sequence of killings 
weve got to find him weve got to find him sonoma county 
sheriff dick michaelsen mumbled at a news conference saturday after 
the discovery of carmina and her sisters 
on sunday the owners of the grand cru winery where salcido 
worked as a forklift operator offered a 5000 reward for 
information leading to his capture 
these atrocities have caused fear and terror to invade an area 
known for its beauty and hospitality walter and bettina dreyer 
said in a statement 
the couple also established a trust fund for both carmina 
salcido and for the family of tracy toovey an assistant winemaker 
at grand cru who was shot to death in fridays rampage 
salcido has been described by neighbors as a hostile guntoter 
who drank a lot a husband who harbored chronic towering jealousy 
of his attractive wife to the point that he drove home from work 
several times a day to spy on her 
despite reports of salcidos having problems at work however 
dreyer remembered his employee as a very competent worker who 
was quick to please 
carmina her throat cut nearly from ear to ear and her dead 
sisters teresa 1 and sofia 4 were found near a landfill 
transfer station not far from where salcido had fled with them 
friday 
carmina also suffering exposure and dehydration was flown to 
petaluma valley hospital where she told deputies her father had 
slashed her sisters and herself after two hours of surgery 
carmina was in stable condition 
shes still in stable condition and doing well nursing 
supervisor stasia andrew said sunday different people have sent 
stuffed animals she has a teddy bears and a couple of bunnies 
doctors said she suffered some vocal cord damage but is expected 
to recover 
a trust fund was being established for carmina in a sonoma bank 
michaelsen said salcido is the only suspect in the killings a 
ranch worker who was shot in a shoulder apparently the first 
person attacked had alerted authorities sending them first to the 
winery where they found one man shot to death 
at a news conference friday michaelsen said a department 
psychologist had warned that the savagery of the slayings indicated 
salcido no longer felt any affection or attachment to his own 
children 
the three girls were spotted in a ravine near the dump by a man 
working on his truck 
at first he thought they were dolls the sheriff said 
the man unidentified called to a worker from the dump and the 
two found yet another horrible scene michaelsen said 
i tried to talk to the little girl who was still alive and i 
tried to comfort her said the dump worker tim smith her 
throat was nearly cut from ear to ear 
autopsies performed saturday in san francisco revealed that mrs 
salcido had been shot and her mother had been shot and her throat 
was slashed the sheriffs office reported mrs salcidos two 
sisters age 8 and 12 died of throat wounds apparently inflicted 
with a knife and had been raped and sodomized michaelsen said 
a friend and a neighbor described salcido as fiercely jealous of 
his wife 
hes crazy he was always going around with a gun said 
richard clark a nextdoor neighbor to the salcidos i could see 
it coming 
one time he threatened to blow his wifes head off he 
added 
during the past week salcido was served with a fresno county 
court order to pay 511 a month child support to his exwife in 
fresno and nearly 6000 for back support payments according to 
court papers

once hailed as a rare success story in a 
continent plagued by coups civil wars and corruption this country 
enters its 10th year of independence tuesday with little of the 
jubilation that marked its birth 
when president robert mugabe led the whiteruled british colony 
of rhodesia to independence as blackgoverned zimbabwe on april 18 
1980 he inherited one of the healthiest agriculturebased 
economies in black africa 
after having waged a bloody sevenyear guerrilla war for 
control of his homeland he promised the 100000 whites and 9 
million blacks peace and prosperity 
many analysts believed mugabes zimbabwe could serve as an 
example for the white rulers of neighboring south africa who 
maintain their black majority is not ready to run the country 
today though still black africas most prosperous nation 
zimbabwe is ailing 
the economy is hemhorraging through shortages of foreign 
currency and a lack of foreign investment both symptoms of bad 
policy making 
exporters who earn hard currency complain they get little 
encouragement from the government and because there is no 
investment code the only significant foreign capital has been 
plowed into a baked beans cannery and a bubblegum factory 
the leadership of mugabes avowedly egalitarian and socialist 
state is crippled thanks to a series of corruption scandals 
five cabinet ministers a provincial governor and a junior 
minister have resigned and several others face prosecution in the 
latest scandal the black marketeering of cars and trucks 
a war in neighboring mozambique is bleeding this countrys 
treasury to the tune of half a million dollars a day the 12000 
zimbabwean troops there are guarding supply lines vital to 
landlocked zimbabwes survival 
at home unprecedented popular discontent is growing over a host 
of ills ranging from official greed and economic mismanagement to 
record unemployment and galloping inflation 
and homeless blacks often complain that land hunger the main 
cause of the war for independence remains nine years later while 
160000 families were promised plots only 40000 have actually 
been resettled 
on the credit side mugabe 65 a onetime cattle herder and 
school teacher has fulfilled his promises of cheap education for 
all and free health care for the poor who comprise most of the 
population 
he also instilled national pride in the black majority that had 
been subjugated by colonizers for nine decades crushed a rebellion 
by armed dissidents in the matabeleland province of western 
zimbabwe and ended a feud with his old political foe joshua nkomo 
the two signed an accord that will unite their parties in the 
next year as a prelude to establishing a oneparty state in one of 
africas few westernstyle democracies 
but there has been mounting criticism that it could transform 
zimbabwe into a leftist dictatorship like angola and ethiopia 
where the vote zimbabweans fought for will be worthless 
the leadership is rotten and it will get more rotten in a 
oneparty state says edgar tekere 52 a founder of the 
governing zimbabwe african national union and now its most vocal 
critic 
tekere fired from the 15member politburo and the 90strong 
central committee in october after he denounced toplevel 
corruption represents mugabes only real political challenge he 
has won widespread popular support for his stand 
public hostility toward elected leaders has grown in the last 
few years as politicians have vaunted their wealth power position 
and privileges 
cabinet ministers last year voted themselves earnings 20 times 
the statutory minimum wage of 50 monthly which they also set 
most own several homes and farms have interests in stores 
hotels and other businesses drive around in chauffeured limousines 
and frequently travel abroad to buy luxury items not available at 
home 
in our pubs we dont talk much about anything else but crooked 
politicians said oddwell mlambo 34 an unemployed laborer no 
one attacks mugabe himself but if there were elections tomorrow 
just about all his cabinet would be thrown out

irs employees put in overtime post offices 
set up special mail drops and demonstrators made their cases as the 
nation prepared to end another federal tax return filing season at 
midnight tonight 
internal revenue service spokesman frank keith said the irs had 
no way of knowing how many taxpayers were waiting until the last 
minute to file but the agency expects to receive 18 million 
returns this week including those filed over the weekend he said 
the deadline is one day later in new england and most of upstate 
new york because today is patriots day a legal holiday in 
massachusetts site of the irs center which processes returns from 
taxpayers in those states 
the irs expects to receive more than 109 million returns this 
year many of which will come in well after the deadline 
about 6 million couples and individuals are expected to get an 
extra four months to file but not to pay any taxes due by 
mailing form 4868 before midnight many of the 650000 americans 
who live and work abroad are likely to take an automatic twomonth 
extension and as usual some taxpayers simply will miss the 
deadline and face a latefiling penalty 
in many irs offices employees planned to continue offering 
advice tonight as long as taxpayers were asking for it 
the postal service was doing its part by setting up booths at 
ballparks selling stamps by the curb and cooperating with radio 
stations and civic groups that were offering refreshments around 
post offices in an effort to make things a little easier for 
procrastinators 
around the nation the jobs for peace campaign sent 
demonstrators into the streets to protest military spending they 
planned to pass out build homes not bombs stickers for 
taxpayers to attach to the envelopes containing their tax returns 
the campaign is urging support for a bill to finance more 
housing by cutting military spending the group calculates that 52 
cents of every tax dollar goes for military spending retirement 
and interest on money borrowed to finance weapons by government 
figuring the military will take 27 percent of next years budget 
not including interest or pensions 
in washington sen mark hatfield rore repeated a taxday 
act he has performed for 10 years introducing a bill that would 
allow conscientious objectors to pay their taxes into a fund that 
would be spent for nonmilitary purposes 
we recognize conscientious objection in time of war 
hatfield said in a statement it is now time to recognize it in 
time of peace 
the national treasury employees union which represents most irs 
employees issued a statement accusing the bush administration of 
failing to budget enough money to finance the taxcollection 
agency employee travel and training have been cut and technicians 
have been pressed into clerical work because of the tight budget 
said robert m tobias president of the union 
by its actions he said the administration effectively 
declared april 17 a national holiday for tax cheaters 
the church of scientology used the filing deadline as a way of 
reminding taxpayers of a new law designed to protect them when they 
have disputes with the irs the church which has had its share of 
scraps with the agency announced it has published a free guidebook 
to the taxpayer bill of rights

the only nuclear plant ever shut down because 
control room operators slept on duty is ready to resume operations 
amid signs that the nuclear regulatory commission will give its 
assent 
an nrc order has kept the peach bottom plant in pennsylvania 
dormant for two years but the commission planned a meeting for 
this afternoon along with a possible vote on reopening 
privately commission officials said last week that all signs 
pointed to the plant gaining permission if not today then 
shortly afterward to begin a slow ascension that would take it 
back to full power 
thomas murley the nrcs top reactor licensing official 
declined to make a prediction friday on the outcome of the meeting 
but he said in an interview that the commission has seen 
significant progress in the management of the plant by philadelphia 
electric co 
clearly there have been big changes in the company and its a 
new company as far as peach bottom is concerned murley said 
the operators have been retrained and there appears to be a new 
attitude 
as the only plant ever shut down because of operator negligence 
peach bottom is unique in the industry dealing with operators 
with people is vastly different than replacing equipment and the 
shutdown has meant a review of the plants entire management 
structure 
the plant located on the susquehanna river near the maryland 
border was ordered to stop producing power on march 31 1987 by 
the nrc which said continued operation posed a public safety 
threat 
a year later james l everett stepped down as the utilitys 
chairman and chief executive officer following criticism of the 
handling of peach bottom 
philadelphia electric has spent about 250 million in 
shutdownrelated costs the figure includes modifications to the 
plant purchases of replacement power and the companys share of a 
125 million fine the largest in nrc history 
while the utility has shuffled its personnel the changes at the 
plant have included more than just new faces the company said 
management will play a broader role in daytoday plant affairs 
than before 
to end catnaps by operators plant officials replaced 
comfortable highbacked chairs in the control room with lowbacked 
models operators rotations have been changed so that workers do a 
week of days followed by a week of an afternoonevening shift and 
then work the overnight 
the rotation which includes days off used to go in the reverse 
order 
the sleeping problems at peach bottom were not confined to a few 
workers last august 33 present or former operators were fined 
500 to 1000 for sleeping andor other acts of inattention to 
duty 
we didnt set out to pick somebody and make an example of 
them murley said its just that the behavior we saw at peach 
bottom was so egregious that we felt we had no choice but to order 
them shut down inpo the institute for nuclear power operations 
came to same conclusion and put more pressure on the top 
management 
inpo an atlantabased nuclear watchdog group termed the plant 
an embarrassment to the industry and the nation in 1988 
but this year the group said philadelphia electrics corrective 
actions at peach bottom have been responsive and effective 
the utility said it would propose restarting one of its two 
working reactors then seek permission to fire up the other one 
later this year it would take a few months for either of the units 
to reach full power once approval is granted

county economic and tourism development council 
last year nearly 800 participants walked or biked 286686 miles 
and lost 6438 pounds that was enough to get national media 
attention when bradley county officials called for information 
the iowans issued their challenge and the meltdown was on 
this year more than 1000 people from sac county are involved 
including 543 who are competing against 203 tennesseans 
the sac county team weighed in at 78851 pounds earlier this

well of the house and waved a packet of letters in the air 
blaine one of the nations foremost politicians was in serious 
trouble 
and he was about to confound his accusers 
nearly 113 years later another speaker of the house jim wright 
of texas faces accusations of unethical behavior in office 
wright adamantly denies any wrongdoing but he has been the 
subject of the most prolonged and intense of the several 
investigations conducted over the decades into the private and 
public affairs of a speaker of the house 
speaker blaine rode out his scandal but echoes of it were to 
follow him for the rest of his career 
in the spring of 1876 blaine was a frontrunner for the 
republican presidential nomination in the election that would 
replace president ulysses s grants corruptionridden 
administration 
three years earlier reps oakes ames rmass and james brooks 
dmass had been censured by the house for involvement in the 
socalled credit mobilier scandal in which railroad construction 
stock had been given to selected members of congress allegedly for 
favors received 
now blaine became embroiled in the scandal facing accusations 
that the union pacific railroad had paid the speaker an inflated 
price for stock of a defunct and bankrupt rail line 
an investigation was launched by the house judiciary committee 
but it was sputtering when new evidence emerged 
it took the form of a set of letters between blaine and a 
business partner which had come into the possession of a third man 
james mulligan 
mulligan in washington to testify before the committee 
encountered an unexpected visitor at his hotel speaker james g 
blaine 
according to mulligan an emotional session followed in which 
blaine fell to his hands and knees and begged for the letters 
threatening suicide if he did not receive them 
mulligan claimed blaine obtained the letters by a pretext and 
left the hotel 
an uproar followed and blaine came under intense pressure to 
make the mulligan letters public he refused claiming they were 
private property 
instead he obtained a statement from two lawyers who said they 
had examined the letters and found nothing relevant to the 
investigation 
the uproar continued and blaine set about to defuse it 
on june 5 he appeared on the house floor and waved the packet 
exclaiming there they are there are the original letters 
blaine then read aloud what he said were the contents of each of 
the letters he said he had handed over every solitary scrap and 
scrimption for inclusion in the congressional record 
they had he declared no more to do with that investigation 
than the north pole 
but no one was ever shown the originals of the letters to verify 
blaines reading of them 
events moved rapidly 
blaine collapsed outside his church suffering from a possible 
heat stroke the investigation was postponed for two weeks to await 
his recovery but before the committee could reconvene the 
governor of maine appointed blaine to fill a vacancy in the senate 
the investigation was postponed again and eventually died 
blaines political backers proceeded in classical washington 
fashion to make the best of a bad situation 
in the 20th century its called making lemonade out of a lemon 
blaines name was placed in nomination at the republican 
national convention by robert g ingersoll on june 15 1876 with 
words that gave blaine an enduring nickname the plumed knight 
from the state of maine 
like an armed warrior like a plumed knight james g blaine 
marched down the halls of the american congress and threw his 
shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every 
traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputation 
blaine never obtained the presidency 
but he twice was appointed secretary of state 
no house speaker has ever been ousted but several have been 
singed during the 200year history of congress 
henry clay who was elected speaker six times drew accusations 
of corrupt bargain when the close election of 1824 was thrown 
into the house of representatives 
the choice was between andrew jackson and john quincy adams 
clay and other members of the kentucky delegation tipped the 
balance in favor of adams 
the accusations flew after the victorious adams named clay as 
his secretary of state 
speaker samuel j randall a pennsylvania democrat promptly 
called for his own investigation in 1879 after being accused of 
favoritism toward a company which provided the paper for the bonds 
and banknotes produced by the bureau of engraving 
he was quickly cleared 
in 1910 speaker joseph g cannon faced a rebellion against his 
imperious and heavy handed rule of the house 
although not deposed cannon was stripped of much of his power 
speaker thomas p tip oneill dmass was named in the 
socalled koreagate influence peddling scandal in the 1970s 
but was exonerated

leave the kids at home skip the lincoln 
memorial and take a scandal tour of washington a raunchy romp 
through the ruins of political careers that takes ogling grownups 
from the watergate to gary harts old townhouse 
with a george bush impersonator acting as host the 75minute 
bus tour leaving on weekends from the posh ritzcarlton hotel is 
just the tonic for bored tourists willing to spend 20 bucks to 
indulge their taste for the trashy 
careening through city streets in a red white and blue bus a 
satirical comedy troupe called gross national product entertains 
customers with a bawdy commentary on passing landmarks where some 
of washingtons most prominent residents fell prey to sex booze 
greed or lust for power mostly sex 
outside the white house a marilyn monroe lookalike croons a 
song to john f kennedy the gentleman who supposedly preferred 
blondes in my eight years in office there will be no sex in the 
white house vowed bush seizing the microphone 
past the executive office building where mock secretary fawn 
hall sobs her admiration for col oliver north the most 
patriotic man in the universe and recalls their irancontra 
shredding parties passengers are given small plastic bags filled 
with shredded paper and signed love fawn 
on to the tidal basin where an inebriated wilbur mills saw both 
his congressional career and his companion stripper fanne foxe 
sink beneath the waves then to the capitol where john and rita 
jenrette enjoyed a congress of a different sort and where a 
homosexual congressman let his fingers do the walking through the 
house and senate pages 
the bus screeched to a halt behind the capitol hill townhouse 
where hart was caught entertaining model donna rice dooming his 
1988 democratic presidential hopes its still the highlight of the 
tour 
everybody out for some fresh air and fresh smut shouted a 
female tour guide youre going to get out of the bus youre 
going to see it youre going to touch it youll be there 
the crowd clustered around the garage where donna rice made 
her backdoor debut for the miami herald then strolled to the 
front of the house to pose for pictures back on the bus the 
tourists sighed happily 
what makes the best scandal the guide asked 
sex someone replied 
illicit sex corrected a woman sitting in the rear 
as the bus forged ahead a blackrobed comic posing as former 
supreme court nominee douglas ginsburg offered to sell nickel bags 
of marijuana and crank up some george carlin tapes a mimic of 
vice president dan quayle promised to serve you like i served the 
national guard on weekends 
rick london the 34yearold writer and producer who founded 
scandal tours last august said he was inspired while escorting 
friends and relatives from his native hattiesburg miss to the 
citys usual monuments and historical sites 
id take them to the capitol or the white house and you could 
see their eyes start to glaze over he says sooner or later 
theyd ask wheres gary harts townhouse and id take them 
then i thought i ought to charge for this 
the tours are especially popular with british tourists and 
japanese businessmen london says hes making plans to start 
scandal tours in london where the brits take the prize 
and possibly rome and paris 
john simmons who plays bush on the tour says washington 
provides a constant source of comedy material because of its 
explosive mixture of power money and sex the result he says is 
bad things happening to people it is hard to feel sorry for 
london says the tour focuses on sex scandals because theyre 
easier for people to understand than complicated affairs 
involving financial wrongdoing 
he says hes found that republicans account for 90 percent of 
washingtons money scandals while democrats are usually the 
culprits in sex scandals 
that means that republicans are spending a lot of time making 
money he said and you can guess the rest

tom monaghan owns the detroit tigers 
baseball club and one of the biggest pizza chains in the country 
but he always wanted a farm 
so monaghan owner of ann arborbased dominos pizza inc 
joined with a retired alabama agriculture professor in a project 
they hope will prove theres still money in small farms 
monaghan is financing the 25acre spread three miles outside of 
ann arbor the soggy fields began their transformation last fall 
under the supervision of booker t whatley author of the book 
how to make 100000 farming 25 acres the grand rapids press 
reported sunday 
the goal is to show that farms of 10 to 200 acres can succeed as 
well as familyrun operations of 200 to 1000 acres and 
agribusiness concerns of 1000 acres or more 
this country can and should support all three categories 
said whatley 73 formerly of the faculty of tuskegee institute and 
publisher of the small farm technical newsletter 
monaghan read about whatley in the wall street journal seeing a 
chance to fulfill his own dream he introduced himself at a 
speaking engagement by the agricultural theorist in lansing 
since fall workers have dug a trout pond established a fallow 
deer herd and begun building a 1acre sinking garden for vegetable 
production farm manager michael trout said 
whatleys book argues that small farms can succeed if they 
provide a yearround daily cash flow produce at least 10 different 
products with no one product making up more than 10 percent of the 
gross and produce goods that have definite markets 
monaghan said he will give his dominos headquarters employees 
the option of spending occasional days at the farm instead of

uruguayans on sunday voted not to end 
an amnesty for soldiers and police accused of human rights abuses 
during the 197385 military dictatorship 
with 6360 of 7072 districts reporting in the referendum on the 
1986 amnesty supporters tallied 922185 votes or 5332 percent 
according to the interior ministry and while opponents numbered 
678087 or 3921 percent 
about 128969 votes or 747 percent were blank annulled or 
ruled questionable for technical reasons 
early today a copresident of the national commission for a 
referendum conceded defeat 
the law has been confirmed matilde rodriguez larreta told 
reporters without doubt the pronouncement of the popular will 
should be adhered to 
however she called for a national compromise on the issue 
and said about 40 percent voted to annul the law the 
country and all its institutions cannot be insensitive to the 
circumstances that nearly onehalf of the population disagrees 
radically with the amnesty 
unofficial tallies indicated that voters in the capital narrowly 
rejected the amnesty while voters in the countryside heavily 
favored it 
shortly after polls closed at 730 pm 630 pm edt and 
before any results were known president julio m sanguinetti 
called for national unity in an address carried on national radio 
and television 
until a short while ago some of us were yellows others 
greens he said that has just ended we are all 
uruguayan citizens and now we have to listen to the voice of the 
people 
supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots opponents cast 
green ones 
the government including sanguinetti supported the 1986 law 
giving amnesty to scores of police and soldiers accused of human 
rights abuses in a campaign against leftist guerrillas during 12 
years of military rule 
leftist political parties and human rights groups which mounted 
a huge petition drive to put the issue to a vote say trials of 
those accused of human rights abuses are necessary before democracy 
can be considered fully restored 
after campaigning ended on thursday both sides pledged to 
respect the outcome 
by late sunday night neither side had claimed victory or 
conceded defeat 
were still gathering information and making our own 
computations said alberto perez perez a spokesman for the 
national commission for a referendum the interior ministry 
estimated that about 65 percent of the 23 million uruguayans 
eligible to vote had cast ballots 
voting is mandatory in uruguay and turnout usually tops 80 
percent turnout apparently was lower than usual sunday because of 
gray skies and rain 
but lines were long from the moment schools cultural centers 
movie theaters and other places used as polling stations opened 
many voters waited for an hour or longer huddled under umbrellas or 
building overhangs 
a country that forgets its past has no future said a 
welldressed woman standing in line to vote in a neighborhood along 
the estuary of the river plate a future of peace and justice 
depend on overturning the amnesty said the woman who refused to 
give her name 
if voters rejected the amnesty trials would not start 
immediately vice president enrique tarigo said the supreme court 
then would have to decide whether the amnesty would be annulled 
meaning a ruling that it never legally existed or merely 
overturned 
if the law were just overturned the change could not be applied 
retroactively 
the amnesty freed security forces from the possibility of 
prosecution in connection with a 1970s crackdown on leftist 
subversion about 150 uruguayans were killed and 200 were arrested 
and never seen again thousands suffered physical and psychological 
torture under detention 
the military maintains it was fighting a war against urban 
guerrillas particularly the leftist tupamaros whose bombings 
kidnappings and assassinations had convulsed the country for years 
the military took control in february 1973 by setting up a 
security council with the authority to veto government decisions 
four months later it forced president juan m bordaberry to 
dissolve congress 
the tupamaro urban guerrillas by that time had been quelled as a 
military threat and the armed forces began to crack down on 
leftist subversion in general 
sanguinetti was elected in november 1984 after democracy was 
restored 
by 1986 about 50 cases had been filed accusing about 180 
soldiers and police of kidnapping murder and torture 
the military high command said it would not require soldiers to 
answer charges in civilian courts sanguinetti broke the impasse by 
pressing for an amnesty which congress passed on dec 22 1986 
human rights and leftist political groups vowed to challenge the 
amnesty in a vote the electoral court last year affirmed that the 
required 555701 voters or 25 percent of the electorate had 
signed petitions for a referendum

most of the 1 million elderly poor people who 
do not get the government benefits to which they are entitled 
either do not know they are eligible or are incapable of filling 
out the necessary forms a private foundation said today 
the study by the villers foundation was aimed at answering the 
perplexing question of why only about half of those eligible take 
advantage of the supplemental security income program established 
by congress in 1972 the program is intended to provide a minimal 
income floor for the nations aged disabled and blind 
some people say that the poor dont apply for ssi because they 
are embarrassed we found thats not the heart of the problem 
said ronald f pollack executive director of the nonprofit 
foundation that concentrates on issues affecting the elderly poor 
the main reasons they dont apply are that they dont know 
they can or they dont have the help they need to fill out the 
application form 
a safety net doesnt do any good hidden in a bureaucrats 
desk added pollack youve got to get it out there under the 
people whose lives are falling 
the foundation based its conclusions on interviews with 6214 
elderly people at community meal sites in 15 states and on 
interviews with staffers at 31 district social security offices and 
358 community organizations serving the elderly 
it was not designed as an academic study and did not seek to 
ensure that the 6214 elderly people questioned were a 
scientifically drawn survey of elderly people eligible for the 
program 
given those parameters the survey found that 
only 33 percent knew ssi could increase an eligible persons 
income 
more than 90 percent assumed incorrectly that having a low 
paying job would automatically prevent an individual from receiving 
ssi 
half thought incorrectly that owning a house or car would 
automatically bar an applicant from eligibility 
more than a third thought incorrectly that anyone receiving 
regular social security benefits would be barred from also 
collecting ssi 
a third of the social security district office managers had no 
staff to assign to outreach activities and 40 percent of the ssi 
client contacts with the 358 community organizations were for help 
filling out the 12page application that asks 45 multiplepart 
questions 
applicants some of them frail and functionally illiterate are 
required to supply documentation of age rent or mortgage payments 
employment status living arrangements assets social security and 
pension benefits insurance and property ownership

authorities discovered two more bodies 
sunday buried on a collective farm two miles south of a ranch where 
13 victims of a cult of human sacrifice were found last week 
investigators said they have evidence the male victims were 
killed by the same drug smuggling cult suspected of performing 
human sacrifices on the 13 males discovered tuesday at rancho santa 
elena about 20 miles west of matamoros 
cameron county sheriff alex perez said the victims found sunday 
were connected to the drug smuggling operations of the cult but 
were not victims of the cults rites as were the other 13 
unlike the bodies uncovered at rancho santa elena the bodies 
found on the farm were not mutilated said mexican federal police 
group chief martin elias salazar 
acting on a tip from some children a 72yearold man led police 
sunday to the common grave in a clearing in an orchard on the farm 
ejido santa librada salazar told reporters 
the dead were identified as moises castillo vasquez the son of 
the man who led police to the site and hector de la fuente also 
known as el guero or the blond both were killed by 
machete chops to the back of the head said jose degadillo an 
employee at funerales rosario some of the victims found on the 
ranch last week also were killed by machete chops 
it was a revenge type killing it was a drug deal gone sour 
perez said the sheriff said the men apparently died in may he 
said he knew about the men because of an ongoing investigation into 
the drug smuggling ring 
however a spokeswoman for the federal judicial police in 
matamoros said the two men were farmhands who had been missing 
since last may 
the children told the 72yearold man hidalgo castillo that 
they had seen some people burying a body in an orchard last 
october salazar said castillos son moises 52 disappeared last 
may salazar said castillo had discounted the childrens tale until 
the 13 bodies were dug up 
the two bodies were stacked and appeared to be those of adults 
investigators said neither had been positively identified as of 
sunday night 
officials disinterred the second body just before sunset sunday 
salazar searched through the pockets of a pair of black pants found 
on the second body and discovered 3000 mexican pesos and a 5 bill 
four suspects arrested in the slayings of the 13 discovered on 
rancho santa elena have told police they killed 13 or 14 people in 
bizarre rites intended to protect a marijuana smuggling ring among 
the victims were a 16yearold boy and mark kilroy missing since 
march when he came here during spring break from the university of 
texas 
police said the suspects have been cooperative in pointing out 
the bodies and had not mentioned burying anybody on ejido santa 
librada ejido means collective farm in spanish 
officials said the group trafficked in drugs and believed the 
human sacrifice would protect them from police in matamoros 
authorities found altars covered with black chicken feathers 
burned turtles cigars and other occult offerings the bodies had 
been mutilated some with their hearts or brains ripped out 
police in mexico and the united states are seeking alleged 
ringleader adolfo constanzo and three others including sara 
aldrete a college student identified as the godmother of the 
cult 
in a related development notimex the mexican government news 
agency reported saturday that a woman identifying herself as sara 
aldrete villareal called a local radio station threatening to 
kidnap children as hostages and burn them if the four prisoners 
were not released 
the news agency said local police in matamoros dismissed the 
report as a hoax

president kennedy once sneaked away for a sexual 
liaison without telling the secret service and without taking the 
list of codes he needed in the event of a nuclear attack a new 
book says 
the book also says that jacqueline kennedy onassis in a 
telephone conversation with marilyn monroe offered to divorce the 
president if the actress would agree to marry him and move into the 
white house 
the biography by c david heymann a woman named jackie was 
to be serialized beginning today in the weekly star a supermarket 
tabloid 
the star reports in its april 18 edition that later excerpts 
will include disclosures about amphetamine use by the kennedys in 
the white house 
heymann also author of poor little rich girl the life and 
legend of barbara hutton said that he obtained secret service 
fbi and cia files through the freedom of information act and that 
he and his researchers conducted 825 interviews he also had access 
to the former first ladys white house social files 
mrs onassis spokeswoman nancy tuckerman said friday that 
mrs onassis had no comment 
the charges about kennedy sneaking away from the secret service 
were made by langdon marvin jr a former defense consultant to 
kennedy 
the book said marvin and kennedy sneaked out of the hotel 
carlyle in new york to attend a party at a townhouse across the 
street 
within minutes jack had made his choice of partner and gone 
off with her to her apartment moments later the secret service 
arrived where was the president nobody knew the agent paled 
on the street in front of the townhouse stood an army 
lieutenant with an attache case handcuffed to his wrist jack was 
off making love and the bagman with the black satchel had been 
left behind 
the russians could have bombed us to hell and back and there 
would have been nothing we could have done about it marvin was 
quoted as saying 
the date of the alleged incident was not given marvin died in 
1987 according to sandra bodner a spokeswoman for the publisher 
lyle stuart 
we are not aware of any material that would support that 
allegation said frank rigg a spokesman for the john f kennedy 
library in boston 
kennedy also had illicit sexual liaisons on the night of his 
inauguration and before the nixon debates the book said 
miss monroe who has been romantically linked with the 
president told kennedys brotherinlaw peter lawford that she had 
called mrs kennedy at the white house according to the first part 
of the series 
according to marilyn jackie wasnt shaken by the call not 
outwardly she agreed to step aside she would divorce jack and 
marilyn could marry him but she would have to move into the white 
house if marilyn wasnt prepared to live openly in the white 
house she might as well forget about it lawford was quoted as 
saying 
actually jackie was infuriated by the call and for some 
reason blamed frank sinatra for it she couldnt easily blame me 
because i was family so she took it out on him sinatra was no 
longer welcome at the white house or in any of the other kennedy 
bastions said lawford who since has died

a soccermad city poured out its grief 
for 94 dead at two of its prominent shrines the modern roman 
catholic cathedral and the home field of liverpool football club 
in the early hours today people were still coming to the main 
gate of anfield road stadium converging on a 100foot expanse of 
steel fence and gate covered with clusters of flowers club 
banners scarves and hats 
they only wanted to see their heroes began one long 
epitaph taped to the fence honoring liverpool fans who died in a 
human crush saturday at hillsborough stadium 65 miles away in 
sheffield 
at the gate a memorial to legendary manager bill shankly 
adorned with the motto you will never walk alone a man and 
woman stood locked together in love and grief barely moving for 
more than half an hour while the womans sobbing never ceased 
many others could be heard crying but few spoke 
were all so close everyone knows someone who died said 
jason travers 20 who had come to put up a card for a 16yearold 
friend who died in sheffield 
so sad so sad a strapping young man said brokenly as he 
walked along the barrier another clenched a fist and cried out 
why 
with the adjoining street closed to traffic sometimes the only 
sound was people crying or the footfalls of people coming and going 
at the metropolitan cathedral which was filled to overflowing 
for an ecumenical requiem mass the red banner of liverpool 
football club stood near the altar 
at the anglican cathedral the bell of great george tolled 94 
times customarily rung for the death of a monarch the bells deep 
tone had last been heard on may 29 1985 ringing for the 39 mostly 
italian fans killed in a riot involving liverpool fans at a belgian 
stadium 
liverpools match on wednesday against west ham united has been 
canceled it is our view that all football matches involving our 
club should be suspended for the time being club chairman john 
smith said sunday 
but the anfield stadium was open during the day and fans came to 
place flowers on the kop the terrace behind one of the goals 
where thousands of fiercely loyal fans congregate 
it was on a similar but smaller terrace at sheffield that the 94 
fans died you will never walk alone a song known to every fan 
on the kop was repeated on many of the messages left at the gate 
among the messages was one from a survivor to those who 
carried me from the goalmouth yesterday you never knew me but ill 
never forget you 
other expressions of sympathy were left by fans of liverpools 
other bigleague football club everton in many families children 
grow up with split loyalties to the red and white of liverpool and 
the blue and white of everton 
liverpool is by far the more successful club four times 
european champion and a record 17 times english league winner but 
the rivalry with everton is respectful and friendly 
everton qualified saturday for the final of the premier english 
fa football association cup its third final in six years 
soccer authorities will decide this week if and when to replay 
liverpools semifinal game

at least a dozen states are considering laws that would force 
companies to insure their employees as a way to stem billions of 
dollars in hospital losses and protect some of the 37 million 
americans without health insurance 
hawaii in 1974 became the first state in the nation to adopt a 
mandatory insurance law and it was followed last year by 
massachusetts 
this year california florida illinois ohio and other states 
are debating bills that would order companies to cover workers 
impose tax penalties on those that dont and provide incentives for 
those that do 
new york washington and a few other states have adopted pilot 
projects to provide health care to the working poor 
and last week in washington dc sen edward m kennedy 
dmass and rep henry waxman dcalif introduced federal 
legislation that would require employers to buy health insurance 
for all fulltime workers similar legislation failed last year 
it is time to make health care a basic right for all not just 
an expensive privilege for the few kennedy said 
more than 37 million americans lack health insurance about 
twothirds 24 million are workers or their families their 
numbers have grown about 1 million a year since 1980 their ranks 
swelled by workers who once held wellpaying factory jobs and now 
work in the service industry 
hospitals have been prime supporters of the effort on the state 
and federal levels to insure the poor small businesses oppose 
mandatory insurance saying they cannot afford to provide health 
care benefits 
in 1980 hospitals lost 28 billion in health care costs for 
which they received no reimbursement or about 36 percent of their 
total costs said irene fraser a health project manager with the 
american hospital association in chicago 
seven years later losses for treating the poor rose to 72 
billion or 47 percent of total hospital costs she said 
many workers are unable to pay their bills because their 
employers provide no insurance and they earn just enough to be 
ineligible for assistance through medicaid which has wage ceilings 
that vary from state to state 
according to the national governors association a family of 
three in alabama could earn only 1416 per year to be eligible for 
medicaid while the same family in utah could earn 8316 
fifteen years after hawaii passed its mandatory insurance law 
opinions differ on the programs success and its applicability to 
mainland states 
i would say to anyone looking dont use hawaii as an example 
because its a poor example said sam slom president of small 
business hawaii neither employees or employers are satisfied 
employees are offered health insurance if they work at least 20 
hours a week for four consecutive weeks the law excludes 
government employees family businesses and people who work on 
commission such as real estate agents 
employees pay 15 percent of their monthly wage or onehalf the 
cost of the insurance premium whichever is less and the employer 
pays the balance 
we think its working well the employers are attuned to the 
law and comply said tomio anzai chief of the prepaid health 
care branch of the state department of labor and industrial 
relations 
hawaiis law wouldnt work elsewhere said jim weidman 
washington dc manager of state media relations for the national 
federation of independent businesses 
i would hasten to point out that hawaii is neither a mainland 
nor a mainstream state he said its more like disneyland 
its easier to gouge tourists who will have to pay more for 
everything from macadamia nuts to shoeshines 
debra lipson senior research associate at george washington 
universitys intergovernmental health policy project agreed that 
hawaii is a special case 
youve got a unique situation in hawaii she said if 
small companies decide the cost of doing business is too high 
they cant just jump over to the next state 
last year massachusetts went a step further with a law 
providing health security both to workers and the unemployed 
the program aimed at the one in 10 people in massachusetts who 
have no insurance is being installed in phases and will take full 
effect in 1992 the program could cost up to 1 billion over four 
years 
minnesota lawmakers are considering a measure that would provide 
basic health coverage to the poor with its 150 million cost paid 
by a payroll tax on employees and employers companies providing 
insurance could get tax breaks

a magazine has published details of the worst 
disaster in the soviets space program indirectly blaming the 
deadly launchpad explosion of an unmanned missile in 1960 on haste 
to catch up with the united states 
the weekly ogonyok said in an article sunday that workers 
ignored safety rules in the rush to launch the first soviet 
intercontinental ballistic missile in the race with the united 
states to develop icbms 
it said a significant number of people perished in the 
explosion and fireball of the r16 missile at a launching pad at 
turatam near the aral sea 
the only victim identified by ogonyok was chief artillery 
marshal mitrofan i nedelin serving as the first commander of the 
newly created soviet rocket forces it said he was about 60 feet 
from the missile when it exploded 
the late nikita s khrushchev who was premier at the time of 
the accident said in memoirs published in the west that dozens of 
soldiers and workers were killed 
accounts of the disaster on oct 24 1960 have circulated 
abroad but ogonyoks report was the first in the official soviet 
media 
it said 
launch of the r16 which was to be the maiden flight of the 
soviets first icbm had been scheduled for oct 23 but was 
postponed because of an electrical defect in the engine that caused 
a fuel leak 
in one of the gravest violations of safety precautions the 
hatches were removed and welding work undertaken on the fully 
fueled rocket 
late the next day the launch was scheduled in 30 minutes but 
workers were still installing an electrical distributor that 
somehow gave a command to ignite the rockets second stage 
flames from the ignition burned through the fuel tanks of the 
first stage touching off the fire and explosion 
ogonyok quoted a worker as saying a stream of fire burst out 
of the rocket inundating everything around it people tried to 
escape by running to the covered area where cars and other 
equipment were but the road literally melted in front of them 
blocking the escape route 
the magazine said the heat was so intense practically nothing 
was left only some metal change keys etc 
in another development the official tass news agency said 
saturday that scientists have abandoned efforts to reestablish 
contact with an unmanned satellite sent to examine mars that meant 
the soviets have lost touch with both phobos spacecraft launched at 
a cost of 480 million 
tass said the decision to discontinue attempts to reach phobos2 
was made by a commission investigating why contact had been lost 
march 27 contact with the phobos1 mars probe was lost in 
september because an erroneous command was beamed to the spacecraft 
from earth 
for many years the official news media did not report failures 
in the soviet space program 
ogonyok said it now was possible to report the circumstances of 
the r16 disaster because of the greater openness permitted under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs glasnost campaign

the halter created by design student 
beth teggatz doesnt cover a lot of flesh but it packs a lot of 
protection 
the top and matching kneelength pants and gauntletstyle gloves 
are made of a bulletproof fireresistant material kevlar 29 
i dont think there are any practical uses unless cher might 
be interested or maybe a punk rock group said teggatz a senior 
at iowa state university 
but practicality is beside the point the halter will be among 
many unusual items going on display next week at focus the 
universitys annual arts festival that prizes the creative over the 
marketable 
the idea is to show that at this highly technical institution 
there are quite a few original ideas said pat miller 
coordinator of the exhibit at the school known mainly for business 
engineering and agricultural studies 
ms teggatz 22 says her halter will be displayed on a 
mannequin although real live models have given it a try they 
have laughed but theyve been pretty agreeable she said 
ms teggatz also will display a wedding dress made from 
radiationresistant fabric 
its really quite sturdy she said the material is thin 
like paper but it doesnt rip its quite easy to work with 
the material which like the kevlar is made by du pont is used 
for garments worn by workers in nuclear plants after exposure to 
radiation the garment is discarded 
ive had people tell me that since the wedding dress is almost 
a paperylike substance that would get thrown away after use maybe 
it could be used for all the disposable weddings in society 
anymore she said 
ms teggatz cherishes the opportunity to stretch her creativity 
to bizarre extremes while she can 
ill have to settle down soon enough she said you cant 
make money being too creative

by having mexicos reputed no 1 drug lord 
arrested president carlos salinas de gortari again surprised 
cynics who had initially considered his pledge to fight highlevel 
corruption an empty campaign promise 
in what amounted to a coup against the oil workers union 
salinas used the army to arrest allegedly corrupt union leaders in 
january 
he jailed stockbrokers accused of fraudulent practices a month 
later 
this month alleged drug kingpin miguel angel felix gallardo was 
arrested 
it is all part of salinas battle to regain the confidence of 
mexicans who blame corruption for seven years of lost economic 
opportunity 
if he fails some analysts say his institutional revolutionary 
party could lose its hold on power such observers hold that 
salinas has been on the attack since taking office dec 1 because 
he has no choice 
salinas has to go against his own government its own 
collaborators to regain legitimacy he realizes that if the 
patronage system continues its going to collapse in upon 
itself said samuel del villar a political scientist at the 
colegio de mexico and adviser to salinas predecessor former 
president miguel de la madrid 
salinas election in july was the most disputed in the history 
of the party which has governed mexico since it was founded 60 
years ago he won just more than half the vote but reports 
abounded of multiple voting stolen ballot boxes and other fraud 
the results of july 6 were as much a rebellion against 
corruption as they were against the government del villar said 
salinas faces a skeptical public every mexican president in 
recent decades has come into office boldly declaring their 
intention to battle corruption 
he has inherited cynicism over the failure of his predecessors 
to tackle corruption fueled by the oilboom years many still 
bitterly criticize jose lopez portillo claiming he and his allies 
stole the country blind claims portillo denies 
he was followed in 1982 by de la madrid the last president 
who held public confidence that he could confront corruption and 
he lost it del villar said 
de la madrids campaign for honest government failed so 
corruption spread extraordinarily del villar said 
salinas has been forced to attack the very elements that with 
pri patronage have kept the party in power 
oil union chief joaquin hernandez galicia and stockbroker 
eduardo legoretta were considered untouchable before salinas jailed 
them 
in drug trafficking havens top dealers were sometimes called 
narcopoliticians before april 8 when salinas had felix 
gallardo thrown in jail 
he also had army troops arrest hundreds of police in felix 
gallardos home town of culiacan sweeping up officials who 
allegedly protected the socalled godfather of mexicos cocaine 
trade 
salinas threat to follow up those arrests with more in other 
states where drug trafficking is strong sent dozens of law 
enforcement officials scurrying for cover according to news 
reports 
de la madrid went after marginal people salinas is going for 
the central figures del villar said 
salinas is up against a centuriesold mix of corruption that has 
infested mexicos traditional authoritarian structure of government 
in his recent la capital the biography of mexico city 
jonathan kandell writes of the turnofthecentury 
gendarmes were forced to prey on the poor in order to cover 
kickbacks demanded from them by their higher officers that system 
continues today with cars with us license plates favored targets 
for a quick shakedown 
decades later mexico city police chief arturo durazo recruited 
known drug traffickers smugglers and car thieves to create a 
more proficient racketeering empire kandell says 
salinas also has staked his presidency and the continuation of 
his partys claim to authority on his ability to pull mexico out 
of seven years of economic crisis that has sliced paychecks in half 
corruption is worst where the economic activity is most 
strategic del villar said 
he said salinas a harvardeducated economist jailed legoretta 
and hernandez galicia because the brokerage firms like the oil 
workers union werent filling a productive role in the economy 
indeed mexican officials hope to gain billions of dollars in 
extra profits from a more efficient less corrupt petroleum 
industry 
salinas crackdowns have earned salinas kudos from the bush 
administration whose help he needs to reduce mexicos 
growthstrangling 107 billion foreign debt 
his credibility in washington has soared says political 
scientist adolfo aguilar zinser 
whether that translates into electoral gains at home remains to 
be seen 
still salinas campaign has impressed even some cynics 
the surprising thing about the arrests isnt that certain 
police are accused of corruption but that theyre being punished 
for it wrote political scientist lorenzo meyer in the mexico 
city daily excelsior

a winery worker sought in the killings 
of his wife two daughters and four other people was an angry 
jealous man who spied on his wife and had threatened to blow her 
head off a friend said 
ramon salcido 28 was so possessive of his wife that he drove 
home from work several times a day to check on her said richard 
clark salcidos nextdoor neighbor in boyes hot springs and friend 
authorities on sunday concentrated their search for salcido 
north of san francisco and alerted the us border patrol fearing 
he could head for his native mexico 
the cost of this is substantial but well pay anything to get 
this man into custody said sonoma county sheriff richard 
michaelsen his acts are those of a totally insane person 
on sunday the owners of the grand cru winery where salcido 
worked as a forklift operator offered a 5000 reward for 
information leading to his capture 
these atrocities have caused fear and terror to invade an area 
known for its beauty and hospitality walter and bettina dreyer 
said in a statement 
on friday officers discovered the bodies of salcidos 
24yearold wife angela at their home his motherinlaw and her 
two young daughters at their home in cotati and a winery 
coworker the girls had been raped and sodomized and one was 
nearly decapitated authorities said 
the next day the bodies of two of salcidos daughters were 
found at a dump with their throats slashed the throat of his 
3yearold daughter carmina also was cut but she survived and 
told police her father had done the slashings 
on tuesday only three days before her death his wife learned 
he had been married before and had another child born only a short 
time before their own oldest daughter the los angeles times 
reported today 
after learning of her husbands other life mrs salcido said 
she wanted to leave him the newspaper said 
now i can get an annulment nextdoor neighbor steve 
nielsen quoted mrs salcido as saying 
salcido also was a regular seller and user of cocaine and 
possibly amphetamines the times reported quoting several of his 
acquaintances it did not indentify by name 
on thursday night salcido stayed out drinking until 2 am 
then snorted cocaine with a friend the newspaper said 
sheriffs investigators said detectives had no information that 
salcido sold drugs 
clark described salcido as being extremely jealous anybody 
who was higher up than him or if he had a nicer car than he did 
he didnt like that he wanted to be no 1 clark said 
he also said the salcidos had recently begun arguing loudly 
once he said he heard mrs salcido an aspiring model cry 
out living with you is like living in jail you wont let me go 
out 
i could hear them yelling i guess i knew the killings 
were coming i heard him say im going to blow your head off 
clark said 
he blew up i had a feeling he would said clark he told 
me he had a gun and he was ready to use it if he ever needed 
salcido also was upset recently because he was served papers 
ordering him to pay nearly 6000 in overdue child support and to 
make monthly payments of 511 for a 4yearold daughter in fresno 
clark said 
despite reports of salcidos having problems at work his boss 
dreyer remembered him as very cooperative and quick to 
please 
he never caused any problems for anybody said warren 
brunhagen a patron at mcneillys bar in boyes hot springs where 
salcido was a regular customer 
if we had had 30 bar patrons like ramon thered be no 
problems 
investigators still have not determined a motive for the 
slayings and havent worked out their sequence michaelsen said 
we hope the young daughter of the suspect can put some light 
on it the sheriff said 
money and gifts poured into a hospital where carmina was 
recovering from surgery 
ive been told shell make a full recovery it was reported to 
me her vocal cords were not cut michaelsen said

supreme court justice harry a blackmun who 
wrote the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion and will hear arguments 
next week on a challenge to that decision said hes been getting 
lots of mail on the subject 
blackmun appearing at a symposium saturday night refused to 
comment on the possibility that the supreme court this term could 
overturn the decision that resulted from roe vs wade 
the high court is scheduled to hear arguments in webster vs 
reproductive health services on april 26 the case involves a 
federal appeals court ruling that struck down key provisions of a 
missouri antiabortion law declaring that human life begins at 
conception 
last september blackmun told law students at the university of 
arkansas theres a very distinct possibility that roe vs wade 
will be overturned by the high court because you can count the 
votes 
the associate justice said saturday night he had been getting 
voluminous mail on the subject with some people branding him 
morally rotten and responsible for the deaths of more babies 
in the history of world 
asked about his philosophy of law blackmun said i think we 
need some compassion in judgments let me just leave my 
constitutional philosophy at that 
the symposium marked the 50th anniversary of the late william o 
douglas appointment to the high court douglas served longer than 
any other justice in us history the symposium also came on the 
19th anniversary of blackmuns appointment they were on the bench 
together for five years 
douglas was an extremely talented person with love of the 
environment veneration of the first amendment ease of writing 
lack of pomposity blackmun said 
i saw douglas as a person with whom i had to get along 
blackmun added he put me on the defensive because of his 
accomplishments 
blackmun said his constitutional philosophy has developed in his 
years on the court but still holds the opinions he held before his 
appointment 
if one reads my opinions in the us court of appeals i 
think youll find i havent changed though i suppose ive 
changed in the sense that ive tried to develop a constitutional 
philosophy he said

in a nationwide referendum 
uruguayans voted to retain an amnesty for soldiers and police 
accused of torture and murder during 12 years of military rule that 
ended in 1985 official returns showed today 
the outcome of sundays vote was a victory for president julio 
m sanguinetti on an issue that had divided the nation for more 
than two years 
he had predicted trouble if the amnesty approved in 1986 after 
rumblings in the barracks were rejected soldiers who faced 
similar prosecution in neighboring argentina have staged three 
revolts in less than two years 
with 7009 of 7072 districts nationwide reporting amnesty 
supporters tallied 1008925 votes or 5257 percent while 
opponents numbered 770221 or 4013 percent about 140049 votes 
or 73 percent were blank annulled or ruled questionable for 
technical reasons 
uruguay definitely has turned the page on the past a 
relieved vice president enrique tarigo said as the interior 
ministry released official returns early today there were no 
winners or losers 
about 180 soldiers and police had been accused of crimes during 
the dictatorships war against leftist rebels thousands of 
suspected leftist sympathizers were arrested and tortured 150 were 
killed and 200 were never seen again 
the governing colorado party noted that in addition to the 
december 1986 amnesty for soldiers and police leftist tupamaro 
guerrillas were released from jail shortly after sanguinetti took 
office in march 1985 
early today a copresident of the national commission for a 
referendum a coalition of human rights and leftist political 
groups that collected more than a halfmillion signatures to bring 
about the referendum conceded defeat 
but a disheartened matilde rodriguez larreta whose politician 
husband was assassinated by security forces in 1976 also called 
for a national compromise on the issue 
the country and all its institutions cannot be insensitive to 
the circumstances that nearly onehalf of the population disagrees 
radically with the amnesty she told reporters 
the decision was accepted quietly by the public there was no 
gloating by the victors or caravans of honking cars or fireworks 
such as occurred in december when the electoral court said the 
referendum would be held 
sanguinetti last year predicted the amnesty law would survive 
the referendum saying overturning it carried the likelihood of a 
long hazardous and dramatic period of confrontation 
between soldiers and civilians the law was enacted as civil courts 
were about call military officers to answer charges of murder 
kidnapping and torture officers indicated they would ignore 
requests to testify setting up a potential clash with the 
government 
the same issue in argentina has led to three unsuccessful 
military insurrections there in the past 20 months against the 
government of president raul alfonsin 
 
official figures indicated that more than 83 percent of the 23 
million eligible voters cast ballots voting is mandatory and 
failure to do so is punishable by a small fine 
supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots opponents cast 
green ones 
the greens did best in montevideo which is home to almost 
half the electorate the traditional stronghold of the leftist 
parties in the countryside yellows dominated by margins of 
21 or more 
jaime perez secretary general of the communist party said the 
government intimidated citizens into voting for the amnesty 
the government developed a campaign seeking to build up 
elements of fear and uncertainty of what would happen if the 
greens won he told reporters this campaign didnt take hold 
in montevideo but it did in the countryside 
sanguinetti who was elected in november 1984 after democracy 
was restored said before the vote that the country should 
concentrate on the future including national elections set for 
nov 26 
not all uruguayans agreed 
standing in line waiting to vote in the upper middle class 
neighborhood of pocitos a welldressed woman said a country 
that forgets its past has no future a future of peace and justice 
depends on overturning the amnesty 
she declined to give her name

hard currency to boost imports to fill in gaps in the market while 
president mikhail s gorbachev tries to reform the economy 
gorbachev has said that improving the living conditions of 
soviet citizens is the main goal of his reform effort but after 
four years supplies of food and consumer goods are worse than 
before the reforms started 
officials announced last week that sugar will be rationed in 
moscow beginning in may for the first time since world war ii

hundreds of students in beijing and shanghai 
marched today to mourn the death of former communist party chief hu 
yaobang an outspoken reformist toppled by conservatives two years 
ago 
long live hu yaobang long live democracy long live freedom 
long live the rule of law chanted more than 600 students from 
beijings political science and law college 
marching behind a huge red flag bearing their schools name the 
students laid wreaths in hus honor at the base of a monument to 
communist martyrs in tiananmen square the symbolic seat of power 
in china 
hu who died saturday at age 73 after suffering a heart attack 
was regarded by intellectuals as favoring greater artistic and 
scholarly freedoms than other chinese leaders 
while a crowd of several thousand looked on the students sang 
the internationale and chanted slogans for about half an hour 
before dispersing 
we just want to express our grief over hu yaobangs death 
because he was a great leader and his death is a loss to the 
nation said one student we arent making any political 
statement 
but another student wang zhixun said the students were 
expressing an attitude of dissatisfaction with the failure of 
chinas leaders to institute democratic reforms 
hu yaobang dared to speak out and he said things we students 
supported wang said 
in shanghai more than 1000 students marched late sunday from 
fudan university to tongji university singing former odes to 
revolutionary leader mao tsetung but substituting hus name 
the demonstration lasted more two hours and broke up early this 
morning said jason hurpado of portland ore who is teaching 
english at fudan 
students at three other schools in beijing including the 
nations leading school beijing university put up hundreds of 
posters on their campuses over the weekend to express sorrow over 
hus death demand that his ouster be reassessed and call for 
greater democracy 
authorities in beijing and shanghai have made no efforts to 
interfere with the student activities the largest display of 
student unrest since the student marches of 198687 that led to 
hus ouster 
in the late 1970s hu supervised the partys rehabilitation of 
thousands of people wrongly jailed during the farleft cultural 
revolution including many scholars 
he was ousted as party chief in 1987 for allegedly encouraging 
bourgeois western influences in china and failing to quash 
nationwide student prodemocracy marches that year

a group of dolphinloving 
environmentalists recline on the sand with eyes closed and 
meditate opening their minds to receive telepathic messages they 
say the playful marine mammals send them 
were offering a true and profound experience with nature 
said bob dennis 28 who directs project delphinus internaional 
from his rented seaside home 50 miles southeast of los angeles 
as a group of the intelligent sea mammals surfaces near kelp 
beds visible from his window dennis lifts an 8inch conch shell 
and blows sending a deep bellow across the water 
dennis says the unorthodox group set up shop to document 
communication between dolphins and humans in hopes the information 
will further their environmental goals 
he said if people truly believe they can communicate with 
dolphins they will treat the animals with greater respect 
once you do that how can you throw a beer can on the beach 
or shoot a dolphin because hes eating your squid dennis asked 
the project was founded in 1987 by dennis and greg hurley with 
the goal of filming a documentary on dolphins to help end their 
slaughter by fishermen 
group activities include meditation sessions on the beach 
wilderness excursions and dolphinwatching boat trips and 
environmental talks they also send a quarterly newsletter to about 
3000 people statewide 
project members believe the rituals of australian aborigines 
polynesian natives and other ancient cultures can help modern man 
reunite with nature 
to honor those rites and pay homage to dolphins during boating 
trips group members sound the conch shell horns and beat drums 
lined with goat bellies to duplicate the way some ancient tribes 
called the seagoing mammals that are renowned for the grace and 
intelligence

president corazon aquino today 
brushed aside an offer by communist rebels to declare a ceasefire 
if she pledges to close us military bases and the us 
ambassador called the proposal a bid to weaken her government 
the rebel national democratic front offered sunday to declare a 
unilateral ceasefire in the 20year insurgency and open peace 
talks if mrs aquino vows to close the six us bases when their 
lease expires in 1991 
as i have said if we want a ceasefire then lets have a 
ceasefire first without any conditions said mrs aquino who 
has refused to say if she will support an extension of the lease 
mrs aquino also raised doubts about who really was authorized 
to speak for the rebels until we can find out once and for all 
who is the leader who can speak for all of them it is really very 
difficult to sit down with anybody the rebel statement which 
was delivered to news organizations was signed by satur ocampo 
one of two rebel negotiators in shortlived peace talks in 1986 
ocampo made similar proposal in an interview last month 
jose maria sison founder of the banned communist party of the 
philippines also gave the same statement in a videotaped interview 
from utrecht the netherlands where he has sought asylum sisons 
interview was broadcast over local television two weeks ago 
us ambassador nicholas platt said today that the rebel offer 
was aimed at undermining usphilippine relations and weakening 
the aquino government 
they realize that these bases and these facilities perform a 
very important economic role and they want to do anything they can 
to weaken the government platt said in an interview with radio 
station dzrh 
and so they are working hard to try and arrange for this 
relationship to end he added platt said the united states would 
close the bases if the philippine government wants them out 
the united states maintains clark air base and subic bay naval 
base two of its largest facilities overseas and four smaller 
installations in the philippines more than 60000 filipinos are 
employed at the bases where about 40000 us troops and their 
dependents are stationed 
the rebel statement said that if the aquino government were to 
close the bases by 1991 and promise no further agreements for us 
bases the national democratic front would not hesitate to 
immediately declare a unilateral ceasefire and enter into 
negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement and a 
peaceful end to the civil war 
but if the government refuses the rebels said they were 
determined to make us imperialism pay dearly for the continued 
stay of its bases and its increasing intervention in our peoples 
affairs

a 10foothigh bullet barrier is being 
built alongside a schoolyard to protect teachers and students from 
frequent street gunfire 
construction of the 300footlong concrete wall at lindbergh 
junior high school begins this week its 160000 cost financed by 
the school district and los angeles county 
its really sad that something like this has to be done but 
its needed in todays society said principal max fraley 
one side of the school where the recreation areas abut the 
713unit carmelitos housing project has been vulnerable to 
gunfire physical education teachers say the wall is long overdue 
when it is completed teacher trish ryan said she will 
celebrate by hanging a sign reading the great wall of 
lindbergh 
judy wade another physical education teacher said she has seen 
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during 
her 25 years at the school but she added now its not what 
theyre throwing but what theyre shooting 
last week students were evacuated from the recreation fields 
twice because of gunfire two years ago in the only shooting in 
which someone was hurt a student playing basketball after school 
was hit in the chest by a bullet and seriously hurt 
we got angry this is ridiculous this is enough we said 
were taking our classes out there and we have to convince the kids 
that its ok when we are not sure its ok ryan said 
anything for the safety of the kids but i think that 160000 
in law enforcement would do more to ease crime said carmelitos 
resident ray fox 28 
describing the north long beach projects police sgt bob 
gillissie said were there all the time because of drugs and 
gangrelated activities 
wesley c mitchell chief of police for the los angeles unified 
school district said the wall was a novel idea but i dont know 
if it is the solution to the problem

a court today ruled solidarity legal 
again officially ending a futile sevenyear attempt by communist 
authorities to eradicate the soviet blocs first independent 
workers movement 
a threejudge panel in a warsaw provincial court handed down the 
decision to register solidarity in the same room where the union 
movement led by lech walesa had its original charter approved in 
november 1980 
there was thunderous applause when the court completed the 
aboutface approved by polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who 
had tried to dissolve solidarity in a december 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown but now seeks the movements help to pull poland out of 
economic crisis 
several solidarity sources hinted that a meeting might take 
place between jaruzelski and walesa on tuesday 
i am happy that weve just returned on the road of democracy 
and freedom walesa said after hearing the decision at his home 
in gdansk where he is recovering from a bad cold he planned to 
travel to warsaw later in the day 
with solidarity registered walesa planned to fly wednesday 
morning to rome to thank polishborn pope john paul ii for the 
roman catholic churchs role in helping to broker the agreement 
with authorities 
the last step in the long bid for restoration of the union 
movement followed intensive negotiations between authorities and 
the solidarityled opposition that ended april 5 with farreaching 
accords 
the bargain grants solidarity and other longbanned groups 
legalization in exchange for opposition participation in 
partydominated parliament elections in june it also creates the 
first freely elected legislative chamber in the soviet bloc a 
senate which will have veto power over the current unicameral 
parliament or sejm where authorities will maintain a majority 
as the court session ended hundreds of hands lifted in the 
v for victory sign and chants of solidarnosc solidarnosc 
filled the room the solidarity leaders beamed and the judges shook 
hands with the participants 
two long solidarity banners were held up through the hearing 
before presiding judge danuta widawska about a dozen key 
solidarity activists and 300 spectators outside the courtroom 
another 100 supporters waited 
today means for me the restoration of justice said tadeusz 
mazowiecki the senior solidarity adviser who led the delegation 
that submitted the application 
mazowiecki who was on hand for solidaritys first legalization 
in 1980 added i hope i will not have to come here a third 
time 
the rev henryk jankowski walesas close adviser said he came 
from his gdansk church to verify walesas words at the funeral 
of prosolidarity priest jerzy popieluszko slain by the secret 
police you gave your life so solidarity could live 
solidarity had a stormy 16month legal existence before it was 
suspended by jaruzelskis martiallaw decree of dec 13 1981 
which led to the interning thousands of activists and the 11month 
detention of walesa 
the union that once claimed the membership of one in three poles 
officially was banned in october 1982 but never ceased to function 
first as an underground organization and then more openly after a 
1986 political amnesty took effect 
the communist party says its decision to legalize solidarity 
again results from changes in the political situation over the 
years that open the possibility for a more responsible union 
devoted to trade union issues and not politics 
party and government officials also admit they hope that 
legalizing the union will encourage the west to reschedule polands 
massive foreign debt and ease the pressure on the struggling 
economy 
president bush scheduled a speech today in the heavily 
polishamerican community of hamtramck mich to unveil new 
economic package for poland

permission to emigrate for eight years said today he is being 
allowed to leave the soviet union 
i have my passport in my hand petrov 36 said by telephone 
he said he will go to the united states as soon as i can 
sometime this week but that his plans were not certain 
petrov said he received notification from the soviet visa office 
in sundays mail and picked up his external passport this morning 
petrovs photographs were displayed last year at the us state 
department and his case has been one of the human rights cases 
pursued by the united states 
asked why he now was being granted permission to leave petrov 
said i will never know i think the reason is all the joint 
effort of the us embassy the state department and other 
countries like the netherlands and australia but mostly it was the 
state departments pressure 
former us ambassador arthur hartman and his wife donna worked 
especially hard on his case petrov said 
petrov tried since 1981 to join his american wife virginia 
johnson but was turned down for reasons of state security he says 
he was told before he began working in an electronics laboratory in 
1977 that he would not be permitted to leave the country for five 
years 
he left the laboratory after three months

americans overwhelmingly believe that outlawing 
abortion would do little to curtail it and half want the operation 
to remain legal and unrestricted in early pregnancies a poll has 
found 
the media generalassociated press poll of 1108 adults also 
found broad opposition to operation rescue whose members have been 
blocking entrances to abortion clinics around the country 
with the us supreme court poised to reconsider its 1973 roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortion during the first three 
months of pregnancy 53 percent in the randomsample survey said 
they favored that landmark ruling 
moreover if the court were to reverse itself and let each state 
make its own abortion laws 57 percent said they would want 
abortion legal in their state thirtyseven percent would want it 
illegal and 7 percent were unsure 
the poll posed the issue in a variety of ways because the 
wording of questions on a sensitive issue can affect the results 
the findings on basic attitudes toward abortion were similar in 
other recent polls but in a new finding large majorities said 
outlawing abortion would fail to prevent it 
abortion proponents argue that many women would have unsafe 
illegal abortions if the procedure were banned 
the poll asked if abortion were illegal in your state do you 
think that would stop most women there who want abortions from 
having them or would most of them go to another state where it was 
legal eightyseven percent said the women would go to another 
state 
the poll then asked whether banning abortions nationwide would 
stop most women from having them or if those women would have 
illegal abortions or go to a country where abortion is legal 
seventythree percent said women would find a way to have abortions 
the survey found its closest split on the question of a 
constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal except in cases 
of rape incest or to save the life of the mother fifty percent 
were opposed and 44 percent in favor a division within the polls 
3point error margin 
no such amendment is before congress but those are the terms 
president bush has said he would support 
in another question on conditions under which abortion may be 
permitted the poll asked should abortion be legal as it is now 
legal only in such cases as rape incest or to save the life of 
the mother or should it not be permitted at all fifty percent 
said legal as now 39 percent said only in certain cases 7 percent 
wanted it banned outright and the rest were unsure 
that question has been asked since 1985 by the cbs newsnew york 
times poll which has found a slight increase in support for 
current law depending on the questions however other polls have 
found slight declines in support for abortion and others still 
have found no movement 
in a question outside the legal context the media generalap 
poll asked if a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor 
agrees to it should she be allowed to have an abortion or not 
sixtyfive percent said yes 25 percent said no and the remaining 
10 percent had no opinion the cbstimes poll has found a similar 
and steady response to that question since 1980 
opposition to abortion was greatest among older less wealthy 
and less educated respondents and republicans and conservatives 
there was no significant division in opinions between men and women 
the federal centers for disease control say 13 million 
abortions are performed annually in the united states making it 
one of the nations most common surgical procedures the supreme 
court next week is to hear a case that could enable it to review 
its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion 
the media generalap survey also found 
sixtyseven percent were opposed to demonstrations by operation 
rescue 
narrow opposition to use of federal funds to help poor women 
with their medical bills if they want an abortion fortynine 
percent were opposed to such spending 41 percent in favor the 
rest did not answer 
support for legalization in the united states of a new pill ru 
486 which halts a pregnancy by cutting off a hormone necessary to 
keep an egg implanted in the uterus 
antiabortion activists call the drug an abortion pill and have 
threatened boycotts against its producers supporters of the pill 
which is available in france call it simpler and safer than 
surgical abortion in the poll 51 percent said it should be legal 
here 24 percent said it should not 25 percent were unsure 
the poll was conducted march 615 by the ap and media general

authorities were investigating the cause of a 
suspicious fire that swept through a historic centuryold loft 
building destroying millions of dollars worth of art and at least 
eight galleries 
all that remained today of the sixstory blocksquare warehouse 
designed by the noted chicago architect louis sullivan was a brick 
shell 
witnesses said saturdays fire began in at least two spots 
and very seldom do two fires break out simultaneously said 
fire department spokesman tom sheppard 
gallery owners said the river north art district should recover 
quickly from the fire 
the major galleries will be back in business said dealer 
william van straaten who lost 3 million in prints in the blaze 
including works by americans jasper johns and robert rauschenberg 
the fire struck as dealers were preparing for the annual art 
expo spring exposition next month at chicagos navy pier which 
attracts art dealers from around the world and is considered the 
most important annual show for chicagos art community 
van straaten estimated that the combined loss to all the 
galleries in the building could total as much as 50 million 
i am totally wiped out said jonathan santlofer a new york 
artist who spent two years on the 13 paintings and drawings he had 
hanging in one of the galleries when the fire struck 
i may try to do something like it again but i wont be able 
to do it exactly the same said santlofer whose abstract 
paintings used religious motifs 
the building was constructed in 1885 and had been recommended 
for landmark status by the commission on chicago landmarks in 
recent years it was the linchpin of the burgeoning river north 
area which is filled with restaurants nightclubs and dozens of 
galleries

two men found buried one atop the other 
on a communal farm were killed by the same cult of drug smugglers 
that sacrificed 13 people and buried the mutilated corpses at a 
ranch nearby authorities said 
the two bodies found sunday were in an orchard two miles from 
rancho santa elena where the other corpses were dug up last week 
the 72yearold father of one of the two victims led police to 
the bodies he said some children had told him last fall they had 
seen people burying a body but he discounted the story until the 
13 corpses were dug up authorities said 
police believe rancho santa elena about 20 miles west of 
matamoros was where a cult performed sacrifices and other rites to 
protect their drug smuggling from police and rivals the bodies 
found last week had been dismembered and their hearts brains and 
other organs removed for use in rituals police said 
the bodies found at the communal farm sunday had not been 
dismembered said martin elias salazar a federal judicial police 
group chief who supervised sundays exhumations a sheriffs deputy 
in brownsville a texas city across the rio grande from matamoros 
said the deaths apparently were drug related 
salazar said police had long suspected the two men of selling 
drugs that suspicion plus the proximity of the grave to the 
ranch led salazar to believe they had done business with the cult 
before it turned to committing human sacrifices 
four men being held in matamoros in the 13 other slayings had 
not been questioned about the newly found bodies salazar said he 
added they were to be interrogated after a court appearance today 
salazar said police then would determine whether to search for 
more bodies 
serafin hernandez garcia elio hernandez rivera sergio martinez 
and david serna valdez were to be formally charged today with 
murder kidnapping and drug and weapons possession authorities 
said 
the cults leaders adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 and sara 
maria aldrete 24 were still being sought police said constanzo 
allegedly ran a marijuanasmuggling ring that sneaked a ton of the 
drug into the united states weekly officials have said 
federal police in mexico city said they were investigating 
possible links between the killings and recent slayings in mexico 
city but had found nothing yet 
on sunday officers inspected a garden across the street from 
constanzos luxurious house in atizapan 13 miles north of mexico 
city for signs that bodies might have been buried but found 
nothing 
they wouldnt be stupid enough to bury them here anyway 
said one officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
on friday federal police searched constanzos atizapan house 
and the apartments of two associates who are fugitives they found 
a couple of marble altars but no signs of human sacrifice 
neighbors said three to five young men suddenly fled the house 
in latemodel luxury cars early tuesday the day the first 12 
bodies were found one of the four suspects captured that day led 
police to a 13th body thursday 
like most of the victims found at rancho santa elena the two 
men found sunday had been struck in the back of the head with a 
machete said jose delgadillo an employee at the matamoros funeral 
home where the bodies were taken 
delgadillo had watched while a doctor examined the remains 
sunday night 
the bones were whole they were not dismembered delgadillo 
said one cant tell if the hearts and other organs were removed 
because the bodies were decomposed its pretty revolting 
delgadillo dug up the bodies as police stood around took 
pictures and cracked jokes the bottom body was clad in black pants 
and snakeskin boots a pants pocket contained a us 5 bill and 
3000 mexican pesos little was left of the remains but bones

toni matt is a former austrian ski 
champion and us national downhill champion but he says he is 
remembered most for one legendary mad dash down tuckerman ravine 50 
years ago 
i got more mileage out of that race than all the rest of them 
put together he said sunday on a nostalgic return to the 
mountain on the 50th anniversary of his famous schuss in the 
inferno race 
matt said he never skied anything like it and i dont think 
anyone else has either because it drops off so fast 
tuckerman ravine on 6288foot mount washington is only a 
small portion of the fourmile race its most notable feature is 
the headwall with a 1000foot drop at angles that reach 65 
degrees matt made a straight run down the ravine 
lowell thomas the late broadcaster who witnessed the event 
along with 2000 spectators described it this way 
the first racers took a good three or four swinging 
highspeed turns on the headwall to check their speed but when 
matt came bolting over the edge because it was so steep he knew a 
turn wouldnt slow him down he schussed the wall like a lead 
plummet hitting 85 miles per hour as he came streaming off the 
bottom his skis shattering the icy snow 
matt reeled through the bottom of the trail just missing a tree 
before finishing the run in 6 minutes 294 seconds that was a 
full minute faster than runnerup dick durrance and smashed the 
previous record of more than 13 minutes 
world cup downhill races last about two minutes and racers 
average about 75 mph 
i dont remember anything about it said the 69yearold 
matt who lives in pawling ny it goes so fast it only takes a 
few seconds from time you see the headwall and youre halfway down 
and before you know it its all over 
i wasnt frightened i was used to speed although not that 
fast and i was in good shape he said 
the race was discontinued after matts 1939 feat because of 
unpredictable weather

gov roy mabus called the legislature back 
to work today to take up a measure that would protect parole board 
members from being sued for crimes committed by freed inmates 
lawmakers during the threeday special session will also 
consider a 79 million building program 
the two proposals died in the closing days of the 1989 regular 
session which ended two weeks ago 
the new parole board would have five fulltime members with 
immunity from liability the current board has four parttime 
members and a fulltime chairman who meet several days a month 
momentum for restructuring the board built after a state judge 
last year ordered three members to pay 3 million to a banker shot 
and paralyzed by a parolee the judgment is being appealed 
the restructuring measure died on the last day of the regular 
session after mabus threatened a veto if it included an amendment 
barring appointment of anyone who contributed 500 or more to any 
campaign of the appointing governor 
a proposal to issue bonds for capital improvements and property 
purchases failed partly because some legislators were reluctant to 
add to the states indebtedness

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may tax television evangelists sales of religious 
books tapes and other merchandise 
the justices said they will review rulings that forced the 
louisianabased jimmy swaggart ministries to pay california 
183000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981 
lawyers for swaggarts organization argue that the california 
tax as applied violates religious freedom 
a state appeals court rejected that argument and the california 
supreme court turned down an appeal by swaggarts lawyers last nov 
17 
the disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on retailers 
for the privilege of selling personal property in california and 
on the consumption of products 
the tax was imposed on sales by the swaggart ministry during 
crusades in california and sales made through the mails 
for the years at issue mailorder sales from baton rouge la 
to california consumers totaled 17 million sales of merchandise 
at california crusades totaled 240000 
the appeal acted on today argued what could be a clearer 
violation of the free exercise of the religion of the religious 
adherent than to tax that adherent for exercising the right to use 
the religious material distributed by the evangelist 
the appeal relied heavily on a 1943 ruling in which the nations 
highest court overturned the convictions of jehovahs witnesses who 
violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in 
doortodoor canvassing to get a license and pay a fee 
the jehovahs witnesses were distributing religious literature 
the court said in its 1943 ruling this form of religious 
activity occupies the same high estate under the first amendment as 
do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits 
the california appeals court acknowledged the 1943 ruling and 
said evangelism whether by ageold methods or by new 
technologies is protected by the first amendment 
but the appeals court said the 1943 decision and other past 
supreme court rulings have banned flat licensing taxes on religious 
endeavors 
the supreme court did not equate a financial burden in and of 
itself with an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of 
religion the state court said 
the appeals court noted that in a 1983 decision striking down a 
minnesota tax as discriminatory against certain newspapers the 
supreme court said our cases have consistently recognized that 
nondiscriminatory taxes on the receipts or income of newspapers 
would be permissible 
the state court concluded a religious organization which 
seeks to disseminate its religious message through sales should 
not enjoy rights to communicate and distribute their message 
superior to those of other organizations having social political 
or other ideological messages to proselytize such as newspapers 
the case is jimmy swaggart ministries vs board of equalization

the supreme court today agreed to settle some 
key questions involving the ability of multinational corporations 
to challenge state taxes in federal court 
what the justices decide sometime next year in a california case 
could carry bigmoney significance for most states and many big 
businesses 
the court granting an appeal by california officials said they 
will review a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to 
challenge a state tax in federal court 
in a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states the 
justices ruled that california may tax multinational corporations 
based on the businesses worldwide income 
but that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent 
company is located in the united states 
the case acted on today involves multinationals whose parent 
company is based in a foreign country 
californias business tax the same levy upheld in the 1984 
ruling was challenged by alcan aluminium limited a canadian 
corporation and imperial chemical industries plc a british 
corporation 
california taxed subsidiaries of the multinationals doing 
business in the state 
the california tax employs what is known as the unitary system 
the method bases the tax on a share of worldwide earnings payroll 
and property value of each multinational and its subsidiaries 
at issue in the appeal acted on today is whether multinationals 
based abroad have legal standing to challenge such unitary state 
taxes in federal courts in the united states 
alcan and imperial challenged the california tax in a federal 
court in chicago where the california franchise tax board has an 
office 
a federal judge threw out the suits on grounds that the parent 
companies claimed they were injured only in their capacity as 
shareholders of their subsidiaries and therefore lacked legal 
standing 
generally shareholders are barred from suing in such cases 
unless they can demonstrate a direct and independent injury 
from the corporation 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last october overturned 
the judges decision againt alcan and imperial reinstating their 
suits the appeals court said there is grounds for the parent 
companies to assert a direct and independent injury 
shareholders with direct personal interests in a cause of 
action can bring suit even if the corporations legal rights and 
obligations are also implicated the appeals court said 
the asserted injuries to alcan and imperial are direct and 
independent the appeals court said because the unitary tax 
diminishes the attractiveness of owning american subsidiaries in 
comparison with entering into contracts with independent companies 
as a means of engaging in foreign commerce 
the appeals court added the potential for the unitary tax to 
penalize foreign ownership of american assets distinguishes it 
from other forms of state regulation environmental or safety 
rules for example that would presumably affect foreign and 
domestically owned operations fairly equally 
the appeals court said taxes like the one imposed by california 
have fueled a simmering trade controversy which has raised 
concerns about foreign retaliation and the united states ability 
to speak with one voice on matters of foreign commerce 
most states and the multistate tax commission joined in 
supporting californias appeal 
the commission said the 7th circuit court rulings effect is to 
permit multinational corporations to forum shop around the 
country for a sympathetic federal judge who will permit the 
businesses to challenge the state taxes 
the case is franchise tax board vs alcan aluminium 881400

the supreme court in an important banking 
industry case today asked the bush administration for its view on 
whether us banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors 
after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts 
the court invited justice department lawyers to comment on 
rulings that required citibank to pay depositors 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will grant 
full review to the case until hearing from the government lawyers 
which could take months 
robert h bork a former federal judge whose supreme court 
nomination was defeated by the senate in 1987 is representing 
citibank 
if the court were to grant review bork might become the first 
defeated nominee in the courts history to later argue a case 
before the justices 
in the appeal acted on today bork said billions of dollars are 
at stake there are more than 900 branches of us banks operating 
in 73 countries with some 225 billion in deposits 
the cases acted on today stem from the fall of saigon vietnam 
to the vietcong in 1975 and economic troubles in the philippines in 
1983 
the vietnamese case involves an account at citibanks saigon 
office opened in 1974 by quang quy trinh a retired south 
vietnamese government official 
the account which paid annual interest of 19 percent compounded 
daily was for trinhs son ngoc quang trinh a student in michigan 
at the time 
the deposit agreement between trinh and citibank said the bank 
did not accept responsibility for any loss due to government 
orders laws or from any other cause beyond its control 
citibank closed its saigon branch on april 24 1975 on the eve 
of the citys fall to communist troops 
the elder trinh was placed in a reeducation camp by the new 
regime and after he was released in 1980 sent the citibank 
passbook to his son in michigan 
the younger trinh sued the bank to recover the deposits 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last july upheld a ruling 
that citibank must pay trinh 319636 including 179269 in 
interest 
the appeals court rejected citibanks argument that its deposit 
agreement excused it from paying deposits lost because of political 
revolution 
the agreement the elder trinh signed did not mean he was aware 
that he had given up his right to proceed against the home office 
of citibank in the event the branch was no longer in existence 
and could not pay its depositors the appeals court said 
it added that both trinh and citibank are innocent parties in 
the case but one must suffer a loss 
in the philippines case wells fargo asia limited in singapore 
deposited 2 million with the citibank branch in manila in june 
1983 the money was to be repaid with interest six months later 
but on oct 15 1983 the philippine government of ferdinand 
marcos who was deposed and fled to hawaii in 1986 froze the 
accounts of foreign banks the move prevented citibank from 
repaying the manila deposits to wells fargo 
wells fargo sued to recover the money and citibank later paid 
it 934000 citibank withheld the balance of the original deposit 
a federal judge in 1987 ordered citibank to repay the balance in 
1987 and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the ruling 
last july 
the appeals court relied on an agreement between the two banks 
that suggested citibanks home office in new york city had the duty 
to pay the money 
the cases are citibank vs trinh 881031 and citibank vs 
wells fargo 881260

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the murder conviction of a new york city man who 
confessed to killing his former girlfriend after police illegally 
arrested him at his home 
the court said it will review a ruling that threw out bernard 
harris conviction because his confession was used as evidence 
against him 
the ruling is being appealed by bronx prosecutors 
the new york state court of appeals last october ruled that 
harris is entitled to a new trial on charges stemming from the 
stabbing death of thelma staton 
ms statons body was found in her apartment jan 11 1984 
police were told by ms statons daughter that harris had kidnapped 
the victim several days earlier and had raped her before letting 
her go 
police said they went to harris apartment five days after 
discovering ms statons body with probable cause to believe 
harris was the killer but they did not have an arrest warrant 
after knocking on harris door and receiving no answer one 
officer went down a fire escape to a window and announced that the 
police had arrived other officers at the front door with guns 
drawn and badges displayed then were allowed by harris to enter 
harris was given his socalled miranda warnings that he had a 
right to remain silent and have a lawyers help police said harris 
then poured himself a glass of wine and confessed to killing ms 
staton 
he was arrested and taken to the stationhouse where about one 
hour later he gave police a written confession 
a trial judge ruled that harris confession at the apartment 
could not be used as evidence because his arrest made without a 
warrant and in violation of his privacy rights was unlawful 
but the judge permitted prosecutors to introduce as evidence the 
stationhouse confession ruling it was not tainted by the illegal 
arrest the connection between the arrest and the stationhouse 
confession was sufficiently attenuated to permit its use the 
judge ruled 
but the new york court of appeals the states highest court 
ruled that the stationhouse confession was a direct byproduct of 
the unlawful arrest 
the state court relied heavily on a 1980 supreme court ruling 
that said police must have a warrant to arrest someone at home 
unless some emergency exists 
the justices in that case barred from being used as evidence a 
bullet casing found at a murder suspects home 
the new york court said the 1980 ruling means the fruits of 
illegal entries must be suppressed even though the police might 
have probable cause to conduct a search or effectuate an arrest 
outside the home without a warrant 
the case is new york vs harris 881000

the supreme court today agreed to study a 
strike by lawyers in the nations capital who sought higher pay 
to represent penniless criminal defendants 
the court said it will hear an appeal by federal officials who 
say the lawyers violated antitrust law 
the superior court trial lawyers association here organized a 
boycott in 1983 to pressure the district of columbia government to 
increase hourly compensation the city pays attorneys who represent 
indigent criminal defendants 
some 100 lawyers who represent most of the citys poor criminal 
defendants had been receiving 30 an hour for time in court and 20 
an hour for outofcourt work they won a 25 per hour increase 
after a twoweek boycott in which nearly all them refused to accept 
new cases 
the boycott created a crisis for the city swamping the the city 
public defenders office with criminal cases the city government 
agreed to the higher hourly rate at an annual cost to taxpayers of 
more than 4 million 
the private lawyers who boycotted represent 85 percent of the 
poor defendants the remaining defendants are represented by the 
public defender service thirdyear law students or in a small 
number of cases lawyers volunteering to work without pay 
after the socalled strike the federal trade commission ruled 
that the lawyers engaged in pricefixing and an illegal boycott 
the ftc ordered the lawyers not to engage in similar conduct in the 
future 
the us circuit court of appeals here set aside the ftc 
decision and ordered the agency to restudy the case to determine 
whether the lawyers had exerted market power in their boycott 
alleged antitrust violators are considered to be exerting market 
power if they are capable of exercising economic control over a 
relevant market 
the appeals court here said it was unclear whether the boycott 
succeeded because the lawyers exercised market power or political 
clout 
power of some sort was surely exercised the appeals court 
said the city council approved a rate increase it had long 
refused two weeks into a boycott that disrupted the court system 
and generated significant publicity 
the appeals court said the lawyers may have succeeded even 
though they lacked market power by changing public attitudes and 
making it politically safe for the city council to raise their pay 
the boycott may have succeeded because it was persuasive rather 
than coercive the appeals court added 
also the appeals court said the ftc must judge the lawyers 
with a special solicitude because freeexpression rights 
protected by the constitution are involved 
the lawyers said the boycott was an exercise of their first 
amendment rights to petition the government for a redress of 
grievances 
in appealing to the supreme court the ftc said the appeals 
court ruling sets a dangerous precedent 
the ruling erects formidable new barriers against antitrust 
challenges to publicly conducted pricefixing boycotts the ftc 
said the taxpaying public no less than private parties is 
entitled to have its monies spent in markets in which all 
participants obey the laws of competition 
the cases are ftc vs superior court trial lawyers association

the supreme court today refused to bar the 
federal government from requiring certain peacetime training for 
any states national guard troops without first getting the 
governors consent 
the justices without comment left intact a 1986 federal law 
prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training 
missions 
the law had been challenged by massachusetts officials 
todays action does not preclude the possibility that the issue 
could some day return to the nations highest court 
since 1933 each person joining the national guard 
simultaneously enlists in two distinct organizations the army or 
air national guard of a particular state and the army or air 
national guard of the united states 
the first organization serves as the states militia the second 
as a reserve component of the national armed forces 
congress in 1986 passed the socalled montgomery amendment after 
several governors voiced opposition to the reagan administrations 
central american policy and said they would withhold their consent 
to national guard training missions in that region 
the 1986 law prohibits any governor from withholding consent to 
a national guard units active duty outside the country because of 
an objection to the location purpose or schedule of such duty 
a national guard unit in massachusetts was designated to 
participate in a central america training mission in mid1988 but 
gov michael dukakis objected 
state officials sued the department of defense in federal court 
alleging that the 1986 law is unconstitutional 
us district judge robert e keeton upheld the law and the 1st 
us circuit court of appeals agreed last oct 25 
the dispute centered on seemingly competing provisions in the 
constitution 
one enpowers congress to raise and support armies including 
calling forth the miltia 
the other leaves to individual states the training of the 
militia 
judge keeton ruled that a states authority to train national 
guard members must yield to the legitimately exercised power of 
congress to raise and support armies 
keetons ruling relied in part on a 1918 supreme court 
decision that upheld congress authority to draft members of a 
state militia into the national armed forces during world war i 
the judge discounted arguments by massachusetts authorities that 
a states authority to supervise the training of national guard 
members is absolute during peacetime and can be taken over by the 
federal government only in times of national emergency 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
declared the montgomery amendment unconstitutional after the law 
was challenged by minnesota gov rudy perpich 
that ruling currently is under review by the entire 8th circuit 
court 
urging the justices to reject massachusetts appeal bush 
administration lawyers said it would be incongruous to hold that 
the constitution gives congress the power to establish these 
reserves as components of the national armed forces but 
withholds federal authority to conduct their training 
the administration lawyers added such a view would not only 
undercut the effectiveness of the national defense but would also 
inject the states into matters of foreign policy that the 
constitution reserves to the federal government 
as of 1986 army national guard members provided 46 percent of 
the armys combat units and 28 percent of its support forces 
for fiscal year 1987 the air national guard members provided 73 
percent of the nations air defense interceptor forces and 25 
percent of its tactical fighter forces 
the case is massachusetts vs department of defense 881223

the supreme court today ordered the dismissal 
of a challenge to a rule that generally requires los angeles city 
court employees to speak only english while at work 
the justices instructed the 9th us circuit court of appeals to 
take such action after being told that the woman who challenged the 
rule no longer works for the city court 
the rule was adopted by the southeast judicial district of the 
los angeles municipal court in 1984 
the rule bars court employees from speaking any language other 
than english except when acting as translators or during breaks 
and lunchtime 
the regulation was challenged by alva gutierrez a 
hispanicamerican who was a deputy court clerk ms gutierrez is 
bilingual and one of her duties was to translate for 
spanishspeaking members of the public that have business before 
the city court 
she said the englishonly rule discriminates against her and 
other minority group members based on their race and national 
origin 
the 9th circuit court last year upheld a federal judges 
injunction barring enforcement of the rule pending further 
developments in ms guitierrez suit 
the appeals court also rejected arguments that the city judges 
who adopted the rule are immune from being sued 
the appeals court said while some employees who speak only 
english may feel threatened by conversations in spanish between 
other workers that is no legitimate basis for a discriminatory 
policy 
existing racial fears or prejudices and their effects cannot 
justify a racial classification the appeals court said the 
fears of people who do not understand spanish do not amount to a 
business necessity warranting the ban the appeals court said 
it noted that the federal equal employment opportunity 
commission properly has warned that barring workers from speaking 
their native tongue on the job may contribute to racial tension 
acknowledging that the california constitution has been amended 
to recognize english as the states official language the appeals 
court said the amendment is primarily symbolic and does not mandate 
that english be the only language spoken by public employees 
the case is municipal court of los angeles vs gutierrez

devastated streets today after artillery and rocket exchanges 
between christian and moslem fighters killed 41 people in less than 
48 hours

began at dusk saturday between army commander gen michel aouns 
largely christian army units and his syrian and druse adversaries

civil war 
kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed alsabah called 
for an emergency meeting of the arab league council to take 
urgent measures to stop the massacre in lebanon 
the sheik who heads an arab league mediation committee on 
lebanon called the meeting after three ceasefire appeals by his 
sixman panel failed to curb the hostilities 
the latest casualties raised the overall toll from 41 days of 
almost nonstop bombardment by both sides to 258 killed and 913 
wounded by police count 
beirut was without electricity and the waterpumping system came 
to a standstill after the capitals main power plants were shut 
down at noon sunday when they ran out of fuel

thundered into action again sending people scurrying back to their 
shelters

the staterun radio beirut station was gutted by a barrage of 30 
artillery shells the station remained off the air for a second day 
the smokeblackened building is next door to the office of

that is vying for legitimacy with a christian military cabinet 
headed by aoun 
hoss met today with frances visiting minister for humanitarian 
assistance bernard kouchner who is trying to arrange a mercy 
mission to evacuate casualties and bring in fuel and medical 
supplies 
a source close to hoss speaking on condition of anonymity said 
a dozen moslem victims of the fighting might be evacuated from west 
beirut to the french navy hospital ship rance at nightfall if 
security conditions permit 
fourteen christians were ferried to the rance on friday 
the fighting was touched off by a blockade aoun clamped on 
illegal militiarun ports that have cost the government about 100 
million a year in lost customs revenue 
the druse progressive socialist party retaliated by shelling the 
christian enclave

president bushs slightly altered plan to 
protect deposits in failed savings and loans will consume the 
senates attention this week while speaker jim wrights troubles 
and the recommended closing of 86 military bases dominate house 
action 
bushs plan would cost a minimum of 157 billion twothirds of 
it from taxpayers over the next 10 years to shore up the 
governments deposit insurance funds after raids on it by 
oftenfraudulent savings and loan operators 
the sampl insurance fund is at least 25 billion in the hole 
because of overly speculative loans insider deals and in some 
cases outright thievery by thrift operators using federally 
protected deposits 
the house ethics committee charged today that wright violated 
official rules of conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of 
dollars in alleged gifts and by skirting rules on speaking fees 
through bulk book sales 
the committee also cleared wright of several allegations 
including one that he improperly intervened with sampl regulators on 
behalf of texas thrift operators and friends 
the house also is scheduled to vote tuesday on a resolution by 
new jersey california and illinois lawmakers to reject a federal 
commissions recommendation last year to close 86 military bases 
among the base closings that would begin in 1990 unless the 
resolution is approved are the armys fort dix and presidio bases 
in new jersey and san francisco and the air forces chanute 
training base in illinois 
lawmakers hope to make this a shortened work week taking off on 
thursday to mark passover but with the sampl deficit growing by an 
estimated 600 million to 1 billion a month senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine has vowed to bring them back on 
friday if they do not complete action on bushs package before the 
holiday 
lawmakers and presidential candidates in both parties closed 
their eyes to the problem during last years election campaign 
while the federal home loan bank board was committing some 38 
billion to close or merge more than 200 insolvent sampls half of 
them in texas 
the bailout package before the senate would come up with the 
balance needed to pay for that 50 billion more needed to handle 
another 350 institutions now or near insolvency plus another 33 
billion to cover losses of additional thrifts expected to go under 
by 1999 
together the costs none of which will ever be recovered are 
more than double the amount of aid repaid loans and loan 
guarantees that the government put up for the marshall plan to 
rebuild europe after world war ii and the chrysler lockheed new 
york city and penn central bailouts combined 
toward bushs stated goal of never again the presidents 
plan also would require sampls effectively to double from 3 to 6 
their own capital at risk for every 100 they lend as an 
inducement to be more prudent 
the legislation also replaces the independent and traditionally 
industryfriendly home loan bank board with the stricter 
bankinsuring federal deposit insurance corp and a new treasury 
office as the industrys regulators 
the senate banking committee last week weakened bushs reform 
proposals somewhat by continuing to allow a variety of nonowner 
assets to count as capital through governmentapproved though 
widely criticized accounting practices 
m danny wall the bank boards chairman would keep his job 
under bushs proposal and the senate committees bill but likely 
would lose it in a version moving through the house 
challenges to walls continuance in office and bushs financing 
plan and an effort to set aside for poor and lowincome families 
some of the housing that has fallen into the governments hands 
through sampl loan defaults may surface on the senate floor this 
week 
under bushs plan the bailout will be financed with 50 billion 
raised through 30year bonds to be issued by a new quasigovernment 
corporation this lets bush avoid having to include the costs in 
his federal deficit calculations while taxpayers pick up about 5 
billion and the sampl industry 300 million of the annual interest 
costs of the bonds 
an onbudget upfront financing plan by house banking chairman 
don riegle dmich was defeated in committee last week despite 
riegles contention that it would have saved taxpayers 45 billion 
in interest costs over the next 30 years

a court today convicted a 23yearold 
palestinian of spying for the moslem guerrillas who are trying to 
overthrow the countrys sovietbacked government 
meanwhile guerrilla reports in pakistan claimed the insurgents 
had breached the southern defenses of the eastern afghan city of 
jalalabad after a sixweek siege 
however diplomats in kabul the afghan capital said the 
government may have succeeded in reopening the highway from the 
capital to jalalabad the usbacked guerrillas had destroyed a 
bridge to close the road during their offensive 
in the kabul trial the special court for national security said 
the defendant abdul razaq deserved the death penalty however 
the court said it commuted his sentence to 16 years in prison 
because he asked for mercy the court said he could appeal 
the threejudge panel found the man guilty of illegally entering 
afghanistan military spying collaborating with insurgents and 
trying to persuade government soldiers to defect to neighboring 
pakistan 
razaq admitted entering afghanistan illegally but he said he 
came only to preach islam 
i am not a professional killer he told the court i came 
to make peace between two guerrilla commanders i am not a spy 
my objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides 
he was arrested last december by government troops who stormed a 
guerrilla hideout in northwestern afghanistan prosecutors said 
he said his home was a palestinian refugee camp in jordan 
on april 5 the court convicted two pakistanis of spying for 
their government one was sentenced to 16 years in prison the 
other to 18 years 
the most powerful antigovernment forces are based in pakistan 
which supports their fight 
the afghan news agency mouthpiece of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance based in pakistan today quoted a guerrilla commander 
identified as fazli haq muhajid as saying the insurgents had broken 
jalalabads stiff southern defenses 
albunyan news service linked to the guerrillas fundamentalist 
ittehadiislami party said battles raged around the headquarters 
of the afghan armys 81st brigade south of the city 
however there were no immediate reports of casualties and no 
independent confirmation 
the diplomats in kabul speaking on condition of anonymity gave 
no details in reporting the highway from kabul to jalalabad may be 
open again however they said a convoy of about 65 trucks with 
weapons and ammunition left today for jalalabad 
the city where an estimated 100000 people now live was the 
guerrillas first major objective since soviet troops withdrew from 
afghanistan two months ago they had intervened nine years before 
in support of marxist rulers 
the citys capture would be a major morale boost for the 
guerrillas who earlier predicted that the countrys government 
would quickly collapse without the red armys help 
in other fighting today government troops battled for the fifth 
day to dislodge guerrillas who had cut the salang highway running 
north from kabul to the soviet union the blockade has prevented 
hundreds of trucks carrying food and fuel from reaching the capital 
the guerrilla reports also said there was heavy fighting near 
khost another eastern garrison town about 78 miles south of 
jalalabad they claimed guerrillas killed or wounded 350 government 
troops and captured five tanks two armored personnel carriers and 
some heavy weapons over the weekend 
those reports were also impossible to confirm

the supreme court in a case involving a 
notorious mexican drugsmuggling operation today agreed to decide 
whether us law enforcement agents need a warrant before searching 
on foreign soil someone who is not an american citizen 
the court said it will hear bush administration arguments that 
us agents did not violate the constitution when without a 
warrant they searched the home of a suspected mexican drug 
smuggler 
rene verdugo urquidez was convicted in california last year of 
taking part in the 1985 kidnapping torture and murder of drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena and his pilot 
alfredo zavala avelar 
verdugo identified as a top lieutenant to mexican drug kingpin 
rafael caro quintero is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life 
he is not eligible for parole for 59 years when he would be 96 
verdugos conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue 
in the case the supreme court acted on today his appeal centered 
on a separate drugsmuggling conviction 
in other cases acted on the court 
agreed to decide whether states may tax television evangelists 
sales of religious books tapes and other merchandise the justices 
said they will review rulings that forced the louisianabased jimmy 
swaggart ministries to pay california 183000 in back taxes and 
interest for the years 1974 through 1981 
refused to bar the federal government from requiring certain 
peacetime training for any states national guard troops without 
first getting the governors consent the justices left intact a 
1986 federal law prohibiting governors from withholding permission 
for such training missions the law had been challenged by 
massachusetts officials 
asked the bush administration for its view on whether us 
banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after 
foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts the court 
invited justice department lawyers to comment on rulings that 
required citibank to pay depositors 
at issue in the verdugo case is whether the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals properly suppressed evidence obtained by the dea 
in its search of verdugos mexicali mexico home in 1988 
verdugo was arrested by mexican police in 1986 and was turned 
over to us authorities in california 
while he was awaiting trial the dea got permission from mexican 
authorities to search the home the agents seized a tally sheet 
they said shows the quantities of marijuana smuggled into the 
united states by verdugo 
a federal judge in california ruled that the evidence is 
inadmissible because the us agents failed to obtain a warrant in 
a us court the judge also said the search was unreasonable 
because it was too general occurred after midnight and the dea 
failed to leave an inventory in verdugos home of the evidence 
seized 
the 9th circuit court upheld the judges ruling 
the appeals court said the agents had a legitimate goal and 
praised them for aggressive and laudable pursuit of drug 
smugglers 
but the appeals court said the agents are not free to ignore the 
constitutions fourth amendment which generally requires a court 
warrant before any government search of a home is conducted 
while verdugo is a foreign citizen who lived outside the united 
states he is being prosecuted for alleged violations of united 
states law in a united states court the appeals court said we 
can discern no conceivable reason why he should be denied the 
protection of the fourth amendment 
the appeals court acknowledged that a search warrant issued by a 
judge in this country has no legal authority in mexico 
nonetheless the appeals court said we cannot relieve the 
government from its obligation to obtain a search warrant simply 
because the place to be searched is outside this country 
a search warrant issued by a judge in the united states 
demonstrates that an impartial magistrate believed there was 
probable cause to conduct the search the appeals court said 
justice department lawyers said the dea agents received 
assurances from mexican government officials that the search was 
lawful there without a warrant 
the governments appeal said the 9th circuit court ruling could 
have serious consequences for us law enforcement efforts on 
foreign soil 
the dea has offices in 45 nations and last year helped in 
investigations that led to 1200 arrests of suspected drug 
smugglers in foreign countries 
the case is us vs verdugourquidez 881353

jim wright 
that wrights friend and business partner fort worth texas 
real estate developer and investor george mallick improperly 
provided 145000 worth of gifts over a 10year period the 
committee found that mallick had a direct interest in legislation 
before the congress making it a violation of house rules for 
wright to accept more than 100 in gifts in a calendar year 
that wright failed to report the benefits he received from 
mallick as gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms the 
items deemed gifts by the ethics committee included free 
housing from 1979 through 1984 in fort worth valued at 31698 
cutrate housing from 1985 through 1988 valued at 21790 an 
18000ayear salary paid to wrights wife betty from 1981

that wright had an overall scheme to evade house limits on 
outside earned income by in seven instances selling bulk 
quantities of his book reflections of a public man to groups to 
which he had delivered speeches the panel said that action in 
effect converted money that should have been speaking fees 
limited under house rules into book royalties which are not 
under the limits in an eighth instance the panel said wright 
received an undisclosed gift because books paid for by a private 
individual were not delivered 
of the 116 total allegations of rules violations originally 
raised by the committees outside counsel chicago attorney richard

presidentelect janez drnovsek said 
today the spread of democracy in this communist nation cannot be 
stopped and suggested the country could join a west european trade 
organization within five years 
drnovsek a 38yearold economist elected in yugoslavias first 
westernstyle election said a suggestion yugoslavia join the 
european economic community was not realistic now the call 
came from the official communist youth union last week 
but he said he could envisage membership in the european free 
trade association whose members are austria finland iceland 
norway sweden and switzerland 
yugoslavia could adapt its terms of trade to those of the 
sixnation grouping over a fiveyear period said drnovsek 
in a 90minute meeting with reporters drnovsek took a largely 
conciliatory but antiserbian stance when answering questions about 
how to solve ethnic tensions and an economic and political crisis 
serbia under its communist leader slobodan milosevic wants to 
maintain a centralized oneparty system measures it says will 
bring down the 400 percent inflation and a 21 billion foreign debt 
in contrast drnovsek stressed that the concentration of 
economic power should not be confused with political 
centralization 
he also spoke out against nationalist tendenices 
complicating the situation in the serbian province of kosovo where 
riots killed at least 24 people last month 
drnovsek said his direct election as slovenias representative 
to the ninemember collective presidency shows democratization 
has begun and will not stop 
the spread of democracy may stop for a short while in one 
place or another but it cannot be halted altogether he 
emphasized 
i am convinced that very soon we will arrive at a more liberal 
development in yugoslavia anything else is unacceptable and could 
have tragic consequences 
yugoslavia hopes new liberal laws will encourage foreign 
investment but drnovsek said the country will continue trying to 
reschedule or write off debt repayments he blamed the us budget 
deficit for high interest rates that he said complicate repayments 
drnovsek and the new representative from yugoslavias smallest 
republic montenegro were the only people directly elected to the 
collective presidency in westernstyle elections 
in serbia and croatia representatives were named by the party 
and approved in rubberstamp legislatures 
the countrys other two republics bosniaherzegovina and 
macedonia still are considering how to elect their 
representatives who sit for five years 
drnovsek will serve one year as president

for only the second time in its history the 
supreme court today permanently barred someone from appealing to it 
as a pauper after ruling that he failed to prove he cannot afford 
the filing fees 
the justices by a 63 vote ruled that curtis wrenn of fort 
drum ny may never again submit a socalled paupers petition 
unless he can show his financial circumstances have changed 
significantly for the worse 
unless granted pauper status anyone who appeals to the high 
court must pay 200 in filing fees plus significant printing costs 
the court in a fourpage unsigned opinion noted that wrenn 
has filed 22 appeals to the court since 1986 and the court has 
denied him paupers status 19 times one one occasion wrenn paid 
the 200 fee 
wrenn who is black and works in the armys wilcox medical 
clinic said he was a victim of racial discrimination by the 
toledo ohio mental health center and the ohio mental health 
department 
wrenn said ohio officials first refused to hire him as an 
assistant programs superintendent in 1978 later he was hired but 
said he then was fired in 1980 because of racial bias 
in legal papers accompanying his appeal to the supreme court 
wrenn said his yearly salary is 27700 and he is 60000 in debt 
the court once before issued a similar previous opinion on feb 
21 denying pauper status to a man who had appealed to the justices 
73 times since 1971 
the justices said today they have a responsibility to allocate 
the courts limited resources in the interest of justice for all 
we do not think justice is served if the court continues to 
process wrenns requests to proceed as a pauper when his 
financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a 
previous filing the court said 
in a dissenting opinion justice john paul stevens said the 
court was wasting more time by preparing and enforcing the order 
resticting wrenns ability to appeal than would be consumed by 
the routine denial of frivolous appeals 
also dissenting were justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall they repeated past concerns that denying pauper status 
could be a dangerous precedent that cuts off worthy appeals 
the court receives some 2300 appeals a year by people who say 
they are too poor to afford the filing fees 
the cases are wrenn vs benson 886494 and wrenn vs 
department of mental health 886497

the khmer rouge commemorated today as 
the 14th anniversary of the date it took power in cambodia and the 
communist guerrilla group also pledged to keep fighting vietnamese 
invaders who later ousted it 
fears of a return to power by the khmer rouge which killed 
hundreds of thousands of people during its threeyear reign have 
heightened since vietnam announced this month it will pull out its 
50000 troops by sept 30 
today our entire people put on their best clothes and 
joyously celebrate their national day with the firm conviction 
that their struggle will score final victory against the vietnamese 
enemy aggressors khmer rouge radio said sunday the text of its 
broadcast was available today in bangkok 
vietnam ousted the khmer rouge when it invaded in late 1978 and 
installed a new communist government in phnom penh 
that government also marked the anniversary but not as a khmer 
rouge triumph instead phnom penh radio called the day a 
historic victory over the us imperialists and their lackeys 
in a broadcast monitored in bangkok 
it went on to say that khmer rouge leaders betrayed this victory 
and plunged the cambodian motherland into a deep ravine of deat 
the khmer rouge entered the capital phnom penh on april 17 
1975 toppling the usbacked government of lon nol today the 
united states and china are key supporters of the cambodia 
resistance which unites the khmer rouge with two noncommunist 
factions 
after entering the capital the khmer rouge dragged many 
residents to labor camps in the countryside it eventually killed 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians in its attempt to create a 
model agrarian society 
in its broadcast the khmer rouge station said vietnam should 
bow to guerrilla demands and allow the united nations to monitor 
its withdrawal the guerrillas have said the vietnameseinstalled 
government should step down 
the station said hanois pledge to remove its troops was merely 
an attempt to deflect international criticism it claimed vietnam 
is hiding thousands of troops in cambodia by dressing them as 
cambodian soldiers 
nguyen van linh chief of vietnams ruling communist party will 
go to moscow on thursday for talks with president mikhail s 
gorbachev on vietnams pullout from cambodia japans kyodo news

in using his wifes career as a line of 
defense against ethics charges house speaker jim wright has struck 
a sensitive chord among his colleagues who fear they could be 
subject to the same scrutiny 
every member who has a spouse that works is concerned says 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
a major charge leveled by the 12member house ethics committee 
against wright is that he accepted improper gifts from a business 
partner with interest in legislation according to the committees 
report released today 
the panel viewed the 18000 a year that wrights wife betty 
received from a fort worth business partner george mallick not as 
a salary for parttime investment advice but as a gift house rules 
prohibit members from accepting more than 100 a year in gifts from 
anyone with direct interest in legislation 
in a counterattack last week wright described his wifes 
lengthy career including her job with the house public works 
committee and cited the scores of other congressional spouses who 
work 
some members wives are attorneys some of them sell real 
estate some of them teach school some of them work for local 
school boards and local units of government some work for the 
executive branch of government some work for other members of 
congress said the texas democrat 
wright raised the specter of congress examining spouses work 
and the concern among members was evident 
i think that saying any money to a spouse is a gift as a 
woman that offends me most spouses i know that work work said 
rep pat schroeder dcolo i do think that spouses income is 
something that we need a very clear guideline but i am offended 
that anybody would make the supposition that any income to a spouse 
is a gift 
mary regula wife of rep ralph regula rohio and president of 
the congressional club made up of house and senate spouses 
wondered whether it was possible to set definite rules 
how could you limit the life of another persons career 
regula said in a telephone interview from her home in ohio how 
could you even put together a bill without getting into 
constitutional rights 
the congressional club has not conducted an official survey on 
whether member spouses work but regula estimates about 70 percent 
are employed either parttime or fulltime 
careers cover a wide range of fields and regula wondered why the 
emphasis was on wives rather than husbands 
pat schroeders husband practices law he has a lucrative 
practice no one has checked his client list regula said lynn 
martin is married to a federal judge and congress votes on their 
salaries 
a random check of other members found that stewart boxer 
husband of rep barbara boxer dcalif is a partner in an oakland 
law firm that has handled a number of workers compensation cases 
deborah dingell wife of rep john dingell dmich works for 
general motors pamela kostmayer wife of rep peter kostmayer 
dpa runs a public relations firm 
washington also is filled with high profile twocareer couples 
sen bob dole rkan serves as minority leader while his wife 
elizabeth is the labor secretary lynn cheney is the head of the 
national endowment for the humanities while her husband dick a 
former congressman from wyoming is defense secretary 
back in 1977 rep david obey dwis the primary author of a 
set of rules revisions said examination of spouses income is a 
responsibility of the irs not congress 
wright alluded to that this past week in defending his wifes 
career 
a far as i know it never has been suggested nor contemplated 
in the rules that the congress would seek to question the 
appropriateness of a wifes or a spouses engagement in personal or 
private professional business wright said 
betty wright served as an administrative assistant on the house 
public works committee in the early 1970s and was paid 23884 
annually putting her 26th on the salary list of the 87member 
committee staff 
she then went to work for mallick providing investment advice 
but according to the house ethics committees outside counsel mrs 
wright only worked a total of 12 days from 1980 to 1984 
mallick has said he can find a number of witnesses who will 
attest that mrs wright worked for the money she was paid 
wright is not the first member of congress to have his spouses 
career raise questions sen mark hatfield rore came under 
close scrutiny when his wife antoinette received 55000 from 
greek businessman basil tsakos 
hatfield said the payments were for his wifes real estate 
services and had nothing to do with his support of a transafrica 
oil pipeline promoted by tsakos

the house ethics committee charged today that 
house speaker jim wright violated official rules of conduct 69 
times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged gifts and 
by skirting rules on speaking fees through bulk book sales 
the committee six democrats and six republicans unanimously 
approved the statement of alleged violations announced the 
chairman rep julian dixon dcalif 
less than two hours later wright defended himself in a speech 
to a washington labor meeting and asked for a speedy end to the 
matter 
i know in my heart i have not violated any of the rules of 
that institution wright said 
i have today requested very urgently that i be given the 
privilege of coming this afternoon today right now or tomorrow or 
the next day surely within a week to confront them to confront 
the allegations headon facetoface 
the charges divided into five counts and an accompanying 
report by richard phelan the attorney who conducted the 
committees investigation could jeopardize wrights future as 
speaker 
the statement represents a determination by the committee that 
in 69 instances there is reason to believe that rep wright 
violated the code of official conduct and other house rules which 
apply to him as a member of congress dixon said 
he emphasized that the committees action is similar to an 
indictment based on a comparatively low standard of proof and 
not a conviction 
the speaker of the house has not been found guilty of any 
violations but from a review of the evidence the committee has 
found a reason to believe violations may have occurred dixon 
said 
we have not reached any final conclusions on the matters that 
are still under investigation he said telling reporters that 
for further proceedings the standard will be clear and 
convincing evidence 
the committee under its rules will next allow wright to 
respond within 21 days 
after that the committee has 30 days to decide whether to hold 
a disciplinary hearing on whether wright indeed violated rules 
and what punishment if any it should recommend to the full house 
the panel cleared wright of several accusations filed against 
him last year when the inquiry began including alleged use of a 
staff member to write the book improper use of campaign funds and 
improper lobbying on behalf of constituents 
the most controversial lobbying effort by wright was the 
pressure he put on federal regulators to go easy on texas thrift 
institutions that were failing due to a weak economy although the 
speaker may have been intemperate in his efforts the committee 
was not persuaded dixon said 
in all phelan found 116 alleged violations and the committee 
dismissed 47 of those 
the committee will continue its investigation into an allegation 
surrounding the investent in an oil and gas well by wright and 
mallick the committee has issued subpoenas in that case he said 
i am prepared to appear as early as monday afternoon but 
certainly the committee should be able to schedule a hearing within 
seven days wright said in a letter sent to the committee sunday 
night 
i continue to believe that i have not violated any house 
rules and i am absolutely certain that i have never knowingly or 
intentionally done so wright said in the letter 
but dixon told a news confrence the committee had just received 
the letter and did not know when wright would appear 
as for the 69 charges the committee determined that apparent 
gifts from wrights business partner george mallick appeared to 
be improper because the fort worth texas developer had a direct 
interest in legislation and had not been properly reported to the 
house 
the nature and extent of the apparent gifts from mr mallick 
indicates that rep wright did not exercise reasonable care to 
avoid even the appearance of impropriety which is the hallmark of 
the house gift rule dixon said 
the committee said the 145000 in gifts included free or 
cutrate use of a condominium in fort worth an 18000ayear 
salary paid wrights wife betty and free use of a car 
dixon said the committee also charged that wright skirted house 
limits on speaking fees through the sales of his book 
reflections of a public man 
in the committees view seven bulk sales of the rep wrights 
book demonstrated an overall scheme to evade the house outside 
earned income limit because speaking honorarium payments were 
recharacterized as royalties 
the house will ultimately be wrights jury and wright last week 
launched an effort to blunt the impact of the charges and keep his 
majority democrats in line 
following news reports that the committee had concluded it had 
reason to believe that wright violated house rules in dozens of 
instances wright on thursday gathered his top lieutenants for a 
halfhourlong statement in the capitol 
the speaker gave his version of the main charges against him 
and with quivering voice vowed to fight for his reputation and that 
of his wife he appealed to other house members with working 
spouses by strongly stating that mrs wright earned the salary she 
was paid by mallightco the partnership the wrights had with 
mallick and his wife 
wrights second in command majority leader thomas foley 
dwash went on television sunday and urged people not to judge 
too quickly 
asked if wright would be crippled politically even if he beat 
the charges foley said no i dont believe that and i think we 
have to be terribly careful that we dont let accusation bring 
about its own taint of guilt 
foley appeared on abcs this week with david brinkley 
opposite rep vin weber rminn a close ally and adviser to the 
man who first brought the charges against wright rep newt 
gingrich rga 
weber while saying that judgment should be withheld said he 
believed the charges against wright were much more substantive 
than just some technical violations that any member might have 
inadvertently committed 
the investigation of wright was triggered by a complaint filed 
with the ethics committee last may by gingrich a persistent critic 
of democratic leadership in the house and of wright in particular 
who is now the house minority whip 
although common cause a good government group was in his 
corner gingrichs maneuver at first was seen mostly as a political 
tactic many expected it would quickly be brushed away by the 
panel perhaps even before last julys democratic national 
convention 
however the committee undertook a sweeping investigation led by 
phelan the chicago attorney it hired for the case a democrat 
phelan dispelled gop suspicions that he would go easy on the 
speaker 
his probe which lasted through the winter and cost an estimated 
15 million presented the committee with a voluminous report on 
the speakers dealings 
even if the committee votes against sanctioning the speaker gop 
leaders have promised to keep wright a political issue 
house minority leader bob michel rill has said he would use 
house rules to force a vote on the committee report republicans 
would try to use that to portray themselves as anticorruption and 
anyone who votes against them as corrupt

does the big chill leave you cold tired of 
hearing oldies older than you on tv commercials three 
exasperated young upstarts say right on 
the reminder that the calendar says 1989 comes from the national 
association for the advancement of time three guys in their 20s 
who say we want to end the 60s in your lifetime 
lets make nostalgia a thing of the past say these fellows 
whove had enough of the baby boom that huge postworld war ii 
generation whose sheer bulk spurred creation of the retail market 
for teenagers divided the nation over vietnam and now is taking 
up space discovering adulthood marriage careers and babies 
destined to grow up hearing stories about woodstock 
antinostalgia crusader eugene dillenburg dismisses baby boomers 
as 50 million teenagers who never grew up 
but they wont go away 
theres so many of them if they want to live in their past 
thats fine but theyre forcing me to live in their past 
gripes dillenburg 29 of chicago he founded naftat with friends 
bruce elliott of los angeles and john keeney of new york city 
heres a sampling from dillenburgs long list of complaints 
movies the big chill 
theater the revival of hair 
television the wonder years 
print media bob greenes nationally syndicated chicago tribune 
column 
books volumes on the riotous 1968 democratic national 
convention in chicago as insignificant an event as ever happened 
in this country 
naftat is part of a natural antiboomer backlash according to 
northwestern university sociologist bernard beck who says any 
cultural statement that lasts too long seems to generate 
resentment 
by failing to step aside the way its supposed to the 
babyboom generation has thrown out of kilter the ordinary 
succession of generations beck said 
there always has been disdain toward this generation because 
theres so many of us in it observed greene singled out by 
dillenburg as a sort of archboomer greene defends nostalgia 
saying readers of all ages respond to his columns about the past 
but when dillenburg and elliott got together in 1987 and 
discovered their mutual exasperation with oldies radio they 
decided it was time to get the monkees off their backs 
preserve what is worth remembering from the 60s the beatles 
bob dylan and the civil rights movement for example and scrap 
the rest dillenburg suggests 
naftat cranks out leaflets calling on sympathizers to fight 
for the present and annoy a lot of selfimportant exhippies in the 
process 
todays young people may not go in for demonstrations but they 
care about apartheid and other issues he said 
naftats feelings about the baby boomers are not altogether 
different from the reaction the postwar generation got from their 
silent majority elders 20 years ago beck said 
many parents waited through the depression and world war ii to 
have children and their offspring grew up being told by everyone 
around them and believing that they were the most important 
thing in the world he said 
they are endlessly fascinated with their own lives he said 
and their vast numbers make every setback central cultural 
business 
the message babyboomers send to others dillenburg said is 
you missed the 60s your life is meaningless your life is 
irrelevant because it came after mine

a radio bomb confiscated from 
suspected palestinian terrorists exploded at federal police 
headquarters today as experts tried to defuse it killing one 
officer and critically injuring another 
a similar bomb disguised as a radio is believed to have caused 
the explosion that blew pan am flight 103 out of the sky dec 21 
over lockerbie scotland killing 270 people 
the federal police bureau initially reported two officers were 
critically injured in todays explosion bundeskriminalamt 
spokesman arno falk said later that one of policemen had died 
brunhilde spiesmohr a spokeswoman for the federal police 
bureau or bundeskriminalamt said in wiesbaden 
during investigation of a suspicious device suspected of 
containing explosives a detonation occurred 
the material that exploded was a device obtained during 
investigation of palestinian terrorists the explosives were 
hidden in a radio receiver she added 
the blast occurred in a basement room of the federal police 
headquarters ms spiesmohr said 
part of the bundeskriminalamt building was evacuated after the 
explosion while bomb disposal experts disarmed a second device she 
said 
an identical radiobomb containing plastic explosives and an air 
pressuresensitive detonator was seized during an oct 26 raid on 
an apartment used by suspected paletinian terrorists in the city of 
neuss 
it was not immediately clear where the bomb that exploded in the 
federal police headquarters came from 
one unofficial source who did not want to be identified said it 
was the same bomb confiscated in the neuss raid but that device 
has been handled repeatedly by west german and foreign 
investigators in their probe of the pan am crash and was presumed 
disarmed long ago

lech walesa still gives the impression 
that he could be spending his days repairing electric carts at the 
lenin shipyard 
instead he is usually to be found negotiating with the interior 
minister meeting with foreign heads of state and leading the 
solidarity movement that has changed his countrys course 
the story of walesa scaling the shipyard fence to inspire 
strikers in forming the east blocs first independent trade union 
is often repeated but should not lose its significance poland has 
not been the same since that day in august 1980 
walesa 45 has never lost the authenticity with which he drew 
millions to his vision of workers solidarity 
on monday he chalked up his latest victory leading solidarity 
through seven years of repressions to regain its legal status just 
as he vowed to do 
the winner of the nobel peace prize a man of deep roman 
catholic faith intended to travel to rome on wednesday to thank 
polishborn pope john paul ii for the churchs role in helping to 
bring about the agreement with authorities 
walesa wears a suit and tie these days but always with a 
picture of the black madonna of czestochowa icon and a solidarity 
pin on his lapel he usually also sports a us vicepresidential 
tie pin given him by george bush in 1987 
but he remains a modest person often answering his home 
telephone himself and riding the early morning train from gdansk on 
his frequent trips to warsaw for highlevel meetings with polish 
authorities 
when in warsaw he stays in a small cloister cell at the church 
episcopate after a long night of negotiations he sometimes 
travels the four hours back to gdansk to sleep in his own bed 
complaining of a bad cold he decided to stay in gdansk on 
monday when a court in warsaw formally registered solidarity again 
as a legal trade union independent of the government 
walesas autocratic leadership style bothers some in the union 
and although he is a spellbinding orator his statements to 
reporters can sometimes be as cryptic as an oracles pronouncements 
a natural politician who goes with his gut walesa ignored 
warnings that he was giving in too easily in september when he put 
his reputation with workers on the line by ending a series of 
strikes nationwide in return for a vague promise of talks from the 
government 
although some youthful militants chanted down with walesa 
in the months that followed he never seemed to doubt the decision 
many solidarity activists point to walesas convincing showing 
in a nationwide tv debate in october as the turning point that 
brought about the talks which won solidarity its legalization 
walesa apologized for his poor performance 
much has changed in poland during the eight months since the 
august strikes but not walesa 
he marked his conclusion of an historic accord with the 
government on april 5 not at the celebratory cocktail party at a 
government palace but by eating dinner in a nearly deserted hotel 
dining room with an aide 
i am exhausted and i dont like eating standing he said

though a sizable minority of adults oppose 
abortions americans overwhelmingly believe that banning them would 
do little to curtail them a media generalassociated press survey 
has found 
with the us supreme court poised to reconsider the issue next 
week the national poll found support for legal abortion ranging 
from 50 percent to 65 percent of the 1108 adults polled depending 
on the question posed 
fiftythree percent for example were in favor of the courts 
1973 ruling legalizing abortion in the first three months of 
pregnancy and if the court reversed itself and let each state make 
its own abortion law 57 percent would want abortion legal in their 
state 
moreover large majorities said outlawing abortion would fail to 
prevent it from occurring an argument used by those who argue 
many women would have unsafe illegal abortions if the operation 
were banned 
the poll asked if abortion were illegal in your state do you 
think that would stop most women there who want abortions from 
having them or would most of them go to another state where it was 
legal eightyseven percent said the women would go to another 
state 
the survey next asked if making abortions illegal nationwide 
would stop most women from having them or if those women would 
have illegal abortions or go to a country where abortion is legal 
seventythree percent said most women would find a way to have 
abortions 
the survey nonetheless found its closest split on the question 
of a constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal except in 
cases of rape incest or to save the life of the mother fifty 
percent were opposed and 44 percent in favor a division within the 
polls margin of error 
no amendment with those provisions is before congress but they 
are the terms president bush has said he would support 
because the wording of questions on such a sensitive issue can 
affect the results the poll posed the matter in a variety of ways 
the findings on basic attitudes toward abortion were similar in 
other recent surveys 
one question asked should abortion be legal as it is now 
legal only in such cases as rape incest or to save the life of 
the mother or should it not be permitted at all fifty percent 
said legal as now 39 percent said legal in some cases 7 percent 
wanted it banned and the rest were unsure 
cbs news and the new york times have asked the same poll 
question since 1985 tracking a slight increase in support for 
current law depending on the questions though other polls have 
found slight declines in support for legal abortion and others 
still have found no change 
in another question outside the legal context the poll asked 
if a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it 
should she be allowed to have an abortion or not sixtyfive 
percent said yes 25 percent said no and the remaining 10 percent 
had no opinion the cbstimes poll has found a similar response to 
that same question 
opposition to abortion was greatest among older less wealthy 
and less educated respondents and republicans and conservatives 
there was no significant division in opinion between men and women 
the federal centers for disease control say 13 million 
abortions are performed annually in the united states making it 
one of the nations most common surgical procedures next week the 
supreme court is to hear a case that could enable it to review its 
1973 ruling legalizing abortion with a decision expected later in 
the year 
on related issues the media generalap survey found 
widespread opposition to protests by operation rescue the 
antiabortion group whose members have been blocking entrances to 
abortion clinics around the country sixtyseven percent opposed 
those demonstrations 22 percent supported them and 11 percent were 
unsure 
narrow opposition to the use of federal funds to help poor 
women with their medical bills if they want an abortion fortynine 
percent opposed such spending 41 percent were in favor the rest 
did not answer 
fiftyone percent support for legalization in the united 
states of ru486 a drug developed in france that stops very early 
pregnancy by preventing the fertilized egg from being implanted in 
the uterine wall 
antiabortion groups call the drug an abortion pill and threaten 
boycotts against any drug company that produces it supporters call 
it simpler and safer than surgical abortion in the poll 51 
percent said it should be legal here 24 percent said not and 25 
percent were unsure

based on telephone interviews march 6 to 15 with 1108 adults in 
the continental united states phone numbers were selected randomly 
and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most 
recent birthday 
the results were weighted to adjust for variations in the 
sample the poll has a 3point margin of error meaning that if 
every adult american were asked the same questions the results 
theoretically would be the within 3 points of the polls results 
19 times out of 20 the error margin is larger for subgroups 
there are other sources of potential error in polls including 
the wording and order of questions these are the questions and 
responses in this poll because of rounding sums may not total 100

here at a glance is a rundown of mondays 
major actions by the supreme court 
 
drug search warrant 
 
the court in a case involving a notorious mexican 
drugsmuggling operation agreed to decide whether us law 
enforcement agents need a warrant before searching on foreign soil 
someone who is not an american citizen 
the court said it will hear bush administration arguments that 
us agents did not violate the constitution when without a 
warrant they searched the home of a suspected mexican drug 
smuggler 
rene verdugo urquidez was convicted in california last year of 
taking part in the 1985 kidnapping torture and murder of drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena and his pilot 
alfredo zavala avelar 
verdugos conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue 
in the case the supreme court acted on monday his appeal centered 
on a separate drugsmuggling conviction 
the case is us vs verdugourquidez 881353 
 
national guard governors 
 
the court refused to bar the federal government from requiring 
certain peacetime training for any states national guard troops 
without first getting the governors consent 
the justices without comment left intact a 1986 federal law 
prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training 
missions 
the law had been challenged by massachusetts officials 
congress in 1986 passed the socalled montgomery amendment after 
several governors voiced opposition to the reagan administrations 
central american policy and said they would withhold their consent 
to national guard training missions in that region 
the case is massachusetts vs department of defense 881223 
 
evangelists taxes 
 
the court agreed to decide whether states may tax television 
evangelists sales of religious books tapes and other merchandise 
the justices said they will review rulings that forced the 
louisianabased jimmy swaggart ministries to pay california 
183000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981 
lawyers for swaggarts organization argue that the california 
tax as applied violates religious freedom 
the case is jimmy swaggart ministries vs board of equalization 
881374 
 
murder confession 
 
the court agreed to consider reinstating the murder conviction 
of a new york city man who confessed to killing his former 
girlfriend after police illegally arrested him at his home 
the court said it will review a ruling that threw out bernard 
harris conviction because his confession was used as evidence 
against him 
the ruling is being appealed by bronx prosecutors 
the new york state court of appeals last october ruled that 
harris is entitled to a new trial on charges stemming from the 
stabbing death of thelma staton 
the case is new york vs harris 881000 
 
pauper appeal 
 
for only the second time in its history the supreme court 
permanently barred someone from appealing to it as a pauper after 
ruling that he failed to prove he cannot afford the filing fees 
the justices by a 63 vote ruled that curtis wrenn of fort 
drum ny may never again submit a socalled paupers petition 
unless he can show his financial circumstances have changed 
significantly for the worse 
unless granted pauper status anyone who appeals to the high 
court must pay 200 in filing fees plus significant printing costs 
the court in a fourpage unsigned opinion noted that wrenn 
has filed 22 appeals to the court since 1986 and the court has 
denied him paupers status 19 times one one occasion wrenn paid 
the 200 fee 
the cases are wrenn vs benson 886494 and wrenn vs 
department of mental health 886497

a gatekeeper said today he refused 
police orders to open an outer gate and allow thousands of late 
arrivals to pour into a soccer stadium where 94 fans were crushed 
to death fans and officials said police opened the barrier 
south yorkshire police who were in charge of saturdays club 
semifinal at hillsborough stadium came under mounting attack as 
liverpool ordered a week of mourning for victims who came to watch 
the citys team play play nottingham forest 
fans and officials said officers responded inadequately and far 
too slowly when spectators were crushed against a steel antiriot 
fence in a standingroomonly area 
gatekeeper jack stone told the yorkshire post he refused police 
orders to open a 16footwide outer gate survivors said about 
4000 fans outside were pushing at turnstiles 
stone would not confirm survivors reports that police officers 
opened the concertina gate but he told the newspaper you know 
as well as anyone whose fault it was 
liverpool fan stephen mitton told british broadcasting corp 
television the steward put his hand on the gate and said dont 
open it the police said open the gate theres going to be a 
crush then two police officers opened the gate 
new arrivals poured in pressing those inside against the 
10foot fence mounted police herded them into the overcrowded 
center terrace some fans said today 
the crush was so great mitton said that fans fell on the floor 
and people climbed over them all the police were doing was 
standing up saying get back get back there was already people 
dead then i climbed on them to get over the fence 
south yorkshires chief constable peter wright said saturday a 
senior officer decided to open the gates to save peoples lives 
and to relieve the crush outside 
he said he was not aware of any connection between the gate 
being opened and the surge on the standing section where many 
victims died 
one of those being trapped in the front of the terrace stephen 
hendry 19 said people were screaming at the police to open the 
gate at the front of the terrace and three fans managed to climb 
over the fence but no sooner had they got out than one of them was 
thrown back over by a copper 
paul middup a police federation representative said today the 
growing public criticism of police actions was grossly unfair 
they were faced with a situation for which no amount of 
training could prepare them he said 
in parliament today home secretary douglas hurd announced an 
independent inquiry to determine the cause of what prime minister 
margaret thatcher called a disaster of immense proportions 
hurd said major soccer clubs may be told to replace 
standingroom terraces with seats as lawmakers and sports 
officials are demanding 
we owe a duty to these passionate supporters of football 
soccer to examine urgently and thoroughly the causes and 
background and to do all in our power to prevent such a thing 
happening again hurd said we have to set our sights high and 
find a better way for british football

a helicopter plucked a drug kingpin from a prison 
yard today but crashed as it took off seriously injuring the 
inmate and pilot officials said 
the helicopter went down about 10 am after a propeller caught 
concertina wire atop the wall at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center authorities said 
benjamin barry kramer a champion powerboat racer serving a 
life sentence and the pilot whose identity wasnt immediately 
known were taken to jackson memorial hospital after the escape 
attempt said us marshal daniel horgan 
prison guards immediately extracted kramer and the pilot out 
of the wreckage and administered first aid they were hurt quite 
seriously horgan said

initial reports indicated the pilot suffered head neck and back 
injuries and kramer 34 fractured his left ankle authorities said 
mcc is the major prison for drug traffickers and others arrested 
for federal crimes in south florida 
among some 1000 inmates are miami policemen convicted of 
running a drug ripoff ring and others convicted of largescale 
cocaine and marijuana trafficking or awaiting trial

aboard he said 
it appears he was ready clark said according to 
witnesses he ran to the helicopter and jumped on as soon as it 
swooped down 
the pilot was holding an identification for charles clayton 
sterns but the warden said authorities suspect the id may have 
been for kramer

running a continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life 
without parole under the drug kingpin law horgan said kramer 
was brought here in december in connection with federal charges in

president bush today announced new us 
economic help for poland praising the warsaw governments move 
toward reform and saying we can and must answer this call to 
freedom 
bush traveled to the polishamerican city of hamtramck which is 
surrounded by detroit to extoll the communist governments 
agreement to reinstate the solidarity trade union movement and to 
hold the first free elections in poland since before world war ii 
while the president announced a series of steps aimed at helping 
poland restore its battered economy bush said continued aid would 
depend on consistent moves by the communist government toward 
reform 
we will not act unconditionally he said we will not 
offer aid without requiring sound economic practices in return we 
must remember that poland is still a member of the warsaw pact we 
must take no steps that compromise the security of the west 
the concessions could open the way for a flow to poland of up to 
1 billion in new loans loan rescheduling and trade and investment 
relief according to administration and international monetary 
sources 
later in a polish restaurant in hamtramck where bush had lunch 
he was asked by reporters whether his package was intended to send 
a message to the soviet union its a good strong meessage and i 
hope it was heard there and in eastern europe bush said 
administration officials who declined to be identified also 
said bush may travel to poland in july immediately before or after 
the sevennation economic summit in paris 
the trip would underscore us support for warsaws landmark 
april 5 steps restoring the legal status of the union solidarity 
and scheduling the first open elections in the communistrun 
country since before world war ii 
bush spoke to a crowd of several hundred people outside the 
hamtramck city hall he received rousing applause when he said that 
today this very day the free trade union solidarity was 
formally restored 
bush said the new agreements by the polish government with the 
solidarity movement that it banned in 1981 should help warsaw 
arrange new loans from multinational lending organizations such as 
the world bank and the international monetary fund 
the sources said in advance of bushs speech that could amount 
to rescheduling up to 700 million in existing loans in an effort 
to help poland make a dent in its 39 billion international debt 
bushs package also called for a lowering of tariffs on selected 
polish imports through the generalized system of preferences a 
move that requires congressional approval 
this system of preferential tariffs traditionally is used by the 
us government to assist lessdeveloped nations 
bush also announced that he will seek congressional approval for 
a program of usguaranteed loans through the overseas private 
investment corp to stimulate private investment in poland he 
also said he would propose negotiations that could lead to joint 
ventures between us and polish businesses 
sources said that some of the proposed inducements would be 
linked to future steps by poland to liberalize its markets and make 
changes in its longtroubled economy 
if polands experiment succeeds other countries may follow 
bush said while we must still differentiate among the nations of 
eastern europe poland offers two lessons for all 
first there can be no progress without significant political 
and economic liberalization he said second help from the 
west will come in concert with liberalization our friends and 
european allies share this philosophy 
the united states has never accepted the legitimacy of 
europes division bush said we accept no spheres of influence 
that deny the sovereign rights of nations 
yet the president said the winds of change are shaping a new 
europen destiny 
the congress the polishamerican community the american 
labor movement our allies and international financial 
institutions must work in concert if polish democracy is to take 
root anew and sustain itself he said we can and must answer 
this call to freedom

roman popadiuk a presidential spokesman said he was aware of 
the 1 billion figure that other administration officials had put 
on the package but that the white house would refrain from 
assigning a pricetag because there were too many variables 
the full impact of the aid package could only be realized if 
other creditor governments went along with the proposed loan 
rescheduling 
popadiuk said of the 39 billion in outstanding polish debt 
only 24 billion is owed to the us government 
he said congressional approval of the plan to give poland tariff 
relief could provide benefits ranging from 35 million to 25 
million depending on what products are selected and on how 
aggressively poland makes use of the new opportunity to export more 
goods to the united states 
this nation imported 417 million in merchandise from poland 
last year including textiles steel fish and ham and exported to 
poland 304 million in goods much of it in grain 
a fact sheet distributed by the white house said that the 
administration would work closely with solidarity in deciding which 
additional credits to grant the polish government 
the april 5 agreement called for free elections in june and for 
creation of a twohouse parliament 
the newly created 100member senate would be the eastern blocs 
first freely elected legislative chamber the government also 
promised to make 35 percent of the seats of the existing 460member 
sejm elective an elective post of president would become available 
in six years 
the government also conferred full legal status on the roman 
catholic church in poland 
bushs package further eases us economic sanctions imposed 
against poland in 1981 and 1982 following declaration of martial 
law and the outlawing of solidarity some of the original sanctions 
were lifted in 1987 after the polish government moved toward 
reconciliation with the union 
us officials reacted positively to polands steps to grant its 
citizens mor freedom 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called the polish 
movement toward new liberties a historic step and a great day 
for the polish people 
still administration officials have voiced caution 
poland has taken a step away from totalitarianism although 
democracy is far from having been achieved secretary of state 
james a baker iii said friday 
bush visited poland as vice president in september 1987 during a 
ninenation european tour

new era of liberalism 
i would even go so far as to say that george bushs idea of a 
kinder and gentler nation is a reflection of a changing popular 
mood the former white house aide to president kennedy said in an 
appearance sunday night at the university of new mexico 
schlesinger said president reagans administration succeeded 
only as it began to yield to the rising force of liberalism 
we need our own homegrown version of perestroika he said 
referring mikhail gorbachevs effort to salvage the economy of the 
soviet union but we need not despair the united states has the 
resources to be a world leader for generations to come 
he said bushs call for charitable efforts and volunteerism 
probably cannot do the job however 
we have a thousand points of light schlesinger said but

gov buddy roemer is trying to uproot 
decades of populist political tradition and restructure louisianas 
tax system in a test that may be a barometer of his political 
future 
opposing him are antitax lawmakers including former ku klux 
klan leader david duke and a tradition of making business pay the 
bulk of the bills 
roemer says the state must lighten the tax burden on business to 
create new jobs and get away from dependence on the petroleum 
industry 
an april 29 referendum is scheduled on a proposed constitutional 
amendment authorizing the legislature to make basic changes in the 
tax structure a new tax code approved by legislators during a 
special session in late february and early march will take effect 
if the amendment is approved 
the legislature convened monday for its 85day regular session 
but no major action is expected until after the election when 
lawmakers will have an idea of how much money will be available 
roemer wants a combination of personal income tax increases 
sales tax decreases and business tax breaks along with a 15 
billion improvement program for highways airports and ports to be 
funded by a net increase in gasoline taxes of about 1 cent per 
gallon 
taxes on cigarettes and wine would go up the plan also includes 
a new balancedbudget measure in the state constitution and a trust 
fund that would set aside mineral revenue should oil prices boom 
again 
the proposed changes chop at the roots of a populist tax system 
that began evolving during the 1930s now homesteads valued at 
75000 are exempt from parish property taxes businesses pay 95 
percent of property taxes and annual auto license plate fees are 3 
petroleum companies have historically footed much of the bill 
for state programs through severance taxes and leases on state land 
in the early 1980s oil and gas revenue amounted to more than 40 
percent of the total state budget and the good times rolled in 
louisiana but when prices fell and production was curtailed the 
state was thrown into one budget crisis after another the state 
now gets only 20 percent of its revenue from petroleum 
opponents claim roemers plan constitutes a 621 million tax 
increase that will guarantee nothing for the states economy 
plagued by the nations highest unemployment rate at more than 11 
percent 
a recent statewide poll by masondixon public research indicated 
that voters were about evenly split among support opposition and 
indecision 
the total state budget is about 77 billion if the tax 
revision plan passes roemer says 234 million in reductions will 
be needed to balance the budget without the plan an additional 
485 million will have to be cut from the budget 
the governor says hes too busy trying to rally public support 
for his tax plan to worry about possible political implications 
im not in this to be safe to sit at home and say well you 
know i couldnt try it because its too risky roemer said 
but rep allen bradley a supporter of the tax plan said the 
package is clearly a buddy roemer tax package and in a way it 
becomes a referendum on the governor 
on the other side is duke elected in february on an antitax 
plank 
he roemer has said it will not hurt citizens on the lower 
end of the income scale but the increases will actually begin at 
25000 said duke 
the governor counters that state income tax figures for 1987 
showed that more than 70 percent of those filing returns made less 
than 25000 
the public affairs research council a government watchdog 
group said the firstyear increase in state taxes would total 116 
million personal taxes would increase in 198990 by 171 million 
and business taxes would decline by 55 million 
by 199293 businesses would enjoy a 219 million decrease from 
current tax levels parc said personal taxes would rise to 218 
million by 199293 leaving total state tax revenues at virtually 
the same level as under the current structure parc said

lottery officials waited today for the holders of 
four tickets to step forward and claim a worldrecord jackpot of 
699 million 
holders of the tickets whether its one person a couple or a 
group will split the pot which was raised from 69 million today 
after final sales were tallied 
two people one in chicago and one elsewhere in illinois 
contacted state officials sunday to report they held winning 
tickets but lottery director sharon sharp said the tickets would 
have to be validated before the millionaires could be annointed 
officials today tentatively identified one winner as a man from 
west central illinois who planned to share the winnings with his 
two sisters from arizona he was on his way to chicago to have his 
ticket validated said lottery spokeswoman carrie worley 
for all of you who said its easier to be struck by lightning 
than to win the lotto four people were struck last night and they 
struck gold ms sharp said sunday at a news conference 
each winner would get a 1725 million share of the grand prize 
paid over 20 years said lottery spokeswoman kathy rem the total 
could rise after final sales figures are tallied she said 
the winning numbers were 3 14 32 40 46 and 54 
hopeful players from around the country and world descended on 
illinois last week buying record numbers of tickets that enabled 
lottery officials to boost the prize some rerouted flights others 
called from as far away as europe japan and south america to find 
out how to get a piece of the action 
losers said they were disappointed but took their losses in 
stride 
i just got one ticket because if youre going to win 
youll win with one said lonny taylor a systems engineer from 
chicago 
in addition to the four big winners ms sharp said saturdays 
drawing produced 1220 players who matched five of the six numbers 
to win prizes of 231650 and 73452 who will receive 7650 for 
matching four of six 
the jackpot beat the old world record of 6198 million set in 
october in california that pot was split among three winning 
tickets one bought by an individual and the others bought by 
groups of coworkers 
the previous illinois record jackpot of 40 million was won by 
chicago printer mike wittkowski in 1984 
ms sharp said sales for the week 565 million eclipsed 
totals for the week leading up to the 40 million jackpot in 1984 
she said sales on saturday reached 27000 tickets per minute 
it was a little hairy there for a while she said 
forty cents on every dollar in lotto proceeds goes to the state 
for the common school fund ms sharp said but since the amount of 
money spent on schools is determined by state budget figures the 
additional revenue from last weeks record sales will go into state 
coffers not specifically slated for education she said 
if only one person had matched the numbers the jackpot would 
have been the largest paid to a single winner 
but with four ticketholders sharing the pot the largest single 
winner in us history remains sheelah ryan of winter springs 
fla who walked away with 5516 million in the florida lottery in 
september 
floridas lotto jackpot is on the rise again to an estimated 
37 million in next saturdays drawing its second highest level 
after ms ryans winnings because nobody won this weekends 23 
million prize lottery secretary rebecca paul announced sunday 
were urging players to purchase their tickets early this week 
to avoid the possiblity of longer lines friday and saturday said 
mrs paul who helped illinois set up its lottery before she moved 
south to florida

the inquest jury that exonerated british soldiers 
in the killing of three alleged irish terrorists in gibraltar was 
acting on incomplete evidence and sometimes conflicting testimony 
amnesty international says 
in a report published tuesday that is likely to refuel the 
controversy over the killings on march 6 1988 the human rights 
movement renewed its demand for a judicial inquiry saying the 
inquest failed to allay suspicions of an official policy of 
deliberate planned killings of suspected members of armed 
opposition groups 
it said the inquest was conducted properly but believed that 
the verdict although reached fairly was based on evidence which 
from the outset was incomplete 
prime minister margaret thatchers office said it had seen the 
report as far as we are concerned the whole matter has been 
fully considered by the inquest and we see no grounds for opening 
up a fresh inquiry said a spokesman requesting anonymity 
the government has faced persistent questions over the killing 
of mairead farrell daniel mccann and sean savage by a 
secrecyshrouded military unit believed to have been flown in from 
britain 
the government said it acted on intelligence the three were 
armed and plotting to detonate a car bomb in the touristpacked 
center of the british colony on the southern spanish coast the 
irish republican army acknowledged the three were members sent to 
gibraltar on active service 
but it quickly emerged the three were unarmed and that their car 
contained no bomb and witnesses later said at least two of the 
suspects appeared to be trying to surrender to the plainclothes 
officers confronting them 
the government said it feared they might have remotecontrol 
devices to detonate the explosives if they were given too much time 
to surrender 
angrily rejecting amnesty internationals call for an inquiry 
mrs thatcher said an inquest would answer the questions seven 
months later the inquest jury ruled 92 that the killings were 
lawful 
amnesty international sent three observers to the inquest led 
by stephen owen a lawyer and ombudsman of the canadian province of 
british columbia 
its report comes two weeks after a british trial lawyer hilary 
kitchin who also observed the inquest wrote that it fell short of 
international legal standards and raised questions about the 
legality of the killings 
amnesty internationals report said details about government 
policy the planning of the operation and the quality of the 
intelligence were not revealed 
it said spanish police who had been involved in tracking the 
three to the gibraltar border did not testify 
spanish testimony could have helped establish whether they were 
known to be without guns or explosives the absence of this 
testimony also made the evidence incomplete the report said 
it said much forensic evidence was destroyed because standard 
procedures were not followed while the state pathologist was 
denied adequate postmortem facilities and ballistics reports 
most of the key independent civilian eye witnesses were 
discovered by media journalists and not by the police said 
amnesty international 
the organization is also concerned that discrepancies between 
witnesses testimonies had not been resolved and that many 
questions remained unanswered such as for example from what exact 
position the soldiers had fired and whether the suspects had made 
attempts to surrender the report said 
recalling past shootings in northern ireland in which police 
were accused of killing when they could have made arrests it said 
the inquest has again failed to alleviate public concern that 
these suspects were killed rather than arrested 
in an interview owen said britain faced the challenge of 
keeping its composure in the face of sometimes intolerable 
violence 
he said he was not accusing the british of stepping beyond the 
law im saying doubt remains that has to be resolved and 
doubt is potentially very damaging to a representative democracy 
the ira is fighting to rid northern ireland of british rule and 
unite it with the irish republic

a drug commonly prescribed for sedation and 
relief of cold symptoms is linked to sudden infant death syndrome 
and should not be sold without a prescription a public interest 
research group said monday 
public citizen health research group urged the food and drug 
administration to reverse its decision allowing overthecounter 
sales of the drug known by the trade name phenergan 
overthecounter availability implies fda designation of a 
margin of safety which in this case is not justified said 
andrew holmes and sidney wolfe physicians with the health research 
group in a letter to the fda 
the group filed a petition with the fda four months ago to block 
overthecounter sales of the drug but no action has been taken 
the group said the matter now deserves urgent attention because 
nonprescription doses of the drug are scheduled to reach pharmacy 
shelves in june 
fda spokeswoman susan cruzan said the groups petition is under 
review the agency has 180 days to review such petitions she said 
the fda last august decided that promethazine hydrochloride the 
active ingredient in phenergan could be used in overthecounter 
coughcold products based on the fact there hasnt been a safety 
problem to justify keeping it under prescription when used as 
labeled and it is labeled not for use in children under 6 cruzan 
said 
the drug is a phenothiazine a class of major tranquilizers 
with antihistamine properties that offer some relief from cold 
symptoms by drying the upper airways 
it is manufactured by wyethayerst laboratories company 
spokeswoman audrey ashby said the fda carefully reviewed all 
data before making its decision and was satisfied the products 
are suitable for overthecounter sales she added that in 
their 35 years of marketing these syrups have been remarkably 
problemfree 
but the health group noted that although phenergan is not 
recommended for children under 2 years old doctors wrote 175000 
prescriptions for the drug for that age group in 1985 it is often 
prescribed for children with colic holmes said 
a study in belgium where the drug is available without a 
prescription linked use with sudden infant death syndrome or 
sids and found that it can cause obstruction of infants breathing 
passages during sleep the health group said the study found that 
children who died of sids were 10 times more likely to have been 
given phenergan or a related drug recently than children in a 
control group 
about 5000 infants die of sids each year in the united states 
its cause is unknown but phenergan is believed to be a 
contributing factor the research group said 
even if only a small percentage of the us sids deaths are 
caused by prescription phenergan the increase in such deaths 
expected with otc overthecounter availability adds up to a 
senseless and avoidable tragedy the letter said 
dr richard l naeye chairman of the pathology department at 
the pennsylvania state university college of medicine has done 
extensive research on sids and is one of the six experts who wrote 
the fda supporting the health groups petition he said that while 
studies have not proven a connection between sids and phenergan 
they have found an association between the two that needs more 
study 
its an unresolved issue but i dont think its good to 
resolve it by putting it on the market over the counter he said 
naeye said that while he generally endorses the fdas push to 
make more drugs available without prescription in this case 
its not prudent

about a mile south of the tiny tohono 
oodham indian village of san miguel a pickup truck crossed from 
mexico through an open gate in the barbed wire that constitutes the 
international border 
the truck carrying 500 pounds of cocaine started along a 
winding dirt road known as indian route 19 it then headed north 
for tucson and to major us cities for distribution 
as the truck continued its journey two us customs agents 
both tohono oodham indians popped onto the road in a 
fourwheeldrive vehicle and chased it 
us agents took a 357caliber magnum the 45 million cocaine 
cache and the truck and charged 21yearold francisco lopez loya of 
chihuahua mexico with conspiracy and other offenses 
the march 23 arrest was similar to one played out almost daily 
as federal state and local law enforcement officers fight a 
narcotics flood pouring across the border 
the 360milelong arizona border has become the latest 
chessboard in the deadly game of drug trafficking primarily 
because of the success of antidrug task forces in southern florida 
we have seen a tremendous increase in the amount of drugs 
coming into arizona from mexico said david s wood chief agent 
for the us drug enforcement administration in phoenix were 
able in many instances to trace it directly back to colombia 
wood said arizona offers a variety of advantages to traffickers 
its a very porous border and then there is the human 
connection because of family contacts on both sides that makes 
it an ideal situation for the smuggler he said 
other factors include the rugged terrain and sparse border 
population only douglas nogales and san luis have populations of 
more than 1000 and the logistics one major mexican highway runs 
25 yards south of the border 
they can throw a package over the fence and its in this 
country wood said 
an unprecedented rash of violence has accompanied the new drug 
trade authorities said 
during the last three weeks the bodies of five men bound 
tortured and stabbed were found in a tucson shed and in agua 
prieta mexico about 125 miles southeast of tucson the bodies of 
nine men and three women were discovered similarly bound tortured 
mutilated and shot all had been dumped in a well or covered with 
lime in a septic tank 
pima county sheriff clarence dupnik said the tucson and agua 
prieta slayings are directly connected with the same persons 
responsible 
they have been characteristic of some of those of the notorious 
colombian medillin cartel said thomas a mcdermott the head us 
customs service agent in arizona weve seen that sort of 
brutality in south florida 
authorities have not drawn any connection between the slayings 
and the mutilations of 15 people near matamoros mexico 
the increased volume in drug trafficking and violence prompted 
sen dennis deconcini dariz to vow last week to press congress 
to fund the remaining 19 billion promised in last years omnibus 
drug bill im prepared to raise taxes and to cut other 
programs he said 
border patrol chief agent ronald dowdy whose sector includes 
most of the arizona border said his agents seized 85000 pounds of 
marijuana in fiscal 1988 to date we have exceeded 107000 
pounds for fiscal 89 which began oct 1 he said recently 
mcdermott said the stepup in violence was anticipated as 
cocaine seizures in arizona soared from 100 pounds in 1985 to 
almost 10000 pounds a year currently 
larry bagley fbi special agent in charge in tucson said his 
office now routinely gets numerous drugrelated queries weekly from 
chicago philadelphia columbus ohio and elsewhere on cases that 
all lead back to tucson as the focal point the funnel from which 
the supply is coming its not so much florida any more but tucson 
arizona this is the distribution center

soldiers dislodged moslem guerrillas 
blocking the highway that connects the soviet border to kabul and 
convoys of food and fuel are expected to reach the capital soon 
the government said monday 
mohammad nabi amani spokesman for the foreign ministry also 
said the insurgents had new weapons and planned increased attacks 
on jalalabad 75 miles east of kabul 
a special security court in the capital convicted a 23yearold 
palestinian of spying for the guerrillas trying to oust the 
sovietsponsored government 
amani told reporters government troops overcame blockades the 
insurgents had established at two points on the salang highway 
which runs north for 260 miles through the hindu kush mountain 
range to the soviet border 
although insurgents had virtually closed the highway about 100 
supply trucks broke through last week becoming the first convoy to 
arrive in kabul since april 6 amani said he expected 600 trucks 
stranded on the road to arrive soon but gave no details 
about 65 trucks left kabul for jalalabad which the rebels 
besieged march 6 in their first major offensive after soviet 
military forces completed their withdrawal feb 15 
he said reconnaissance flights showed the insurgents to be 
planning a new offensive around the city which is about 45 miles 
from the pakistan border but did not elaborate 
amani said rockets and heavy artillery rounds hit jalalabad 
wounding a civilian he claimed 32 guerrillas including five 
commanders were killed in a retaliatory strike by government 
forces 
each side in the war exaggerates the others casualties and the 
conflicting estimates cannot be reconciled 
guerrilla spokesmen in pakistan reported heavy fighting outside 
jalalabad after a weekend in which the insurgents claimed to have 
have captured seven government outposts they and amani also 
reported fighting at khost another eastern garrison town about 75 
miles to the south 
the afghan news agency of the sevenparty guerrilla alliance 
based in pakistan quoted a commander named fazli haq muhajid as 
saying insurgents breached jalalabads southern defenses for the 
first time in the offensive 
in kabul the national security court convicted abdul razaq of 
spying for the guerrillas the threejudge panel said the young 
palestinian deserved the death penalty but was sentenced to 16 
years in prison because he asked for mercy 
razaq was found guilty of illegally entering afghanistan 
military spying collaborating with insurgents and trying to 
persuade soldiers to defect 
he admitted entering afghanistan illegally but said his purpose 
was to preach the islamic faith 
i am not a professional killer he told the court i came 
to make peace between two guerrilla commanders i am not a spy 
my objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides 
soldiers who stormed a guerrilla hideout in northwestern 
afghanistan arrested razaq in december prosecutors said razaq 
said his home was in a refugee camp in jordan 
on april 5 the court convicted two pakistanis of spying one 
was sentenced to 16 years the other to 18 years 
pakistan the united states and china are major supporters of 
the guerrillas who began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 soviet forces entered the war in december 1979 and withdrew 
nine years later under a unmediated agreement

the nations tobacco farmers are hoping to 
boost production this year and one of the reasons is the thriving 
overseas demand for us cigarettes and unrolled leaf 
according to the agriculture department almost one of every six 
cigarettes made in the united states in 1988 went to foreign 
buyers more than two of every five pounds of tobacco leaf produced 
by farmers last year were exported 
sustained increases in foreign demand have more than offset the 
continued decline in us cigarette use meaning that the 
departments annual quotas for fluecured and burley tobacco have 
been increased for the 1989 season 
in response tobacco farmers have indicated they intend to plant 
713000 acres this year up 13 percent from 1988 with average 
yields this years total tobacco harvest could increase by about 
15 percent 
the departments economic research service says in its latest 
analysis that us cigarette production rose about 1 percent in 
1988 to an estimated 695 billion pieces americans smoked 5625 
billion cigarettes last year about 2 percent fewer than in 1987 
but cigarette exports rose more than 18 percent last year to 
1185 billion pieces while shipments of leaf rose 12 percent to an 
equivalent of 578 million pounds farm sales weight about 17 
percent of the 1988 tobacco output of 135 billion pounds 
the united states is the worlds leading tobacco exporter as 
well as the largest importer the report said 
back in the early 1960s the united states exported about 30 
percent of its tobacco in recent years exports accounted for 38 
percent of the crop however there has been a rise in competition 
and the us share of the world market has dropped by half from a 
28 percent share in 1970 to 14 percent in 1987 
last year the report said the value of all us tobacco 
exports was a record 415 billion up 22 percent from calendar 
1987 the previous high the total included 125 billion worth of 
unmanufactured tobacco and 29 billion in products mostly 
cigarettes 
according to the census bureau some 105 countries bought us 
tobacco last year about 60 percent of the cigarettes went to asian 
countries while europe traditionally is the largest buyer of leaf 
which is used to blend into domestically produced products 
despite the recent pickup in leaf exports they continue to hold 
below the annual levels during most of the 1970s and early 1980s 
higher excise taxes are reducing or slowing the growth of cigarette 
sales in some countries the report said and the high costs of 
us tobacco together with the dollars strength in the early 
1980s prompted some to shift to other sources notably brazil and 
zimbabwe 
even with comparatively lower us prices since 1985 there is 
still stiff competition from less expensive foreign stocks the 
report said 
last year for the first time since 1980 west germany was the 
leading buyer of us tobacco leaf followed by japan which was 
the no 1 market the previous seven years but that was mainly 
because japan reduced 1988 imports after buying unusually large 
quantities the previous year

a tollfree consumer meat and poultry hotline 
operated by the agriculture department generated about 50000 
telephone calls last year most of them asking for information 
about food safety 
linda burkholder of the departments food safety and inspection 
service the agency that handles meat and poultry inspection 
programs reports that the number of calls during the fiscal year 
that ended sept 30 increased 6 percent from 1987 
burkholder said about 30000 of the calls came in during usdas 
regular business hours 10 am to 4 pm est after hours and on 
weekends callers heard taped educational messages such as tips on 
safe food preparation suggestions for transporting foods or 
information on product recalls 
approximately 70 percent of callers asked about basic food 
safety she said in the spring issue of usdas food news 
magazine these questions concerned how long a specific meat or 
poultry item could be safely stored how to minimize the risk of 
illness from eating raw or lightly cooked eggs or how to judge when 
turkey is done 
about 5 percent of the calls were about salmonella with most 
wanting to know how the bacteria cause food poisoning while others 
were interested in federal programs designed to control salmonella 
repeat callers accounted for 12 percent of last years calls 
burkholder said the number of the tollfree hotline now in its 
fourth year is 18005354555

bob bergland a former secretary of 
agriculture and a major voice in support of the nations rural 
electric cooperatives has offered a reminder about the role of the 
rural electrification administration 
the rea an agency of the agriculture department was created in 
the 1930s to finance electric power service to the nations 
farmers various administrations have sought to curb or alter its 
functions 
bergland speaking last week at a hearing of a house 
appropriations subcommittee urged lawmakers to reject outright 
current proposals to privatize the agency 
rea is a lending program not a grant program he said 
last year rural electrics local cooperatives borrowed 780 
million from the government but they paid back some 4 billion in 
principal and interest 
bergland who was secretary during the carter administration is 
executive vice president and general manager of the national rural 
electric cooperative association which represents about 1000 
local coops 
now is not the time to weaken any component of this delicate 
infrastructure built as a proven partnership between the 
federal rea and rural electric coops he said

the soviet union introduced a new progressive 
income tax that will abolish payments by the poor and increase 
rates threefold for wealthier citizens 
finance minister boris i gostev said the new tax structure 
reflects growing differences in income 
in an interview published monday in the communist party 
newspaper pravda gostev said the new tax structure becomes 
effective in january and is the first change in 46 years 
on sunday pravda published the tax structure in the form of a 
draft law the draft must be approved by the government before it 
becomes law 
soviets currently pay a flat 10 percent of their income in taxes 
if they make less than the equivalent of 320 a month the rate 
increases a few percentage points for higher incomes 
under the draft people making more than 2400 a month will pay 
50 percent of their earnings to the treasury 
gostev said only 34 percent of soviet workers make more than 
the equivalent of 800 a month and that most soviets wont be 
affected by the new tax structure 
the new structure calls for abolishing tax payments by people 
who make less than 130 a month just above the amount government 
officials consider the minimum necessary to get by in soviet 
society it also provides for reduced taxes for earners of less 
than 160 monthly with officials determining later how big the 
reduction should be 
most industrial workers make 347 a month 
the structure sets a tax rate of 122 percent for incomes of 
1120 a month increasing progressively to the 50 percent ceiling 
most taxes are withheld at the workplace and workers do not 
need to file annual tax returns 
the finance minister said cooperatives individuals who have 
struck out on their own to produce goods and services and other 
reforms fostered by president mikhail s gorbachev have raised 
the level of material security of soviet citizens and at the same 
time raised the differentiation of the populations income 
they need a new tax structure to reflect those changes he said 
wageearners with four or more dependents are eligible for a tax 
cut of 30 percent of the new rates according to the published 
report 
soviet taxpayers who earn money from several difference sources 
now must pay separately on each of the sources gostev said the new 
law unifies all income sources so people pay on total income 
it includes stiff penalties for tax evaders he said 
in october several soviet economists said an overhaul of the 
tax structure was essential to distribute income more equitably and 
expose those who have made fortunes on the black market 
to search for some kind of scientific approach in our system 
of taxation is useless deputy finance minister viktor semyonov 
told the weekly moscow news 
another economist v yaroshenko said a yearly report of income 
and expenditures would serve as a means of strong economic and 
psychological action most of all against the system of organized 
crime

getting mom and dad a 41st anniversary 
present took more than just pulling out a credit card for scott and 
dennis rice who spent six months restoring a 15yearold red 
convertible to its former glory 
when i was working that was always my ambition to ride 
around in a convertible said william rice who retired in 1982 
rice and his wife elinor dont celebrate their anniversary 
until april 23 but the sons decided to turn over the keys to the 
1974 buick ahead of time last month when they were washing the car 
in dennis driveway and their parents paid a surprise visit 
we both said i cant believe it mrs rice said i 
said ive got to sit down my knees are getting weak 
scott 23 said he and his 35yearold brother obtained the 
buick last fall the restoration recorded on a sixhour videotape

its only a student body vote but state 
officials will be watching closely this week when stanford 
university holds the first election by computer in california 
if voter turnout is as big as organizers hope the election 
tuesday and wednesday could be the largest in the united states 
ever conducted on computers and a harbinger of general elections in 
the 21st century 
the stanford computers will be programmed with a variety of 
safeguards to discourage hackers and vote fraud if the voter tries 
something funny with the keyboard for example the computer will 
make noise to summon a poll watcher 
were observing the stanford election as an interesting 
experiment said john mottsmith coordinator of voter outreach 
programs for the california secretary of states office 
computers are becoming increasingly useful in a variety of ways 
one of those ways could be elections 
an election last week at boston university drew 3159 voters 
believed to be the largest turnout at a computer election so far in 
the united states stanfords enrollment of 13000 is smaller than 
bus but a typical stanford election draws about 5000 voters 
organizers said 
it was very simple a lot easier than the old system said 
bu senior colin dodd who used a macintosh mouse a handheld 
device that transmits instructions to the computer to make his 
choices instead of a pen or pencil 
though though system at boston got generally good reviews a 
disk failure caused 248 votes last week to go uncounted a computer 
scientist is checking to see whether the missing votes can be 
retrieved but they werent enough to have affected the outcome of 
any of the races there anyway 
although california has no plans to hold computerized elections 
officials are intrigued by stanfords experiment and hope to see 
how secure and userfriendly the system proves to be the 
election is expected to cost at least 3000 less than the 13000 
spent last year and allow votes to be counted within two hours 
instead of five days 
its interesting for us to see how the bright minds of 
stanford university in conjunction with silicon valley are going 
to deal with the questions of how voters interact with the 
equipment mottsmith said 
omputers arent completely unknown on election day of course 
in many locations voters use a stylus to punch holes in cards that 
are then counted by computers like the keypunch cards that were a 
staple of computer departments until the last decade or so 
but with that kind of voting system or the oldfashioned paper 
ballots the paper remains as a backup if there is a problem or a 
call for a recount 
how a computer can duplicate that integrity is an interesting 
question mottsmith said the bottom line is the people have 
to have confidence that the system is accurate 
stanford student election officials think theyve got a 
fraudproof system thats easy to use and should take each voter 
only about three minutes the software was developed by a student 
sophomore sandy aronson 
if the computer detects that its being tampered with in some 
manner it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the poll 
watcher said elections commissioner steven krauss also a 
sophomore 
but paper ballots will still be used by students at stanfords 
three overseas campuses for absentee ballots and for those who 
refuse to use the macintosh computers 
there will probably always be people on campus who dont know 
how to use a mac and are dreadfully afraid of using the 
machine krauss said for those who fall into that category 
who would like to vote but theres no way on gods green earth 
theyre going to touch one of these machines we will have paper 
and pencils available

nazi hunter simon wiesenthal who for years 
rejected hollywood offers to do his story says he signed with home 
box office because his contract allowed him to consult on the 
script draft by draft 
wiesenthal also said in an interview for the april 22 tv guide 
magazine that he was pleased by hbos choice of ben kingsley to 
play him in the movie to be broadcast sunday called murderers 
among us the simon wiesenthal story 
the movie is based on wiesenthals 1967 book of the same title 
wiesenthal credited with finding more than 1100 war criminals 
said producers were after him for years for the movie rights but 
offered deals that would have left him helpless if he felt the 
script diverged from the truth 
in 1984 executive producer robert cooper offered a contract 
that gave wiesenthal no veto power but required that he be 
consulted by the writers on each draft as they worked toward the 
final script 
now i am confident that the spirit of my story will be 
properly represented wiesenthal said 
kingsley who won a bestactor oscar for the title role in 
ghandi told the magazine he read three of wiesenthals books 
before meeting him in vienna austria 
we clicked immediately the british actor said and 
wiesenthal had both of them crying within 10 minutes 
he told me a story about liberation day on the 5th of may 
1945 and how some of his fellow jews were dying as the gis came 
in kingsley said

the defense rested monday without 
presenting any witnesses in the murder trial of a christian science 
couple accused of letting their 7yearold diabetic daughter die 
without medical attention 
former banker william hermanson 42 and his wife christine 
38 are charged with thirddegree murder and felony child abuse 
sarasota circuit judge stephen dakan said he expected the six 
jurors to begin deliberations tuesday after closing arguments and 
his instructions 
amy hermanson was aided by spiritual healers but not doctors 
before her death in september 1986 the hermansons attorneys 
claimed the couple were acting legally under a 1975 florida law 
allowing parents to withhold medical treatment from their sick 
children if they are legitimately practicing their religious 
beliefs 
christian science tenets rely on prayer and spiritual 
practitioners rather than on medicine to heal illness there are no 
church sanctions however for followers who seek medical aid 
the couple have a right to practice their religion but not the 
right to allow a child to die assistant sarasota state attorney 
deno economou said during the weeklong trial 
on friday defense attorneys successfully blocked the testimony 
of a family friend who said out of the jurys presence that amys 
parents had in the past obtained medical care for themselves but 
didnt get the insulin injections that expert witnesses said could 
have saved their childs life 
attorney charles arnold said the surprise testimony by mary 
christman violated trial rules requiring lawyers to notify the 
other side of damaging testimony expected to be introduced 
the prosecutors acknowledged their inaction but gave no 
explanation and the judge ruled the testimony inadmissible

despite increases in federal spending and the 
number of families being helped poor families face an evergrowing 
shortage of lowrent homes and apartments according to a private 
study of government data released monday 
more of the poor were forced to pay more for housing because of 
soaring costs from 1978 to 1985 said the study entitled a place 
to call home 
the study was produced by two advocacy groups that generally 
advocate increased resources for social programs the center on 
budget and policy priorities and the low income housing information 
service the authors used data from a 1985 housing survey 
the various findings of the study are captured in one statistic 
the proportion of poor renting families who pay at least 60 
percent of their income for rent and utilities rose from 44 percent 
in 1978 to 55 percent in 1985 
among poor owners the proportion rose from 31 percent to 38 
percent 
half of all poor renting households paid at least 266 a month 
in 1985 up from the 1978 figure of 229 
in the 1970s and 1980s housing demand increased while supply 
shrank the study said 
the number of households with cash incomes below the official 
poverty line rose 25 percent from 105 million to 133 million from 
1978 to 1985 that line was 8573 for a family of three in 1985 
hud guidelines consider housing affordable if it takes no 
more than 30 percent of family income 
the number of houses and apartments available for a monthly rent 
of 250 or less 30 percent of the income of a family making 
10000 a year was 97 million in 1970 or 24 million more than 
the comparable number of families 
in 1978 there were still 370000 more units than familes but 
by 1985 the number of families had risen to 116 million while the 
number of houses and apartments available at 250 or less had 
fallen to 79 million a deficit of 37 million affordable housing 
units of the 79 million 800000 were vacant and 15 million were 
occupied by families with incomes above the poverty line 
the primary cause of the disappearance of lowcost housing 
according to barry zigas executive secretary of the low income 
housing information service was upgrading abandonment and 
changes in use including gentrification in some cities as well 
as substantial cost escalation in housing 
our housing resources are filtering up rather than down the 
income scale he said

here are the major features of the 
package president bush unveiled monday to reward poland for its 
recent steps toward democracy and to encourage further political 
and economic reforms 
trade concessions 
the administration will submit to congress legislation to lower 
us tariffs on a variety of polish goods this would be 
accomplished by putting poland under the generalized system of 
preferences which gives this form of trade relief to selected 
countries with low percapita incomes 
the administration estimates the value to poland at 35 million 
to 25 million annually depending on what products benefit from 
tariff reductions and how aggressively poland reacts to the lowered 
tariffs 
old loans 
bush called for other wealthy western nations to join the united 
states in giving poland easier terms for paying back its 38 
billion foreign debt only 24 billion of which is owed to the 
united states but the debt stretchout would be conditioned on 
economic reforms by the warsaw government 
administration sources said the step could lead to the 
rescheduling of up to 700 million in existing debt 
new loans 
the administration said it would support conditional new loans 
to poland from the international monetary fund but suggested they 
should be tied to movement toward marketoriented economic 
policies the white house did not put a dollar value on the imf 
loans 
some official sources have suggested the imf loans could total 
300 million if poland meets all the requirements followed perhaps 
by 250 million more from the world bank 
business investment 
the package provides a variety of incentives to encourage more 
us business investment in poland along with joint ventures with 
polish businesses these overtures would be made conditional on 
polands progress in carrying out the political and labor reforms 
it has promised including recognizing solidarity and holding free 
and open parlimentary elections 
debtequity swaps 
the government proposed that poland be permitted to reduce some 
of its international debt by giving us banks or other investors 
shares in polish enterprises in exchange

senate majority leader george mitchell on 
monday told a union conference the president is against us in 
efforts to raise the minimum wage and urged the delegates to 
confront president bush when he speaks to them tuesday 
maybe you can ask him this question mitchell told about 
3000 delegates of the aflcio building and construction trades 
national conference how is it that the president can propose a 
tax cut of 30000 a year for the very richest americans and yet at 
the same time say that 30 cents an hour for the poorest americans 
is too much i say that is wrong and that is unfair 
mitchell dmaine was referring to bushs proposal to cut 
capital gains taxes and the 30 cents an hour difference between 
bushs offer to raise the hourly minimum wage to 425 by 1992 and 
the 455 target contained in legislation passed by both the house 
and senate 
the white house and congressional proposals also differ on 
whether employers should be able to pay newly hired workers a 
subminimum wage bush has said he will not sign any increase unless 
there is a sixmonth training wage covering all new employees 
while both the house and senate bills include a twomonth training 
period with significant eligibility restrictions 
a conference committee is resolving differences between the 
house and senate bills before the measure can be given final 
passage and be sent to bush who has promised to veto it 
the president appears to have enough votes to sustain a veto 
but democrats have decided on a vigorous campaign in favor of the 
bill in hopes of gaining a political edge should bush hold fast to 
his veto threats 
were going to fight mitchell said the president is 
against us 
mitchell delivered a lengthy defense of the democratic party and 
questioned bushs campaign call for a kinder gentler nation 
weve made mistakes mitchell said of the democrats weve 
gone too far in some cases but if this is a kind and gentle nation 
it is democrats who made it so and if it is to become kinder and 
gentler it is democrats who will make it so 
mitchell also said that with or without bush the democrats 
planned to move forward with their domestic agenda including 
programs for the homeless environment health care and 
infrastructure 
weve got a public agenda that wont wait and were not going 
to wait mitchell said

government plans to build along the border to stop mexican 
motorists from driving into southern california illegally 
californians are strongly concerned about legal and illegal 
immigration into that state said daniel stein executive 
director of federation for american immigration reform which 
commissioned the poll conducted april 69 by tarrance amp associates

residents while 31 percent of this group said they opposed the 
plan statewide 28 percent were opposed 
the san diego sample had a margin of error of 59 percent 
the poll was released two days before the san diego city council 
debates a proposed resolution to oppose the ditch a number of 
hispanic political groups have lined up against the proposal 
but stein says the poll shows hispanic californians support the 
ditch by a 6133 percent margin and that hispanics generally 
support tougher measures to stem illegal immigration 
hispanics like all other americans are concerned about 
competition on the bottom of the job ladder stein said 
but the poll also showed that hispanics split 5244 percent when 
asked if they supported erection of secure fences and barriers to 
thwart illegal border crossings 
in january fair issued an extensive study proposing 
construction of sunken concrete walls and secure fences to tighten 
border security the organizations membership includes colorados 
former democratic governor richard lamm former sen walter d 
huddleston dky and former attorney general william french smith 
of those surveyed in the san diego area 31 percent said they 
opposed the ditch while 12 percent said they were unsure 
statewide 28 percent opposed construction of the ditch while 11 
percent said they were unsure 
the poll also found overwhelming support among californians for 
increased border security to curb drug smuggling sixtyeight

sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate 
finance committee introduced legislation monday that would require 
the internal revenue service to notify taxpayers when they overpay 
their taxes 
the irs should be honest with taxpayers not try to hide from 
them that they have paid more than they rightfully owe bentsen 
a texas democrat said in a senate speech we expect taxpayers to 
pay their fair share but not an extra share 
the bill grew out of a disclosure last month that the irs 
instructed employees matching tax returns with income forms such 
as the w2 for wages and the 1099 for interest and pension 
payments to keep quiet when such examination disclosed 
overpayment the overpayment usually resulted when a taxpayer 
failed to subtract taxes withheld from taxes owed 
after an irs employee in memphis complained to sen albert gore 
jr dtenn irs acting commissioner michael j murphy ordered the 
policy discontinued 
bentsens bill would write that change into law

jim wrights attorney predicted monday the 
house ethics committee will find no rules violations when it 
considers whether clear and convincing evidence exists of 
improper conduct by the speaker 
lawyer william c oldaker rebutting all the charges in the 
committees statement of alleged violations said they were based 
on a mischaracterization of factsoutrageous readings of 
legislative history retroactive writing of the rules 
doublespeak 
oldaker commented after committee chairman julian c dixon 
dcalif announced the panel was charging the texas democrat with 
69 violations of house rules 
in a lengthy statement the panel found reason to believe 
wright had broken rules requiring reporting of gifts barring 
acceptance of gifts from persons with a direct interest in 
legislation and limiting outside earned income 
both oldaker and dixon emphasized the committees allegations 
were based only on a reason to believe that rules were 
violated in order for the panel to declare actual violations took 
place and to recommend punishment by the full house it must find 
clear and convincing evidence 
i am confident they will find no rules violations clearly and 
convincingly proved said oldaker who particularly criticized 
the committees special outside counsel richard j phelan of 
chicago for its report monday 
the committee on standards of official conduct the panels 
formal name charged that wrights friend and business partner 
fort worth texas real estate developer and investor george 
mallick improperly provided 145000 worth of gifts over a 10year 
period 
the committee found that mallick had a direct interest in 
legislation before congress making it a violation of house rules 
for wright to accept more than 100 in gifts in a calendar year 
oldaker called the allegation that mallick had a direct interest 
in legislation one of the most outrageous readings of legislative 
history 
he called mallick a close personal friend of wright who had 
interest in oil and an interest in real estate that covers 
everyone in the country 
the attorney said mallick never asked the speaker to do 
anything for himself or anyone else 
the committee charged wright with failing to report the benefits 
he received from mallick as gifts on his annual financial 
disclosure forms 
the items deemed gifts by the ethics committee included free 
housing from 1979 through 1984 in fort worth valued at 31698 
cutrate housing from 1985 through 1988 valued at 21790 an 
18000ayear salary paid to wrights wife betty from 1981 
through 1984 totaling 72000 and the use and maintenance of a 
1979 cadillac from 1983 through 1988 valued at 19391 
according to oldaker it was mallicks practice to have 
employees live for free in the same fort worth condominium 
complex he let the wrights use 
oldaker said phelan wrongly implied that wrights wife betty 
was incompetent when she worked for the investment company founded 
by wright mallick and their wives 
wrights lawyer said former colleagues of mrs wright told the 
committee she worked five to seven days a month when she went 
out and looked at various investments and talked to people he 
said mrs wright was not successful in the ventures and left no 
written record of her work 
the car was owned by the wrightmallick firm and the speaker 
never believed the car was a gift oldaker said 
wright was accused by the committee of having an overall 
scheme to evade house limits on outside earned income by in 
seven instances selling bulk quantities of his book reflections 
of a public man to groups to which he had delivered speeches 
the panel said that action in effect converted money that 
should have been speaking fees limited under house rules into 
book royalties which are not under the limits in an eighth 
instance the panel said wright received an undisclosed gift 
because books paid for by a private individual were not delivered 
oldaker said the committee found problems with only seven 
speeches during a threeyear period when wright gave 750 talks 
on the disclosure question oldaker said public disclosure 
was made which is the essence of everything betty wrights salary 
was disclosed the book royalties were disclosed there was a lot 
of noise a lot of clamoring but very little substance

the cost of loving is going up 
new york after years of allowing manufacturers free use of the 
i love new york logo will start charging royalties this year 
people who print the logo on sweatshirts key chains pens or 
other consumer goods will be forced to give new york state 6 
percent to 10 percent of the money they make said stephen morello 
a state deputy commissioner for economic development 
the state has spent more than 100 million advertising itself to 
tourists since launching the i love new york advertising 
campaign in 1977 he said 
the state registered the motto with a red heart symbol in place 
of the word love though the symbol has been adapted for a 
variety of bumper stickers and other uses the state only holds the 
trademark for loving new york 
we think this is one modest way to begin recapturing some of 
the investment without negatively impacting the mottos 
effectiveness morello said 
state officials have watched with great interest the success of 
the california raisins advertising campaign which has branched off 
into lucrative records touring cartoon characters and other 
products he said 
a licensing agent will be hired to help market the logo which 
tourism officials refer to in news releases as legendary 
up until now the state has allowed manufacturers to include i 
love new york in anything deemed appropriate figuring its 
helping the state advertise itself he said 
manufacturers who already use the logo will be allowed a certain 
period of time to sell off their inventory before they have to 
start paying he said

poles reacted with delight monday to news 
that solidarity was legal again but some seemed doubtful that even 
the legalization of the independent union can solve the countrys 
economic woes 
many poles had not heard by afternoon that the warsaw regional 
court had approved registration of the union that had energized the 
nation before being banned in the wake of the december 1981 
martiallaw crackdown 
i didnt know its great it should have happened a long time 
ago said gregorz maracewicz a solidarity supporter who works in 
the science office of the roza luksemburg lightbulb factory 
we will have to see what they solidarity will do but it 
will make a great difference for all of us he said before 
heading home in a driving spring snowstorm after his shift 
its a good thing it should change things but its hard to 
say whether solidarity can do it all by itself said a factory 
employee and former solidarity member who declined to give her name 
at the institute for professional training near where the 
warsaw branch of solidarity had its offices during its first 16 
months of legality employees welcomed the decision 
i am very happy i really think its a historic moment i 
think registration was the first condition of all the changes which 
are going to improve things when there is more democracy said 
sociologist krystyna lewinska 
i dont give interviews said another institute employee who 
walked away and smiled he then turned his head and added but i 
am very happy 
most of those interviewed who were members of the union during 
its legal phase in 198081 said they would join again 
thats obvious said alina jablonska an employee in a 
design office now on maternity leave when asked if she would 
become a member again 
we are full of hope the whole society at least my community 
believes our life problems should disappear perhaps not so soon 
but in the long term she said 
an elderly woman who like jablonska was standing in line for 
meat at the hala mirowska market disagreed 
it doesnt matter who rules what matters is that things 
should be good in this country so that i shouldnt have to stand in 
line for a piece of meat said the woman a retired factory 
worker who was a member of solidarity in 198081 
i dont think anything will change she added declining to 
give her name 
authorities and the opposition hope the legalization of 
solidarity will provide social calm needed for economic reforms to 
take effect 
chronic consumer shortages and the failure of wages to keep pace 
with inflation sparked two crippling waves of strikes in may and 
august 1988 service on polands 38 billion debt eats up hard 
currency needed for investments to modernize industry 
in light of such problems some poles want to wait and see what 
the union can do before joining the union once boasted 10 million 
members out of the 18 millionmember workforce but walesa has said 
he expects 5 million to 7 million in the new solidarity 
others demonstrated their commitment to solidarity even before 
the decision to register the union was officially announced 
we organized when solidarity was illegal underground so we 
are not used to this new situation we represent committees already 
organized in our region the big difference will be our freedom of 
action said roman jarosz 
the 26yearold construction worker and three of his friends 
took the overnight train from their home in gorzow wielkopolski in 
western poland so they could hold up a solidarity banner in the 
courtroom where the decision was read

bush administration officials defended their 
1990 african aid budget proposal monday against a democratic 
senators accusations of neglect and misplaced priorities 
sen patrick leahy dvt told his foreign operations 
subcommmittee that despite millions of dollars in american aid 
countries south of the sahara are facing every imaginable 
problem today with less economic assistance provided for the 
half billion people who live in the region than for nine million 
people in two central american countries el salvador and 
honduras 
the senator demanded that the bush administration halt what he 
called a republican policy of neglect that he said was 
demonstrated by former president ronald reagans never once 
visiting africa 
to put it bluntly leahy said your 1990 budget is wholly 
inadequate to meet the challenges i want us to do more 
alison rosenberg deputy assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs acknowledged that recent appropriations for africa 
have fallen short of allowing us to meet our earlier stated 
objectives 
the 1990 request for 820 million in economic and 85 million in 
military assistance for subsaharan africa a 10 percent increase 
over 1989 has the correct emphasis she said with 10 times as 
much economic as military assistance 
ms rosenberg said the military aid is focussed on countries 
with important us strategic interests kenya chad and zaire 
and is a fraction of the 1958 level of 158 million some 6 million 
is requested for a recently launched program for civic action and 
coastal security aid she said which has gained us direct access 
to top leadership in half a dozen countries in west africa 
overall she said the decline in military assistance for 
african countries has put us reliability and credibility in 
jeopardy this year we are unable to provide sufficient funding 
even to support nigers two c130 transport planes 
on the economic side ms rosenberg described as a major 
american success the trend toward private enterprise and 
relaxation of state control over african economies

the national security agencys decision to 
build its own top secret computerchip plant was spurred by the 
threat of sensitive technology falling into the wrong hands 
according to american electronics specialists 
the nsa the nations biggest intelligence agency says the 85 
million microelectronics plant being built at fort meade md 
represents a unique capability within the us government 
the move comes amid increasing concern about erosion of american 
chipmaking expertise and manufacturing capacity in the face of 
stiff competition from japan south korea and other countries 
the national security agencys main missions are eavesdropping 
on communications around the globe encoding us communications 
and cracking foreign codes as well as safeguarding the security of 
us military computers and communications systems 
to carry out those missions the defense department agency makes 
heavy use of sophisticated powerful computers author james 
bamford an authority on the agency has reported that computers 
cover more than 5 acres at its headquarters complex at fort meade 
according to bamford the nsa has a work force topping 60000 
employees more than all other us spy agencies combined and a 
budget estimated at more than 10 billion a year 
the nsas public affairs office said that in september 1988 the 
agency signed an 85 million contract with national semiconductor 
corp of santa clara calif to instrument and train the 
government to operate a stateoftheart microelectronics 
fabrication facility 
construction of 60000 square feet of building space to house 
the chipmaking plant was started in january 1986 by the us army 
corps of engineers and completed in october 1988 it said 
now national semiconductor is outfitting the sixinch silicon 
wafer fabrication line the nsa statement said operations are 
scheduled to begin in 1991 and national semiconductor will train 
nsa personnel in the operation of the new facility over a period of 
18 months 
the agency said that building such a facility at fort meade 
will enable nsa to have direct control over the production process 
and the security procedures necessary for safeguarding the plant 
this facility represents a unique capability within the us 
government 
paul hazan a computer scientist at the johns hopkins university 
applied physics laboratory in laurel md said the nsa plant was 
aimed at dealing with the threat of reverse engineering 
efforts to figure out the functioning of a computer system by 
scrutinizing its key components 
that is why they dont want to have a process made elsewhere 
you have coding and so on and if that falls into the wrong 
hands the other side could find out what your code is thats why 
they want to keep control of it inhouse he said 
hazan chairman of the defense research and development 
committee of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers 
a 300000member professional association said that we are 
losing the commercial semiconductor competition 
since that in turn is what is driving the technology we 
rapidly find ourselves where in defense if you want to build 
defense systems you wont have the capability here you have to go 
overseas and hope that japan or korea or somebody else is willing 
to apply the resources to that as opposed to something else he 
said 
hazan added that if you do that then its a commercial 
market presumably theyll sell it to anybody who has the need so 
its potentially a very tricky situation 
larry sumney president of semiconductor research corp an 
electronics company in research triangle park nc said that in 
1982 while he was on the pentagon staff he chaired a defense 
science board task force on development of very highspeed 
integrated circuits 
the task force recommended to the science board that the 
government give some consideration to putting together a facility 
to provide stateoftheart integrated circuits for classified 
applications he said 
sumney noted that another defense science board task force study 
in 1987 also called attention to the fact that the government 
couldnt put itself in a position of being dependent on foreign 
sources 
asked about the nsas decision to build its own chip plant 
sumney said i would think that now its even more supportable 
because weve continued to erode in our ability to be competitive 
in world markets for integrated circuits

the countrys top law enforcer said in 
remarks distributed monday that about 1000 moslem extremists were 
detained this month in a nationwide sweep prompted by a riot 
outside a provincial mosque 
security sources said earlier that only about 100 people were 
rounded up 
interior minister zaki badr whose ministry oversees domestic 
order gave the new figure sunday night during a speech at cairos 
national sporting club the staterun middle east news agency 
distributed a summary of his remarks on monday 
the fundamentalist rioting which left four people wounded 
broke out april 7 in the southern city of fayoum immediately after 
friday prayers at a mosque the government has accused sheik omar 
abdelrahman a charismatic blind preacher of inciting his 
followers to violence 
he was arrested on the day of the riots 
the government contends that abdelrahman is spiritual leader of 
an underground extremist group called jihad it blames the group 
for the 1981 assassination of president anwar sadat and a later 
coup attempt 
abdelrahman was tried twice after sadats slaying for 
involvement with jihad but was acquitted both times 
although badr said about 1000 extremists were detained in the 
sweep since the riots he did not say how many remained in custody 
and on what charges 
the emergency law that allows the detentions also lets 
authorities hold people for virtually as long as they like without 
charge 
badr a practicing moslem said he would continue to crack down 
on moslem extremists with the utmost firmness 
fayoum rioters demanded that the government impose islams legal 
and social code known as sharia the rules include harsh criminal 
penalties like limb amputation and flogging 
the government says most egyptian laws already conform to 
sharia but they do not include the codes corporal punishments

leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini a landmark in arab history 
it was the sweet nectar which turned to bitter poison for 
khomeini it said 
khomeini had compared his acceptance of a unbrokered 
ceasefire with iraq in august to drinking poison 
the iranians captured faw in february 1986 and held it for two 
years despite iraqi efforts to dislodge their forces from 
marshlands around the battered oil terminal town of faw

the author of president bushs new plan for 
encouraging commerical banks to voluntarily reduce third world debt 
told congress on monday not to expect immediate results 
despite a 36 billion package put together last week by the 
international monetary fund to support economic reform in mexico 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said it is too optimistic to 
assume that commercial banks will immediately agree on how much to 
cut mexicos debt to them 
mexican finance minister pedro aspe was scheduled to begin 
negotiations this week with a consortium of 13 us commercial 
banks holding a large portion of mexicos 100 billion debt 
brady told members of the house approporations committee that 
the 13 billion firstyear portion of the imf package would depend 
on mexico negotiating debt reductions from the commercial banks 
however he said he expects negotiations to be lengthy before 
any agreement is announced 
to be dead honest with you i think you ought to be prepared 
to wait longer he said lets not try to make the first of 
these transactions so big that it scares everybody to death we 
dont have to throttle the train up to a 100 miles per hour when 
were first getting started 
but rep thomas coleman rmo said there is a short time 
span for the commercial banks to step forward 
the treasury secretary said he was disappointed that the imf 
package announced last week did not include provisions for 
socalled debtequity swaps 
in those deals a bank will forgive a portion of the principle 
or interest on a loan in exchange for an investment share in newly 
privatized enterprises that formerly were operated by the debtor 
countrys government 
without naming them brady said he knew of two countries 
negotiating deals to write down by 20 percent loans for electric 
power stations that would be converted from public to private 
ownership 
the parties involved he said believe that amount of money will 
be returned to the countries in the form of native capital that had 
earlier fled it 
brady attempted to dispel fears that taxpayers will end up 
bailing out banks with third world loans through arrangement by 
governmentfunded multilateral lending agencies like the imf and 
world bank to guarantee that commercial banks that reduce the loans 
will be paid the remaining balance 
i dont think anybodys going to be involved in putting more 
money into it than were already putting into it he said 
but because countries can leverage money from the imf and world 
bank and the loans held by commerical banks are being sold for only 
25 to 60 percent of their face value he said the plan would allow 
countries to buy back a face value amount equal to 10 times the 
seed money he said 
you can get a 10 reduction for every dollar you spend on the 
process brady said in addition he said 9 in procurement 
comes back our way for every dollar of us taxpayer funds 
funneled to debtor countries through the imf and world bank

house speaker jim wright chose a friendly 
audience monday to deny violating house rules in his financial 
dealings and to call for a swift resolution so congress could tend 
to its business 
i know in my heart i have not violated any rules of that 
institution wright told 3000 delegates to an aflcio building 
and construction trades department conference i love that 
institution 
those comments were similar to the denial he issued last week in 
advance of the house ethics committees report alleging 69 
violations of house rules 
but unlike last week wright did not give a detailed answer to 
each of the charges against him instead he delivered a lengthy 
defense of democratic party ideals and his career and asked that 
the committee allow him to come before it to counter the charges 
immediately surely within a week 
we cannot delay and be bogged down in acrimony wright said 
life is too short for that our problems are too big for that 
the texas democrat said he was prepared to live up to the 
ultimate outcome of the investigation and then said as long as i 
live im going to be working for the kind of country that doesnt 
accept second best as good enough 
it appeared that he had ended his brief discussion of the ethics 
charges and was moving on to other topics when he suddenly added 
sometimes assertive and bold leadership draws the ire of powerful 
forces in this country 
at the outset of the speech it was not clear whether wright 
would address the charges at all 
he entered to a standing ovation that lasted several minutes and 
a warm introduction from robert a georgine president of the 
building and construction trades department who saluted wright as 
a man of honor and a man of integrity 
hes now under bombardment by the same rightwing element that 
for years has bombarded us georgine said on a huge screeen 
behind georgine was the picture of wright used on the cover of a 
book that figures prominently in the allegations of ethics 
violations 
wright opened his speech with a few jokes flashing his wide 
grin and saying the lengthy applause had almost embarrassed me 
but not quite 
there were more jokes about the welcoming 
there are two kinds of people in this world who appreciate 
flattery men and women 
then came stories about how building trades unions had helped 
him in his 18 elections to congress 
i feel at home here wright said to more applause 
he listed democratic programs from the great depression to the 
last session of congress and promised more in the year to come 
and before turning to the subject that had brought a dozen 
television cameras to the basement ballroom of a washington hotel 
wright talked a bit about himself 
i am 66 years of age he told the hushe audience i have 
had the great privilege of serving more than half my life in 
the congress of the united states thanks to the friendship and the 
confidence of my colleagues i was elected speaker of the house i 
think it is the greatest honor that can come to any lawmaker

a top soviet psychiatric expert said monday that 
authorities in the past had abused the legal rights of mental 
patients in the soviet union 
the soviet union pulled out of the world psychiatric association 
in 1983 after reports that political dissidents were held in soviet 
psychiatric hospitals the reports probably would have caused the 
soviets to be expelled from the association 
the organizations executive committee voted at a meeting in 
madrid spain on march 29 to readmit the soviets a decision yet 
to be ratified by the associations general assembly 
abuses have been committed in our psychiatry during the recent 
decades the official tass news agency quoted alexander karpov 
the chief psychiatric expert in the ministry of public health as 
saying the way psychiatric patients were treated was not always 
correct 
karpov spoke at the opening of a threeday symposium on the law 
and mental health attended by psychiatrists and lawyers from a 
dozen countries 
karpov without mentioning the treatment of dissidents said 
denying legal rights to psychiatric patients must be eliminated 
this is why a decree was issued in the ussr last year 
laying down new rules of psychiatric treatment tass quoted him 
as saying 
it gives the patients definite legal guarantees showing that 
they are no longer rightless in the eyes of public health organs 
karpov said they now have the right to call in a lawyer to 
complain to the prosecutor or the court of justice 
the symposium is being attended by psychiatrists and lawyers 
specializing in psychiatric cases from the united states canada 
the netherlands switzerland denmark west germany east germany 
bulgaria hungary czechoslovakia poland and cuba tass said 
in early march a team of us psychiatrists and lawyers were 
allowed to interview 27 patients in an unprecedented twoweek tour 
of soviet mental hospitals 
after the tour a group spokesman praised the soviet union for 
its openness but said it was still impossible to tell whether 
patients were being held for their political views an abuse of 
psychiatry the soviets have pledged to end

wildlife officials on monday staked 
out a red oak tree by a reservoir where the first pair of bald 
eagles to nest in massachusetts in nearly 80 years is believed to 
be guarding a clutch of eggs 
the evidence is still purely circumstantial but the female 
refused to leave the nest when approached and the male has been 
bringing her food said ellie horwitz a spokeswoman for the 
state division of fisheries and wildlife 
the male is ross one of the first pairs of eagles raised and 
released in the restoration program begun in 1982 his mate is 
another stateraised bird released in 1985 ms horwitz said 
over the last seven summers the state has raised and released 42 
bald eagles at the quabbin reservoir in western massachusetts 
two other bald eagle pairs built nests at the reservoir this 
spring and there is a possibility that a second pair could also 
have eggs ms horwitz said the third pair are believed to be 
younger birds practicing housekeeping as ross and his mate did last 
spring she said 
the last active bald eagle nest in massachusetts was reported in 
sandwich on cape cod in 1910 she said 
at least four other states new york pennsylvania new 
hampshire and new jersey also have active nests this spring 
state officials said 
the bald eagle looks to be one of our success stories said 
paul nickerson of the us fish and wildlife service the 
breeding population is increasing from 5 percent to 10 percent 
annually 
he estimated the 48 lower states have about 2200 breeding pairs 
of bald eagles up from 500 to 600 pairs in the 1960s 
nickerson credited the banning of ddt and other pesticides 
which weaken eagle egg shells and a drop in shooting and trapping 
it may take several years for eagles which mate for life and 
return to the same nests year after year to learn how to become 
successful parents ms horwitz said normally they lay from one to 
three eggs and the young hatch in midmay she said

the government is planning to increase its 
efforts to assure that the medicare program does not pay medical 
bills for which private insurance carriers are liable 
the secretary of health and human services louis sullivan 
asked office of management and budget director richard darman in a 
letter friday to release 75 million to begin the steppedup 
enforcement plan 
the hhs contingency funds would be used to make revisions in the 
contracts with medicare claims processors to require them to match 
their private insurance records with their medicare rolls sullivan 
said this would enable them to identify claims where private 
policies are liable for the bill 
the coverage issue stems from an overlap between medicare and 
private health plans for elderly people who continue to work 
under the law medicare is liable only for charges not covered 
by the elderly employees private health plan 
current efforts by the health care financing administration 
results in annual medicare savings of more than 18 billion but 
hcfa has known for some time that there is potential for even 
greater savings sullivan said 
sullivan said the department which includes hcfa would again 
propose legislation that would require all health insurers to 
provide information identifying those enrolled in their plans who 
may be eligible for medicare 
although our efforts to convince the office of management and 
budget of the need for this legislation have been unsuccessful 
recent findings of an hhs task force as well as news reports of 
potential savings and possibile fraud highlight the need for 
greater efforts sullivan said 
the justice department has said it is reviewing a number of 
cases referred by hhs in which authorities believe medicare paid 
medical bills for which private carriers were liable 
the departments civil division recently filed lawsuits against 
two private insurance companies to recover money the government 
claims should not have been paid by medicare 
the wall street journal reported earlier this month that its 
investigation of hcfa records shows as much as 10 billion may have 
been misspent over the last six years because the agency has failed 
to correct the billing problem 
medicare currently is paying about 67 million this year to 88 
commercial insurance companies that serve as claims processors to 
identify claims where private insurance carriers sometimes their 
own are liable 
hhs inspector general richard kusserow and others have said they 
are concerned about a possible conflict of interest in these 
companies roles as a medicare contractor and commercial insurance 
carrier

the leaning tower of pisa will be measured 
every three months instead of just once a year to see if seasonal 
change affects the landmark scientists said monday 
since 1913 the angle of the 800yearold towers lean has been 
measured every year in june this year a reading was taken in 
march and other measurements will be taken in june september and 
december 
there is no particular cause for alarm said brunetto palla 
a professor at the university of pisa we are curious to see 
whether the change of seasons has an affect on the tower 
the collapse of a 900yearold tower in pavia on march 17 has 
raised concerns over the stability and safety of italys monuments 
four people were killed 
the march measurements showed no notable variation from june 
1988 palla said 
the monument began to lean shortly after its construction in 
1173 when the soil beneath the 180foot marble monument shifted

president pw botha said monday 
the government will react with magnanimity if jailed black 
leader nelson mandela offers to promote a peaceful settlement in 
south africa 
bothas speech in parliament appeared no different from previous 
government offers to free the 70yearold african national congress 
leader on condition he renounces his guerrilla organizations use 
of violence mandela has refused 
it would be futile for the government to release mandela if his 
freedom led to heightened conflict or if he was rearrested botha 
said 
he cautioned he could not take any steps that may lead to the 
rejection of democratic principles and the destruction of private 
initiative and free enterprise this appeared to be his view of 
what south africa would be like under the anc which espouses 
socialism 
for these reasons the case of mr mandela is being treated 
with circumspection said botha 73 who plans to retire after 
elections expected by midseptember 
mandela considered by many south african blacks as their 
paramount leader has been imprisoned since 1962 on a life sentence 
for plotting to sabotage the whiteminority government he has been 
living in a staff house at a prison farm near cape town since he 
recovered from a bout of tuberculosis last year 
if mandela shows he is willing to contribute to a peaceful 
settlement in south africa the government will react with 
magnanimity botha said 
on another topic the south african leader acknowledged he has 
had differences recently with members of his national party but 
said he will ensure the disputes do not become unbridgeable 
divisions 
there should not be attempts to drive a wedge between us he 
said 
botha suffered a stroke in january and shortly after resigned 
as party leader several nationalist officials and newspapers then 
urged botha to step down as president in favor of the new party 
leader education minister fw de klerk

eleven prominent scientists are urging the 
government not to rush into new production of tritium an important 
constituent of nuclear weapons until the soviet union has been 
sounded out about reductions in the nuclear stockpile 
tritium decays and must be replenished in nuclear weapons from 
time to time none has been produced in the united states since the 
aging reactors at the energy departments savannah river sc 
plant were shut down a year ago for safety upgrading 
officials have testified that at least one reactor must be 
restarted by the end of the year or the need for new tritium will 
become critical some members of congress have said failure to 
restart production would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament 
the energy department plans to spend 75 billion to build two 
new tritiumproducing reactors that could be ready in 10 years 
in a statement dated sunday the 11 scientists said that once 
the options were studied it would be surprising not to find that 
tritium requirements to maintain a fully adequate stockpile of 
weapons could be met for about five years without additional 
production 
it should not take as long as five years however to determine 
whether the start and other armsreduction negotiations are likely 
to produce cuts sufficient to permit continued suspension of 
tritium production the scientists said 
their statement was organized by the nuclear control institute 
which has advocated a similar position the signers included two 
nobel prize winners and three former staff members of the los 
alamos national laboratory the principal nuclear weapons research 
and development installation 
a spokesman for the energy department did not immediately return 
a telephone call seeking comment 
the fusion of atoms of tritium which is hydrogen containing two 
neutrons instead of none is the driving force of thermonuclear 
weapons other weapons use the neutron burst from the fusion of 
small amounts of tritium to accelerate or boost the fission 
reactions of plutonium reducing the amount of plutonium required 
for the same explosive yield 
weapons are loaded with a surplus of tritium and reloaded when 
all the surplus is gone the reloading cycle is a secret and 
presumably varies from weapon to weapon the scientists noted 
published reports that the reloading cycle is four to six years for 
current weapons and 10 years for new submarinelaunched missiles 
the scientists advocated more frequent reloading with a smaller 
surplus and the use of tritium from warheads withdrawn under treaty 
terms or simply retired 
some may already have been taken into account and some may 
not provide much relief but certainly these and any other similar 
examples should be exploited before it is concluded that there is 
any imminent crisis the group said 
the 11 scientists are hans bethe retired professor of physics 
at cornell university freeman dyson professor of physics at the 
institute for advanced study in princeton nj herman feshbach

technology val fitch professor of physics at princeton

authorities asked workers to ignore calls 
for a general strike tuesday that would be the first mass protest 
against the military government since 1987 
the general workers central the countrys largest labor 
movement called the work stoppage to protest banishment of its two 
top leaders involved in the last major protest strike in october 
1987 
that strike against the government of president augusto pinochet 
failed to halt most activities in the country but it ignited 
violence that left three people dead 
the government said monday it has taken all the necessary 
measures to maintain public order and guarantee the rights of 
those wanting to work 
interior subsecretary gonzalo garcia urged workers not to be 
afraid to go to work tomorrow 
garcia did not elaborate on the antistrike measures taken by 
authorities in the past the government has mobilized thousands of 
police and army troops during such protests 
a series of mass protests shook the military government from 
1983 to 1986 leaving at least 200 dead 
the federation urged all the nations workers to boycott work 
tuesday and to keep their children home from school 
a number of trade unions and a coalition of 17 opposition 
parties have said they will join the strike opposition 
politicians however have openly said they do not expect a 
significant work stoppage 
the president of the oppositioncontrolled workers central 
manuel bustos and vice president arturo martinez were sentenced to 
internal exile in small provincial towns last year 
they were charged with promoting violence and breaking state 
security law 
the federation also is demanding an increase of the minimum wage 
from 55 to 100 a month 
diego olivares acting president of the labor federation said 
monday the strike should be entirely peaceful but some leftist 
groups are calling for street demonstrations in santiago and other 
cities police said the demonstrations will not be allowed 
three bombs went off in santiago on sunday night causing damage 
but no casualties no one claimed responsibility but police said 
they found prostrike pamphlets nearby

an organization representing federal employees 
filed suit monday to prevent the closing of us military bases 
charging that the law creating the federal commission that 
recommends base closings is unconstitutional 
the lawsuit filed in us district court by the national 
federation of federal employees against the united states said the 
base closure and realignment act violates the constitution by 
improperly delegating the important legislative function of 
regulating the disposition of government property to the unelected 
secretary of defense and to the unelected members of the 
commission 
the suit also said that the constitution requires that congress 
provide for the nations defense the base closure law calls for 
the commissions recommendations to be accepted in their entirety 
and denies congress the right to determine the logistical 
arrangements for the us military forces in the 21st century 
the suit said 
the union represents 5000 employees at george air force base 
and norton air force base in california and chanute air force base 
in illinois all are scheduled to be closed 
congress approved legislation in october 1988 requiring the 
defense secretary to close and realign bases according to the 
panels report two months later the commission recommended 
closing 86 bases partly closing five more and changing the mission 
of 54 others 
former defense secretary frank carlucci approved the 
commissions report in january 
the house is scheduled to vote tuesday on a resolution to 
disapprove the base closing recommendations last month the house 
armed services committee by a vote of 434 supported the 
recommendations the full house is expected to do the same 
james m peirce president of the union said the commission 
based its decision on erroneous and outofdate information to 
put it simply the commission blew it and it doesnt appear as if 
the majority of congress gives a damn 
the union is seeking a declaratory judgment from the courts on 
whether the base closure and realignment act is unconstitutional

experts and news reports said monday that italian 
scientists had created nuclear fusion at room temperature in a 
small container 
scientists at the national agency for alternative energy in 
frascati outside rome measured neutrons being emitted from their 
experiment said a scientist familiar with the work 
they saw a lot of neutrons that means fusion said 
francesco celani of the national institute of nuclear physics who 
worked with the frascati group 
the scientists were trying to copy an experiment by martin 
fleischmann of the university of southampton england and stanley 
pons of the university of utah who announced last month they had 
achieved nuclear fusion in a glass beaker at room temperature 
fleischmann and pons claimed their experiment yielded four times 
the energy put into it 
if they are correct the result could be a relatively 
inexpensive energy source that is virtually inexhaustible no 
scientists have managed to duplicate the energy burst reported in 
the experiment however and many experts believe the two 
scientists made a mistake 
several universities have said they confirmed parts of the 
fleischmannpons experiment 
another researcher steven jones of brigham young university in 
utah says he also created nuclear fusion but the energy output was 
virtually nil 
pierluigi sani public relations director of the frascati 
agency refused to confirm italian media reports that scientists 
there had achieved fusion a news conference has been scheduled for 
tuesday and officially we cant say anything until tomorrow 
he said 
celani said the scientists at frascati checked for neutrons but 
not energy emission 
fusion is the process powering the sun in which tremendous 
amounts of energy are released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms 
fuse by contrast nuclear power plants get energy from fission 
the splitting of atoms 
most scientists seeking a way to harness nuclear fusion have 
used extremely high temperatures and machines the size of houses to 
jam atoms together 
jones pons and fleischmann used electrical current to herd 
hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes where the hydrogen atoms 
apparently fused because of proximity 
in the frascati experiment scientists forced hydrogen atoms 
into titanium and according to celani lowered the temperature of 
the experiment to enhance fusion

fugitive financier robert vesco was 
added monday as a defendant in a drugconspiracy indictment 
accused of persuading his cuban hosts to allow cocaineladen 
airplanes to fly over cuba en route to the bahamas 
vesco a fugitive since the nixon administration was indicted 
on one count alleging he conspired to import cocaine into the 
united states 
vesco is believed to have lived in cuba since 1982 after 
bouncing around the bahamas the caribbean and costa rica he has 
been wanted in the united states since 1973 on charges of looting 
an investment firm investors overseas services of 224 million 
the federal indictment charged that in october 1984 colombian 
cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas sent a messenger from nicaragua 
to cuba asking vesco to use his influence in cuba to arrange for 
lehders aircraft to fly over cuba on smuggling runs from nicaragua 
to andros island in the bahamas 
a few days later vesco in the presence of another 
individual supplied lehders messenger with a document approving 
the cocaine overflights the other person was not identified in the 
indictment 
the united states and cuba dont have normal diplomatic 
relations or an extradition agreement the cuban government has 
denied playing host to vesco 
vescos name was added as 15 other defendants including 
lehders former wife faced arraignment in federal court in what 
prosecutors call the son of lehder cocaineconspiracy case 
lehder is believed to be one of the architects of the medellin 
cartel a colombian drugsmuggling organization that is blamed for 
80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the united states 
lehder 39 was convicted in may in jacksonville of cocaine 
smuggling and operating a continuing criminal enterprise and is 
serving a life sentence plus 135 years in federal prison in marion 
ill 
most of those charged in the latest indictment unsealed in 
march were mentioned in testimony during lehders trial 
in addition key members of the medellin cartel also were 
indicted as well as everette bannister a nassau businessman and 
close associate of bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
bannister and the reputed leaders of the cartel pablo escobar 
gaviria jose gonzalo rodriquez gacha jorge ochoa vasquez fabi 
ochoa vasquez and gonzalo mejia remained at large monday 
but 15 codefendents most of whom were freed on bail after 
their arrests in march were ordered to appear before us 
magistrate harvey schlesinger they included yemel nacel who was 
once married to lehder 
all 15 are accused of playing relatively minor roles in the drug 
dealing some of which occurred as long as a decade ago 
ms nacel who now lives in new york city is accused only of 
helping count some of lehders money in 1978 in beverly hills 
calif 
also facing new charges is jack carlton reed the codefendant 
in lehders trial who is serving a 15year prison sentence reed 
faces a possible life sentence if convicted of operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
assistant us attorney ernst mueller who along with former 
us attorney robert w merkle prosecuted lehder said he expects 
to face strenuous defense arguments including the statute of 
limitations and duration of the alleged conspiracy from 1974 to 
1989

the house approved legislation monday to make 
the martin luther king jr federal holiday commission a permanent 
agency with authorized spending of 500000 
the legislation sponsored by rep john conyers dmich passed 
the house on a 30584 vote a similar measure is pending in the 
senate which failed to act before adjourning last year on a 
housepassed bill to make the commission permanent 
the commission was established by congress in 1984 to 
institutionalize the federal holiday in honor of the slain civil 
rights leader authorization for the commission expires may 1 
conyers told the house on monday that the commission is needed 
more now than ever before because most young people have no first 
hand knowledge of the civil rights movement 
while the commission has received no federal funds in the past 
conyers and other supporters of the bill argued that the 500000 
annual authorization is needed because private funds for the 
panels work have been drying up 
the senate bill sponored by sen sam nunn dga would extend 
the commission for five years at a cost of 15 million

barbara bush saying nearly all of societys 
benefits flow from literacy praised a young woman monday who 
learned to read and broke free from the welfare cycle 
addressing more than 3000 volunteer leaders at a united way 
national conference the first lady said you are at the heart of 
virtually every worthy cause there is 
mrs bush praised united way for its help and funding of such 
organizations as red cross and the boy scouts and girl scouts and 
causes as diverse as combatting child abuse and comforting young 
aids patients 
then turning to the cause that has been the focus of her own 
volunteer leadership mrs bush said as many as 25 percent of 
americans struggle with literacy 
literacy is everybodys business she said the need for 
literacy is linked to every other important need in society 
housing nutrition health employment 
to illustrate the point mrs bushs address was followed by a 
videotape about evelyn vega a 29yearold stamford conn 
resident and mother of three children who broke 11 years of 
welfare dependence by learning to read and getting a job 
mrs vega dropped out of high school during her first pregnancy 
and was the third generation of her family to live on public 
assistance the film showed her receiving reading lessons from 
united way volunteer paige oristano and working as the assistant 
manager at a fastfood restaurant 
after the film mrs vega who since has become a united way 
volunteer read from a letter she had written mrs bush to thank 
her for supporting literacy programs 
it is hard and scary to get off welfare you cannot do it by 
yourself people like me need someone out there to teach them how 
to make that dream come true because it is all new to them i 
still feel scared she said her voice choking with tears 
mrs vega presented the first lady with a copy of the letter and 
the two women hugged briefly as the gathering rose to its feet and 
applauded overcome with emotion mrs vega kissed mrs bushs 
cheek 
later monday mrs bush traveled to the museum of science and 
industry on the south side where she officially opened an exhibit 
on the brain and learning disabilities 
the permanent exhibit called learning and learning 
disabilties explorations of the human brain is the first of its 
kind in the nation 
this is truly an exhibit of hope the first lady said i 
applaud the museum for addressing this misunderstood subject in a 
public forum 
the exhibit uses touch screens video monitors mannequins and 
giant brain models to show how the brain changes as it learns and 
how disabilties alter that process

here are excerpts from the summary of the 
special counsels report to the house ethics committee on 
allegations against house speaker jim wright 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the facts discovered during the preliminary inquiry demonstrate 
that wright has violated at times repeatedly special outside 
counsel believes that wright committed 116 violations of house 
rules house rule xliii clauses 1 conduct reflecting 
discreditably on the house and 4 accepting improper gifts house 
rule xliv failing to disclose income and gifts house rule xlvii 
clause 1 exceeding the limit on outside earned income code of 
ethics for government service consideration 5 receiving favors 
which may influence performance of government duties and 2 usc 
441i retaining excessive honoraria these violations occurred 
over the period from 1978 through 1988 during which wright 
committed the following acts 
in 1979 wright accepted an interest in a successful natural 
gas well from texas oilman the late monty moncrief which was an 
unreported gift worth approximately 8200090000 
from 1984 through 1987 wright received approximately 54600 
in unreported gifts honoraria and other outside income from 
lobbyists and special interest groups styled as royalties from 
the sale of his book reflections of a public man 
from time to time from 1978 through 1988 wright received 
approximately 150000 in unreported gifts from texas real estate 
developer george mallick in the form of reduced interest on a 
loan procurement of a loan salary paid to betty wright for work 
not performed free and belowmarket value housing in fort worth 
and the use of a 1979 cadillac seville in washington dc 
in 1986 and 1987 wright improperly used his position in the 
house leadership to exercise undue influence on the actions taken 
by the federal home loan bank board to control the burgeoning 
savings and loan crisis in texas and elsewhere 
the following is a summary of facts discovered and conclusions 
reached by special outside counsel on each of the six areas of 
inquiry set forth in the committees resolution a detailed 
exposition of the preliminary inquiry is provided beginning on page 
25 of this report

beginning in late 1978 wright intervened with the state 
depatment and the egyptian government on behalf of the neptune oil 
company in order to secure for neptune an opportunity to resolve a 
dispute with egypt over the right to explore develop and operate 
offshore oil fields in the gulf of suez neptune had a contract 
with the state of israel to explore and develop the 
israelioccupied territory however as a result of the camp david 
accords in september 1978 and the subsequent peace treaty 
negotiations israel was required to return the occupied sinai and 
gulf of suez territory to egypt relinquishing all rights to the 
oil fields without compensation egypt would not recognize 
neptunes rights under the israeli contract thus neptune stood to 
lose its investment and expected profit from the operation of the 
oil fields 
wright introduced richard moncrief and other neptune principals 
to state department officials contacted secretary of state cyrus 
vance and egyptian ambassador ashraf ghorbal and personally 
delivered a letter to egyptian president anwar sadat while he was 
in washington wrights intervention on behalf of neptune oil does 
not in itself appear to have violated any law or ethical standard 
however the facts of certain investment opportunities provided 
to wright by the moncrief family at the same time he was 
intervening for neptune demonstrate that wright improperly received 
a gift valued at more than 100 from monty moncrief a person with 
a direct interest in legislation before congress we were unable to 
establish with the required certainty that the gift was 
compensation for wrights intercession on behalf of neptune oil 
wright accepted the opportunity to purchase part of the moncrief 
family interest in two easttexas gas wells from monty moncrief 
the late patriarch of the moncrief family who was for many years 
active in washington dc as a lobbyist for the independent 
petroleum association the first opportunity the whatley well 
appears to have been an ordinary personal business transaction 
for example wright received a written offer to participate in 
drilling the well accepted the offer by written commitment to pay 
his share of all drilling costs obtained financing to pay for his 
drilling costs and actually paid those costs all prior to the time 
gas was discovered in the well on july 11 1979 put another way 
he risked the amount of the drilling costs against the chance that 
the well would be dry had the well been dry the investment would 
have been lost 
once gas was discovered in the whatley well although it was 
commercially productive it was clear that it would not be the 
investment predicted by the moncriefs production and therefore 
profit from the well if any would be substantially less than had 
been anticipated 
in contrast in wrights second investment opportunity the l 
d williams no 1 well wright made no written commitment to pay 
drilling costs and did not obtain financing or pay for any costs 
until october 1979 long after gas was discovered in that well on 
june 27 1979 thus unlike the whatley investment wright invested 
in williams no 1 already knowing that it was a commercially 
successful well the risk of losing his investment which made 
whatley an ordinary business transaction was absent in williams 
no 1 thus wright received a gift worth aproximately 
8200090000 the difference between the drilling costs and the 
increased value of the well after gas was discovered wright failed 
to disclose his receipt of this gift on his financial disclosure 
statement for 1979 
wright also deferred paying two moncrief invoices for williams 
no 1 drilling costs without paying interest on the unpaid balance 
one invoice for 866821 remained unpaid from october 19 1979 
until september 4 1980 a second invoice for 770364 remained 
unpaid from april 18 1980 until july 1 1980 although it appears 
that wright may have received interestfree loans from monty 
moncrief for 868821 for 10 months and 770364 for two months 
gifts worth nearly 1200 it is impossible to determine whether 
moncriefs failures to collect the overdue balances were intended 
as gifts or were merely bookkeeping oversights thus we cannot 
conclude with the required certainty that moncriefs failures to 
collect interest were gifts to wright 
in 1984 at a time when the whatley well was shut in ie 
had temporarily ceased production wright asked monty moncrief to 
buy back his interest in the well wright was receiving no income 
from the well and consequently he made no payments on his loan from 
continental national bank the banks chairman stated that under 
those circumstances he would have required other arrangements for 
repayment of the nearly 20000 outstanding balance 
monty moncrief agreed to buy back the whatley interest for 
20000 while moncriefs repurchase of wrights interest in the 
whatley well appears to have been a favor to wright it also 
appears to have been purchased at about the market value of the 
interest therefore there was no gift to wright

a 42 million drilling platform that 
capsized in heavy seas off south carolina 10 days ago drifted more 
than 280 miles to the northeast before finally sinking off north 
carolina officials said monday 
the 27500ton structure sank shortly before 1 am sunday about 
62 miles east of cape lookout nc coast guard chief warrant 
officer greg johnson said 
the platform was being towed from puerto rico to gloucester 
mass for a pipeline project when it capsized april 7 no one was 
aboard it the platform known as a jackup rig was used for 
exploratory drilling and other underwater projects 
authorities are not sure why it overturned but johnson said 
heavy seas contributed the coast guard is investigating 
after the platform capsized it slowly sank drifting northeast 
with the gulf stream johnson said a tug stayed with the rig to 
make sure no ships ran into it he said 
an estimated 500 gallons of oil hydraulic oil and diesel fuel 
were aboard the platform but officials dont feel that presents a 
major environmental threat because the platform sank well off the 
coast in water 1 miles deep johnson said 
the platform owned by maitland brothers inc of littlestown 
pa was built in 1978 by bethleham steel for 42 million said

dec 1 1987 after a threeyear manhunt for the killer of a large 
group of elderly women between october 1984 and january 1986 
the women all were between 60 and 83 years of age and nearly 
all were strangled stabbed or smothered in their homes after being 
severely beaten paulin told police that he stalked the women and 
forced his way into their homes 
paulin had a record of arrests for thefts and drugs but police 
said the killings did not seem to be linked exclusively to money 
they said that during the interrogation paulin had trouble 
distinguishing between all the attacks he had committed 
paulins fingerprints were found in the homes of at least seven 
murder victims police said at the time 
prison authorities who declined to be identified in keeping 
with prison policy said paulin tested positive for aids in 1986 
and last year began suffering symptoms of the disease that attacks 
and destroys the bodys immune system 
paulin fell into a coma several days ago and was admitted to the 
intensive care unit of fresnes prison hospital over the weekend he 
died early monday authorities said without providing any other 
details 
before his death paulin blamed several of the murders on his 
accomplice jeanthierry mathuin who was arrested shortly after 
paulin and remains in custody 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers

north korea canceled two negotiating 
sessions saying monday that south koreas arrest of a dissident 
who visited the communist nation was part of a plan to undermine 
efforts for better relations 
two letters from pyongyang called off talks set for tuesday on a 
possible joint team for the 1990 asian games in beijing and an 
april 26 session on arranging a meeting of the two prime ministers 
the action appeared to threaten future negotiations between 
south korea and north korea on easing their bitter rivalry in a 
land divided since world war ii 
north korea proposed the talks resume in july but seoul 
officials said continuing the dialogue would have to be considered 
they spoke on condition of anonymity 
both messages from north korea were delivered at panmunjom the 
truce village at the border and released by the government of 
president roh taewoo in seoul 
they criticized south korea for arresting the rev moon ikhwan 
for his visit last month to pyongyang where he discussed 
reunification of the peninsula with president kim il sung 
moon was arrested thursday on his return to seoul via japan and 
charged with aiding antistate groups and making an illegal visit 
to north korea 
about 10000 war veterans and supporters shouting 
anticommunist slogans demonstrated monday in puchon about 12 
miles west of seoul denouncing moons trip and leftists trying 
to destroy freedom and peace through revolution according to the 
south korean news agency yonhap 
thousands of radical students in seoul and elsewhere fought riot 
police or rallied to demand moons release yonhap said no 
injuries or arrests were reported 
north korea said moons arrest proved seoul did not want to 
improve relations it is illegal for south koreans to visit north 
korea without government permission 
paik nam jun a senior north korean official said in the letter 
suspending political talks that the charge against moon of dealing 
with an antistate organization could only refer to north korea 
as a result he said the smooth conduct of the northsouth 
talks has been made impossible paik said north korea hoped the 
atmosphere would improve and meetings could resume in july 
the two nations have tried to improve relations through a series 
of talks that began in 1988 but with little success 
when moon went to pyongyang the seoul government cracked down 
on dissidents and said moon wanted to help north korea seize 
control of the entire peninsula south korea says talks with the 
north may be conducted only by the government 
dissidents in the south have held violent protests demanding the 
downfall of rohs government but they have little public support 
and moons visit to north korea appears to have damaged their cause 
many south koreans who fear north korea were infuriated by the 
visit television showed moon embracing kim who ordered the 1950 
invasion that started the korean war 
the two koreas technically remain at war because no peace treaty 
was signed after the war ended in 1953 
in other korean developments monday 
daewoo motor co a joint venture between the usbased 
general motors corp and south koreas daewoo group halted 
production in response to a wave of strikes by workers seeking 
higher wages similar walkouts forced carmakers hyundai motor co 
and kia motor corp to stop production last week officials said 
the job actions threaten south koreas economy also monday 5000 
taxi drivers threatened to strike for higher wages and improved 
working conditions 
eight senior lawmakers of south koreas second largest 
opposition party the reunification democratic party led by kim 
youngsam offered to resign over a scandal involving a party 
lawmaker who bribed a rival candidate to drop out of a national 
assembly election it was not clear if kim would accept the 
resignations

luxembourg a nation smaller than the state of 
rhode island marks its 150th anniversary tuesday determined to 
survive among the great powers that spawned its independence 
a speck on the world map tucked between france west germany 
and belgium the grand duchy has used its position on the 
crossroads of europes main cultures to maintain one of the highest 
standards of living in the world 
dont mix us up with countries that are even smaller than 
ours said lex roth a government spokesman 
luxembourg with a population of 372000 became independent of 
the netherlands under the 1839 treaty of london signed by the 
european powers 
since then its fate has been determined by close cooperation 
with its neighbors an inevitable option for a nation that covers 
only 999 square miles rhode island is 1214 square miles 
it is essential a small state like us can survive and develop 
by keeping its independence only within great frameworks prime 
minister jacques santer who heads a centerleft coalition 
government said recently 
luxembourg is a founding member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and an ardent member of the european economic 
community 
it is home for a number of eec institutions including the 
european investment bank and the european court of justice 
luxembourg license plates display the eec flag of 12 gold stars in 
a field of royal blue 
tuesdays independence celebrations will be attended by foreign 
dignitaries from many nations including west germany britain the 
soviet union and france 
in recent decades luxembourg has become a financial center the 
city of luxembourg with a population of 75000 has more than 100 
banks from around the world and the banking industry employs 10 
percent of the work force and accounts for a quarter of the 
national income 
the financial institutions have helped keep unemployment at 
about 15 percent by far the lowest in the 12nation eec 
immigrants account for 27 percent of the population the highest 
in the eec 
problems involving immigrants do exist roth said but without 
the violence that mars coexistence in many other european nations 
although they have no voting rights our portuguese and italian 
fellow citizens have all the same social rights as luxembourgers 
he said 
to improve integration a relaxed naturalization process in 
recent years has made it easier for immigrants to gain citizenship 
language poses a problem for foreigners from southern europe 
roth said most luxembourgers speak german and french along with 
luxembourgish a german dialect 
but roth added were a good blend the french are more 
impulsive the germans more heavyhanded giving luxembourgers 
balance and patience

here are excerpts from the statement from the 
house ethics committee which accompanied its statement of alleged 
violations by house speaker jim wright these excerpts focus on 
those matters where the committee did not find reason to 
believe wright had violated house rules and on the one matter the 
committee is still pursuing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on june 9 1988 the committee on standards of official conduct 
voted to undertake a preliminary inquiry into certain assertions of 
improper conduct raised against house speaker james c wright jr 
the resolution of preliminary inquiry indicated the committees 
decision to ascertain whether representative wright committed 
violations of the code of official conduct or a law rule 
regulation or other standard of conduct involving 
1 the circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts on behalf of a 
constituent with whom he had an interest in a private gas well 
venture 
2 the circumstances surrounding intervention in a matter before 
the department of the interior on behalf of texas oil amp gas company 
3 whether campaign funds were used directly or indirectly to 
pay for publication of a book from which he received a 55 percent 
royalty 
4 whether government resources were improperly used to complete 
work on a book from which he received royalties 
5 the use of a condominium in fort worth texas and 
6 the possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with 
officials of the federal home loan bank board 
on july 26 1988 the committee appointed a special outside 
counsel hereinafter also referred to as counsel richard j 
phelan to conduct the preliminary inquiry the appointment was 
made to assure that the investigation would not be subject to 
claims that the matter was not handled in a fair and objective 
manner in addition the committee received sworn testimony from 
representative wright on september 14 1988 regarding the areas 
under investigation at the time of his appearance representative 
wright who was accompanied by his counsel also responded to 
questions asked by members of the committee because the committee 
did not complete the preliminary inquiry prior to the end of the 
100th congress the investigation was reauthorized for completion 
by the committee at its first meeting of the 101st congress on 
january 4 1989 
during the course of the preliminary inquiry the special 
outside counsel and his staff obtained the sworn testimony of over 
70 witnesses and examined thousands of documents based upon the 
information obtained mr phelan submitted a report to the 
committee on february 21 1989 containing counsels legal and 
factual findings 
subsequent to submission of the special outside counsels 
report the committee began a threephase decisionmaking process 
first the committee committed one full week which was designated 
as a reading period to allow all committee members to read 
counsels report and supporting materials in the second phase the 
committee received an extensive oral presentation by the special 
outside counsel and his staff and then by counsel for 
representative wright who were accorded an opportunity to hear and 
respond to the special outside counsels presentation during the 
second phase questions were asked of both counsel in order to 
obtain the greatest perspective on the matters addressed during the 
preliminary inquiry as well as to put to rest any concern that 
representative wright had been denied a full and fair opportunity 
to respond to the special outside counsels findings particularly 
where improper conduct was believed possibly to have occurred 
immediately upon the conclusion of the oral presentations the 
committee commenced phase three deliberations on the matters it 
had received 
the committee has completed its threephase review process and 
is today announcing the decisions made in the matter of the 
preliminary inquiry regarding representative wright 
first at the beginning of its deliberations the committee 
decided that it would release the complete text of the report of 
the special outside counsel simultaneous with any statement of 
alleged violation if such a statement was to be issued in 
connection with the subject case under rule 11b of the 
committees rules of procedure a statement of alleged violation 
may be issued if the committee determines there is reason to 
believe that the violation occurred should such an alleged 
violation become the subject of a disciplinary hearing under rule 
16e the committee staff has the burden of proof to establish 
clearly and convincingly by the evidence that fact of a 
violation second the committee decided that in the event it 
determined not to take action on matters addressed in the special 
outside counsels report it would make public its views on why no 
further action was being taken in order to avoid any claim that a 
matter not pursued was ignored as opposed to having been the 
subject of full committee consideration 
the discussion that follows is presented in the order in which 
specific areas of investigation were identified in the committees 
june 9 1988 resolution of preliminary inquiry as appropriate 
the discussion will either explain why the committee determined no 
further action should be taken or why a statement of alleged 
violation is being issued along with the complete text of the 
statement of alleged violation in this regard the committee 
emphasizes that while the following discussion presents those 
actions taken it is not intended either to set forth all of the 
facts or information obtained by the special outside counsel or to 
be viewed as a substitute for the detailed analysis contained in 
counsels february 21 1989 report 
individuals desirous of all relevant facts should consult the 
counsels report which is being made publicly available with this 
committee statement

drug czar william j bennett emerged monday 
from a meeting with officials from metropolitan washington but 
not mayor marion barry saying he found good will on their 
part to help his plan to combat drug abuse and related violence 
in the area 
barry whose administration was attacked by bennett a week ago 
as having failed to serve its citizens did not attend the 
meeting because he was testifying before a senate panel barry 
asked the senate appropriations committees district of columbia 
panel to assign 500 federal police officers to aid the drug fight 
bennetts meeting monday was marked by confusion among local 
officials about what the plan meant if the war on drugs would end 
at the district boundary line and whether they would get stuck with 
a new prison for washington criminals bennetts office invited the 
mayors of 11 local cities and eight counties as well as the 
governors of maryland and virginia 
the mayors and county officials who attended the hourlong 
meeting told reporters afterward they were pleased their areas 
would be included for intelligence gathering and law enforcement 
efforts by a new task force but baltimore mayor curt schmoke said 
there were still many more questions than answers today 
what i got from my understanding today was that this plan is 
evolving that this is just the first phase and thats why were 
still in a situation where there are still a lot of questions on 
our minds schmoke said 
bennetts criticism of and estrangement from barry has brought 
up questions about whether they can work together to combat the 
drug problem that has made washington the nations murder capital 
bennett said monday that he had not spoken directly with barry 
since the plan for washington was announced a week earlier but 
said he had invited the mayor to attend the meeting and he urged 
reporters to drop the issue 
we are not in the process of developing a relationship we are 
trying to respond to the drug problem bennett said this issue 
about whether marion barry and i will stand up in public and put 
our arms around each other is not the issue and you ought to get 
off it 
civil rights activist jesse jackson who met with bennett later 
in the day said the issue is not barry vs bennett it is 
drugpushing terrorists against a civilized society my sense is 
that barry is not feuding with mr bennett mr bennett certainly 
is not feuding with mr barry 
on sunday jackson had toured washington and played some 
basketball with barry and had criticized bennetts plan for 
washington saying it was too limited in scope but there was no 
public criticism of bennett on monday 
bennett selected washington as a test case for the drug war 
and has said he plans to use what he learns from the various 
approaches tried here to help him compile the national drug control 
strategy which is due in another 4 months 
washington became the nations murder capital last year with 372 
murders most of them drugrelated so far this year there have 
been 145 slayings compared with 96 at the same time in 1988 
bennetts plan among other things called for creation of a 
metropolitan area task force of law enforcement agents with of 57 
more federal officials construction of the pretrial detention 
facility and a 700bed federal prison 
among the questions still open was the location of a 500bed 
pretrial detention facility bennett praised the officials who 
attended the meeting monday for their understanding that with 
positions of responsibility come responsibilities to act on certain 
things but he criticized the notinmybackyard attitude 
many people have about prisons 
everybody wants to wage the war on drugs but there are fewer 
volunteers for the building of prisons bennett said we may 
not want prisons in our county or in our part of the state but in 
some areas the choice may be between having the bad guys in the 
back yard or the prison in the back yard 
bennett said the purpose of mondays meeting was to inform the 
good local responsible officials of a little more detail on the 
plan i want to stress the degree of good will on their part 
they are interested theyre on board they want to see this 
problem solved

president julio m sanguinetti said 
monday the question of amnesty for human rights abuses under 
military rule has been settled by voter approval of the amnesty law 
his government passed in 1986 
with 7037 of 7072 districts reporting in sundays referendum 
the vote was 1013554 for amnesty or 5262 percent and 771942 
4008 percent who wanted the law discarded 
sanguinetti a 52yearold lawyer told reporters monday now 
the discussion has ended 
when asked whether his government would consider a compromise 
with opponents of amnesty since they got nearly 41 percent of the 
vote he replied 
they were the ones who chose this way they were the ones who 
submitted the law to a majority vote national peace is to 
accept the verdict of the ballot box 
blank or invalid ballots and others classed as questionable 
that may or may not be counted totaled 140703 or 73 percent of 
the votes cast about 85 percent of eligible voters participated 
the amnesty law forbids prosecution of about 180 soldiers and 
police accused of torture murder and other crimes in 197385 when 
the military ruled uruguay and conducted what it called a war on 
leftist subversion 
it was passed by the new civilian government in december 1986 
after officers made clear they would not answer charges in the 
courts 
three military uprisings have occurred in neighboring argentina 
during the past two years because of the same issue argentina 
returned to civilian government in 1983 after nearly eight years of 
military rule and has tried many officers including former junta 
members 
uruguayans voted on amnesty because the national commission for 
a referendum gathered 634000 petition signatures during 1987 more 
than the required 25 percent of registered voters 
sanguinetti said his goal was to consolidate democracy in this 
nation of 3 million people which was an example of representative 
government to latin america before 1973 and in this case peace 
is justice 
he told the news conference amnesty does not excuse or justify 
military abuses which included the executions of about 150 
uruguayans arrests and disappearances of 200 more and the torture 
of several thousand 
it must be remembered he said that military intervention 
followed years of terrorism and economic chaos sanguinetti said 
leftist tupamaro guerrillas were released from prison in 1985 and 
the military amnesty is on the same line 
there is no sense of triumph in the referendums result he 
said and added the most important aspect in all this is that 
the country was able to do it by popular vote yesterday at 
730 pm when the ballot boxes were closed uruguay completed its 
transition to democracy 
the national commission for a referendum and the human rights 
and leftist political groups that supported the referendum 
apparently accepted the outcome 
only the small communist party said the vote was not fair 
claiming the government intimidated voters by hinting of trouble if 
the amnesty was overturned 
matilde rodriguez larreta de gutierrez copresident of the 
referendum commission said in accordance with the results of 
the referendum the amnesty has been confirmed without doubt the 
decision of the electorate should be accepted

one of the relatively few eastern airlines jets 
flying since the beginning of a strike against the carrier was 
seized monday by customs after inspectors found 75 pounds of 
cocaine in a mail bag in the cargo hold 
it was the 14th seizure of cocaine on an eastern plane since 
september and eight of those shipments were found in the mail or 
courier bags 
the boeing 727 seized monday landed in miami after a flight from 
asuncion paraguay that stopped in bolivia peru and panama said 
customs spokesman michael sheehan 
customs imposed a 12 million fine on eastern and demanded a 
letter of credit from the strikehobbled airline before releasing 
the plane 
we hate to kick an airline while its down but we will not 
allow illegal drugs into the country sheehan said 
because of easterns financial problems customs has decided to 
cash in three previous credit letters worth about 3 million he 
said the letters are usually held until customs and the airline 
negotiate an agreement on the fine 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said customs will have to go 
to bankruptcy court to get its money we dont think that fining 
airlines and seizing their aircraft is the way to stop drug 
trafficking said ms ceremsak 
she said the airline spent 3 million on security last year an 
amount that was not decreased this year even though eastern has had 
to severely shrink its schedule following the march 4 machinists 
strike that was supported by pilots and flight attendants 
but sheehan said eastern apparently wasnt doing the job even 
though smugglers were using the same method time after time 
due to the fact that over half of the seizure have been in 
courier bags we find it difficult to understand why courier bags 
do not receive extra attention sheehan said there shouldnt 
be a courier bag on eastern airlines that isnt gone over with a 
finetoothed comb 
the bright blue and green bag of a type used to carry mail was 
found during a routine inspection monday by the customs contraband 
enforcement team 
it was not on the plane manifest and authorities did not know 
where it was put aboard the plane 
no destination was listed on the bag suggesting that someone 
planned to remove it from the cargo hold in miami sheehan said 
meanwhile eight men who were eastern baggage handlers at the 
time of their 1986 indictment went on trial monday in a smuggling 
scheme they are charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and 
conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute

a un spokesman said monday that the 
fierce combat that broke out in northern namibia at the outset of 
the independence process has created severe logistical problems for 
the un monitoring force 
cedric thornberry secondincommand of the un contingent that 
is to oversee namibias transition to independence said un 
personnel had planned to use vacated south african military 
facilities 
but because of clashes between security forces and guerrillas of 
the southwest africa peoples organization south african troop 
withdrawal has been delayed he said this has created enormous 
competition for accommodation and other facilities in the 
relatively underdeveloped northern region of ovambo 
thornberry said the united nations planned to start deploying 
police monitors in ovambo this week who will check actions of the 
south africanled territorial police force but he said it was hard 
to find offices for monitors that were easily accessible to 
civilians who might want to file complaints 
the world body has urged civilians to report allegations of 
harassment or intimidation by the security forces or swapo 
supporters 
at un headquarters in new york swapo foreign secretary 
theoben gurirab said monday that secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar should visit namibia to restore public confidence in the 
united nations 
gurirab said a visit by the un chief would help restore the 
tarnished image of the united nations in the eyes of namibians 
he blamed the world organization for not stationing un 
peacekeepers in northern namibia by april 1 the day a ceasefire 
was supposed to take effect at the start of a yearlong transition 
to independence but instead the day that swapo guerrillas fought 
gun battles with south africanled security forces 
territorial officials say 278 guerrillas and 27 security force 
members have been killed and 28 guerrillas captured 
thornberry said 2662 members of the planned 4650member un 
military force were in namibia by monday with 410 kenyan 
infantrymen due by tuesday 
south africa said about 1600 guerrillas crossed the border from 
angola in violation of an agreement that they stay at bases at 
least 100 miles inside angola up to 380 guerrillas returned to 
angola after withdrawal orders from their exiled leader and about 
900 remain in namibia south african offficials say 
as of monday only seven guerrillas reported to un checkpoints 
established as part of a plan to give guerrillas safe passage back 
to angola the others who withdrew did so on their own 
officials expressed doubt that guerrillas would venture near the 
assembly points because of the heavy concentration of police and 
soldiers around each area 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i in december 
it agreed to allow independence in exchange for cubas withdrawing 
its estimated 50000 troops from angola 
swapo has fought south african rule since 1966 and is favored to 
get the most votes in preindependence elections scheduled for 
november

similarly when moncrief agreed in june 1984 to take a farm 
out from wright of wrights interest in the drilling of a second 
williams well ie a buyout of most of wrights interest in the 
well the terms of the farm out were in accordance with 
industry custom and the price was at or near market value thus 
there was no gift to wright nor can either the repurchase or the

in september 1979 wright cosigned a letter to secretary of the 
interior cecil d andrus on behalf of texas oil amp gas corporation 
txo the letter provided andrus with background information 
on txo and its dispute with the arkla exploration company over 
mineral exploration leases on land in arkansas 
wright held no interest in txo at any relevant time as 
discussed in section iii a of this report from february 1979 
until march 1984 wright held an interest in the whatley well an 
easttexas natural gas well drilled and operated by txo however 
as an investor in the well wrights financial return was 
determined only by the productivity of the well and could not have 
been affected by txos success or failure with respect to the 
arkansas leases wrights letter did not comment upon the merits of 
the dispute between txo and arkla therefore it is not a 
prohibited ex parte communication under the government in the 
sunshine act pub l 94409 4 stat 1241 1246 5 usc 557d 
the letter was the only communication on the subject between 
wright or his staff and andrus or his staff therefore the letter 
was not an exercise of undue influence by wright furthermore 
andrus and undersecretary james a joseph both stated that the 
letter made no demand or request that they deemed unusual or 
improper nor did the letter affect the decision made by the 
department with respect to the leases 
as discussed in full in section iii b of this report wrights 
communication with the secretary of the interior on behalf of txo 
violated no law or standard of conduct

in early 1984 wright and his close friend william carlos moore 
discussed producing a book of wrights earlier speeches poems and 
writings which wright and moore testified would be sold at low cost 
to a very broad audience including college students and average 
citizens wright told the committee he wanted to give people an 
idea of what his personal feelings were on a number of subjects so 
that they could get to know the majority leader and next speaker of 
the house 
wright also discussed the book with his staff matthew 
cossolotto wrights congressional staff researcher and speech 
writer testified that wright first raised the subject of the book 
at a staff breakfast in february 1984 wright asked the staff to 
think about ways to market the book and suggested that when he gave 
a speech to a trade association or other group he could sell the 
group books instead of taking an honorarium cossolotto testified 
that wright explained to the staff that unlike honoraria book 
royalties are exempt from the 30 percent maximum limit on outside 
earned income 
throughout 1984 wright had members of his staff collecting his 
old speeches and compiling editing typing and proofreading the 
manuscript for his book wrights staff obtained celebrity 
endorsements of the book for the back cover and selected a 
photograph of wright for the front cover 
carlos moore formed the madison publishing company in 1984 as a 
division of madison systems corporation moores political 
consulting firm for the purpose of publishing wrights book 
reflections of a public man however madison publishing did 
not publish wrights book nor has it published any other book 
madison publishing designed the layout and printed the cover for 
wrights book moore sent the book itself to be printed and 
assembled by the printing center in fort worth because as he 
testified madison publishing did not have the capacity to print 
20000 copies the printing center actually printed 19068 books 
and reduced the charge to madison publishing accordingly the final 
product was completed in early december 1984 and delivered in two 
installments on december 6 and 18 1984 
wright himself applied for and secured copyright protection for 
the book and hired a fort worth real estate attorney to draft a 
royalty agreement between wright and madison publishing 
company wright supplied the attorney with specific provisions to 
be included in the agreement including the provisions for a 55 
percent royalty the agreement was executed on december 12 
1984 after 2160 copies of the completed books had already been 
delivered to moore

public airing of the ethics committee report 
on house speaker jim wright provides his opponents with reams of 
political ammunition but does not in itself strike a fatal blow 
democrats must move to quickly mold public opinion if the 
speaker is going to keep his leadership post and wrights allies 
say having the facts on the table can help 
the committee on standards of official conduct released a 
voluminous report by its special counsel and charged the speaker 
with 69 instances of violating house rules 
the report provides sometimes embarrassing details of the 
financial benefits he received from friendships with two fort worth 
businessmen 
one carlos moore gave wright unusually high royalties he 
published the speakers book reflections of a public man with 
fiftyfive cents of every dollar going to wright the committee 
said it appeared that the speaker was using bulk sales of the 
paperback to evade house limits on outside income from speeches 
the second friend george mallick had a business partnership 
with the speaker wright and his wife betty benefited from the 
free use of a condominium and a car and an 18000 annual salary 
to mrs wright 
house members are looking at the committee report on two 
political levels within the institution and in their home 
districts 
within the house release of the report monday caused members to 
begin focusing on their own situations 
we have to deal with it on a very specific level said 
martin frost dtexas a wright ally who contends lawmakers will 
make independent judgments despite pressure at home i think 
members dont want to be stampeded on this one way or another 
he said 
frost said members confronted with the committees findings will 
find them troubling because of their broad implications for 
example it decided that mallick had an interest in legislation 
using a standard so broad that anyone with wealth would fall in the 
same category he contended a situation that could snare many 
lawmakers 
i think members will look at this in a serious way and say 
is this fair he said 
outside of the house democrats must persuade the public that 
the violations wright is accused of are mostly technical and not 
really unethical they cant afford to wait for the committee to 
render a verdict on whether wright should be found guilty and 
punished 
the initial rush of publicity was seen by virtually everyone as 
negative for wright but democratic leaders argued that as they 
rebut the specific charges the public will come to believe that 
wright is being held to an unjust standard 
rep beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said that once people clearly 
understand then you get an entirely different feel and 
reaction 
wright himself must also be convincing 
if the speaker is well received in the country and what he 
says is resonant with the american public he improves his 
chances said rep john spratt dsc 
further the report itself is not a conviction that could only 
be done by the full house and even if that were to occur it would 
be up to the democrats who elected him to decide whether wright has 
become an unsupportable political liability 
with few exceptions republicans greeted the release with sounds 
of deference and respect to the process set up to investigate a 
fellow member despite the fact that the campaign to investigate 
wrights finances was kicked off by one of their own rep newt 
gingrich of georgia the republicans tried to portray themselves as 
above the fray 
a key element in their strategy to wrest control of the house 
away from the democrats is to portray the democrats as the party of 
corruption and themselves as its enemy 
the best politics for republicans is no evidence of politics 
at all said rep jerry lewis of california chairman of the 
house republican conference 
some democrats scoffed at the gop tactic 
it was bipartisan nonpartisan garbage said rep james 
traficant dohio let there be no mistake today in washington 
dc the party lines are being drawn in indelible ink 
the verdict on wright from the ethics committee may be technical 
and not so clear as the party lines but when that comes some 
weeks down the road the public verdict may have already come in 
well be opening our own mail for a while said rep pat 
williams dmont

lech walesa on monday urged poles to 
rebuild solidarity skillfully and quickly hours after a court 
declared the independent union legal again and ended seven years of 
government suppression 
walesa also praised president bush for announcing an aid package 
for polands economy 
walesa was expected to follow up restoration of his unions 
legal status with a meeting tuesday with his longtime antagonist 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and a trip to rome on 
wednesday to meet polishborn pope john paul ii at the vatican 
looking relaxed despite what he said was a case of pneumonia 
walesa arrived by train in warsaw on monday night and told 
reporters bush was a brilliant politician 
bush is a great man and he knows the polish situation very 
well he said he called the proposal for us aid quite big 
walesa was accompanied to warsaw by key adviser adam michnik and 
was welcomed at the station by a handful of other solidarity 
advisers 
he said he could not confirm or deny he had a planned meeting 
with jaruzelski 
i appeal to all workers and supporters of our union to form 
factory organizations as soon as possible where they still dont 
exist and to report their membership in solidarity or to join it 
said walesa in a statement read in warsaw by union spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz 
onyszkiewicz said an independent union press should begin 
operating by the end of the month and that solidarity should get 
new national headquarters in gdansk by tuesday 
our effort devotion and suffering have not been in vain 
walesa said in his statement we defended our workers rights 
together we are paving a road to a fully democratic and sovereign 
poland 
but he cautioned the day of success came in hard economic 
times 
the polish nation is facing tasks which are much more complex 
than in 1980 now we must undertake a trial of real and deep 
economic reform and democratic restructuring of the state he 
said 
the warsaw provincial court registered the reborn solidarity in 
the same room where its original charter was approved in november 
1980 
onyszkiewicz said walesa stayed away from the hearing in part 
because the union always regarded itself as legal so the session 
had a technical rather than symbolic nature 
nevertheless there was thunderous applause when the verdict was 
complete sealing an aboutface approved earlier by communist party 
leaders 
as the court session ended hundreds of hands lifted in the 
v for victory sign and chants of solidarnosc solidarnosc 
filled the room solidarity leaders beamed supporters waved 
bouquets of yellow daffodils and judges shook hands with the 
participants 
then there were cheers of lech walesa lech walesa and the 
singing of the national anthem 
the spirit of history was with us said solidarity supporter 
krzysztof sliwinski 
two solidarity banners were held aloft during the hearing before 
presiding judge danuta widawska and two other judges about a dozen 
solidarity leaders and advisers and 300 sympathizers jammed the 
narrow courtroom with yellow walls and crimson curtains another 
100 waited in the corridor 
polish society puts enormous hopes in the honest operation of 
all trade unions in the area of the rights and interests of the 
working people and the realization of their material and cultural 
needs ms widawska said after the verdict in which she 
registered solidarity as a legal trade union 
jaruzelski tried to dissolve solidarity in a december 1981 
martiallaw crackdown but now seeks the movements help to pull 
poland out of economic crisis 
party and government officials also admit that by legalizing the 
union they hope to encourage the west to provide economic help to 
poland burdened by a 38 billion foreign debt 
president bush on monday announced an aid package to help 
polands economy he told a polishamerican crowd in hamtramck 
mich that continued aid would depend on consistent moves by the 
communist government toward reform 
the concessions could open the way for up to 1 billion in new 
loans loan rescheduling and trade and investment relief according 
to administration and international monetary sources 
the last step in the long bid for restoration of solidarity 
followed unprecedented negotiations between communist authorities 
and opposition representatives led by walesa 
the talks reached accords on legalizing solidarity creating the 
first freely elected legislative chamber in the soviet bloc and 
other economic and political reforms 
solidarity members who predict the union will grow to 5 million 
to 7 million members and hold its first congress later this year 
face the tasks of organizing the union and the election campaign 
the movement was 10 million strong and so popular it threatened 
to topple the communists monopoly on power when martial law was 
imposed 
although thousands of its activists including walesa were locked 
up the union continued to function first as an underground 
organization staging rallies and putting out clandestine 
newspapers and then more openly in factories and offices after a 
1986 political amnesty

the agreement provided that wright would receive 325 nearly 
55 percent of the 595 list price on all retail sales of the 
book moore would receive 270 from which he would pay all 
printing and marketing expenses such royalty payments are 
unheard of in the publishing industry in fact wrights previous 
royalty contracts with three major publishers provided for standard 
industry royalties ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent depending 
upon sales morton janklow an expert on the publishing industry 
testified that no rational publisher would agree to a 55 percent 
royalty on list price because it could not make a profit janklow 
also testified that in his opinion as literary agent for nancy 
reagan sen daniel p moynihan helmut schmidt sidney sheldon and 
danielle steele wrights book was not commercially publishable 
although the agreement also provided that madison publishing 
would publish and market the book in fact wright and his staff 
provided many of the ordinary services of a publisher and made the 
most significant contribution to marketing efforts 
in this instance moore designed the layout and printed the 
cover of the book he hired others to typeset and print the book 
itself all other aspects of book production were performed by 
wright or his staff moore also sent out 300 to 500 letters 
soliciting orders for the book and employed 12 to 15 people for 
four hours a day during one week to make telephone solicitations 
from voter registration lists moore arranged an autograph party 
one or two newspaper advertisements and an appearance by wright on 
the larry king show moores marketing efforts resulted in precious 
few sales to average citizens in fact moore testified that he 
never intended to sell the book to bookstores where average people 
could buy them because bookstores would only purchase at the 
discount price of 300 per copy that doesnt leave you much 
room 
the real focus of the marketing effort for reflections of a 
public man was on bulk sales to trade associations and other 
groups almost 98 percent of all sales of reflections of a public 
man were bulk sales of 15 or more books in some instances 
wrights staff informed various groups wright spoke to that because 
he had already reached the maximum limit on outside earned income 
for that year he would not be able to keep an honoraium offered to 
him the staff then recommended that instead of paying wright an 
honorarium the organization could purchase books for the same 
amount 
for example wright gave a lecture in october 1984 at southwest 
texas state university the university paid wright an honorarium of 
3000 in addition to his expenses but was subsequently informed 
by wrights staff that he would be unable to accept the honorarium 
wrights staff suggested that the university purchase 504 books for 
3000 in lieu of the honorarium the university purchased the 
books and distributed most of them to students in its political 
science department wright endorsed the 3000 check over to 
madison publishing company despite the change in the nature of the 
transaction the universitys records plainly list the 3000 
expenditure as an honorarium for wrights appearance instead of 
passing up 3000 or donating it to charity wright thus received a 
1650 royalty for his lecture at the university 
wright also spoke at a satellite broadcasting and communications 
association sbca trade show in september 1985 just several 
weeks after sbca had purchased 1680 copies of reflections of a 
public man for 10000 sbca testified that although it 
historically has paid honoraria and expenses to congressmen for 
their appearances in this case sbcas legal counsel who arranged 
for wright to speak at the trade show suggested that sbca purchase 
the books instead thus wright received a 5500 royalty for 
his appearance before the sbca 
not all bulk sales were in lieu of honoraria for example 
carlos moore arranged a sale of 2000 books to the teamsters for 
12200 paid out of the drive political fund the books were 
distributed to teamster members wright had not spoken at any 
teamster event 
in addition s gene payte a fort worth real estate developer 
testified that he wanted to give wright a 5000 gift and in fact 
had given a 5000 check to betty wright wright subsequently 
informed him that he could not accept the gift and returned the 
check to payte payte continued to search for a way to give cash to 
wright and shortly after receiving the first check back from 
wright wrote a second 5000 check this time to madison systems 
for revision and distribution of wrights books payte 
testified that he expected to receive 1000 copies of the revised 
edition of the book and in fact he made a second payment of 
1000 when he realized that 5000 would not buy 1000 copies of 
the 595 book however the book was never revised payte 
testified he received approximately 300 to 500 copies of the old 
book instead no further accounting was made

british officials say they wont negotiate because it will 
only lead to the taking of other hostages kauffmann told a 
meeting to mark the third anniversary of mccarthys kidnapping i 
say you can negotiate without giving in 
the french and west german governments managed to secure the 
release of their hostages without being brought to their knees 
kauffmann said at the meeting organized by british and french 
journalists 
kauffmann a magazine writer and french citizen was freed in 
may 1988 after more than three years captivity 
france which was under constant pressure to get back its 
hostages has denied paying ransom it complied with several 
iranian demands including banishing the main iranian opposition 
group from paris

anniversary in captivity of terry anderson 42 the chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press and the longest held of 
15 western hostages in lebanon anderson was abducted march 16

be sent to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and the 
iranian and syrian embassies in paris

as the senate opened debate monday on 
president bushs slightly altered plan for bailing out savings and 
loan depositors republicans blamed house democrats for the bulk of 
costs 
theres enough blame to go around but if you want to single 
out one culprit its the house of representatives said sen 
jake garn of utah the ranking republican on the senate banking 
committee 
garn said the bailout costs estimated at a minimum of 157 
billion over the next 10 years would be only half as much if in 
1986 the democraticcontrolled house had gone along with a 
senateapproved measure to pump 15 billion into the sampl insurance 
funds to close insolvent thrifts then 
the kindest thing i can say about the house is only that it is 
totally irresponsible garn said referring to action last week 
by a house subcommittee that would require sampl owners to put up 
less of their own money to stay in business 
former sampl regulators have blamed democratic house speaker jim 
wright of texas for stalling the 1986 legislation on behalf of 
thrift operators in his state 
the house ethics committee on monday cleared wright of charges 
he improperly intervened with sampl regulators but concluded that 
there is reason to believe wright violated official rules of 
conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged 
gifts 
senate banking committee chairman don riegle dmich said 
state chartered thrifts in texas and california accounted for 70 
percent of the 38 billion the government committed last year to 
resolve thrift problems 
i dont think we can let irresponsible state legislatures hold 
the key to federal deposit insurance funds he said referring to 
changes his committee made in bushs plan to put more restrictions 
on statechartered sampls 
riegle said the legislation breaks up the close relationship 
between the thrift industry and its regulators while assuring the 
survival of most sampls as the originator of half of the nations 
home mortgages 
but he said there is no certain guarantee that this plan or 
any plan will work as intended and conceded that taxpayers may be 
asked again in the future to come up with more money 
we can say that this package is the soundest and the toughest 
we could put together within the time bounds given us he said 
referring to the seven weeks since the package was put forth by the 
white house 
both riegle and garn as well as other members from both parties 
on the banking committee pleaded with their colleagues to forego 
offering amendments to the 564page bill 
we may have a long fight ahead with the house garn said 
extraneous and controversial amendments would upset the delicate 
balance weve reached 
however several amendments were in the works according to 
senate aides although none were offered or voted on monday 
among them was one by sen larry pressler rsd that would 
stretch out to june 1994 bushs june 1991 deadline for small sampl 
operators with loans of less than 100 million to effectively 
double the amount of their own money at risk 
pressler complained the bill provides a heavy advantage toward 
larger institutions by allowing them to stretch out to as long as 
25 years goodwill exemptions from the capital requirements 
a spokeswoman for sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he is 
considering proposing a variety of proconsumer amendments 
other possible amendments include 
reinstating a funding plan authored by riegle who claims it 
would save 150 million a year riegle effectively abandoned the 
plan last week under a veto threat by bush but majority leader 
george mitchell said he assumes it will consume considerable 
debate over the next two days 
giving nonprofit groups and local housing agencies a 90day 
right of first refusal to purchase at appraised market prices 
residential property that has fallen into the governments hand 
through loan defaults to insolvent sampls the amendment by sen john 
kerry dmass was defeated in the banking committee where it was 
criticized by sen phil gramm dtexas as social engineering 
meanwhile three consumers groups the consumer federation of 
america consumers union and association of community organizations 
for reform now on monday criticized both the senate and house 
versions of the sampl bill 
last week the banking committees led us down a primrose path 
that threatens to end in another nightmare of sampl insolvencies and 
enormous public debt said peggy miller a cfa lobbyist what 
you have to concentrate on is the loopholes because theyre broad 
and easily used

oregon lawmakers said monday that a draft 
commerce department report on japanese barriers to imports of 
american wood products should bolster the case for us sanctions 
the draft report obtained monday says japan uses unfair trade 
practices including high tariffs subisidies and even building 
codes that require the use of nails that can crack american 
plywood to protect their mills from us imports 
the report said japanese tariffs and other barriers were 
designed to bolster imports of raw logs and discourage imports of 
finished products 
despite earlier progress in opening some parts of the japanese 
market the report said barriers remain which impede us imports 
and it said the government of japan has refused to enter into a new 
round of talks 
the report said it is unlikely that any further concessions 
will be forthcoming unless additional us efforts are made such 
concessions would only be obtained if there were a clear incentive 
or at the least inclusion of these barriers in the high priority of 
issues to be resolved by the us and japanese governments 
sen bob packwood rore who requested the study more than a 
year ago said it should bolster the case for imposing trade 
sanctions against japan unless the barriers are removed 
rep ron wyden dore who had earlier called for sanctions 
said in a letter to us trade representative carla hills the 
report strongly supports a need for aggressive action by the 
administration 
last month the national forest products association asked hills 
to rule the japanese were engaging in unfair trade practices 
involving forest products and if negotiations failed to resolve 
the dispute after 18 months to impose sanctions 
the association has estimated that exports of finished us 
forest products to japan could increase 12 billion annually if 
the barriers were lifted

criticism grew of how police handled 
the stadium crush that killed 94 soccer fans and the government 
said monday it may ban standingroomonly sections like the one 
where the tragedy occurred 
officials and fans accused south yorkshire police of letting 
thousands of late arrivals into hillsborough stadium then reacting 
too slowly when the surging crowd crushed people against a steel 
antiriot fence in one of the concrete terrace areas packed with 
standees 
home secretary douglas hurd speaking to a hushed house of 
commons said an investigative panel led by lord justice taylor 
would begin work tuesday and make recommendations about the needs 
of crowd control and safety at sports grounds 
we have to set our sights high and find a better way for 
british football soccer hurd said we owe a duty to these 
passionate supporters of football to examine urgently and 
thoroughly the causes and background and to do all in our power to 
prevent such a thing happening again 
hurd told the commons the decision of a senior police officer to 
open the gate because he considered that there was a possible 
danger to the lives of the spectators at the front would be a 
central question for investigators survivors said about 4000 fans 
were pushing at turnstiles to get inside 
hillsborough gatekeeper jack stone told the sheffield star he 
refused police orders to open the outer gate and was forced to hand 
over his keys to a police inspector 
i handed the keys to him and told him it was his 
responsibility and not mine stone was quoted as saying 
liverpool fan stephen mitton who was caught in the crush 
outside the gate told bbctv 
the steward put his hand on the gate and said dont open 
it the police said open the gate theres going to be a crush 
then two police officers opened the gate 
the crush was so great mitton said that fans fell on the floor 
and people climbed over them all the police were doing was 
standing up saying get back get back there was already people 
dead then i climbed on them to get over the fence 
the sheffield star said a police superintendent made the 
decision to open the 16footwide gate because he feared a wall was 
seconds away from collapsing on hundreds of fans 
startled officers some of them hemmed in thought the wall 
was beginning to buckle under the enormous pressure of screaming 
fans the crowd was packed so tightly around a police horse that it 
was lifted six inches off the ground the paper said 
south yorkshire police who have handed over a separate 
investigation of the policing of the match to the neighboring west 
midlands police force refused to comment on the sheffield star 
report 
police federation representative paul middup attacked growing 
public criticism of police actions as grossly unfair saying 
they faced a situation for which no amount of training could 
prepare them 
police on monday released the names of the 94 victims all were 
british 34 were teenagers 33 were in their 20s and seven were 
women 
press association britains domestic news agency said as many 
as 40 who perished are thought to have died in the rush through a 
tunnel to the center terrace at the liverpool goal the rest were 
crushed against the 10foot fence in front of the terrace or were 
trampled underfoot it said 
they ranged in age from 10 to 67 of the 170 injured 47 
remained hospitalized monday including 17 in intensive care 
prince charles heir to the british throne and his wife diana 
visited some of the hospitalized fans as did liverpool soccer team 
members who came with team scarves and souvenirs 
in liverpool where most victims lived the city council monday 
called an official week of mourning and discussed ways of helping 
the bereaved and injured 
in the house of commons hurd said the government believes the 
future of soccer lies in providing allseated accommodation at 
major football clubs 
most british soccer stadiums have seats and standingroomonly 
terraces which are cheaper and generally favored by young fans 
hurd said justice taylor would also review the fencing in soccer 
stadiums which has been required in many areas to prevent fan 
violence 
several soccer clubs including liverpool announced monday they

governments plans to crack down on soccer hooliganism

the first area addressed in the preliminary inquiry concerns 
the circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts on behalf of a 
constituent with whom he representative wright had an interest in 
a private gas well venture 
special outside counsel reported that beginning in late 1978 
representative wright intervened with the us department of state 
and the egyptian government on behalf of the neptune oil company 
neptune in order to secure for neptune an opportunity to resolve 
a dispute with egypt over the right to explore develop and 
operate offshore oil fields in the gulf of suez neptune had a 
contract with the state of israel to explore and develop the 
israelioccupied territory however as a result of the camp david 
accords in september of 1978 and the subsequent peace treaty 
negotiations israel was required to return the occupied sinai and 
gulf of suez territory to egypt relinquishing all rights to the 
oil fields without compensation egypt would not recognize 
neptunes rights under the israeli contract thus neptune stood to 
lose its investment and expected profit from the operation of the 
oil fields 
representative wright introduced richard moncrief and other 
neptune principals to state department officials contacted 
secretary of state cyrus vance and egyptian ambassador ashraf 
ghorbal and personally delivered a letter dated march 27 1979 to 
egyptian president anwar alsadat while he was in washington 
seeking president sadats consideraton of neptunes plight in 
counsels view representative wrights intervention on behalf of 
neptune oil did not in itself appear to have violated any law or 
ethical standard 
during the period representative wright intervened on neptunes 
behalf he also accepted the opportunity to purchase a percentage 
of the moncrief familys interest in two easttexas gas wells 
offered by w a monty moncrief the late patriarch of the 
moncrief family who was for many years active in washington dc 
as a lobbyist for the independent petroleum association the first 
opportunity the whatley well no 1 located in freestone county 
texas appears to have been an ordinary business transaction 
the record establishes that representative wright risked the 
amount of his share of the drilling costs against the chance that 
the well would be dry had the well been dry representative 
wrights investment would have been lost 
once gas was discovered in the whatley well although it was 
commercially productive it was clear that production and 
therefore profit from the well would be substantially less than 
had been anticipated consequently in 1984 at a time when the 
whatley well was shut in ie had temporarily ceased 
production representative wright asked monty moncrief to buy back 
his interest in the well 
monty moncrief agreed to buy back representative wrights 
whatley interest for 20000 while moncriefs repurchase of 
representative wrights interest in the whatley well appears to 
have been a favor to representative wright it also appears to have 
been purchased at about the market value of the interest 
therefore counsel concluded that there was no gift to 
representative wright 
the committee concurred with counsels findings accordingly 
item no 1 in the committees resolution of preliminary inquiry to 
the extent that it was predicated on representative wrights 
interest in the whatley well does not warrant further action by 
the committee 
however in the course of pursuing the circumstances surrounding 
representative wrights interest in the whatley well the special 
outside counsel identified a second well in which representative 
wright had an interest which in counsels view raised a question 
of improper conduct this matter concerned representative wrights 
acquisition of an interest in the l d williams no 1 well 
counsel reported that during calendar year 1979 representative 
wright acquired an interest in the l d williams no 1 well the 
opportunity to invest in such well also having been afforded to him 
by the late w a monty moncrief an individual having a direct 
interest in legislation representative wright purchased his 
interest by check dated october 11 1979 in response to a bill 
from the moncriefs dated august 20 1979 for 2903691 with 
approximately 50000 having been paid in total the predrilling 
completion cost to invest but after the well had been drilled and 
determined to be a successful venture on june 27 1979 since at 
the time of his purchase representative wrights share was valued 
at approximately 132000140000 counsel believed the congressman 
received a gift of approximately 8200090000 from mr moncrief 
in reduced purchase cost moreover during the period immediately 
prior to when representative wright acquired this interest counsel 
noted he had actively intervened on behalf of the moncrief family 
with respect to capital investments the family had in the sinai 
peninsula

basements and bunkers during citywide shelling that killed at least 
45 people in three days and touched off international appeals for a 
ceasefire 
the rocket and artillery barrages slammed into both the

around beirut between christian army units and an alliance of druse 
militiamen and syrian troops 
the dead included spains ambassador to lebanon pedro manuel de

police also said 175 people were wounded in renewed bombardments 
that broke out late saturday 
police put the toll in 41 days of fighting at 262 killed and 932 
wounded the overwhelming majority of the victims have been 
civilians 
tens of thousands of beirut residents had hardly emerged from 
their shelters monday morning during a brief lull when guns and 
rocket launchers thundered back into action sending them back 
underground many were trapped without water or electricity 
smoldering cars lay charred monday in streets littered with 
glass shards and severed power cables hundreds of fashionable 
boutiques were gutted 
many buildings burned down because firefighters had no water 
only a few bakeries opened monday morning but there was not 
enough bread to go around 
please please i need five loaves i have five children that 
i have to feed shouted housewife amina shehab outside a bakery 
in moslem west beirut 
the baker yelled back ive less than three dozen loaves and 
there are many other people who want to eat as well i can only 
give you two loaves 
lebanons apocalypse persists beiruts independent daily 
annahar said in a frontpage editorial monday 
the prime minister of the moslem cabinet in the split 
government salim hoss said monday he reached agreement with 
french humanitarian assistance minister bernard kouchner to 
evacuate more wounded civilians 
a source close to hoss later said moslem victims of the fighting 
would be evacuated to a french hospital ship on tuesday if security 
conditions permit 
fourteen christian victims were ferried to a french boat from 
the christian port of jounieh on friday 
the united states kuwait jordan pope john paul ii appealed 
for an end to the confrontation which has developed into one of 
the bloodiest rounds of the 14yearold civil war 
pope john paul ii urged the united nations and arab league 
nations to use their influence to bring about an immediate 
ceasefire 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said all parties including syria which is a direct participant 
in the artillery exchanges must stop the fighting 
kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed sabah called for 
an emergency arab league council meeting 
the battles began after gen michel aoun the head of the 
christian cabinet ordered his forces to blockade several ports 
controlled by moslem militiamen syria rallied to the militiamens 
aid and aoun pledged to expel the estimated 40000 syrian troops 
from lebanon 
the arab league invited syria to send in its forces as 
peacekeepers in 1976 
aoun in an interview released monday accused the united states 
of covering up for syrian attacks in lebanon 
the united states is undoubtedly trying to solve the 
palestinianisraeli or the arabisraeli problem at lebanons 
expense and is thus sponsoring this dirty syrian role in lebanon 
he was quoted as saying by the londonbased newsletter middle east 
mirror text of the interview was sent by telex to the associated 
press in bahrain 
aoun said us officials were trying to portray lebanese strife 
as a problem between moslems and christians but he said it is 
caused by occupation by syrian and israeli forces according to the 
interview 
israel occupies a selfproclaimed security zone up to 10 
miles deep in south lebanon

in counsels view representative wrights actions on behalf of 
the moncrief family at a time when he acquired an interest in the 
l d williams no 1 well below its fair market value represented 
a violation of consideration no 5 of the code of ethics for 
government service which states in part that any person in 
government service should never accept for himself or his family 
favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by 
reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his 
governmental duties the special outside counsel also indicated 
that such a violation also represents action which does not reflect 
creditably on the house of representatives in violation of house 
rule xliii clause 1 
finally because representative wright did not report as a gift 
the belowmarket purchase of his l d williams no 1 well interest 
on his financial disclosure statement for calendar year 1979 
coupled with the fact that this gift was worth more than 100 
counsel believed that representative wright violated house rule 
xliv reporting receipt of gift and house rule xliii clause 4 
which imposes a limit of 100 on gifts received from persons having 
a direct interest in legislation 
the committee did not concur with the special outside counsel 
this conclusion rested on five grounds first the absence of any 
formal communication between representative wright and monty 
moncrief or the moncrief oil organization indicating the 
congressmans commitment to acquire an interest in the l d 
williams no 1 well did not in and of itself support a conclusion 
that there had been no agreement for representative wright to 
acquire his interest prior to the successful completion of the well 
in june 1979 in this connection the committee believes it is 
reasonable to infer that representative wright established his 
good faith in entering into a business transaction with the 
moncriefs in connection with the whatley well 
second it appears that representative wrights transaction with 
the moncriefs was handled no differently than the purchase of an 
interest in the same well by monty moncriefs grandchildren 
specifically the moncrief grandchildren also purchased their 
interest in the well through a trust agreement at the same time 
representative wright acquired his interest all of these 
transactions occurred subsequent to the successful completion of 
the well 
third representative wrights october 4 1979 loan transaction 
with continental national bank to obtain the funds 35000 
required to defray the cost of his acquisition in the well occurred 
a short time after his receipt of a bill from the moncriefs for his 
share of drilling costs in this regard the committee believes it 
is reasonable that the congressman delayed his loan transaction to 
avoid paying interest on the funds until there was a need for him 
to meet his financial obligations arising out of the purchase 
fourth the original correspondence from monty moncrief to 
representative wright dated february 22 1979 clearly indicated 
the possibility that the congressman might be interested in one or 
two oil and gas ventures which later resulted in his acquisition 
of interests in the whatley no 1 well and the l d williams no 1 
well the fact that an ambiguity arises by virtue of representative 
wrights february 26 1979 letter in response to the earlier 
february 22 1979 correspondence from monty moncrief wherein 
the congressman indicated his interest in participating in one 
venture was not viewed as supporting the conclusion that 
representative wright intended to purchase an interest in only one 
well accordingly the ambiguity in the correspondence was resolved 
in favor of representative wright 
finally representative wrights financial disclosure statement 
for calendar year 1979 indicated that the interest was acquired in 
april of that year 
in the light of the foregoing the committee did not conclude 
that there was a reason to believe that representative wright 
violated any controlling standards of conduct in connection with 
his purchase of an interest in the l d williams no 1

a helicopter swooped into a prisons highsecurity 
exercise yard monday and a convicted drug kingpin jumped aboard 
but the chopper caught a fence and crashed in the yard injuring 
the wouldbe escapee and his pilot 
benjamin barry kramer 36 a former powerboat champion 
serving life without parole as the leader of a 
marijuanatrafficking ring broke his right leg in the accident 
the pilot suffered two broken legs and facial injuries 
kramer apparently was ready and as soon as the helicopter was 
there he jumped right into it said john clark warden at the 
federal metropolitan correctional center 
clark said three armed guards watched but did not react because 
they did not want to shoot into the prison yard where a halfdozen 
men were exercising he also said they feared there might be a 
hostage in the helicopter 
most of mcc is mediumsecurity but kramer and about 50 other 
prisoners were being held in a special highsecurity area because 
they were considered escape risks 
the twoseater bell helicopter a type once flown for military 
reconnaissance but now used mainly for aerial photography or 
cropspraying flew into the prison just after 10 am clark said 
it dropped low enough for kramer to jump onto one landing skid 
and was beginning to rise when its tail rotor caught in barbed wire 
atop the metal fence around the exercise area 
clark said at least one other prisoner may have tried to jump on 
the helicopter possibly destabilizing the small craft 
the accident sent pieces of the rotor and the fence hurtling 
hundreds of yards 
its lucky more people werent hurt clark said 
prison guards immediately pulled kramer and the pilot from the 
wreckage and administered first aid before they were taken to a 
hospital 
authorities identified the pilot as charles clayton stevens 34 
of gold beach ore 
the bell 47d1 helicopter built in 1952 was reported sold in 
january to c stevens of gold beach according to the federal 
aviation administration 
stevens a sea urchin diver worked with sin loi commercial 
diving co in gold beach according to a man who answered the phone 
there stevens left town about a month ago said the man who 
refused to give his name 
an aviation official who spoke under condition of anonymity said 
the helicopter was spotted last month on a truck near tamiami 
airport a few miles from the prison the truck carried an oregon 
registration the source said 
but the copter apparently took off from opalocka airport about 
25 miles north of the prison the us marshals office said 
after the crash all 1000 inmates were locked down and 
officials began interviewing prisoners who were in the yard at the 
time clark said 
prisoners even in the highsecurity area have phone privileges 
and all calls are taperecorded he said obviously we will be 
going back and checking the calls that kramer made clark said 
kramer was convicted in illinois along with former carracing 
star randy lanier on charges of running a multimilliondollar 
potsmuggling ring he was sentenced to life without parole 
he was brought to mcc from a federal prison at ray brook ny 
in december to face another marijuanasmuggling indictment in fort 
lauderdale and a miami gun charge on which he already has been 
convicted 
us marshal john horgan said kramer will also be charged with 
attempted escape which carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
prison and the pilot will face charges of aiding an escape 
according to the fort lauderdale drug racketeering indictment 
kramer imported tons of marijuana to florida and california and 
shifted millions of dollars between accounts in lichtenstein and 
the british virgin islands 
three years ago another mcc inmate tried a helicopter escape 
gary betzner who later testified about alleged gunsfordrugs 
schemes to arm the contra rebels in nicaragua arranged to hire a 
helicopter that flew into the prison 
but betzners contact was an undercover agent and the 
helicopter carried agents who arrested him when he ran to it

a former government employee went to court monday 
seeking to halt construction of apartments and an underground 
garage on a site he claims was a nuclear dump 
oleg lyanin said the site along the leninsky prospekt 
thoroughfare in south moscow was used to bury wastes from uranium 
processing at the beginning of the soviet nuclear effort in the 
1940s 
no official evidence has been released that the dump exists and 
there is no evidence of nuclear leaks the moscow man said in a 
telephone interview but he claimed scientists involved in the 
nuclear effort have pinpointed the spot and several others as the 
sites of nuclear dumps 
were sure theres a map perhaps several made at different 
intervals of where and what is in moscow said lyanin a former 
negotiator and translator for the ministry of foreign trade 
he said he filed his first court documents april 10 asking that 
the case be turned over to prosecutors for investigation of 
possible criminal charges he said that request was granted three 
days later 
according to a law passed after the chernobyl nuclear accident 
disturbing buried radioactive waste is punishable by up to 10 years 
in prison according to lyanin 
he said that in his court appearance monday he asked the court 
to halt construction of the garage and apartments to leave 
trouble where it lies 
there has been much greater concern in the soviet union about 
nuclear safety since the chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 
april 1986 at least 31 people perished when a reactor exploded 
the site for the garage and apartments in southern moscow is 
less than a halfmile from the angloamerican school whose 200 
pupils include children of diplomats and business representatives 
from the united states britain canada and other countries 
the director of the angloamerican school vera nordal said 
soviet officials have not contacted the school about the matter 
she said british officials checked the area for radiation monday 
and tests conducted by the us embassy following the chernobyl 
accident did not turn up radiation near the school 
lyanin said the planned apartments would be occupied by members 
of the council of ministers of the russian republic and officials 
of the central council of trade unions 
he said excavation for the 24 million project began recently 
but has been halted pending a decision on his petitions in the 
dzerzhinsky region peoples court 
residents of the region have held several meetings to oppose the 
construction project according to lyanin

a man was reported killed monday during a 
demonstration by several thousand supporters of the fundamentalist 
national islamic front against the suspension of islamic law in 
sudan 
spokesmen for the front identified the victim as shayk rayeh 
mahmoud but did not give details or accuse anyone in his death 
as they marched through central khartoum protesters chanted 
there is no god but allah there is no alternative to sharia 
islamic law 
it was the fourth day of demonstrations which began after 
parliament voted to postpone debate on sharia or islamic law 
until a national constitutional conference convenes 
the conference is to assemble all political forces including 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army and one of its purposes 
is to find a solution to the 6yearold civil war in the south 
suspending islamic law which president gaafar nimeiri put into 
effect two years before he was overthrown in 1985 has been a major 
demand by the south most people there are christians or animists 
while khartoum and the rest of the north is overwhelmingly moslem 
ali osman taha the national islamic fronts leader in 
parliament told the marchers monday demonstrations will 
continue day and night until this government of traitors 
nonbelievers is toppled 
you have come out to tell them there are sharp swords ready to 
defend the sharia of allah 
riot police did not interfere although the protests violate an 
interior ministry ban on demonstrations 
interior minister mubarak abdullah fadil mahdi said in a 
statement later however that security forces would use force if 
necessary to end unauthorized protests 
mahdi said two demonstrators were injured in addition to the one 
killed but did not elaborate

the house gave overwhelming approval monday to 
a measure that would repeal major portions of the hatch act and 
allow federal civil service employees to participate in partisan 
political activity on their own time 
but despite the 29790 house vote final enactment into law is 
far from certain 
the house approved an almost identical bill last year but it 
died in the senate 
the administration is opposed to the bill and attorney general 
dick thornburgh has said he will recommend a veto should it reach 
president bushs desk 
nonetheless the measure was pushed strongly by various unions 
representing federal workers and their leaders were quick to praise 
the house members who voted for it 
this is not a political party issue its a political 
freedom issue said robert m tobias president of the national 
treasury employees union we urge the senate to join the house in 
standing firmly on the side of rights for federal workers 
however tobias statement did not suggest there was anything 
more than an excellent possibility the measure will pass the 
senate 
the bill would 
allow federal employees to run for partisan political office on 
their own time without taking a leave of absence unless 
campaigning would interfere with performance of their duties 
permit employees to request unpaid leave to run for office and 
says leave must be granted unless the agency they work for 
determines they cannot be spared 
allow federal employees to manage political campaigns and raise 
campaign money during offduty hours 
the measure would clarify and in many cases strengthen current 
hatch act prohibitions against using a federal position for 
political purposes 
in a letter to congress thornburgh said enactment of provisions 
in the house will would lead to a tragic repoliticization of the 
federal workforce 
aside from concerns about specifics of the bill wrote 
thornburgh the overall effect on public perception of the fairness 
of government dealing might well be devastaging 
for example if it appears that a candidate of party a has 
misappropirated funds it will not inspire confidence to learn that 
the local us attorneys office charged with investigating the 
allegation is headed by that candidates campaign manager he 
said

some bulk purchasers did not even want the books they paid for 
for example wright addressed the annual meeting of the 
midcontinent oil amp gas association midcontinent purchased 1000 
worth of wrights book in lieu of paying him an honorarium but 
asked to receive only three books midcontinent suggested that the 
remaining books be distributed to libraries and other public 
institutions of wrights choice there are no records reflecting 
the requested distribution 
the select committee on ethics interpreted rule xlvii clause 1 
in advisory opinion no 13 which makes it clear that the 
limitations on outside earned income may not be avoided by the mere 
characterization of a payment in all cases the real facts will 
control select committee on ethics advisory opinion no 13 
ethics manual p 179 in this case the facts reveal that wright 
compiled a series of previous speeches and writings into a 
commercially unpublishable manuscript his good friend carlos moore 
formed a publishing company for the purpose of producing the book 
and entering into a socalled royalty agreement inordinately 
favorable to wright together they sold the book almost exclusively 
to lobbyists persons interested in legislation and other interest 
groups in order to provide income to wright 
the resulting income does not therefore become royalty 
income just because moore calls himself a publisher and claims 
to pay royalties on book sales the royalty contract was 
not an armslength agreement between an author and his publisher 
but a joint business venture a means by which moore could help 
his friend wright obtain money in excess of congressional 
limitations 
receipts from sales of wrights book should thus be 
characterized as outside earned income not copyright royalties 
and subject to the limits and reporting requirements for such 
income as advisory opinion no 13 makes clear income a member 
earns through his own personal efforts is earned income for 
purposes of rule xlvii clause 1 even when the income is first paid 
to a corporation and then distributed to the member in this 
matter wright earned income from the books through his performance 
of publishers duties including the marketing of the book 
however whether or not the income from sales of the book may be 
considered royalties when books are allegedly sold to 
lobbyists or interest groups but no books are delivered to those 
groups in exchange for their payments the books retained are 
gifts received from persons with an interest in legislation 
before congress those books are also gifts when the group 
donates the books to a library or institution of wrights 
choice 
furthermore where the books are purchased in lieu of paying a 
customary fee for a speech or appearance the payment received is 
an honorarium in the form of a royalty the term 
honorarium is defined to mean the payment of something of 
value accepted as consideration for an appearance speech or 
article ethics manual p 83 quoting 11 cfr 11012b see 
also 2 usc 311 in this case the royalty was itself the 
honorarium paid for wrights appearance 
thus as discussed in full in section iii c of this report 
wrights receipts of outside earned income including honoraria in 
excess of 30 percent of his congressional salary are violations of 
house rule xlvii clause 1 in addition gifts exceeding 100 from 
lobbyists and other groups with interests in legislation before 
congress are violations of house rule xliii clause 4 wrights 
receipt of an honorarium in excess of the 2000 limit imposed by 2 
usc 441i is a violation of that law finally his failures to 
disclose the receipts of income gifts and honoraria are violations 
of house rule xliv 
we found no evidence that campaign funds were used to produce 
the book

wright used members of his staff to compile type proofread 
edit and market his book reflections of a public man the 
book was wrights own project from which he personally received 
income 
matthew cossolotto a writer and researcher on wrights staff 
testified that he spent about 200 hours preparing the book for 
printing other members of the staff had more limited roles in the 
preparation of the book eg marshall lynam wrights chief of 
staff solicited the quotes for the back cover of the book and also 
participated to some extent in marketing the book charmayne marsh 
wrights press secretary helped to select the photograph used on 
the cover of the book mike grisso occasionally entered passages 
for the book onto the word processor dorothy biard the office 
librarian assisted in gathering and locating material and cathy 
mitchell wrights executive assistant and scheduler also 
participated in marketing the book to various groups wright gave 
speeches to in 1984 and 1985 in addition wright used other 
government resources including a computer to complete the

algeria has ordered all soccer matches 
suspended for a week following the stabbing of a goalie by fans 
during a riot last week officials said 
in east germany a newspaper reported monday that 18 people were 
injured on april 7 when thousands of fans made a rush for tickets 
to a soccer match 
the reports followed the deaths of 94 british fans during a mad 
rush saturday at a soccer match in sheffield england 
the president of the algerian football federation mohamed 
baghdadi said matches were suspended saturday and would not resume 
for a week the statement sunday came in response to violence at a 
match the day before between constantine and setif that left two 
players injured 
setif goalie antar osmani was circled by about 100 fans and then 
stabbed in the abdomen he said he had never seen such savagery 
during his 14year career 
it was not clear why osmani was attacked 
baghdadi said the suspension should be used for meditation 
consciousnessraising and a call to responsibility 
in berlin the governmentrun newspaper young world said fans 
were injured during a run on tickets april 7 for a union of 
european football associations semifinal game between the dynamo 
dresden soccer club and stuttgart of west germany 
the newspaper printed a letter by students of dresdens 
technical university which said the ticket sale began suddenly 
around midnight causing chaotic conditions 
it also printed a reply by peter stehr security chief for the 
dresden club which said 18 people were hurt 
stehrs letter said the injuries were caused by inconsiderate 
behavior and by the pushing and shoving of the unreasonable 
fans he said the club also would revise the way it sold 
tickets 
the newspaper earlier reported that some fans had been camping 
for two days for tickets to wednesdays game 
the students letter said the box offices opened suddenly and 
prematurely suggesting that the injuries were caused by a crush 
of thousands of fans trying to get into the line when officials 
began selling tickets eight hours ahead of the announced time 
all 38000 tickets were sold by the morning the newspaper said

certainly materials paid for by government funds may not be 
appropriated for personal use thus technically wrights use of a 
government word processor for example to prepare a book from 
which he derived personal income was a violation of 31 usc 
1301a which provides that government appropriations are to be 
used solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated 
it is not so clear however whether wrights use of his 
congressional staff to produce and market his book is a violation 
of 31 usc 1301a no attempt was made to keep work on the book 
separate from work on official business no records were kept of 
hours worked on the book as compared to the hours spent on official 
business matthew cossolotto who spent far more time than any 
other staff employee working on the book testified that he worked 
on the book about 200 hours over eight to eleven months other 
staff members also testified that during that period there were 
weeks in which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour weeks 
thus it is entirely possible and in some instances even probable 
that although some work on the book was certainly done during the 
normal 9 to 5 work day staff employees worked on the book in 
addition to completing all the work ordinarily done as part of 
their official duties 
such use of staff time is specifically permitted under house 
ethics guidelines 
moreover members are given wide discretion to determine the 
conditions and the duties of employment the enormous breadth and 
ambiguity of these guidelines makes it virtually impossible to 
prevent members from using staff employees paid by government funds 
from working on projects providing personal income to the member 
thus as discussed in full in section iiid of this report 
because it is impossible to determine with the required certainty 
that wright had his staff working on the book during time that 
should have been devoted to his official business we do not 
conclude that wright violated any law or standard of conduct

in 1979 jim and betty wright and their good friends george and 
marlene mallick formed and became equal shareholders in mallightco 
inc mallightco invested in commercial paper securities real 
estate and oil and gas ventures for the general purpose of making 
money for its shareholders mallightco was funded in february 1980 
with 58127 in cash from the mallicks and roughly the equivalent 
in marketable securities from the wrights 
throughout wrights investment in mallightco it was used as a 
conduit for cash flowing from the mallicks to the wrights for 
example mallightco began lending money to the mallicks and the 
wrights in august 1980 the first loan on august 15 1980 was for 
4375 each the second loan on september 3 1980 was for 553609 
each the mallicks paid off their loans in december 1980 by selling 
mallightco a 1979 cadillac seville valued at 10575 and credited 
against the loans the wrights made no payments on these loans 
during 1980 
in september 1980 marlene mallick obtained a 150000 loan from 
the ridglea bank which she immediately loaned to mallightco the 
interest rate on the loan from ridglea bank apparently fluctuated 
above the prime lending rate on september 12 1980 the mallicks 
and the wrights then each borrowed 75000 from malme rate 
reached 205 percent in may 1981 and again in july 1981 the 
interest rate on the loan from mallightco to the wrights remained 
at 135 percent 
the net effect of these loans from mallightco to the wrights is 
that during the first year of business the wrights had recovered 
their entire investment from mallightco plus an additional 25000 
the mallicks had added 65000 in cash and a 10575 car to their 
initial investment the wrights received a gift worth over 100 
from the mallicks in the form of reduced interest payments during 
1981 1982 and 1984 when market rates exceeded 135 percent they 
also received a gift from the mallicks in the form of marlene 
mallicks creditworthiness and her ability to obtain financing from 
the ridglea bank for the wrights although the gift is difficult to 
value we believe it is worth more than 100 wrights failure to 
disclose these gifts are also violations of house rule xliv

sinhalese militants detonated 
explosives buried in the road and blew up an army truck on monday 
in southeast sri lanka killing four soldiers and wounding eight 
government officials said 
the vehicle was on patrol in embilipitiya 80 miles southeast of 
colombo reported the officials who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules 
they said an attacker was killed during a raid by sinhalese 
extremists on a police station in kurunagala district 85 miles 
northeast of colombo 
the violence came one day before expiration of a oneweek 
ceasefire announced by president ranasinghe premadasa 
the truce was part of a peace package the government offered to 
sinhalese and tamil extremists in a bid to end six years of ethnic 
violence that has claimed at least 12600 lives 
leftwing sinhalese militants rejected the offer but the 
largest tamil militant group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
agreed on saturday to hold talks with the government 
premadasa asked the tamil rebels to pick a team for talks aimed 
at ending their campaign for a separate tamil homeland 
the tamil acceptance came after at least 100 people died last 
week in attacks that were blamed on the rebels 
the tamils most of them hindus comprise 18 percent of this 
island nations 16 million people the tamils began the separatist 
campaign in 1983 saying the majority sinhalese discriminated 
against them in jobs and education 
sinhalese mostly buddhists make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military 
the tamil tigers rejected an indiasponsored july 1987 accord 
that gave tamils limited autonomy complaining it did not meet 
their demands for selfrule 
sri lanka lies just south of the indian peninsula in the indian 
ocean india became involved because its own 60 million tamils were 
sympathetic to the rebel cause 
the accord triggered a violent sinhalese backlash sinhalese 
extremists who belong to the marxist peoples liberation front 
said the agreement conceded too much to the tamils and vowed to 
kill anyone who supported it 
the front has been blamed for more than 2500 political killings 
since january most of the victims were government officials and 
security personnel

natural gas policy act has been decontrolled for several years the 
new legislation would gradually remove controls from old gas

earlier victims the reports said ms laban was killed in the 
occupied west bank and salama in the gaza strip

in the west bank 
jewish settlers in a tiny enclave in the west bank city of 
hebron said they were creating a mobile armed militia and using 
attack dogs to defend their houses against arab stonings 
weve decided to create a trained group of people that would 
not interfere with the army but will reach troublesome spots and 
help defend jewish houses in hebron settler leader aharon domb 
said on israel radio well also secure jewish houses by using 
guard and attack dogs to be unleashed only in emergency 
situations

united states and the european community to urge an independent 
investigation of the killings of four palestinians during a border 
police raid last week on nahalin a west bank village

at least a partial army withdrawal as a condition for agreeing to 
elections in the occupied lands 
there is nothing to talk about regarding changes in the 
deployment of israeli army forces shamir said on army radio 
this deployment is necessary to maintain order and order is 
necessary for elections

creating a palestinian state shamir proposes the elections to 
choose palestinians to negotiate with israel 
i will talk and discuss and argue with my friends i hope 
ill convince them that although these doubts have some basis 
we can overcome such things the prime minister said on israel 
television 
if those implementing the plan decide that there will be no 
palestinian state here im saying there will be no palestinian 
state 
shamir told the committee palestinian election candidates would 
have to agree to certain limits in advance including rejecting a 
palestinian state israel radio said 
he also said he opposes international supervision of the vote 
plo leader yasser arafat on sunday demanded such supervision and 
the withdrawal of israeli troops as a condition for elections

would be a step toward the polls

in 1981 mallightco loaned the wrights an additional 37000 
over the period 1981 through 1983 the wrights and the mallicks 
made regular payments on their loans from the proceeds of their 
other investments however beginning in 1984 the wrights made 
little progress in reducing the outstanding principal balance and 
in fact were not meeting their interest payments the debt 
continued to accrue interest mallightco never demanded payment 
from the wrights or took any steps to collect the debt 
mallightco distributed several dividends to its shareholders in 
1986 and 1987 despite the wrights failure to make significant 
payments on their loans the company distributed 59000 in cash to 
the wrights as dividends while the mallicks also received 
dividends during this period all dividends to the mallicks were 
paid in the form of credits against their outstanding debts to the 
company until their loans were completely repaid in 1987 
on june 9 1988 the wrights through the james c wright jr 
blind trust formed in october 1987 sold their mallightco shares 
back to the company for 350000 the alleged market value of the 
shares at the time of sale the price consisted of 230000 cash 
and a 120000 unsecured fiveyear 10 percent interestbearing 
note subordinate to all present and future debt of mallightco the 
wrights paid back most of their outstanding loan balance then 
80000 from the cash received from the sale approximately 
12700 in accured interest was forgiven in the transaction between 
mallightco and the blind trust 
it appears that the wrights received greater benefit from their 
interest in mallightco than did the mallicks since the wrights had 
the use of a substantial amount of cash provided by the mallicks 
however although no effort was made to collect the wrights loans 
from mallightco those loans did accrue interest at the rate of 
approximately 10 percent per year and were ultimately paid back 
almost entirely although 12700 in interest was not paid back 
that transaction occurred between mallick and the trustee of 
wrights blind trust special outside counsel assumes that wright 
was unaware of this gift to his blind trust and will rectify the 
account with mallick when the gift is made known to him thus 
wright ultimately paid for the use of the money he borrowed and has 
apparently not violated any law or ethical standard with respect to 
his mallightco investment 
on the other hand we believe that wright violated house rules 
with respect to his indirect receipt of and failure to report 
additional gifts from the mallicks bestowed in the form of salary 
paid to betty wright by mallightco free housing to the wrights in 
fort worth from 1979 through march 1988 and the use of a 1979 
cadillac seville in washington dc from 1983 until approximately 
february 1989 
betty wright began working for mallick in 1979 as a parttime 
consultant for mallick properties inc which hired mrs wright to 
help mallick expand his real estate ventures into areas of texas 
beyond fort worth mrs wright earned 18000 per year for her 
parttime work on a brochure entitled the mallick community 
concept for market studies of austin and san antonio texas and 
for her access to officials and other key people in the austin and 
san antonio areas although it is impossible to determine how much 
time mrs wright devoted to her employment with mallick properties 
inc it does appear that she did identifiable work on projects 
arguably within her expertise which may have been worth 18000 a 
year to the company 
on january 1 1981 mrs wright went on the payroll of 
mallightco inc at a salary of 1500 per month according to 
mallick mrs wright was hired as a consultant to seek out new 
investment opportunities for mallightco however mrs wright 
formerly on the staff of the subcommittee on investigations and 
oversight of the house public works committee had no education or 
prior experience in investment analysis or financial counseling 
she performed few if any services to mallightco which has no 
record of any work product she created 
furthermore although mallick testified that mrs wright 
assisted him and advised him he could not articulate what 
valuable services she performed he testified to research she did 
on several investment opportunities during the four years she was 
paid by mallightco but could not produce any research reports or 
even point to one investment mrs wright researched which was 
ultimately made by the company 
moreover although mallick was the one responsible for making 
investment decisions and both he and his assistant pamela smith 
performed services of value for mallightco neither mallick nor 
smith received a salary from mallightco in fact mrs wrights 
salary was mallightcos greatest expense the company frequently 
had to borrow money from the mallick company or other mallick 
entities in order to pay mrs wrights salary ultimately 
mallightco could not continue the expense mrs wrights salary was 
suspended as of december 31 1984 thus from 1981 through 1984 
mrs wrights salary was a gift from mallick

greek premier andreas papandreou filed a libel 
lawsuit monday accusing time magazine of defaming him in a story 
that suggested he took millions of dollars in payoffs his american 
lawyer said 
the lawsuit was announced here by lawyer leonard boudin who 
said the lawsuit was filed in london because the story was more 
damaging abroad than in the united states 
he conceded however that another factor was that it is easier 
for a public figure to make a case under english libel law than 
under american 
the time story which concerned allegations of financial 
wrongdoing at a greek bank that have rocked the papandreou 
government since last fall was on the cover of the magazines 
march 13 international edition a similar story ran in the us 
edition but it was not the cover story 
the articles quoted former greek bank president george koskotas 
who is jailed in massachusetts and fighting extradition to greece 
as saying he passed millions from the bank of crete to papandreou 
and other figures in the premiers socialist government 
papandreou has been greeces premier since 1981 his government 
is up for reelection in june but the banking scandal and the 
70year premiers open affair with a 34yearold former airline 
stewardess have hurt his standing among voters according to recent 
polls 
papandreou has denounced the time article as part of an 
international conspiracy to topple his government 
boudin said papandreou would ask for a considerable 
reasonable sum in damages from time but said the amount hasnt 
been decided he said clearing papandreous name was the main 
reason for the lawsuit launched only after time failed to respond 
to a demand for an public apology and retraction 
time promised in a statement to vigorously defend itself 
what is most alarming about the announcement of this lawsuit 
is the inescapable conclusion that prime minister papandreou is 
suing the messenger because he wishes to discredit the message 
the magazine said in a statement 
such a suit just by being brought disregards a central role 
of the press in a free democratic society which is to make 
important information available to the public time magazine will 
take whatever steps are necessary to fight the allegations of this 
lawsuit and defend its right to report news and information it 
deems in the public interest the statement said 
boudin said he could not recall another case in which a head of 
state sued for libel although there have been a number of cases 
brought by highly placed public figures in recent years including 
the lawsuit filed against time by ariel sharon the former israeli 
defense minister 
in that case a new york jury found in 1985 that time had erred 
but had not acted with malice and therefore did not have to pay 
damages 
in england papandreou need only show that the story written 
about him was defamatory and injured his reputation while the 
magazine has the task of proving that what it wrote was true 
boudin said in the united states papandreou would have to show 
not only that time wrote untruths but that it acted with malice 
besides new yorkbased time the lawsuit filed in london names 
as defendants timelife branches in london and amsterdam and the 
writer of the article robert ajemian 
time wrote that papandreou had refused to be interviewed or to 
answer questions the magazine submitted before publishing the 
article but boudin countered that the questions were of a general 
sort about government integrity and not about any specific 
accusations of wrongdoing by papandreou

the second area pursued by special outside counsel was 
the circumstances surrounding representative wrights 
intervention in a matter before the department of the interior on 
behalf of texas oil amp gas company 
counsel reported that on september 28 1979 representative 
wright cosigned a letter to secretary of the interior cecil d 
andrus on behalf of texas oil amp gas corporation txo the 
letter provided secretary andrus with background information on txo 
and its dispute with the arkla exploration company over mineral 
exploration leases on land in arkansas 
the undisputed facts are that representative wright held no 
interest in txo at any relevant time as discussed in the counsels 
report from february 1979 until march 1984 representative wright 
held an interest in the whatley no 1 well an easttexas natural 
gas well drilled and operated by txo however as an investor in 
the well representative wrights financial return was determined 
only by the productivity of the well and could not have been 
affected by txos success or failure with respect to the arkansas 
leases representative wrights september 28 1979 letter did not 
comment upon the merits of the dispute between txo and arkla nor 
did it demand or request extraordinary action by department 
officials in view of these findings special outside counsel 
concluded that representative wrights letter was not an improper 
communication 
the committee concurred 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the fourth area explored by special outside counsel was 
whether government resources were improperly used to complete 
work on a book reflections of a public man from which he 
representative wright received royalties 
special outside counsel reported that matthew cossolotto a 
writer and researcher on representative wrights staff testified 
that he spent about 200 hours over an 811 month period preparing 
the book reflections of a public man for printing other 
members of the congressmans staff had more limited roles in the 
preparation of the book 
in addition representative wrights congressional office used 
some government resources to complete the manuscript albeit on an 
apparently limited basis while materials paid for by government 
funds may not be put to personal use the special outside counsel 
did not focus on this issue because of the limited extent to which 
this occurred instead counsel examined the efforts of 
representative wrights staff primarily mr cossolotto in 
assisting book preparation 
special outside counsel concluded that a violation warranting 
further action was not indicated based upon the evidence and 
testimony counsel did not conclude that representative wrights 
use of his congressional staff to prepare his book violated 
relevant standards of conduct in this connection while no 
apparent attempt was made to keep the staffs work on the book 
separate from their work on official business it nevertheless 
remains that no records were kept of hours worked on the book as 
compared to the hours spent on official business this applied to 
not only matthew cossolotto who spent far more time than any other 
staff employee working on the book but the other staff members as 
well 
relevant testimony of representative wrights staff was that 
during the time of book preparation there were periods during 
which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour work weeks thus 
it is entirely possible indeed even probable that although some 
work on the book was done during the normal 9 am to 5 pm 
work day staff employees worked on the book in addition to 
completing all the tasks ordinarily done as part of their official 
duties

two sailors were missing monday evening after a 
652foot freighter en route from greece apparently sank in rough 
seas 400 miles southeast of cape cod twentythree crew members 
were rescued 
the 23 sailors from the star of alexandria were found on a 
lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship ravenscraig coast 
guard petty officer randy midgett said in new york 
theyre all in good shape some minor cuts and scrapes 
midgett said 
the two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft 
which was the object of a hunt monday evening by the 950foot 
ravenscraig and five navy and coast guard search planes officials 
said 
the ravenscraigs crew spotted a second life raft but it turned 
out to be empty 
the cause of the sinking was not immediately known officials 
said 
the star of alexandria had been en route from athens greece to 
new york with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 
12foot seas and winds up to 35 mph midgett said the first mayday 
call went out at 905 am 
a coast guard jet from the air station on cape cod and a c130 
plane from elizabeth city nc converged on the ship the 
lifeboat was spotted around noon 
the c130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat 
carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish 
communications midgett said about four hours later they were 
rescued by the ravenscraig 
the star of alexandria was not spotted and was presumed to be 
sinking or sunk midgett said visibility in the rough seas was 
five to eight miles monday afternoon 
the star of alexandria was built in 1966 and was registered in 
england it was designed to carry bulk freight and was owned by 
caribene investments ltd of gibraltar according to bureau 
veritas a parisbased shipping registry 
the ravenscraig had been bound for england but its destination 
after its rescue mission was not immediately known

accordingly because it was not possible to determine whether 
representative wright directed his staff to work on the book during 
time that should have been devoted to official business special 
outside counsel did not conclude that representative wright 
violated any law or standard of conduct 
the committee concurred with special outside counsel central to 
the committees conclusion was the undisputed fact that mr 
cossolotto the primary staff person who assisted representative 
wright on the book did not create text for the congressman 
instead mr cossolottos efforts focused solely on editing the 
congressmans words as opposed to creating and editing text of his 
own devise thus it can be fairly said that mr cossolottos 
efforts were not solicited for the purpose of generating text for 
representative wrights book but rather for the editing of text 
previously prepared by the congressman second and of equal 
importance is the fact that there is no evidence supporting a 
finding that mr cossolottos work on the book was done to the 
detraction of his official responsibilities as a congressional 
staff member consequently it is entirely reasonable that mr 
cossolottos time working on the book regardless of when it 
occurred did not deny the government specifically representative 
wrights congressional office full value of services paid for out 
of the official allowance 
in the light of the foregoing the committee did not conclude 
that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred in 
connection with mr cossolottos or other staff activities 
associated with preparation of representative wrights book again 
this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that no records were 
maintained regarding mr cossolottos or other staff daily 
activities the irregular nature of work hours by congressional 
staff and the fact that there is no evidence that mr cossolottos 
fulfillment of his official responsibilities suffered as a result 
of his efforts on the book

vice presidentelect francisco 
merino said monday leftist rebels are the only generators of 
violence in el salvador and his rightist party is forming an 
agency to keep track of them 
he was asked if abductions and killings of leftists by 
rightwing groups constituted terrorism and he said not that i 
know of because there is no extreme right 
merino of the republican nationalist alliance known as arena 
blamed rebels for a bomb attack on his home friday that caused 
extensive damage and slightly injured a nephew 
merino and his wife maria antonieta were not at home at the time 
of the bombing four children and two other nephews in the house 
were not harmed 
merino and presidentelect alfredo cristiani of arena won the 
march 19 election defeating the centrist christian democrats and 
are to be inaugurated june 1 for fiveyear terms 
at a news conference monday merino gave the names addresses 
and workplaces of eight people he said belonged to the guerrilla 
cell that attacked his home he said the information came from a 
rebel who was captured and interrogated by police but released for 
lack of evidence of involvement in the bombing 
police have not arrested the eight people he named because of 
an excess of work for lack of resources or for lack of will 
merino said 
he said arena was forming an intelligence service to receive 
information from citizens about activities of the rebel alliance 
the farabundo marti national liberation front 
our party our local headquarters and our leaders will receive 
in confidentiality all the information and pass it on to the 
armed forces the police and judicial authorities according to the 
case he said 
people should go before our local leaders and tell them of 
these cases he added the members of our organization meet 
frequently and this way we can elaborate a more complete picture 
of the rebel movement so the people play a more active role in 
imposing order 
arena was founded in 1981 as an anticommunist group 
international human rights organizations and the us government 
linked party leaders some of whom remain active to rightist death 
squads that killed thousands of people in the early 1980s 
the party denies any connection with death squads and cristiani 
did not join the party until 1985 
merino said arena would be only a conduit for citizen reports 
and would not take followup action on its own 
he said security forces would definitely be the ones to take 
appropriate action arena is a civilian institution we do not have 
the capacity to counter the military action of these groups 
merino called the guerrillas the only generators of violence 
in el salvador and added if we can minimize the terrorists 
action the level of violence of victims will tend to diminish 
leftist rebels began their battle for power nine years ago more 
than 70000 salvadorans have been killed and most of the victims 
were civilians

during the 1979 through 1984 period that mrs wright was on the 
payroll of mallick properties inc and mallightco she and her 
husband also received free housing from mallick just steps away 
from his office in fort worth mallick testified that housing was 
provided not as a part of compensation but because it was 
convenient for him to have mrs wright living only a few feet away 
from his office mallick could not explain why her job required her 
to be so close to his office in fact much of her work for mallick 
properties was done in austin and san antonio moreover throughout 
her employment with mallick mrs wright lived primarily in 
washington dc spending on the average only one week a month in 
fort worth thus her consulting jobs plainly were not jobs 
requiring her to be close to the office the free housing was thus 
not job related but a gift from mallick 
beginning in 1985 the wrights began paying rent for the housing 
mallick provided the rent was determined by dividing the fair 
monthly rental of the apartment 650 by 30 the average number of 
days in a month the wrights were charged 2167 or sometimes 
2100 or 2150 for each day they personally occupied the 
apartment notwithstanding the fact that since their furniture and 
personal belongings occupied the apartment every day they had 
constructive possession of the apartment daily thus in 1985 the 
wrights paid rent of 88150 for the equivalent of 41 days at 
2150 per day in 1986 an election year they paid 171192 for 
79 days in 1987 they paid 756 for 36 days at fair market rent 
the apartment would have cost the wrights 7800 per year finally 
after renting for 10 days through march 1988 the wrights bought 
the apartment at what appears to be its fair market value of 
58500 wrights receipt of housing at substantially below market 
rental is a gift from mallick 
beginning in 1983 mallick provided betty wright with free use 
of mallightcos 1979 cadillac seville mrs wright brought the car 
to washington and has used it there ever since although the car is 
referred to in mallightcos records as the bw cad mallightco 
owned the car until approximately february 1989 and paid expenses 
including license fees insurance tires and repairs until 
approximately february 1989 
on february 16 1989 special outside counsel received a copy of 
a february 9 1989 letter to the committee from thomas h law 
trustee of the james c wright jr blind trust law stated that he 
recently discovered that 
 
the speakers wife betty as an officer of mallightco used 
an automobile owned by that company i have been informed that the 
parties treated this transaction as a loan of the car to mrs 
wright to be handled similarly to other loans from mallightco to 
its principals i have been further informed that the parties 
intended that the automobile be purchased by the trust at its 
inception unfortunately due to an oversight the automobile was 
overlooked at the trusts creation and never accounted for 
 
thus only after special outside counsel had completed its 
investigation and questioned witnesses regarding mrs wrights use 
of the car law discovered the inadvertent omission of the car 
from the trust records law further stated in his letter

police said monday that art thieves 
returned one of three van gogh paintings stolen from a museum to 
prove they had the other two and add pressure to their demand for a 
25 million ransom 
but the thieves failed to give further instructions no ransom 
was paid and the location of the remaining two paintings wilted 
sunflowers and an early version of the dutch impressionists 
world famous the potato eaters remains a mystery police 
spokesman sgt theo reus told the associated press 
he said the painting the loom was recovered unharmed on 
april 6 in the trunk of a car parked near the home of rwd 
oxenaar director of the kroellermueller national museum in this 
eastern dutch village 
total value of the three works taken after a museum window was 
smashed on dec 12 has been estimated at 100 million to 125 
million 
recovery of the loom followed almost a month of secret 
negotiations between oxenaar and the thieves reus said 
he said that on march 13 the crooks sent oxenaar a written 
demand for a 25 million ransom in exchange for the three 
paintings 
the letter drew no response because it contained no proof the 
sender was in possession of the paintings he added 
on march 22 a man telephoned oxenaar asking why did you not 
respond to my letter and threatening to burn all three 
paintings reus reported 
a week later he said oxenaar was mailed a recent photograph of 
wilted sunflowers that experts said was genuine and on april 
6 oxenaar was called and told where the loom had been left 
they the thieves may have thought just a photograph wasnt 
convincing enough the sergeant said 
he said the thieves called oxenaar last monday to arrange for 
delivery of the ransom money but did not follow up as promised 
with further instructions 
reus said monday of efforts to recover the masterpieces we 
havent really found anything just one painting and that was 
given to us

i have currently rectified this situation by purchasing as 
trustee the automobile from mallightco the purchase price was 
7050 the value of the automobile on mallightcos books as of 
january 1 1983 at which time it was taken to washington dc the 
trust made a cash payment of 7050 plus 7 percent interest dating 
back to january 1 1983 for a total cash payment of 10011 
in addition the trust holds a 120000 note payable from 
mallightco this note has been reduced by 930285 representing 
the sums paid by mallightco for insurance on and repairs to the 
automobile from january 1 1983 to present 
 
law does not explain how the oversight was discovered nor does 
he explain how the purchase of the automobile in 1989 at its 1983 
book value rectifies the trusts failure to purchase the car in 
1987 
plainly laws february 9 1989 letter to the committee is an 
attempt to cover up wrights violations of house rule xliii clause 
4 with respect to mallicks gift of the car mallightco never 
expected nor attempted to collect rental or loan payments for 
the car 
george mallick testified that betty wright had the car because 
she would use the car in connection with her work for 
mallightco however even assuming that betty wrights employment 
by mallightco in 1983 and 1984 was bona fide there is no evidence 
that she did any work for mallightco in washington dc which 
required use of a car in addition regardless of the legitimacy of 
mrs wrights mallightco employment there is absolutely no 
justification for her retention of the car after she stopped 
working for the company therefore the value of using the car from 
1983 to date and all related expenses are gifts from mallick to 
wright received in violation of house rules 
of course in order for gifts to violate house rules they must 
be received from someone with a direct interest in legislation 
before congress in this matter we believe it is clear that george 
mallick had such an interest we further impute his interest in 
legislation to his wife marlene mallick 
mallick is and has been a major real estate developer in fort 
worth having developed commercial and residential properties worth 
over 160 million prior to 1986 mallick also had major holdings 
in texas oil and gas ventures in 1986 he stood to profit from the 
proposed redevelopment of the fort worth stockyards which relied 
heavily on public funds being appropriated by congress thus he 
had a direct interest in legislation affecting the taxation of real 
estate interest rates the oil and gas industries and 
appropriations for the stockyards project 
in addition mallicks financing of certain real estate ventures 
through savings and loan associations and the subsequent 
foreclosure on at least one of those properties gave mallick a 
direct interest in legislation regarding the savings and loan 
industry nevertheless in late 1986 wright designated mallick to 
conduct an investigation and prepare a report concerning the 
savings and loan crisis in texas the report addressed issues 
of concern to mallick and recommended legislation which would curb 
the industrys right to foreclose on loans in default 
thus as discussed in full in section iii e of this report 
wright repeatedly violated house rule xliii clause 4 rule xliv 
and consideration 5 of the code of ethics for government service

members of two farflung families came forward 
from four states monday to claim half the record 699 million 
illinois lotto jackpot leaving the holders of the two other 
winning tickets unknown 
its more money than any of us ever expected to see in our 
lifetimes said daniel dixon 38 of suburban naperville ill 
who bought one winning ticket for his wifes family 
louis and mary matlosz of elizabeth nj and their four 
children including dixons wife maryann and three grandchildren 
joined dixon at a news conference saying they would split their 
175 million share of the jackpot and plan to spend the money on 
vacations and on the grandchildren 
another winner was ron miller 36 a hog buyer from little york 
who will share his prize with brothers in stafford texas and 
chandler ariz 
miller said he was hysterical after learning he had won 
i sat at the table and laughed 
the news got around fast in little york a town of 300 in 
westcentral illinois and a big sign in the post office declared 
congratulations ron 
state computers recorded that four winning tickets were sold 
two in the chicago area one in westcentral illinois and one in 
southern illinois 
both the matlosz family and the miller family bought 15 lotto 
tickets and miller said he was not surprised the 699 million 
jackpot was being shared 
its more money than ill ever use miller said 
he said he would not quit work altogether but ill find 
something i like a little better 
the matlosz family members planned to keep working 
the remaining winners were expected to come forward this week 
perhaps after making financial preparations 
most people will have already gotten some advice said state 
lottery director sharon sharp 
the final figure for the jackpot boosted by four winnerless 
drawings and a frenzy of ticketbuying last week before saturdays 
drawing was 69940000 ms sharp said 
the huge jackpot which nearly doubled in the week before the 
drawing drew dreamers to lotto outlets from around the country and 
even the world as travelers flocked to lotto kiosks at ohare 
international airport between planes 
by monday life was back to normal in lottoland its a lot 
slower than last week ms sharp said 
the jackpot bolstered by a week of record sales beat the world 
record of 6198 million set in october in california that pot was 
split among three winning tickets one bought by an individual and 
the others bought by groups of coworkers 
if only one person had matched the numbers the jackpot would 
have been the largest paid to a single winner but with four 
ticketholders sharing the pot the largest single winner in us 
history remains a florida woman who walked away with 5516 million 
in the florida lottery in september 
the winning numbers drawn saturday were 3 14 32 40 46 and 54 
illinois lotto players pick six numbers from 1 to 54 with two 
chances on each 1 ticket the odds that a ticket carries a winning 
sequence are 129 million to 1

the final item addressed in the preliminary inquiry concerns 
representative wrights 
possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with officials 
of the federal home loan bank board 
based upon his examination of a number of instances in which 
representative wright interacted directly or through staff with 
officials of the federal home loan bank board special outside 
counsel concluded that there was reason to believe representative 
wright exercised undue influence in dealing with that agency the 
committee did not concur 
it is clear that under our constitutional form of government 
there is a constant tension between the legislative and executive 
branches regarding the desires of legislators on the one hand and 
the actions of agencies on the other in carrying out their 
respective responsibilities the assertion that the exercise of 
undue influence can arise based upon a legislators expressions of 
interest jeopardizes the ability of members effectively to 
represent persons and organizations having concern with the 
activities of executive agencies 
accordingly while it may well be that representative wright was 
intemperate in his dealings with representatives of the federal 
home loan bank board the committee is not persuaded that there is 
reason to believe that he exercised undue influence in dealing with 
that agency in sum such a finding cannot rest on pure inference 
or circumstance or for that matter on the technique and 
personality of the legislator but instead must be based on 
probative evidence that a reprisal or threat to agency officials 
was made

during the course of counsels investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding the gifts received by representative 
wright from george mallick a question was raised regarding 
mallightco incs acquisition of a 4 percent interest in an oil 
well deal known as the north sabine lake prospect located in 
orange county texas 
in sum counsel found that on may 10 1988 mallightco inc 
with michael mallick acting on behalf of mallightco inc formally 
acquired a 4 percent interest in the well from jaffe energy 
corporation for 9120 also on may 10 1988 mallick entered into 
a transaction with union rheinische petroleum inc urp in 
which urp loaned mallightco incs 440000 
what this meant was that mallightco received 350000 cash owed 
jaffe nothing for drilling and completion expenses and would 
receive 15 percent of the working interest of the well after urp 
received 440000 in oil and gas revenues but mallightco would not 
be liable for repayment of the loan soon after mallightco executed 
this agreement with urp it tendered an offer to the trustee of the 
james c wright jr blind trust the blind trust to 
repurchase all the trusts shares of mallightco inc stock for 
350000 this sale was consummated on june 9 1988 michael 
mallick submitted mallightcos unaudited balance sheet dated may 
16 1988 the balance sheet reported mallightcos total assets to 
be 1248632 and its total liabilities to be 545529 mallightco 
thus reported a net worth of 703102 a majority of the companys 
assets was its sabine lake investment valued at 650000 
mallightco inc paid the blind trust two checks totalling 230000 
and a promissory note in the amount of 120000 the trust endorsed 
one check over to mallightco inc for 8182170 representing the 
outstanding balance of the trusts indebtedness to mallightco 
including part of the interest accrued and tendered the trusts 
stock certificates back to mallightco 
against the backdrop of these business transactions between 
jaffe energy corporation michael mallick mallightco inc and 
representative wrights blind trust all of which occurred during 
the period january through june 1988 are the salient facts 
regarding drilling activities on the north sabine lake well

drilling on the sabine lake well began march 4 1988 the well 
reached total depth of 11560 on april 2 1988 at a cost of 
1256151 the well operator brammer engineering co ran an 
electric log on that date to determine the potential productivity 
of the well the log revealed the probable presence of oil and gas 
in a seven foot band of hackberry sand at a depth of 11272 11280 
feet based upon these log indications the owners of the well 
primarily jaffe energy inc and goodrich oil co decided to 
comence completion operations 
from april 3 1988 to april 22 1988 brammer engineering 
worked to install the necessary equipment on the well to begin 
testing and production the initial tests on the well on april 23 
1988 indicated flows of oil and gas in commercially productive 
amounts 
however over the next few days testing revealed alarming 
declines in oil and gas production and well pressures were 
occurring the well clearly had tapped into a reservoir containing 
some oil and gas but because the well pressure readings steadily 
declined during all tests it was also clear that the well was not 
a gusher 
brammer engineering undertook numerous attempts to stimulate 
production in the well 
all of these efforts had roughly the same result temporary 
stimulation of production but the wellhead pressures inexorably 
dropped as time progressed by may 4 1988 the well had declined 
to a point that it was uneconomical to test the negligible 
quantities of gas and no oil by may 10 1988 brammer had spent 
nearly a million dollars trying to complete the well 
despite these disheartening results from the well on may 10 
1988 urp nevertheless acquired michael mallicks 4 percent 
interest in the venture for 440000 in the manner described above 
records received from brammer engineering reveal that throughout 
the month of may 1988 brammer kept trying to stimulate pressure in 
the well and to turn the well into a profitable producer however 
all of brammers efforts were unsuccessful brammer shutin the 
well on june 9 1988 having spent 2890000 to drill and complete 
the well brammer suspended all operations for almost two months 
 
brammer engineering promptly decided to plug the original well 
and the sidetrack well and to abandon the site plugging operations 
were concluded on september 24 1988 the drilling derrick and 
barge were removed and the site was abandoned on september 25 
1988 
regardless of the method used to value the well on may 10 1988 
it seems clear that michael mallicks 4 percent interest was worth 
a fraction of the 440000 paid by urp while the loan from urp 
may well have been a gift to michael mallick or mallightco inc 
counsel could not conclude based upon available evidence that any 
house rules were violated during the entire time mallightco inc 
was involved in sabine lake representative wrights ownership of 
his mallightco inc stock was in a blind trust thus special 
outside counsel could not say whether representative wright knew of 
the sabine lake transaction the urp loan or of the great 
disparity between the loan price and the value of the fractional 
interest in the well nor whether urp had a direct interest in 
legislation accordingly special outside counsel recommended 
further investigation into mallightcos loan transaction with urp 
the committee agreed with special outside counsel that important 
questions remain to be resolved regarding urps transaction with 
mallightco inc as well as the later transaction with 
representative wrights blind trust available evidence suggests 
that far too much money was paid by urp to acquire its interest in 
the north sabine lake prospect given that the well records indicate 
an unsucessful venture accordingly the committee has issued a 
series of subpoenas to the relevant parties for the purpose of 
obtaining the information necessary to resolve remaining questions 
the committee will take such additional action regarding 
mallightco incs purchase and sale of its interest in the north 
sabine lake prospect if the facts indicate there is reason to 
believe violations occurred

the foregoing discussion and explanation of the committees 
actions taken in connection with the preliminary inquiry into the 
assertions raised against representative wright have been presented 
pursuant to the committees wellestablished policy to make full 
public disclosure of the results of its investigative activities 
while as discussed above certain additional work will continue 
it is the committees view that the foregoing statement will be 
sufficient to explain why no further action has been taken in 
connection with certain areas of the june 9 1988 preliminary 
inquiry this statement also explains why a fivecount statement of 
alleged violation covering 69 separate violations has been issued 
to representative wright regarding those matters in which the 
committee has determined that there is a reason to believe such 
violations have occurred beyond this statement the committee will 
have no further disclosures of information or documents in this 
matter except in accordance with the committees rules of procedure 
 
the foregoing explanatory statement and statement of alleged 
violation were agreed to by the committee on april 13 1989 by a

the crash of delta flight 191 would 
have been even more disastrous if the crew had aborted a landing 
attempt because of wind shear a witness for delta air lines 
testified monday 
flight 191 crashed at dallasfort worth interntational airport 
during a thunderstorm on aug 2 1985 killing 136 people on board 
and a motorist twentyfive people survived 
delta air lines sued the federal government in an attempt to 
force it to help pay about 125 million in claims by victims 
relatives and 25 million for the cost of the l1011 destroyed in 
the crash 
the nonjury liability trial which recessed last month after 
the government rested its case resumed with delta presenting 
rebuttal witnesses 
the national transportation safety board has blamed the crash on 
a microburst a violent downward blast of air often associated with 
severe thunderstorms 
the government has contended that planes crew should have tried 
sooner to maneuver the jet out of the storm 
but university of texasarlington professor b robert mullins 
testified that if the crew had tried to abort its landing when it 
encountered the violent wind shear the jet would have crashed 
sooner and fewer people would have survived 
mullins who played a videotape simulating deltas 
interpretation of what the crew encountered before the crash 
denied government assertions that the crew forced the jets nose 
down when trying to come out of the wind shear 
he said the planes nose was forced down because a head wind 
rapidly changed into a tail wind this is what started the course 
of events which eventually led to the accident mullins said 
delta contends that federal aviation administration air traffic 
controllers and national weather service meteorologists failed to 
warn flight 191s crew of the storms severity 
but the government has countered that the crew never sought 
information about the storm and that the planes weather radar 
should have warned the pilots against flying into a large storm 
cell 
throughout the trial the government has criticized delta crew 
training and procedures charging they have been inadequate for 
years 
the government has also tried to portray flight 191 pilot ted 
connors as a habitual user of the tranquilizer stelazine 
a denver psychiatrist testified monday that the amount of 
stelazine that connors was taking was not enough to impair the 
pilots judgment dr frederick lewis said he estimated from trial 
transcripts that connors took only 2 milligrams of the drug every 
three days 
the most frequent side effect of the stelazine is a temporary 
deterioration in motor abilities lewis said there is absolutely 
no evidence that ted connors had any of these sideeffects he 
said 
lewis said connors took the drug for jaw pain 
government attorneys pointed out that lewis had never treated or 
examined connors and that it was impossible to tell how often 
connors took tranquilizers because the prescription directed him to 
take them as needed 
deltas presentation of rebuttal testimony and evidence is 
expected to continue through wednesday the government has the 
option of rebutting or resting 
us district judge david o belew said he hopes to have a 
ruling in the lawsuit by aug 15

nearly 2000 students swarmed into central 
beijings tiananmen square by bicycle and on foot before dawn 
tuesday and cheered demands that the communist partys ruling 
politburo resign 
more than 1500 students in shanghai also took to the streets to 
express grief over the death saturday of former communist party 
chief hu yaobang and to demand more democracy 
students marched in both cities monday they put up posters on 
campus mourning hu a liberal reformist and expressing vague 
dissatisfaction with the government 
a poster at beijing university attacked senior leader deng 
xiaoping for the first time although not by name it blamed the 
84yearold deng for hus removal in 1987 
the marches were the largest since the 198687 prodemocracy 
demonstrations that led to hus forced resignation conservatives 
accused hu of being too liberal and failing to halt student 
demonstrations 
tuesdays demonstrations brought the revived student movement 
closer to a new political stage 
beijing students cheered when one speaker climbed on a monument 
to chinas revolutionary heroes and demanded that the 22member 
politburo resign 
they cheered a demand that party leaders reassess hus place in 
history it could not be determined how many demonstrators joined 
in formulating the demands 
most students dispersed after reaching tiananmen but about 200 
staged a sitin before the great hall of the people the national 
seat of government next to the square 
they presented six demands to the national peoples congress or 
parliament including reassessment of hus role opposition to 
antiliberal political campaigns and disclosure of leaders 
incomes they demanded freedom of speech and press higher pay for 
intellectuals and lifting restrictions on street marches 
the six demands did not include one for the politburos 
resignation 
an unidentified official received the demands but said they were 
major matters that needed to be studied at length 
the students sang the national anthem and the socialist 
internationale chanted long live democracy and oppose 
dictatorship and asked other students back on the campus to join 
them 
the fourhour march from campuses in northern beijing to 
tiananmen had the atmosphere of a recreational outing 
students joked and laughed and many said they didnt know what 
they would do once they reached tiananmen 
were going to honor the memory of hu yaobang one said 
we dont have any political goals 
several said the march began spontaneously shortly after

alexander dubcek whose reform program 
in czechoslovakia was crushed by the sovietled invasion in 1968 
has denounced hungarys former communist party leader for 
supporting the intervention 
dubcek was removed as czechoslovakias communist party leader 
after the invasion and remained out of public view for years 
recently he has been commenting on the actions that ended his 
reforms known as the prague spring 
he criticized former communist party chief janos kadar in an 
interview carried on the hungarian television program panorama 
it was believed to be the first time an interview with dubcek 
was broadcast by an official news channel in a sovietbloc country 
the official mti news agency on monday carried excerpts of the 
interview 
mti reported dubcek said kadar or wladyslaw gokmulka polands 
communist party leader in 1968 could have stopped the invasion by 
refusing to participate 
he was quoted as saying i hoped that kadar would finally say 
no to the intervention or that gomulka might have the strength 
to do so 
kadar and gomulka would have had to do their utmost because 
they alone would have been able to prevent the intervention 
romania was the only warsaw pact country that refused to take 
part in the invasion 
mti reported dubcek rejected claims by some of kadars 
supporters that he agreed to support the soviet invasion to protect 
economic reforms being introduced in hungary the agency quoted 
dubcek as saying that because of the invasion the reform movement 
slowed down for 20 years not only in czechoslovakia but also in the 
soviet union and hungary 
mti did not say where or when dubcek was interviewed 
kadar accused by some party officials of blocking hungarian 
reforms in the 1970s was replaced by karoly grosz last may 
gomulka was removed as polands party leader in 1970 
in another development monday hungarys communist party 
repealed its decision to expell four leaders who had been accused 
of harming party unity 
the decision by the partys central control commission came two 
days after some 600 communist reformers met in kecskemet and some 
speakers supported the idea of splitting away from the communist 
party 
two of the four who were expelled a year ago economist laszlo 
lengyel and political scientist mihaly bihari addressed the 
kecskemet meeting the other two are parliamentarian zoltan kiraly 
and zoltan biro who last month was elected to the presidium of the 
democratic forum 
all four have been associated with the democratic forum a 
reform organization established in september 1987 it has become 
one of the most influential of dozens of independent movements in 
hungary 
it was not known if the four would decide to rejoin the 
communist party now that kadar has been removed

in early 1986 the federal home loan bank board the bank 
board perceiving worsening conditions in the southwests 
economy and thrift industry began a massive examination of almost 
all the savings and loan associations in district 9 which included 
associations in texas new mexico louisiana arkansas and 
mississippi as a result the bank board discovered that many 
associations especially those in texas where state regulations 
were especially permissive were built on risky investments 
uncollectible loans and fraudulent appraisals while the real 
estate market was booming these associations appeared to be doing 
well however when the bottom dropped out of the texas real estate 
market the bank boards examinations showed that much of the 
profit had been imaginary 
the burgeoning number of savings and loan failures in texas and 
elsewhere placed enormous strains on the fslic fund which insures 
deposits in federal and statechartered savings and loan 
associations under federal law when fslic places an insolvent 
federallyinsured savings association into a receivership it must 
pay off the insured depositors almost immediately therefore each 
closure requires fslic to make an immediate cash outlay 
approximately equal to the insolvent associations deposits as 
fslics reserves dwindled it lost the financial ability to close 
even the most insolvent associations in late 1986 approximately 
250 associations required fslic assistance of these fslic 
considered 130 associations with stated assets of 476 billion 
to be severely troubled 
in response to this crisis in may 1986 a bill was introduced in 
the house of representatives which provided among other items 15 
billion in new funds for fslic without the use of general revenues 
the bill was referred to the house committee on banking finance 
and urban affairs which passed the bill by a vote of 47 to 1 
without significant amendment the bill was placed on the 
suspension calendar and was scheduled for consideration by the full 
house on monday september 29 1986 the suspension calendar is 
reserved for bills engendering little controversy however wright 
removed it from the calendar prior to its consideration the bill 
was rescheduled on october 6 1986 and on october 7 1986 it passed 
the house under suspension of the rules however because the 
senates version of the bill contained controversial provisions 
insufficient time remained to resolve the differences before 
congress adjourned on october 18 1986 
on january 6 1987 substantially the same bill was reintroduced 
in the new congress the banking committee held hearings later in 
january as members began increasingly to pass along complaints 
about regulators arbitrary actions in closing down savings and 
loan associations for the first time forbearance provisions 
ie provisions restricting fslics ability to close associations 
were discussed as part of the bill wright supported these 
forbearance provisions as well as a reduction in the 
recapitalization amount to 5 billion the bank board believed the 
forbearance provisions and the reduced recapitalization amount 
would severely hamper its ability to deal with the crisis although 
wright later supported 15 billion the house passed the 
recapitalization bill at the 5 billion level the amount was 
raised to 108 billion in conference and the forbearance 
provisions were weakened the bill was signed into law in august 
1987 
during this 19861987 period wright intervened with the bank 
board on behalf of four texas businessmen who were deeply embroiled 
in the savings and loan crisis one of these businessmen craig 
hall met with wright on september 2 1986 and informed him that 
the bank board was out of control and taking action against him 
which would have serious repercussions in the dallas and texas 
communities 
hall is a dallasbased real estate syndicator and one of the 
largest owners of real estate in texas once hall determined that 
the worsening texas economy threatened his ability to remain 
current on loans held by numerous savings and loan associations he 
sought assistance from the bank board and district banks in 
restructuring his debts held by fsliccontrolled savings and loans 
although the bank board was not adverse to the concept of a 
global restructuring it believed it could not legally assume the 
role of negotiator for those associations involved in the hall 
restructuring which were already under fslic control hall was 
required to negotiate individual agreements with the special 
representatives of each fsliccontrolled association 
hall was able to reach agreement with all but one 
fsliccontrolled association the westwood savings and loan of los 
angeles which held approximately 200 million in hall loans 
westwoods bank boardappointed special representative scott 
schultz and its outside counsel refused to accept conditions to 
the restructuring which were adverse to westwoods interests and 
decided to foreclose on halls properties and allow him to go 
bankrupt rather than accept his restructuring plan 
at the onset of foreclosure proceedings the bank board and 
district banks ceased communication with hall hall told wright in 
their september 2 1986 meeting that he had received no response to 
his efforts to reestablish communication with the bank board and 
district banks soon after meeting with hall wright called a 
meeting in his office with several texas congressmen and 
representatives of the bank board including its chairman edwin 
gray although hall may have been mentioned the meeting was 
generally devoted to passing along reports that bank board 
regulators were mistreating texas savings and loans 
wright called gray shortly after the meeting to complain about 
westwoods special representative scott schultz whom wright said 
was not as flexible or understanding as he might be wright asked 
if there was not anything gray could do about that situation 
wright never discussed the merits of the bank boards position and 
he rebuffed the bank boards offer to explain its position in the 
hall matter 
gray decided to further investigate the hall matter on friday 
september 26 1986 bank board chief of staff shannon fairbanks 
went to a meeting with hall and his california savings and loan 
creditors on that day hall learned that because of wrights 
interest in halls situation wright had placed a hold on the 
fslic recapitalization bill which had been scheduled for 
consideration by the house on the following monday 
gray and fairbanks thus determined that if they were to obtain a 
recapitalization bill they would have to facilitate a 
restructuring of halls loans on september 29 1986 gray replaced 
scott schultz with another special representative who was 
instructed to disregard outside couunsels legal advice and 
determine if there was any way to build a responsible economic case 
in support of renegotiating halls loans following grays removal 
of schultz and grays later assurances to wright that the bank 
board would not treat texas savings and loans unfairly the bill 
was returned to the house calendar it was passed by the full house 
under a suspension of the rules on october 7 1986

the house ethics committee with democrats and 
republicans united formally charged speaker jim wright monday with 
69 violations of the chambers rules including what the panels 
chairman called a scheme to evade limits on outside earnings 
after a 10month 15 million investigation the committee of 
six democrats and six republicans voted unanimously to issue a 
report finding reason to believe the texas democrat had run 
afoul of house rules requiring reporting of gifts barring 
acceptance of gifts from persons with a direct interest in 
legislation and limiting outside earned income 
i know in my heart i have not violated any of the rules of 
that institution wright said in a speech to a labor meeting 
shortly after the ethics report was released 
he said he had asked very urgently very earnestly for a 
quick meeting with the the committee to confront them to 
confront the allegations headon facetoface 
while scandal has tainted other house speakers wright is the 
first ever to be formally charged with ethical wrongdoing 
at a news conference committee chairman rep julian dixon 
dcalif emphasized that wright is presumed innocent until the 
charges are proven and he underscored that proving them requires a 
much heavier weight of evidence than the step taken monday which 
is the panels equivalent of an indictment 
the move set in motion a series of steps in which wright can 
defend himself and the panel try to prove with clear and 
convincing evidence that the violations occurred that is likely 
ultimately to throw the matter before the full house where 
wrights position as the nations highest elected democrat could be 
on the line 
possible punishments range from a reprimand to expulsion from 
the house although lawmakers in both parties seemed to think the 
final decision would come down to whether wright should be 
reprimanded or simply chastised for poor judgment and let off 
without formal punishment 
wright immediately began his defense in earnest operating what 
one supporter rep charles wilson dtexas called a war room 
out of the speakers office at some point weve got to start 
figuring out whos on our side and whos on the other side 
wilson said 
wilson predicted wright would win on the floor losing a few 
cowardly democrats and picking up some brave republicans 
the most serious allegation against wright that fort worth 
developer george mallick from whom he accepted 145000 in gifts 
over a 10year period had a direct interest in legislation also 
had the narrowest margin of support on the ethics committee 
according to records of internal committee votes released along 
with the report of the panels special outside counsel chicago 
attorney richard j phelan democrats chester atkins of 
massachusetts and bernard dwyer of new jersey joined the six 
committee republicans for an 8 to 4 margin on that issue 
the panel agreed with its counsel phelan that mallicks major 
interests in real estate and oil and gas ventures and in 
redevelopment of fort worths historic stockyards district gave him 
a direct interest in legislation on taxation and on certain 
appropriations bills his financing arrangements with savings and 
loan institutions also gave him an interest in legislation 
involving the sampl industry the committee found 
but wrights lawyer william c oldaker called that 
doublespeak and said its one of the most outrageous readings 
of legislative history he has seen overall the report contains 
a lot of noise a lot of clamoring but very little substance 
he said 
other matters before the committee were more clear cut the 
panel voted unanimously that there was reason to believe wright 
failed to report as gifts the use of a car and fort worth 
condominium he and his wife received from mallick committee 
members voted 102 that mrs wrights 18000ayear salary from a 
mallickwright company should also be characterized as a gift 
saying she did little or nothing to earn the money 
the panel also voted 102 that certain bulk sales of wrights 
book reflections of a public man appeared to have been used 
to evade house ceilings on outside earned income 
in the committees view seven bulk sales of rep wrights 
book demonstrated an overall scheme to evade the house outside 
earned income limit because speaking honorarium payments were 
recharacterized as royalties dixon said 
the committee voted unanimously to issue its statement of 
alleged violation formally charging the speaker with breaking the 
rules 
fortyseven possible violations raised by phelan were dismissed 
those involved allegations of improper lobbying of executive branch 
officials misuse of congressional staff and misuse of campaign 
funds 
republicans were largely holding their fire monday aware that 
any attack could help wright paint the investigation prompted 
last june by a complaint from rep newt gingrich rga as a 
partisan matter 
no republican is attacking jim wright said rep dan burton 
rind this is a bipartisan report of the ethics committee we 
are taking a waitandsee attitude we will serve as a jury lets 
not make this partisan 
but another gop lawmaker rep vin weber of minnesota said the 
committees release of its findings demonstrated that the charges 
are not trivial they are not technical they are not aimed at his 
wife as wright contended last week these are serious serious 
questions and 145000 is a lot of money 
the report said that mallightco a small investment company 
formed by wright mallick and their wives paid mrs wrights 
salary even though it often had to borrow money from mallicks own 
company to do so mallightco was little more than a conduit for 
cash flowing from the mallicks to the wrights the report stated 
on one issue the panel could not reach a conclusion and said it 
would investigate further that involved the purchase by mallightco 
of an interest in an oil and gas well known as the sabine lake 
prospect 
for an initial investment of 9120 the partnership bought a 4 
percent interest on may 10 1988 the well struck oil but soon 
played out and on june 9 was shut down despite the results a 
texas petroleum investment corporation union rheinische petroleum 
inc offered 440000 for mallightcos share on may 10 boosting 
the value of mallitco at a time when wrights blind trust was 
selling its interest 
an independent appraisal of the interest in the sabine lake 
prospect put its value at 69000 to 169000 far less than union 
rheinische offered

wright did not merely urge prompt consideration of or 
express judgment on the hall matter as specifically permitted 
in the select committee on ethics advisory opinion no 1 he 
removed the recapitalization bill from house consideration in order 
to pressure the bank board into changing its resolution of the hall 
matter regardless of the merits of the bank boards position such 
pressure is a violation of house rule xliii clause 1 as 
interpreted by advisory opinion no 1 
on october 6 1986 wright met with j scott mann iii an 
austin texas savings and loan operator who complained that the 
bank board was discriminating against texas savings and loans 
associations and that a recapitalized fslic would close large 
numbers of texas institutions mann also set forth his complaints 
in a letter of october 7 1986 which wright forwarded to gray 
asking that he check on the situations described gray investigated 
manns charges and reported to wright that manns creditbanc 
savings had committed serious regulatory violations and was in a 
precarious financial condition wright took no further action thus 
wrights request that gray check on manns charges is within the 
guidelines of advisory opinion no 1 which expressly provides that 
it is appropriate for a member to request information or a status 
report 
in early november 1986 wright telephoned gray regarding 
wrights friend thomas m gaubert of independent american 
savings association a texaschartered association with its main 
office in irving texas gaubert was also a contributor to the 
democratic party and treasurer of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
in january 1986 gaubert had been permanently removed from 
independent american and prohibited from operating any 
fslicinsured association gaubert had been involved in 
questionable transactions at an iowa savings and loan as well as 
regulatory violations and unsafe or unsound practices at 
independent american as of november 30 1986 independent american 
had a negative net worth of 454 million although gaubert entered 
into a written agreement removing him from the industry he later 
argued that he had been misled and treated unfairly and therefore 
that the agreement was invalid 
wright asked gray to meet with gaubert personally in order to 
get gauberts side of the story gray protested that bank board 
rules prohibit the chairman from meeting with parties to actions 
before the board despite grays protests wright insisted that 
gray meet with gaubert gray did so as an accommodation to wright 
following his meeting with gaubert gray made the unprecedented 
decision in january or february 1987 to appoint an independent 
counsel selected by counsel for gaubert to determine whether the 
bank board had in fact wrongfully removed gaubert from independent 
american gray testified that but for his perception of wrights 
influence on the recapitalization bill he would not have appointed 
independent counsel independent counsel ultimately determined that 
the bank board had not violated any statutes or regulations in its 
treatment of gaubert although it did note some instances of 
improper or unfair behavior none of which justified gauberts 
claim that he was removed improperly 
nonetheless despite the significant concessions made by gray 
at a meeting with officials of the bank board and fhlbdallas on 
february 10 1987 in wrights office wright made it plain that he 
viewed the outcome of the gaubert matter to have been extremely 
unsatisfactory the clear inference is that wright was not simply 
seeking impartial consideration of gauberts claim but a change in 
the bank boards regulatory response to gaubert such use of 
wrights influence is a violation of house rule xliii clause 1 as 
interpreted by advisory opinion no 1 
in december 1986 congressman tony coelho called wrights aide 
john mack and requested wrights assistance on behalf of don r 
dixon of vernon savings and loan in dallas and vernon texas 
coelho informed mack that the fslic was going to shut down vernon 
that day he asked that wright attempt to get dixon a grace period 
as dixon said he had a willing buyer 
mack testified that following his conversation with coelho he 
told wright of dixons problem wright telephoned gray and asked 
him whether vernon was being closed down gray responded that 
closing an institution requires a bank board meeting and he had not 
authorized any such meeting wright asked gray to find out if 
anything was happening and to call john mack with the information 
gray later informed mack that vernon was not being shut down 
but the fhlbdallas supervisory agents were going to seek a 
consent to merger agreement from vernons directors at the end 
of december 1986 gray explained that such an agreement would not 
affect the associations ability to find an investor and that mack 
should let the bank board know if an investor were found 
ultimately no investor was found and vernon was placed in 
receivership in march 1987 
in this instance since wright merely asked for information from 
the bank board no violation occurred 
in november 1986 wright again called gray to express his 
concern about the way texas institutions were being treated by the 
bank board he brought up the subject of h joe selby the director 
of regulatory affairs at the fhlbdallas and formerly the acting 
comptroller of the currency who had the reputation of being a 
tough regulator and who had been brought into the savings and loan 
crisis by gray to implement the bank boards supervisory and 
regulatory response because of his hardline posture selby was 
feared and distrusted by many in the thirft industry 
wright told gray he understood from unnamed sources that selby 
was a homosexual who was sending all of fhlbdallas work to a 
ring of homosexual lawyers in texas wright asked gray if there 
was anything gray could do to get rid of selby gray refused 
wrights request and defended selby as a highly competent regulator 
doing the tough job expected of him 
although unsuccessful wrights attempt to destroy selbys 
career based upon such an accusation violates house rule xliii 
clause 1 because it does not reflect creditably on the house 
similarly when in late 1987 or early 1988 wrights aide phil 
duncan called carl hoyle the bank boards director of 
congressional affairs and said he wanted william black fired from 
the staff of the fhlbsan francisco such a request indirectly from 
wright is also a violation of house rule xliii clause 1 
thus as discussed in full in section iii f of this report 
wright committed four violations of house rule xliii clause 1 as 
interpreted by advisory opinion no 1

constanzo is a cubanamerican who has lived in miami and 
aldrete is a texas college student who authorities said lived a

victims deaths to the murder kidnapping drug and weapons charges 
already pending against the four suspects 
although relatives disputed the description officials said the 
two newly found victims were drug dealers somehow involved with the 
cult 
castillos 76yearold father hidalgo castillo of brownsville

artistphotographer sergei petrov said monday he 
was being allowed to leave the soviet union after being refused 
permission to emigrate for eight years and that he hoped to go to 
the united states this week

petrov said he received notification from the soviet visa office 
in sundays mail and picked up his external passport monday he 
said he filed repeated invitations for visits to america with the 
visa office long ago and that they just picked one 
he replied when asked why he now was being granted permission to 
leave i will never know i think the reason is all the joint 
effort of the us embassy the state department and other 
countries like the netherlands and australia but mostly it was the 
state departments pressure 
petrovs photographs were put on display at the state department 
late last year and his case has been a priority human rights case 
pursued by washington 
he said he will go to the united states as soon as i can 
sometime this week but that his plans were not certain 
the photographer said former us ambassador arthur hartman and 
his wife donna worked especially hard on his case 
petrov said he was told before he began working in an 
electronics laboratory in 1977 that he would not be allowed to 
leave the soviet union for five years he left the laboratory after 
three months but officials continued to refuse permission to 
emigrate for years after 
in december he was refused permission when authorities allowed 
his 71yearold mother klavdia to go to the united states for 
medical treatment she is in washington dc

at least a dozen states are considering laws that would force 
companies to insure their employees as a way to stem billions of 
dollars in hospital losses and protect some of the 37 million

radio announcer jim svejda once did a 
classical music show examining the question do composers write 
music that unintentionally sounds like they look 
he also staged an interview with dead conductor wilhelm 
furtwangler who said his absence from the living would not be a 
problem in succeeding herbert von karajan as director of the berlin 
philharmonic orchestra because he was still a better conductor 
than karajan was alive 
svejda 42 brings his sometimes harsh and often hilarious 
musical insight to radio listeners nationwide through a pair of 
weekly american public radio programs the opera box and the 
record shelf he also hosts a daily classical music show on kusc 
in los angeles 
after 10 years at the station he has become a valuable property 
he is just what radio thrives on and that is a real radio 
personality said station president wallace a smith hes 
extremely quirky 
in his wry delivery that sounds a bit like a lockjawed 
satinvoiced edward g robinson svejda explores historical 
recordings recent releases the littleknown the underappreciated 
and indeed the quirky 
a piece on fat singers was described by svejda in the program 
guide as theres more of them to love a highcholesterol 
tribute to the centurys largest singers a show on operatic 
ingenues was called not much upstairs but what a staircase 
in another program svejda settled on bruckner as the ugliest 
composer a dirty golfball which when it smiled which wasnt 
often suggested a badly opened beer can 
underlying his approach seem to be two principles decry 
mediocrity and never sanctify the art 
classical music is human he said in a recent interview from 
kusc you read mozarts letters and they are unpublishable 
svejdas opinions are publishable though maybe just barely his 
book listing favorite recordings the record shelf guide was 
published last year 
of composer philip glass he writes a very nice man who has 
gotten very rich not by underestimating but by completely ignoring 
his audiences intelligence conductor nikolaus harnoncourt is an 
incompetent bozo tenor luciano pavarotti once great has 
become a vulgar sot 
of course since this is a book of svejdas favorites most of 
the adjectives are glowing 
in his comments literary and spoken svejda almost seems to be 
waging a campaign against karajan though he says that is not 
intentional 
hes repulsive said svejda referring to the conductors 
membership in the nazi party and success under hitler i think 
hes a symptom of whats happened since the war the new anonymity 
although he does have a distinctive personality he turns 
everything into mush 
gone too are the days when hearing five measures could 
identify an orchestra 
i dont think its too farfetched to say its a lot like 
airports said svejda one guy flies in for two weeks another 
guy flies in for two weeks 
conductors in svejdas favor include leonard bernstein simon 
rattle carlo maria giulini carlos kleiber michael tilson thomas 
and klaus tennstedt 
they say as much about themselves as they do about the piece 
which is now disreputable 
jet flying has also brought on the dark ages of opera as 
singers burn out their voices globehopping between performances 
he said 
its very depressing i like opera but i hate to see it 
dying 
svejda said he never provoked complaints from performers or 
composers he has skewered but some listeners have responded 
angrily according to smith 
some are outraged when svejda criticizes their favorite 
composers another during a request program was deeply offended 
when jim made the comment about a piece requested as being a piece 
of junk said smith other listeners were angered by svejdas 
title for a program on homosexual composers the third sex 
svejda who majored in philosophy at the university of michigan 
said he never doubts his critical conclusions 
i dont think its arrogance after a certain amount of time 
a certain amount of experience you develop an ear of course your 
glands tell you a lot he said 
the fact that he really has no regard for anybody who is 
living is a modest affirmation of how deadly serious he is smith 
said 
svejda also has a profound side answering his own question 
what is music good for at the conclusion of one program he 
said 
its a little like asking what are we good for a startlingly 
similar question as it turns out since the answer whatever it 
is amounts to almost the same thing

after eight years of sometimes 
bitter controversy bavarian leaders are planning a youth center in 
dachau to help teach younger generations of the nazi horrors that 
occurred in its notorious concentration camp 
but deep philosophical differences remain over just how the 
center will pass on its bitter lessons 
politicians here in highly conservative bavaria want the youth 
center to be under governmental control they envision it as a 
youth hostel that would combine instruction about the nazis with a 
chance to learn about the modernday city of dachau 
on the other side an association that has members in several 
countries argues that the leadership of the center should reflect 
more diverse views and be more international in scope 
the association for a dachau international youth meeting center 
says the guest house should serve almost exclusively as a forum to 
analyze the nazi past and its implications today 
juergen zarusky a leader of the association said he sees 
dangers in government control 
that means everything must be under government protection so 
that the past will be presented as a formal history lesson 
zarusky said in an interview both the personal impact and the 
search for meaning for today wont be presented as strongly 
zarusky a 30yearold doctoral candidate in modern history 
whos lived in dachau for three years said his group feels 
unfairly excluded from the project because local conservatives fear 
this could go in a leftist direction 
the concentration camp site including a museum and memorials to 
the dead already attracts about a million visitors a year 
twothirds of them foreigners the site also contains watch towers 
barbed wire fences a reconstructed barracks and the crematorium 
where the dead were once burned 
dachau which is about five miles north of munich was the first 
of a string of nazi concentration camps that became centers mainly 
for the extermination of jews mostly in gas chambers in world war 
ii 
official nazi records say that 206000 prisoners were kept at 
dachau although the actual number is believed to be much higher 
nazi records say that nearly 32000 prisoners died there but 
thousands of other deaths were not registered 
the nazis set up the concentration camp at dachau two months 
after seizing power jan 30 1933 its prisoners included jews 
communists social democrats clergymen and other opponents of the 
nazi regime 
bavarian officials opened the camp as a memorial in 1965 after 
agreeing to cooperate with the brusselsbased international dachau 
committee in supervising the site the committee made up of former 
dachau prisoners has representatives on the board of trustees of 
the association that wants an international youth center 
the association was formed in 1984 after three years of efforts 
by a local committee to establish a place where young people could 
meet and spend the night 
the plans ran into vehement opposition from the conservative 
christian social union officials at dachaus city hall they 
repeatedly have maintained that such a center would unfairly a 
create an extra burden on a city already saddled with a 
notorious past 
in 1987 members of the state parliament in munich filed several 
motions seeking to take the matter out of local hands as a way to 
find a solution 
as a result the bavarian education ministry this past september 
approved a plan for creating the youth center with sleeping 
accommodations for about 100 people as well as meeting rooms for 
both west germans and foreigners 
the youth guest house should contribute to enabling and 
promoting a discussion of the past that is linked to the spirit of 
democratic responsibility the education ministry said 
in its proposal for dachau however the education ministry 
called for the exclusion of events focusing on daytoday 
politics 
the ministrys manfred heger who is handling the project said 
the guest house is supposed to be multifunctional 
it isnt supposed to be set up exclusively for instruction 
about the camp memorial the concentration camp site nazism and 
fascism 
the association for a dachau international youth meeting center 
has rejected the government plan and continues to push for its own 
ideas including a greater reliance on former prisoners to narrate 
their horrifying experiences 
gabi hendl another leading member of the association brushes 
aside objections that the center could damage the citys reputation 
this youth meeting center is a chance for dachau and the 
people who live in the city to hear what young people from other 
countries are thinking said the 24yearold ms hendl a member 
of the leftistleaning social democratic party 
another member of the association is nikolaus lehner 65 a jew 
who survived dachau 
we arent politicizing he said were discussing 
history

archaeologists have unearthed an ancient 
cemetery in northern israel and say the 3000yearold finds 
indicate the phoenicians were landlubbers before they went to sea 
and dominated the mediterranean 
the phoenicians emerged about 1000 bc and established 
citystates throughout the mediterranean basin from lebanon to 
spain surviving until roman times 
pottery jewelry and other remains of their cities show a 
variety of influences from greek cultures in the aegean as well as 
ancient egypt and mesopotamia 
but little is known of the origins of the ancient phoenicians 
evidence uncovered by a hebrew university team in the tombs at 
achziv near israels border with lebanon point to a semitic 
background either from the ancient land of israel also known as 
canaan or further inland 
the team declined to give a specific location of the cemetery 
for fear of plunderers they believe artifacts and gold may be 
buried in the tombs 
elat mazar an archaeologist at hebrew university in jerusalem 
said the architecture of the tombs carved into the bedrock linked 
the early phoenicians to the ancient hittites a semitic people who 
lived in what is now turkey and syria and had no significant 
sailing tradition 
we found a hole in the ceiling on the tomb which is 
characteristic of hittite burial chambers she said in their 
cult of the dead it was a symbolic link between the living world 
and the world of the dead 
she added that the phoenicians had a sophisicated society with 
advanced sailing technology refined tastes in jewelry and an 
unparalled ability to adapt material from other cultures 
there is no question they were more developed than the 
israelite culture of the time they were semitic and close to the 
israelites but different 
the packrat characteristic of borrowing from neighboring 
societies made the phoenicians something of a mystery however 
patricia smith a britishborn anthropologist and dentist 
interviewed at her laboratory in jerusalems hadassah hospital 
said a study of the ancient human remains show the physical 
features of the phoenicians were semitic 
this was no greek said ms smith turning the skull of a 
phoenician and pointing to the wide skull arch of the nose and the 
high cheekbones a cast of an israelite skull from the same eighth 
to seventh century bc period had similar features 
from his teeth smith deduced that the man 45 to 50 years old 
when he died suffered either from fever or hunger in his infancy 
but was quite fit as an adult with not a single tooth cavity 
apart from this hole in his head he was very healthy smith 
said of the phoenician who died of a powerful blow to the back of 
his head apparently struck by a heavy blunt instrument 
the israeli expedition unearthed about 50 skeletons from two 
cave tombs measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet the cemetery covers 
seven acres and may contain the remains of thousands of phoenicians 
spanning almost the entire 1000year life of their society here 
ms smith said she hoped to use the remains especially the 
skulls to recreate the general phoenician look 
it will be very exiting to find out who the phoenicians were 
ms smith uses video cameras and still photography to recreate 
faces she employed the technique on behalf of the prosecution in 
the trial of john demjanjuk a cleveland ohio autoworker 
convicted last year in israel of nazi war crimes and sentenced to 
death 
she made a video that superimposed a recent video image of 
demjanjuk on a 40yearold nazi identity card to show it was the 
same man 
with the phoenicians she plans to use the same technique to 
superimpose video images from ancient drawings of phoenicians and 
modern sketches over the skulls themselves 
i would be able to define a type but not an individual we 
should be able to tell how varied the phoenicians were she said 
explaining that a perfect recreation was impossible without 
knowing the features of soft tissue such as eyelids ears and lips

two bearded rabbis recently slipped under the 
cover of night into an occupied west bank village to question 
residents about allegations of israeli troop brutality during an 
armyimposed curfew 
they are members of the new rabbinic human rights watch which 
is gaining prominence among the growing number of israeli groups 
monitoring abuses in the occupied territories 
membership has swelled from a handful of rabbis a few months ago 
to 75 rabbis embracing all streams of judaism the orthodox 
conservative and reform movements 
the groups first action was to survey community health care in 
several west bank villages then write to defense minister yitzhak 
rabin complaining that medical treatment was being used as a 
means of political pressure on the population 
it was immediately published in the papers and we said we as 
rabbis have the power we have credibility as jewish leaders who 
first of all think of the moral side said the usborn chairman 
of the group rabbi david forman 
the group has since monitored the palestinian village of batir 
three miles outside jerusalem 
in early april one day before a group of rabbis was to have 
visited batir the army clamped a curfew on the village in 
retaliation for a stonethrowing attack on a train 
four days later forman and another rabbi yermiyahu milgrom 
slipped into batir at night to hear the villagers complaints 
their report of alleged troop brutality including beatings and 
verbal abuse was submitted to rabin and was carried in the israeli 
press 
the group includes about 10 orthodox rabbis with the rest of 
its members equally divided between reform and conservative 
clerics it is run by a board of six rabbis that includes two 
representatives from each of the three movements 
the unusual cooperation between orthodox and rival reform and 
conservative rabbis as well as the groups lack of political 
ideology gives it a moral authority over most of the dozen or so 
other israeli movements considered to be comprised of leftists 
western human rights groups on the other hand are considered 
by many israelis to be biased in favor of the palestinians 
we raise our voice the moral voice of the jewish spirit 
which holds that every man and woman without regard for religion 
and nationality is created in the image of god the groups 
platform states 
invested with a religious mandate to speak for the jewish 
people who has suffered so painfully we must forever remain 
sensitive to the suffering of others 
forman criticized israels religious leaders on grounds that 
they failed to speak out against brutality in the occupied 
territories 
we sense a lack of the rabbinic voice and when we do hear it 
its usually on the farthest right said forman 45 a reform 
rabbi who immigrated to israel from boston in 1972 we invite the 
chief rabbis to respond to whats happening because it opposes the 
spirit of jewish law and tradition 
chief rabbinate spokesman eitan eizman denies the allegations 
saying israels orthodox chief rabbis have responded every time 
there was an outstanding violation writing that innocent people 
should not be harmed or beaten 
rabbi moshe levinger a settlement leader in kiryat arba near 
the west bank town of hebron called the rabbis criticism 
misguided 
we have never agreed that these are occupied lands levinger 
said well stop the moment the arabs stop 
the rabbis group is careful not to endorse a political solution 
to the 16monthold conflict and it denounces palestinian violence 
milgrom 35 said judaism is often seen as something that 
comes to discriminate and persecute the nonjewish side and we 
oppose that it does not correctly portray judaism man was 
created in gods image every man and not just the jews 
the rabbis said adherence to jewish religious tradition has also 
helped the group in gathering testimony 
at batir for example forman and milgrom used a method 
described in talmudic religious law of comparing testimony from 
different witnesses forman said that as a result he was convinced 
people told the truth despite an army denial of events described 
in the groups report 
he said the rabbis group also offers rabbinical counselling 
for soldiers deeply troubled by the moral and ethical struggle they 
confront while serving in the occupied territories 
the groups next project is an investigation of the army policy 
of forcing palestinians to remove barricades built by protesters in 
the occupied territories forman said 
i dont want to compare us with other countries he said 
we have to measure our behavior by jewish standards if we start 
using the lowest common denominator we cease to be a light unto 
the nations

amid the uncertainties of politics and a new 
administration some things were absolutely certain not so long ago 
there was for example no doubt about it if president bush was 
denied senate confirmation of john g tower to be secretary of 
defense his relations with congress would never be the same the 
democratic majorities there would be emboldened to challenge him on 
every front he would retaliate any idea of bipartisanship could 
be forgotten 
tower was rejected none of the above occurred the issue 
evaporated 
i didnt like what happened bush said last week so i 
would just respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the 
united states senate reached and im going to work with them 
were going forward now 
so far this has not been a good year for absolutes that 
comprise conventional wisdom about washington 
bush came to office after a campaign that accentuated the 
negative and pushed symbols in lieu of issues surely the 
bitterness wouldnt go away quickly the democrats wouldnt let it 
happen 
they did and not long after the votes were counted they did 
forget quickly about their own nominee gov michael dukakis seldom 
is mentioned by leaders of the party that ran him for the white 
house when he unexpectedly announced long in advance that he not 
seek another term as governor of massachusetts the reaction in 
washington was negligible 
during the campaign bush made his read my lips vow against 
new taxes a fixture part of every speech everybody knew the 
democrats were going to make him swallow that line or at least try 
forget that too at least for now 
the president and leaders of the democratic congress reached 
compromise terms on a federal budget last week bush said they had 
produced the first such agreement reached ahead of schedule and 
not framed in the context of a crisis while it leaves the 
toughest budget questions to be confronted next year it preserves 
at least until then the presidents pledge against new taxes 
that issue will be back congressional democrats said they will 
have to look for additional revenues for the next federal budget 
nevertheless it puts another crack in conventional wisdom 
i think if you had asked what the chances would have been 
that we would be here in agreement on a budget resolution before 
april 15th in the first year of the bush presidency the answers 
would have been slim and none said richard darman the budget 
director 
okay but it was a safe bet that president bush would be living 
for a long time in the shadow of ronald reagan after all he ran 
largely on the reagan record and on his own piece of it as vice 
president he said his election mandate was to continue and to 
build upon the reagan legacy he promised new faces but five of 
his cabinet appointees came from the reagan cabinet 
bush said that within six months or so the imprint on the 
presidency would be his not reagans 
it didnt take nearly that long reagan seldom is mentioned 
these days and thats been the case for weeks 
reagans name did come up at the white house the other day 
because of a flap over a column reporting that some bush aides had 
been making snide comments about his work habits as a result 
chief of staff john sununu was said to have told bush aides dont 
get caught you know making jokes or being lighthearted or 
anything about the past 
scratch one more certainty 
but dont forget that there was no question bush would have 
serious problems dealing with the white house press he avoided 
press conferences during his fall campaign and his relations with 
reporters sometimes were testy it pointed to tense times with the 
white house press 
forget that one too so far bush has proven the most 
accessible of presidents he doesnt always answer the questions 
but he takes them and frequently bush describes his press policy 
this way 
availability dont get mad when they ask stuff you dont 
like and treat people as you would whatever walk of life or 
whatever occupation they come from 
while all of that raises some doubt about sure bets one thing 
is for certain 
it cant last

they may be satirized in cartoons and criticized 
by their peers but mbas men and women holding the master of 
business administration degree are pervading the big business 
scene 
while most of them still can be found at the division manager 
level more and more are making it all the way to the presidency or 
chairmanship 
their influence is spreading laterally too once found in 
finance jobs they now serve in every functional area including 
manfacturing sales and marketing they are displacing psychology 
majors in personnel departments and they have made deep inroads 
into the steel automotive and chemical industries which in the 
past werent known as especially promising areas for mbas 
they are now a critical mass exerting power and influence 
throughout corporate life and tending to hire even more mbas 
noting the need and the interest the nations universities are 
doing their best to maintain a supply 
no degree program in the past two decades has grown faster 
than the mba says eugene jennings professor of business 
management at michigan state university who has studied routes to 
corporate success for four decades 
research by jennings who pioneered studies of corporate 
mobility patterns in the late 1940s and wrote the mobile 
manager suggests a large industrial company is three times more 
likely to be headed by an mba than was so a decade ago 
mbas he contends have the drive and commitment to persist 
along the long route to the higher echelons of management while 
others drop by the wayside 
between 1981 and 1986 he found mbas made up 9 percent of new 
employees with college degrees at the supervisory level their 
representation was double that and at the even higher division 
level it was triple 
part of the numerical strength is based on the fact that 
corporations are more likely than ever to seek a college degree for 
a salaried position in a sense he says an undergraduate degree 
has become a union card 
as a result those seeking to excel go after graduate degrees 
and the most mobile of all double degrees over the past 20 years 
says jennings is the bachelor of engineering combined with a 
master of business administration 
further entrenching the mbas is the willingness of large 
corporations to subsidize graduate education he estimates that 
about onethird of those with mba degrees earned them while in the 
employ of their companies 
nothing gives a mobile manager more leverage than obtaining an 
mba five to eight years into his or her career says the 
professor among whose many volumes is routes to the executive 
suite which traces success patterns 
among other things he explains it removes the educational 
anonymity that sometimes surrounds an employee it demonstrates 
that here is an individual who takes business seriously and is 
willing to make a longterm commitment 
no other career group says jennings zeroes in so intensely on 
big business it is the groups primary goal while big business 
might need mbas he says mbas need big business and so like a 
barnacle they stick to it 
the strong successful and apparently enduring relationship 
and the pervasiveness of mbas in various positions throughout the 
corporation has all but destroyed the stereotype of mbas as 
overly analytical and limited 
data from 1981 through 1986 indicate strongly says jennings 
that there is a much higher probability than ever before that the 
chief executive officer has an mba in his or her resume

at the hartford stage company director 
mark lamos has recreated the magical mystical world of peer 
gynt in a dazzling twopart fivehour production of ibsens 
rarely performed masterpiece 
the play on view through may 20 is a glorious theatrical 
adventure a journey that lamos manages to make both epic and 
intimate 
using 26 actors in more than 70 roles the director and scenic 
design wizard john conklin transport theatergoers around the globe 
from rustic norway to a bizarre troll underworld to the sands of 
north africa to a cairo madhouse to a ship wrecked in a raging sea 
and then back again to norway 
but lamos doesnt forget this tale is one mans story of 
selfdiscovery from brash selfcentered carefree and charming 
youth to cynical even despairing old man who finally finds 
redemption through the love of a forgiving woman 
negotiating the sweep and intimacy of lamos production is actor 
richard thomas he plays peer with a fierce determination thomas 
who was a robust nonmelancholy dane in hartfords hamlet last 
year is one of those fearless energetic actors willing to take a 
chance despite his eagerness he doesnt rush through ibsens 
difficult poetry done here in a new very modern translation by 
gerry bamman and irene b berman they follow the playwrights 
original rhyme schemes 
bamman played the older peer in livui ciuleis production of the 
play in 1983 at the guthrie theater in minneapolis lamos saw that 
revival and thought about doing it at hartford 
the play has always been sitting there in my mind waiting i 
guess lamos says every year it would come up and weve talk 
about it but after richard played hamlet here we decided to do 
it 
in fact lamos said if it werent for thomas he wouldnt have 
attempted the mammoth revival the actor according to lamos 
exuded a willingness to take a journey with peer gynt that 
really didnt always seem as if it had a purpose or a goal to it 
that was really the best part of the rehearsal process we just 
kept looking at each other and saying well lets just keep 
traveling we arent going to get all the answers right away 
lamos felt he would get to know the play better if he could 
collaborate with bamman and berman as they worked on the 
translation which was commissoned by hartford stage 
it was a wonderful way of learning peer gynt from the inside 
out and without preconceptions and not taking anything for 
granted lamos says literally each moment in the play had to 
be dealt with very very carefully and specifically 
the big surprise was that we found out that a lot of the 
existing translations were glossing over more of the crudities 
ibsen was after and more of the slang that he definitely put into 
the play at first things that we were criticizing in the early 
drafts we discovered were in fact ibsens intentions 
and that made a huge difference in the whole approach to the 
play it was one of the reasons the production became more 
childlike and naive and began to have more of a folk quality than i 
originally thought it would have 
conklins settings reenforce that theme beginning with the 
opening moments of the play the stage is decorated like a 
surrealistic nursery in which peer lounges in a cradle or commands 
a rocking horse as if it were a galloping steed 
the director and designer have created several memorable images 
the most poignant being the death scene of peers mother at the end 
of into the mountains which is part 1 of the play the mother 
beautifully played as a loving scold by patricia conolly is 
transported to her grave in peers cradle now turned into a sleigh 
and driven by her son 
in part 2 the voyage conklin fills the stage with 
billowing black plastic which becomes the violent sea that finally 
washes peer back home 
the designer uses yards of fabric to cover the theater floor 
creating snowy mountains yellow deserts and green forests more 
cloth hangs like a curtain over the theaters back wall allowing 
lighting designer pat collins to conjure up mountains as well as 
spectral images conklins original designs were more complicated 
lamos says 
at first john created a set model which was filled with large 
and colorful scenery he said we slowly took pieces out of it 
until we came to something much simpler and realized we wanted 
something that had more fluidity thats when we arrived at the 
idea of these thousands of yards of flowing china silk and the 
shadows that they made behind them 
the large cast matches thomas enthusiasm particularly stephen 
rowe as the vulgar hedonistic troll king who urges peer to be 
yourself and nothing else a motto that still has a large 
following today 
for lamos the most challenging aspect of the production was 
to stay open and not try to contain the play with a metaphor of 
some kind i just let it be what it turned out to be and then it 
began to unify itself in a funny way 
what can lamos and hartford stage do for an encore 
the director is not thinking about that just yet 
i dont even want to browse through my drama book shelf at 
home lamos sighs i just want to go look at the ocean for a 
while

they were cousins who grew up together in a 
mississippi river town in louisiana jerry lee lewis mickey gilley 
and jimmy swaggart and if you want the lowdown on them drop by 
glen mcglothins barbershop he not only picks up the latest gossip 
while cutting hair hes also the mayor and the lead singer in a 
rock n roll band 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mayor glen mcglothin who sings with a rock 
n roll band when hes not barbering or mayoring dances around 
the chair as he clips a patrons hair and talks about ferridays 
famous four 
a sign on the edge of town reminds you that ferriday is home 
of jerry lee lewis mickey gilley jimmy swaggart and howard k 
smith 
the latter of course is the network tv anchorman but the 
barbershop gossip this day is mostly about the others the three 
cousins who left this mississippi river town of 4000 folks and 
took separate routes to make their mark in rock n roll country 
music and tv evangelism 
theres a lot of disappointment in this town says 
mcglothin referring to the furor surrounding swaggart who was 
defrocked by the assemblies of god church in 1988 after a new 
orleans prostitute said the evangelist had paid her to pose nude 
for him swaggart refused a denominational order to stay out of the 
pulpit for a year in january a new orleans stripper mary 
catherine kampen made similar allegations against swaggart in 
penthouse magazine 
you may not agree with him on his thinking says mcglothin 
a member of a clan that grew up with the three famous cousins he 
got pretty bad down on the catholics for a while and the baptists 
but a lot of people thought he was a good christian man and im 
not going to say he aint 
im not in the judging business god does a pretty good job of 
judging the bible says he who is without sin can cast the first 
stone well i couldnt throw a pebble 
the woman who made the accusations in penthouse he says is 
at least pretty that other girl though she was ugly just pure 
ugly 
the mayorbarber perks up when asked about jerry lee lewis the 
rock n roll legend whose life story is depicted in a new movie 
titled great balls of fire due for release in late june 
i was just a tad when jerry lee lived in town says the 
42yearold mcglothin he was cocky but he said he would make it 
big one day id listen to him rattle that piano and say to myself 
that i would too 
when mcglothin was about 21 and ready to try the big time the 
army grabbed him 
it was christmas eve 1967 when i got drafted he says 
boy was i mad two lsu football players and i were getting the 
physical im telling you these boys were big they could knock 
walls down and eat nails they flunked the physical me i was 
dried up 140 pounds and passed 
the next thing i knew i was in the 1st cavalry in vietnam and 
they made me point man on patrol i still dont know who disliked 
me so much 
doing a jitterbug step around his barber chair mcglothin sighs 
and concedes that even if the army hadnt intervened he still 
wouldnt have made it as lead singer in a bigtime band 
i had the stardust like a lot of kids around here who were 
poor and saw how jerry lee and mickey made it he says but i 
never had what it takes to make it big jerry lee had that thing 
he could make you jump out of a seat and dance thats the thing 
that sells records 
gilley wellknown in country music circles became nationally 
known when the movie urban cowboy featured the nightclub 
gilleys in pasadena texas outside houston gilley was 
partowner of the club which is now closed

in a case that has shaken this town noted for 
its thundering waterfalls a high school student is going on trial 
for clubbing his mother to death with a baseball bat in an argument 
over his romance with a 15yearold girl the relationship between 
billy shrubsall and his domineering mother is at the heart of the 
case and lawyers for both sides concede the issues are not 
clearcut 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at the close of his valedictory 
address to the lasalle high schools class of 1988 billy shrubsall 
penned a tribute to his mother marianne marge shrubsall 
on a personal note i would like to thank my mother who 
taught me my reach should exceed my grasp he wrote thank you 
mom 
the words of gratitude for a parent who pushed a son toward 
academic excellence went unspoken however twelve hours before he 
was to give the speech police say shrubsall bludgeoned his mother 
to death with a baseball bat 
instead of crowning an accomplished high school career that 
brought him to the top of his 250member class shrubsall found 
himself in jail charged with seconddegree murder and this city 
known for its awesome waterfalls found itself trying to understand 
what had happened 
when i heard the first thing i said was no way it wasnt 
bill says billy hartman a classmate who knew shrubsall for six 
years it still doesnt seem true to me now 
adds another friend terry adamec he had everything going for 
him a class valedictorian wouldnt do something like that he was 
the smartest guy in the whole school 
when the case comes to trial probably this spring or early 
summer defense attorney paul g cleary wont dispute that 
shrubsall clubbed his mother several times with a baseball bat in 
the early morning hours of june 25 1988 
while an automatic plea of innocent was entered in the case 
cleary will likely reprise a defense he used successfully in a 
highly publicized case in nearby allegany county several years ago 
in that case leslie emick was convicted of seconddegree 
manslaughter in the shooting death of her commonlaw husband while 
he slept in the family motor home 
clearys legal approach emick was the victim of a battered 
wife syndrome and finally snapped after years of brutal sexual 
torture at the hands of her boyfriend 
the battered woman syndrome applies also to other types of 
violence or abuse within a household cleary says the thread he 
says is physical andor mental domination in which the abusee 
develops almost a total dependance on the abusor 
the shrubsall case has elements of both physical and mental 
domination cleary says although shrubsall is a sturdy 6footer 
his mother outweighed him by more than 100 pounds 
the evidence of mental domination is clearer marge shrubsall 
was always a strict authority figure in the home according to 
friends and she had become even more so after the death of her 
husband william three years earlier 
her goal for her son was academic excellence 
we all knew how the mother pushed him says a neighbor tony 
kobler she expected him to be a whizbang 
cleary would not permit an interview with shrubsall but in a 
statement he gave police following the killing shrubsall said he 
began to rebel against his mothers strict house rules and she 
responded with violence 
the more you socall browbeat her the more you argue your 
point the worse she gets until she gets to the point where she 
starts to hit me and i mean i have been hit several times he 
told police her hits ranged from slaps to backhands 
david zacher a friend of shrubsalls since junior high school 
says he had bruises on his arms and i never really thought about 
it much 
the situation grew more tense when shrubsall entered his first 
serious romantic relationship with 15yearold gretchen rowe mrs 
shrubsall was not happy about the romance according to a statement 
miss rowe gave police 
she has also accused him of loving me more than her but 
thats wrong because he did love his mother very much she said 
the night before his graduation shrubsall was at miss rowes 
house told to be home by midnight he was late after going back to 
retrieve some things hed left at the girls house 
mrs shrubsall was in her car in the driveway ready to drive to 
the rowe house to get her son when he arrived according to the 
police statement 
a heated argument ensued inside the house with mrs shrubsall 
calling miss rowe a slut and him slime according to 
shrubsall she started to call miss rowe to demand that the two end 
their relationship when shrubsall tried to stop her she elbowed 
him and he pushed back 
shrubsall told police his mother then threatened to kill him and 
backed him down a hallway 
feeling she was going to strangle him shrubsall said he 
turned around and picked up the first thing and i hit her a lot 
of times so many times out of fear and then after that i dont 
know i was genuinely scared and i was protecting myself 
cleary said that while some may have fled the situation state 
law does not impose upon a person the duty to retreat when 
confronted with a threatening situation in his or her own home 
niagara county district attorney peter broderick whose office 
will prosecute the case doesnt think that a defense patterned 
after the emick case will work 
i would think thats an awfully tough defense to establish 
even in a spousal situation never mind a mother and son he says 
broderick called shrubsalls statement to police loaded with 
selfserving declarations while he said he could see a lot of 
background circumstances which probably dictated his conduct 
they are not enough to justify his actions 
while both sides say there has been no attempt at 
pleabargaining seconddegree manslaughter charges were added in a 
second grand jury indictment possibly setting up a situation where 
shrubsall might plead guilty to lesser charges 
broderick says pleabargaining is discussed in almost every case 
but frankly i have a lot of difficulty with that at this 
point thats because a manslaughter plea would make shrubsall 
eligible for youthful offender status he says and that 
minimizes the penalties significantly the maximum then becomes 
nine years as opposed to 25 
but broderick also realizes the problems of trying a defendant 
who even the police have called an allamerican type with no 
previous record 
sometimes its easy its clearcut said broderick a lot 
of times its not very easy and in this case its difficult

its called the snow train or the moose meat 
special depending on the time of year and the interests of its 
passengers and for tourists its a way to pierce the wilds of 
canada without severe damage to the household budget first built 
to haul iron ore and timber out of the hinterland north of sault 
ste marie the algoma central railway was later discovered by 
hunters artists and sightseers

the train is highballing 
through an awesome crack in the earths surface on a scenic 
journey to nowhere and back 
inside the nofrills passenger cars steam heat and the morning 
sun fog the wide windows 
a bored kid punches his sister in the arm she wails 
their grandmother is preoccupied with the vista outside the

happygolucky guys lurch down the aisle without spilling a drop 
from their open cans of beer 
all had crossed the us border at sault ste marie and bought a 
35 ticket for an eighthour roundtrip train ride through the 
canadian wilderness to eaton 120 miles to the north 
ninety years ago the algoma central railway first pierced the 
canadian hinterland it was built to bring iron ore out of wawa and 
timber out of hearst then it was discovered by artists sportsmen 
and tourists who know it by such names as the snow train or the 
moose meat special depending on the time of year business is 
brisk in the snowbound winter gets even better during the spring 
and summer 
today lucy dassance was riding the rail with her daughters 
family the seven of them among the hundreds of americans who take 
algoma centrals weekend tour each year 
a local makes regular stops along the way during the week but 
on the weekend sightseeing run there are no stops no depots just 
ride to the end of the line get up turn your seats around and 
ride back 
my husband didnt come mrs dassance says he said he had 
enough snow back in michigan 
outside a cold wind rips through agawa canyon tearing at the 
rock walls with ice crystals further eroding this wild open cut 
in the earths skin 
the agawa canyon has been molded by erosion and sculpted by 
glacier up close it is a narrow cleft in the dark gray rock 
through which a river tumbles and the railroad runs giant 
pressures thrust up granite mountains so long ago the range has

agawa means sheltered place to don stones people the

the mining and timbering produced small towns along the track 
hawk junction batchawana searchmont but so much of the 
territory remains a wilderness that game hunters ride in by rail 
shoot their quarry and then flag down the train for the ride back 
in october moose season the algoma central railway adds cars 
to carry the quarry they call it the moose meat special but moose 
isnt the only meat on board 
ive seen bear ride the train too stone says 
you could get there by road in many places but that loses the 
romanticism he says 
there was no road beyond batchawana when the algoma line 
attracted its first train tourists a band of rebel canadian 
artists called the group of seven 
in 1918 some of these radical artists hopped a caboose in sault 
ste marie to ride into the wild algoma they shunted from siding 
to siding sketching the strong land with wild picasso skies on the 
inside covers of their cigarbox palettes 
the art world laughed but the seven prevailed they would become 
some of canadas most famous artists 
dan murray understands what drew the seven at 66 and retired 
from algoma steel murray is starting a career in art following 
the path laid by the seven and mapped personally for him 
i have been in the area he says i have stood in the spot 
where jeh macdonald did the solemn land you can feel it 
decades after the train trips murrays sisterinlaw rented a 
summer cottage to a returning member of the seven ay jackson 
murray was born to the land but he never saw it as the rich 
strong north until jackson showed him how 
he opened my eyes murray says 
to stan black the algoma central railway is more than art and 
recreation it is commerce black a vice president of the company 
says the railroad last year moved 14 million tons of iron ore 
limestone and coke 
the railroad carried an additional 1 million tons of 
manufactured products such as steel and almost half as much timber 
and wood pulp he says 
but there is a shadow across blacks figures eighty percent of 
the railroads life comes from freight traffic the biggest hunk 
as much as 57 percent is jeopardized by algoma steels talks of 
closing the george w macleod iron ore mine in wawa 
it not only is the only producing iron ore mine on the line but 
it is also the very mine the algoma railroad was built to serve in 
1899 
at eton 120 miles from sault ste marie the soo the tourist 
train stops the seats are reversed and the tour starts back 
passengers fell asleep in the warm sun of late afternoon rocked by 
the sway of the train 
margo downing grabs some peace in a cup of coffee and a 
cigarette and vows she is going to quit her job as train tour guide 
i used to enjoy this she says but there are some days 
when nobodys happy 
she looked out the window at the spectacular view the frozen 
waterfalls the jagged cliffs i know ill miss this she says 
its the one thing ill really miss

hes a physician by profession and when he 
started writing novels about a sleuthing antique dealer he took a 
pen name that means worthless in the slang of antique dealers john 
grant the doctor sometimes feels guilty about the time he spends 
away from his medical work as jonathan gash the writer but for 
him it sure beats golf 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lovejoy you see is this sometimes shady 
antique dealer who is always broke a knowitall sleuth with an 
eye for women who almost always have an eye for him hes also a 
knight errant in setting right challenges that range from murder to 
the plight of a stutterer 
needless to say he is always in trouble which is the trademark 
given him by his creator the ebullient english author jonathan 
gash 
gash acknowledges that his dozen books that feature lovejoy 
abound in plots and subplots that defy the most analytic reader 
the swedes who measure such things say there are an average 
of 4 major plots and 13 minor plots per book he says they 
say the usual is two major plots and three subplots 
gash doesnt plan his stories that wses on the faculty of the institute 
of tropical 
medicine at the university of london and a visiting professor at 
half a dozen middle eastern universities 
when he was in medical school and needing money he recalls i 
got a job in petticoat lane it was an antiques market in those 
days 
the cockney antique dealers were angels i feel like sending 
them my md sometimes they kept me alive they paid me for the 
work i did and never saw me go hungry as soon as they knew i was a 
medical student they couldnt do enough with that and a couple of 
night jobs i made my way through college 
it was in petticoat lane that the doctorintraining got his pen 
name gash 
if you go among street markets in london its one of the 
commonest words youll hear he says it means good for 
nothing it has a bit of a joke in it i couldnt find another 
author whose name was gash its the same initial as my name and 
its one i could remember 
he married pam a nurse when he was 21 pam was affluent 
gash says she had 7 pounds in the bank id never seen so much 
money in my life we lived in a garret really it didnt seem 
especially brave 
gash reports gleefully that two of their three daughters are 
married to actors named richard and the other says with her luck 
shell marry richard iii the gashes have two grandchildren a 
third is expected on july 4 
since writing the judas pair in 1977 gash works without an 
outline and sometimes has more than one book under way at once 
i dont know how to write a book he says i write 
everything longhand very small lines very close on sheets of 
paper 
its like a jigsaw i may write chapter 19 first i dont know 
how to plan a novel or how to bring in a new character unless it 
just comes i never know what is going to be in my mind 
when ive done it all i rewrite it over the original in a 
different color ink red then blue and green until finally it 
looks like a map of the underground then i send it off to the 
typist then i do the same thing again to the typescript black 
red blue green its indecipherable gold by gemini took 13 
rewrites the fewest rewrites was the vatican rip which took 
seven 
gashs latest book jade woman published by st martins 
press is set in hong kong where gash and his family lived in the 
1960s and where he was director of clinical pathology at queen mary 
hospital and working in infectious diseases at hey ling chau leper 
colony 
jade woman may be the book that makes him a householdname 
like fellow brits pd james and dick francis although he finds 
fame embarrassing 
i suppose it is the guilt of laying aside your medical work 
for a while even if its an hour a day he says i find that 
very painful you go to a clinic see several patients dying by 
way of light relief you write something there is deep within you 
the feeling look here youve stopped working instead youre 
scribbling inanities about some shoddy antique dealer i know 
its a human beings way of pacing himself an executive who makes 
major decisions goes out and plays golf this is my game 
i feel like an intruder into the whole literary scene if i 
had the time i would go to cambridge and do a degree in english 
lit think how marvelous that must be we go to medical school six 
years later we emerge blinking at the light never having seen 
anybody but doctors and patients were highly trained were not 
educated theres something a wee bit wrong about that

unlike many actors who are eager to leave old 
series characters behind peter falk readily admits he is happy to 
be back playing columbo 
falk feels comfortable as the rumpled ruminating detective he 
created in the original series that ran on nbc from 1971 to 1977 
he won three emmy awards as best actor for the role 
columbo is now a part of the abc mystery movie lineup 
i was sorry it went off the air the last time says falk 
sitting on a stool by an easel in the art studio behind his beverly 
hills home i think theres still a lot of life left in that 
character i think itll be a terrific character to see grow old 
itll be fun to see him creaking around 
i dont think his emotional appeal has anything to do with 
age i think hell be even funnier as he grows old i dont feel 
well sir sorry forgive me it takes me a while to get up these 
steps 
as he talks falk squirms on the stool he screws up his face 
his brows knit he suddenly smiles he throws back an arm to 
scratch his head his shirt rises up to reveal his bare belly 
its like watching columbo go through his routine here its 
merely fun to watch falk on the screen columbos mannerisms are 
calculated to make the suspect underestimate him he may put the 
suspect off guard or make him so exasperated he makes a mistake 
the art studio is devoted to falks work as a charcoal artist 
he also works in pencil and in black and sepia crayons in a 
turnofthecentury french style on the easel and around the 
studio are examples of his drawings of the female figure they are 
reminiscent of edgar degas ballet girl sketches 
ive been drawing about 13 years falk says but its not 
how long youve been doing it but how often id rather do nothing 
but draw for two years straight than dabble for 13 years 
elaine may his sometime collaborator on films told falk that 
she saw columbo as a backward sherlock holmes 
sherlock holmes had a long neck he says columbo has a 
short thick neck holmes was an aristocrat columbo is from the 
streets holmes smoked a meerschaum pipe columbo smokes 35cent 
italian cigars holmes was an elegant dresser i cant find the 
words to describe columbos wardrobe 
what they have in common is an insatiable curiosity a fierce 
logic flashes of intuition and an innate sense about human 
behavior they are helpless victims of their own obsessions they 
have to find out they have to know what really happened they are 
both cerebral rather than physical columbo cant stand guns or the 
sound of gunfire he doesnt even carry a gun hes got too many 
papers in his pockets 
columbo was created by two of televisions foremost 
practitioners of crime william link and the late richard levinson 
the character made his first appearance on a summer mystery show 
with bert freed in 1960 thomas mitchell was columbo in a stage 
play prescription murder that later became the first columbo 
movie in 1968 bing crosby and lee j cobb reportedly turned down 
the role before it went to falk 
falk believes columbos lack of pretension and his comfort in 
his own skin give him an appeal 
hes a genuinely polite man not to say hes not canny he 
says its hard for me to know when he actually forgets or when 
hes abstracted he has a kind of misty quality hes aware of how 
to hound somebody and how to get to them he knows how to play his 
hand and hold back his ace 
people enjoy seeing how hes going to catch the suspect its 
a cat and mouse game its that aspect where columbo and the 
villain are both saying that i know you know that you know that i 
know 
in a recent show columbo came up against an authority on sex 
played by lindsay crouse she was a writer and host of a radio show 
with an open and approving attitude toward contemporary sexual 
standards columbo possesses oldfashioned romantic ideas about 
sex it made for a tantalizing match 
in 1979 nbc attempted to capitalize on columbo by doing a 
spinoff starring his wife columbo frequently referred to his wife 
but she was never seen falks idea of mrs columbo was that she 
was a homebody surrounded by children 
but kate loves a mystery introduced a young beautiful and 
stylish mrs columbo played by kate mulgrew the show was a dud 
and nbc quickly changed her name to kate callahan to erase any 
reference to lt columbo the show was still a disaster and was 
gone by the end of the year 
i never approved of showing her falk says that way 
everyone could have his own idea of what she was like columbos a 
storyteller he makes frequent references to children and nephews 
when he doesnt want to reveal where he learned a piece of 
information hell say someone in his family told him

little things bring home the reality of starring 
in a big broadway play 
people on the bus who ask did i go to high school with you 
or did you live in my mothers apartment building 
or the persistent gaze of strangers who give you the kind of 
stares that mean they either want to steal your purse or 
congratulate you on your performance 
such are the problems facing actress joan allen who now has her 
name above the title in wendy wassersteins hit comedy the heidi 
chronicles 
i try to be nice to people but it makes me embarrassed 
says the quiet almost shy allen relaxing in her tiny dressing 
room backstage at the plymouth theater especially when they say 
where do i know you from and then you have to stand there and 
say i did this and i did that and listen to them say no no 
no and finally oh thats it 
for allen the plymouth theater has become something of a 
permanent home 
she was there last season in lanford wilsons burn this she 
won a tony award as best actress for her portrayal of a grieving 
dancer mourning the death of her roommate 
now she is back with the heidi chronicles which won the 
1989 pulitzer prize for drama in it she plays art historian heidi 
holland a witness to 20 years of changing attitudes toward women 
in modern america 
heidi is a very complicated character allen says the 
more ive done the play the more ive learned about her 
and she has had time to get acquainted with heidi the play 
began last december at offbroadways playwrights horizons a small 
but important new york company where such works as sunday in the 
park with george and driving miss daisy two other recent 
pulitzer prize winners got their start 
heidi may not get involved but she takes everything very 
personally allen says she feels things deeply and sticks to 
her own path because she doesnt rail at the winds people find 
her to be some sort of a pushover i dont find her to be that 
passive 
the play follows heidi from the late 60s and the era of vietnam 
war protests to the late 80s when the reagan era has come and gone 
and the dreams of the baby boomers have begun to burst 
the 32yearold allen came of age some seven or eight years 
later than the character she plays on stage and with less 
turbulence the actress is from rochelle ill some 80 miles west 
of chicago her father now retired ran a gas station 
its farm country corn fields and soybeans she says it 
was very quiet and a great way to grow up i was allowed to be a 
kid forever 
allen first went to eastern illinois university where as a 
freshman she studied drama and met john malkovich a junior the 
following year malkovich transferred to illinois state university 
and linked up with people like gary sinise terry kinney and laurie 
metcalfe out of this group of young drama students came the 
steppenwolf theater company 
after college allen joined the fledgling company which had 
found a home in the chicago suburb of highland park to earn money 
she kept a fulltime job as a secretary for an educational film 
company 
my experiences arent like those of a lot of other 
actresses she says of her early days with steppenwolf i had 
a readymade family i would know what show i was doing and i 
almost never auditioned during the entire seven years i lived in 
chicago we read for parts among ourselves it created a lot of 
security we didnt have to keep proving ourselves 
allen kept her job as a secretary even when she was doing eight 
shows a week at steppenwolf only when she came to new york in 1983 
with a steppenwolf production of and a nightingale sang did she 
quit outside work 
the success the previous year of sam shepards true west 
starring malkovich and sinise made the move to new york easier for 
other steppenwolf members 
until then i had never been to new york not even to 
visit allen says it was the right time in my life i was in 
my late 20s and it was a good role for me again i came with a 
steppenwolf show so there was a sort of builtin security 
in nightingale allen played a shy crippled english 
spinster from the show allen got an agent rave reviews and a 
sixmonth run she decided to stay in new york and won a part in 
christopher durangs comedy the marriage of bette and boo as 
well as movie roles in such films as peggy sue got married 
manhunter and tucker 
allen teamed up with malkovich for a yearlong run in burn 
this which first played los angeles then steppenwolfs theater 
in chicago and finally new york 
the month that burn this opened on broadway in 1987 allen 
did a reading for the heidi chronicles it was an early draft 
of the play but allen immediately knew she wanted to play heidi 
when the comedy was done on stage 
she got her wish for the next six months or so at the plymouth 
allen will concentrate on heidi refining the character 
when we started rehearsals wendy would drop telling comments 
about the kind of woman heidi was and then i would use my 
imagination allen says we also sat in on some art history 
lectures and talked to different art historians 
the actress also met with wellknown feminist art historian 
linda nochlin who teaches at the city university of new york she 
attended nochlins graduate class and read her essay why are 
there no famous women painters 
still the actress doesnt know if her portrait of heidi holland 
will ever be complete 
thats what is so good about the theater she says its 
an alive art form you keep working on something and hopefully the 
more you do it the better you get at it

for the first time in nearly 20 years chileans 
will elect a president this year to replace an ironfisted military 
leader but it could be too early for rejoicing this is another in 
a series of periodic reports by the associated press on the 
economic social and political turbulence that has turned south 
america into a continent in crisis

lame ducks though they may be chiles 
military leaders already are casting an ominous shadow over the 
civilian government that will take office next year 
they have made it unabashedly clear that while they will step 
aside they wont step out and will seize power again if they think 
it is necessary 
and therein lies a major difficulty for the civilian who wins 
the presidential election dec 14 and takes over march 11 from gen 
augusto pinochet the ironfisted president since 1973 
the military government will bequeath a growing and stable 
economy to the civilians but they also will leave deep and 
potentially explosive social imbalances 
millions of chileans are still poor as they were when pinochet 
led the military into the civilian disarray of september 1973 and 
overthrew president salvador allende the marxist who professed to 
want to help the poor 
recent opinion polls indicate that while chileans have a 
relatively robust economy low salaries and unemployment are high 
on their list of priorities for the civilian government 
as politicians prepare for the election pinochet and other 
military leaders make it clear they do not plan a complete retreat 
from the political scene 
pinochet recently said military leaders have the obligation to 
ensure that the future civilian president is an authentic 
democratic man 
and the military is on record that it wont hesitate to 
intervene again 
if the institutional order is broken the armed forces have 
the duty to restore it using compulsion and all the necessary 
means gen alejandro medina head of a center of strategic 
studies said in a recent lecture to noncommissioned officers 
civilian politicians complain that will place the armed forces 
in the role of armed guardians of the civilian government 
a constitution drawn up by the military government in 1980 gives 
the armed forces the means for such a role it allows pinochet who 
still commands the army and the commanders of the navy air force 
and national police to keep their posts until 1998 
pinochet who is constitutionally prohibited from seeking 
reelection in december has already said he will remain as army 
commander after the election 
that is tantamount to creating an armed state within an 
unarmed democratic state said genero arriagada vice president 
of the centrist christian democratic party the largest in the 
opposition 
the constitution also established a militarydominated national 
council which may represent its views to the civilian 
government on key matters 
more complicated for the future leaders may be the problem of 
human rights violations during 16 years of military rule 
opposition leaders say that should they win the election they 
will investigate the abuses and try those found responsible 
the military leaders have made it clear however they it will 
not permit reprisals for what they see as actions that were part of 
a war 
in the military years thousands of leftists were arrested many 
were sent into exile and hundreds were killed local and foreign 
human rights groups have documented more than 700 cases of 
dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by security forces 
a recent opinion poll taken by the center for public studies an 
independent research institute however indicates that chileans 
are more interested in their personal economic situations than in 
the political complexities of the process to restore civilian rule 
or in the military threats to take power again 
in a nationwide poll taken by the center in march and april 46 
percent of the respondents mentioned low salaries and inefficient 
public health services as the two top items on a civilian 
governments agenda

turkish yuppies in bluejeans and 
miniskirts sip coffee at a fashionable waterside cafe on the 
bosporous seemingly oblivious of the moslem faithful bent in 
sabbath prayers in a mosque just a few feet away 
turkey is a country of such contrasts 
istanbul and ankara the centers of commercial intellectual and 
parliamentary life feature glittering hiltons shopping centers 
and trafficclogged streets while an hours flight away are the 
horsedrawn carts and souks of diyarbakir in the far east where 
politics are often inflamed by blood feuds 
with one foot in europe and the other in asia turkey yearns to 
be a part of the west but also feels the pull and bears the 
vestiges of the east 
its armies reached the gates of vienna three centuries ago but 
were beaten back in what was the start of the decline of the 
ottoman empire 
today turkey seeks to enter europe peacefully bidding for 
membership in the european economic community eec the symbol of 
west european democracies economic and political clout 
it would fulfill the dream of kemal ataturk the revered father 
of modern turkey who put the overwhelmingly moslem country on a 
westward bent by turning away from islamic law to build a republic 
based on separation of church and state in 1923 
turkish officials believe they have already paid their dues for 
admission to the west by fighting alongside us troops in korea 
and by membership in north atlantic treaty organization protecting 
a land border with the soviet union but the eec bid is seen as the 
acid test 
its one of the few subjects in which theres more or less a 
consensus in turkey said inal batu the foreign ministry 
spokesman 
he acknowledged stressing turkeys dilemma that some europeans 
think the eec is a club for christians 
says stephen j karper general manager of citibank in istanbul 
and an american europeans have to become familar with turkey 
but turks too have become increasingly wary of signs of a rise 
of islamic fundamentalism which has seen women marching in the 
streets covered head to toe and strained turkeys relations with 
neighboring iran 
that coupled with a history of military interventions to topple 
democratic governments and charges that torture in prisons 
persists raises questions about how solid western foundations are 
on the other hand since the military returned to the barracks 
in 1983 premier turgut ozal has taken giant steps in shaping a 
turkey of the late 20th century 
new airports highways and power grids have gone up around the 
country bringing electricity and directdial telephone service to 
remote mountain villages in the east vast housing projects are 
being built replacing the gecekondu meaning built 
overnight the shantytowns that gave ankara and other cities a 
third world look 
bankers are high on turkey as a safe place for foreign 
investment and cite its large domestic market and food resources 
when you can feed people they have more patience said 
citibanks karper 
on the drawing board is a vast project to irrigate the barren 
southeast anatolian plain near turkeys borders with syria and 
iraq to further exploit turkeys rich agricultural potential and 
stem the flow of peasants to the cities in search of work 
in other words development in a rush not only to get turkey on 
the european track but also to provide for a fastgrowing 
population now at 55 million 
but turks and now ozal himself have paid a price for this 
ozals liberal economic policies aimed at forcing turkish 
industries to compete on european terms and heavy public spending 
have spurred economic growth but also triggered inflation running 
as high as 75 percent that has impoverished many turks 
this in a country where school teachers and other civil servants 
earn as little as 100 a month without wage indexing to protect 
against inflation so dear to western europes socialist economies 
voters punished ozal in nationwide local elections in march 
sending his governing motherland party to a humiliating third place 
in the polls 
but others factors were also blamed and tell much about turkey 
today 
ozals expressed sympathy for moslem fundamentalist women 
barred by the constitutional court from wearing islamic headscarves 
on university campuses apparently cost him the votes of millions 
of secular turks the fundamentalist vote about 10 percent of 
the electorate went to a religious party

kings county hospital is the parris island of 
american medicine a sometimes hellish boot camp that tuns out 
seasoned professionals 
it has 140 internists in training more than any other us 
institution and some of the citys poorest and sickest people 
recruiting a few good men and women however has been getting 
harder and harder 
five years ago 90 percent of the hospitals medicine residents 
staff doctors in training were graduates of american medical 
schools today less than half are even in the worst years kings 
county could count on getting 20 to 25 graduates of the medical 
school of the state university of new york with which it is 
affiliated last year not a single suny graduate applied and only 
three of 60 firstyear residents are from american schools 
there are a many reasons why young doctors might shun a hospital 
like kings county but heres the most obvious half the patients 
in the internal medicine service have aids that may have been 
the straw that broke the camels back says dr richard schwartz 
the medical schools provost 
with more than 8800 residents new york city hospitals train 
almost 10 percent of the nations physicians three times more 
than any other city but at a time when the hospitals need more 
residents than ever the quality and quantity of applicants is 
declining leading teaching hospitals cant attract their top 
recruits and others have scrambled to fill their residency slots 
with graduates of foreign medical schools 
in recent years fewer us medical students have gone into less 
lucrative primary care specialities like internal medicine and 
pediatrics new york seems to be having more trouble attracting 
such residents than other cities and one thing that sets it apart 
from them is aids it has a fourth of the nations cases and in 
two years as many as 10000 of its 25000 general hospital beds 
could be filled by aids patients 
although the chances of doctors catching acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome from their patients are low a survey at new 
york and san francisco hospitals found that fear of aids 
preoccupied doctors and gave them nightmares 
medical students can be so overwhelmed with aids patients you 
dont get the broad experience a resident wants says caroline 
reich of emory university chairmanelect of student 
representatives to the american association of medical colleges 
a residency is supposed to expose young physicians to a wide 
variety of illnesses and patients doctors worry that if too many 
of their patients have aids their exposure becomes too narrow and 
their diagnostic skills atrophy a residency is also supposed to be 
educational but aids patients are so sick that their care leaves 
little time for study or consultation with senior doctors 
donald wilson is chief of medicine at kings county hospital 
when he was making his hospital rounds as a resident 25 years ago 
he usually had to spend only five to 10 minutes with each patient 
a good proportion of them werent particularly sick he says 
now though one aids patient might require as much time and 
attention as six of the people i used to see wilson says it 
takes an enormous toll physicially and emotionally on our staff 
aids is the health care crisis of the decade but in much of the 
nation it remains an exotic curiosity most people who are 
looking to go into private practice dont think theyll be seeing 
many aids patients and dont feel they need an intensive exposure 
to aids during their residency says cindy osman of brown 
university president of the american medical student association 
some doctors and students argue that caring for aids patients is 
good training it doesnt sound nice to say it but aids patients 
have lots of medical problems and the sickest patients are often 
the ones you learn the most from says ron samuels of syracuse 
university medical school who plans to do his pediatric residency 
a new york city hospital 
the real problem may not be aids per se but the type of aids 
patients increasingly entering new york hospitals intravenous drug 
abusers nationally aids is spreading fastest among drug users 
their sex partners and children and new york city has about a 
third of all such cases drug abusers have surpassed gay men in 
newly reported cases in the city 
the average drugaddicted aids patient is a physicians 
nightmare he requires vast amounts of care although very little 
can be done to help him he frequently fails to follow medical 
instructions and often resents the doctors inability to halt his 
decline 
an important part of medicine is identifying with the patient 
knowing how to talk to them says michael caldwell a student at 
mount sinai medical school but thats so lacking with a lot of 
these aids patients 
i have nothing in common with a male prostitute drug addict i 
have sympathy for him but i cant empathize 
homosexual men on the other hand are generally regarded as 
good patients they tend to have supportive relatives and friends 
and a respect for medical authority at san francisco general 
hospital which has relatively few drug addicts applications for 
internal medicine residencies has increased 
the burden of caring for aids patients is accentuated by a 
shortage of nurses and support staff that translates into the bane 
of every resident scut hospital slang for necessary but 
nonmedical tasks that can be performed by nonphysicians such as 
taking blood or delivering medical records 
if students think new york is short of people to help with scut 
theyll give its hospitals a wide berth said clay balentine 
chairman of student representatives to the american association of 
medical colleges the time you spend pushing a wheel chair is 
time you cant spend reading 
at elite institutions like columbia presbyterian hospital and 
new york universitybellevue hospital aids and its related 
problems have merely made residency programs less selective at 
others it has meant an increase in the number of foreign medical 
school graduates hired as residents 
although everyone pays lip service to the notion that foreign 
medical school grads fmgs as theyre called arent necessarily 
inferior to amgs the best teaching hospitals take virtually 
nothing but amgs because they are a known commodity this attitude 
passed to students guarantees segregation 
if a program has a high percentage of foreign school grads 
that program is that much less attractive to american school 
students says beth aklo a fourthyear medical student at the 
university of connecticut and a student representative to the 
medical colleges association 
while most of us feel that the good students at foreign 
medical schools are as as good as us grads the bad are really 
bad they couldnt get out of american schools doctors dont want 
to work with other doctors who are weak

farmers and homeowners should probably just 
learn to live with fire ants says a researcher who has been 
unsuccessful at stopping the imported pests whose sting sends 
21000 americans a year to doctors 
with todays technology theres nothing out there thatll 
eradicate them said stan diffie a researcher at the university 
of georgias coastal plain experiment station we can control 
them but we cant eradicate them 
diffie and entomologist craig sheppard are evaluating chemical 
and biological controls for the south american insect believed to 
have entered the united states in mobile ala about 60 years ago 
since then fire ants have spread to 270 million acres in the 
carolinas puerto rico oklahoma florida georgia alabama 
louisiana mississippi texas and arkansas 
fire ants reproduce quickly and spread rapidly in south 
georgia its not uncommon to find 40 mounds per acre which isnt 
a problem in pastures but in fields where machinery is used you 
would have a problem diffie said 
theyre a nuisance a people pest whether its unsightliness 
in your yards or stinging your kids said diffie the ants 
painful stings force at least 21000 people to seek medical 
treatment each year according to a survey of physicians in 13 
states for the american academy of allergy and immunology 
nearly 40 percent of those treated were in texas according to 
the survey and 20 percent were in florida thirtytwo people died 
from stings last year mostly people especially sensitive to the 
toxin and bitten more than once 
people and physicians should take these stings seriously 
said dr robert rhoades a pediatrician at the medical college of 
georgia who monitors medical problems caused by fire ants people 
allergic to other kinds of insect stings should be especially 
cautious the stings cause a burning sensation usually followed by 
formation of pus around the site within 24 hours 
but fire ants also help farmers by attacking pests such as 
ticks worms and other insects that damage sugar cane cotton and 
pecans up to 250000 ants can live in each mound which can extend 
up to six feet in the soil 
theyll eat anything thats dead you have to have something 
out there to clean up the carcasses diffie said 
in the search for effective controls diffie has studied baits 
pesticides and natural enemies such as nematodes and mites he 
makes bait from corn grits soaked with soybean oil and poison the 
bait scattered on pastures and fields is carried into fire ant 
mounds and kills ants that consume the mixture 
only a few ants in each colony are capable of reproduction 
fertile males and females have wings and mate in flight then the 
males die and the females establish new colonies you have got to 
kill the queen diffie said if you dont shell just keep 
laying eggs 
common pesticides can kill fire ants but dont remain active 
long enough in the soil to be a longterm solution he said it 
would be nice if we could put them where we want them get them 
out of the yard and put them in the pecan orchards and sugar cane 
fields but id rather see them gone altogether if we didnt have 
them wed find ways to control the other pests 
concern about the environmental hazards has led researchers to 
look for biological controls including microscopic worms known as 
nematodes and strawitch mites which are a natural enemy of fire 
ants 
nematodes were mixed in water and poured over a fire ant 
mound about 2 million nematodes could be mixed in two gallons of 
water diffie said those tests werent considered very 
successful because only about 37 percent of the colonies treated 
with nematodes were destroyed 
mites were fairly successful he said but the cost is 
prohibitive as treatments are 5 per mound and two treatments are 
necessary

tom was a successful businessman who 
sought treatment for what his wife viewed as a gambling problem he 
seemed bored until another patient told of the thrill of chasing 
women 
tom 35 sat forward listened attentively then astounded 
members of the therapy group with his own tales of womanizing 
twelve percent to 14 percent of patients who admit themselves 
for alcohol drug and gambling addiction treatment also show 
patterns of sexual addiction say bonnie j adkins and julian i 
taber of the veterans administration 
multiple addictions are frequently found among patients being 
treated for one addiction such as alcohol drugs gambling or 
kleptomania agreed stephen b levine a psychiatrist at university 
hospitals of cleveland 
two decades of bringing sex out of the closet have increased the 
number of patients who enter sex clinics said levine we saw 
five or six patients in 1980 20 in 1981 125 in 1983 every year 
the number goes up and up 
treatment includes group therapy in which addicts hear others 
rationalizations and see how they are kidding themselves make 
them face what they are doing and understand the impact on the 
individual he said that is followed by individual therapy and 
if patients are married their wives get counseling then we bring 
the couples together and eventually we hope to start treating 
children but not yet 
ninety percent of levines patients are men it may be that 
males have more of a tendency to act while women keep such problems 
private and quiet and it usually doesnt lead to violence for 
them he said 
at the va hospital in this cleveland suburb everyone seeking 
treatment for compulsive behavior must write and read their life 
story in the first two weeks of the fourweek program making them 
face their problems mrs adkins said 
addiction has several possible causes including such external 
influences as alcohol or changes in body chemistry or there may 
be a genetic link because many addicts have addicted parents or 
grandparents she said 
there also is research on whether they become addicted to 
their own endorphins when a risk taker begins taking risks his 
body shoots endorphins into his system its a type of morphine it 
makes them feel good 
they like the feeling so they continue the behavior to get the 
feeling 
a number of selfhelp sex therapy groups have started nationwide 
in the past decade operating much like alcoholics anonymous she 
said sex addicts annonymous started in minneapoils in 1978 has 
35 chapters in that area sex love addicts anonymous a california 
group has about 400 chapters nationwide 
sexual compulsiveness covers a wide range of behavior including 
perversion obscene phone calls exhibitionism voyuerism 
pedophilia sadism cruelty rape and masochism levine said 
he credits use in recent years of a progesterone known as 
depoprovera with helping many men regain control of their lives 
but he also noted it produces such side effects as weight gain 
high blood pressure and hair loss 
but for some thats not as bad as the illness he said 
perverse sexual behavior is a substitute for remembering trauma 
as children they behave instead of feeling and remembering we 
call it acting out 
we try to help them remember and help them to feel 
levine said a typical sexual addict is a man who feels socially 
deficient views himself as a loner who feels he was socially 
isolated as a child and teen and who has a history of being abused 
psychologically physically and sexually 
mrs adkins said she found no typical profile it cuts across 
so many personalities its an illness

kings county hospital is the parris island of 
american medicine a sometimes hellish boot camp that tuns out 
seasoned professionals 
it has 140 internists in training more than any other us 
institution and some of the citys poorest and sickest people 
recruiting a few good men and women however has been getting 
harder and harder 
five years ago 90 percent of the hospitals medicine residents 
staff doctors in training were graduates of american medical 
schools today less than half are even in the worst years kings 
county could count on getting 20 to 25 graduates of the medical 
school of the state university of new york with which it is 
affiliated last year not a single suny graduate applied and only 
three of 60 firstyear residents are from american schools 
the most obvious reason why young doctors might shun a hospital 
like kings county is that half the patients in the internal 
medicine service have aids 
with more than 8800 residents new york hospitals train 10 
percent of us physicians three times more than any other city 
at a time when hospitals need more residents the quality and 
quantity of applicants is declining 
students can be so overwhelmed with aids patients you dont 
get the broad experience a resident wants says caroline reich

a chemical ancient babylonians extracted 
from figs to treat skin ailments is being used to develop animal 
vaccines and may prove to be important in detecting and fighting 
human viruses a researcher says 
the value of the chemicals called psoralens for virus 
detection and vaccine development lies in their ability to bind the 
twined double strands of the dna molecule said john e hearst a 
university of california berkeley chemistry professor who 
reported his work to the american chemical society 
because psoralen molecules are flat they can slip between the 
two strands of dna without affecting the dna itself when psoralens 
are struck by light they bind with the dna locking the two 
strands of the structure together 
vaccines are generally prepared by first killing a virus with 
formaldehyde and then placing the dead viral material into the body 
so the immune system can recognize proteins on the virus outer 
coat and develop defenses formaldehye reacts with some viral 
proteins so this is not always successful by locking viral 
genetic material psoralens rob a virus of its ability to replicate 
psoralens used in babylon as far back as 4000 bc to treat 
skin pigmentation diseases occur naturally in figs some other 
plants and in some microorganisms they sensitize the skin 
promoting rapid tanning and were used in tanning lotions until the 
food and drug administration labeled them as possible cancer 
causers a few years ago 
hearst said psoralens also can be used in dna probes segments 
of a dna strand for a particular virus that is placed in a blood 
sample to bind to the particular virus or bacteria by counting the 
freefloating dna probes after the test scientists can determine 
whether a particular virus is present 
because dna probe bindings are generally weak many are not 
maintained during the counting he said adding that if psoralens 
are attached to the dna probes the binding is much stronger

one of the tough questions arising out 
of yearslong space missions or life in a space station are what to 
do about sunlight soil and gravity not for the astronauts for 
their food 
on short missions its a lot easier to resupply space stations 
with tv dinners than to have astronauts grow their own food if 
youre going to mars or beyond it would become cheaper to grow 
it said gale nevill a university of florida aerospace engineer 
working on spacebased ways to grow crops 
plants can recycle nutrients and other valuable elements that 
otherwise would be discarded without recycling astronauts would 
have to replace carbon nitrogen oxygen and others elements with 
costly regular shipments from earth 
but growing wheat rice soybeans and other crops can be tricky 
right now there are more problems than solutions said bill 
knott chief scientist for nasas controlled ecological life 
support system project there are some engineering problems in 
growing plants in microgravity you cant go pouring water on a 
plant because it floats all over the place 
although models will be tested on earth in five to 10 years it 
could be 20 to 50 years before automated planting and harvesting 
technology reaches space 
scientists are patterning the system after earth plants take 
nutrition from manure and other waste products and produce food 
humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide plants use the 
carbon dioxide and produce oxygen 
one problem associated with the lack of gravity is that 
nutrientladen water tends to rise through roots and stems so fast 
that the plant doesnt have time to extract nutrients researchers 
have designed a tiny collar to stop this flow but the problem has 
yet to be solved completely nevill said 
scientists hope to reduce the time between harvests by about 
onethird knott said because of the limited area available for 
crops in a space station the systems must yield three to 20 times 
more than an earth farmer could grow

thousands of fragile mountain lakes in the west 
could be endangered from acid snow which already is causing 
environmental damage says a researcher who has spent eight years 
studying the problem in colorado 
one possible sign of the effects of acid precipitation is a drop 
in the number of neotene tiger salamanders in mexican cut near 
crested butte as acid levels rose said john harte a university 
of california professor 
the decline of this salamander population may be the first 
indication of biological damage from acid precipitation in the 
western united states harte said he said he traced the acid 
pollution to coalburning power plants metal smelters and car 
emissions hundreds of miles away 
he cautioned that his study to be published in june did not 
prove acid snow to be the undisputed cause because the salamanders 
sometimes are subject to natural population fluctuations and larry 
svoboda of the environmental protection agency said eight years 
of study may not be enough 
the research is significant because epa has found that 6500 
highelevation ponds and lakes in the west are highly vulnerable to 
acid precipitation such damage has been documented for years in 
the northeast but not in the west 
at issue is a symptom known as acid pulse which happens each 
spring when the snow melts the pollutants contained in the snow 
surge downstream into a string of 15 ponds in mexican cut at 
11000 feet up in the rockies 
harte found that without acid pulse 80 percent of salamander 
eggs hatched but with it only about one third hatched he said 
the salamander population dropped from 500 to 200 during the study

a briefcasesized monitor that plugs into 
a telephone outlet will let doctors for the first time not only 
monitor but also treat heart patients even before an ambulance can 
arrive 
the first mdphone developed by medphone inc of paramus 
nj was installed recently in the home of a 72yearold patient 
who had bypass surgery said dr edwin rogers director of cardiac 
care at sacred heart hospital here 
rogers said his patient will have the mdphone for 90 days 
this is the kind of thing you hope would not be used on the 
patient he said the first three months of a heart attack are 
critical because this is when a patient is at highest risk of 
having another cardiac episode 
the mdphone is plugged into a wall jack if a problem arises 
the patient or family member just opens the case and attaches 
electrode pads the machine automatically dials the hospital 
emergency room setting off alarms the base unit in the hospital 
retrieves the patients records and displays them on one computer 
screen while another shows the electrocardiogram 
if the patient develops a dangerously erratic heartbeat known 
as cardiac arrhythmia a doctor at sacred heart could immediately 
defibrillate the patient by signalling the device to deliver an 
electric shock 
telemetry systems that give data on patients at remote locations 
have been around for years but the mdphone is the first that 
allows treatment in this way said medphone president s eric 
wachtel 
sacred heart and two other hospitals the wilmingtonchristiana 
medical center of delaware and jewish hospital in st louis 
cooperated in development of the mdphone wachtel said the first 
installation in st louis is expected in about two weeks each home 
unit costs 7500 and base units installed in hospital emergency 
rooms are 30000 each

five years after what company officials admit was 
a false start in trying to break out of the midwest strohs beer 
is taking a new look and message nationwide 
stroh brewery co has sunk 50 million into the marketing 
campaign for its flagship brand that begins this week experts will 
be watching closely to see whether the effort founders amid flat 
beer sales in recent years and a market increasingly dominated by 
industryleaders anheuserbusch and miller 
once you get beyond the no 1 and no 2 brewers nos 3 4 and 
5 all face problems said jerry steinman editor of beer 
marketers insights an industry journal they have to look to 
take sales from the big guys but thats like taking it from 
gorillas 
stroh privately held and based in detroit is the nations 
thirdlargest brewer but its entire lineup holds just an 11 
percent share of the us beer market compared with 419 percent 
for anheuserbusch and 216 percent for miller according to 
beverage industry magazine 
company sources told the detroit news that stroh annual revenues 
have stagnated at 15 billion annually since 1985 and the strohs 
brand itself holds only 2 percent of the national market beverage 
industry said 
the new campaign includes revamped advertising redesigned 
containers and even new posters and mirrors to be distributed to 
bars and party stores 
we consider this a continuation of our national introduction 
of the brand said william l henry stroh vice president of 
marketing 
our opportunity with strohs is to appeal to a lot of people 
in america who have never even had a strohs said hal riney a 
san francisco advertising executive who created the new campaign 
and there are millions of those 
stroh will spend 20 million on rineys new ads which will 
stress both the new packaging and the companys 200year heritage 
as a family enterprise anheuserbusch by comparison spent an 
estimated 130 million in 1988 just to advertise budweiser 
another industry expert questioned whether stroh could overcome 
the growing piles of money that anheuserbusch and miller are 
throwing into a market diluted in recent years by beverages other 
than beer 
i know of no brewers in the history of the brewing industry 
who have ever turned around a brand after a serious slide said 
robert weinberg head of rs weinberg amp associates its a very 
unforgiving industry 
stroh still has other brands on which to fall back including 
old milwaukee schlitz and schaefer all of which it acquired 
earlier this decade but officials are hopeful of reviving the 
companys namesake brand 
in my 11 years here this is the most striking set of changes 
ive seen stroh president roger fridholm said i think we have 
a chance of getting some very positive consumer reaction

moneylosing control data corp today said it 
will eliminate its supercomputer business and make other cuts that 
will cost 3100 jobs 
the computer maker decided it cant afford to continue product 
development across such a wide section of products said

including 350 million from liquidation of eta systems the 
subsidiary started in 1983 to compete with twin cities rival cray 
research inc and other supercomputer makers 
asked if control data attempted to sell eta systems ryan said

eta has never made money for control data in 1988 it had 
operating losses of about 100 million it has sold 34 machines 
ranging in price from 1 million to 20 million 
eta will account for 800 of the 3100 layoffs with the rest 
made in corporate ranks and other sectors ryan said

for sustained growth 
control data has had two consecutive quarterly losses including 
a 128 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 for the year 
the company had a profit of 17 million after earning 193 
million in 1987 and losing a total of 832 million in 1986 and 1985

lockheed corp today delivered the last of 50 
c5b jumbo cargo planes to the air force completing a sevenyear 
69 billion contract that drew accusations of greed from congress 
the final c5b the biggest air cargo carrier in the free world 
took off after a ceremony made a salute lap around lockheed 
aeronautical systems co headquarters in suburban marietta and then 
headed for the air base at dover del 
the company has no plans for further production of the c5b 
said robert z christopher director of the c5 program lockheed 
aeronautical is a division of lockheed corp the calabasas 
califbased aeronautics giant 
the c5b is 248 feet long has a wing span of 223 feet and a 
65foot tshaped tail high as a sixstory building 
the jet an updated version of the c5a can carry almost any 
piece of the armys hardware two 50ton m1 tanks for example 
it has been used recently for such nonmilitary missions as 
carrying equipment and supplies to the site of the exxon valdez oil 
spill in alaska and aid to the victims of the earthquake in the 
soviet republic of armenia said air force spokesman capt tom 
dolney 
the huge contract has been a boon to the atlantaarea providing 
thousands of jobs and pumping millions of subcontracting dollars 
into 40 states 
todays ceremony marked a happy landing in the flight of the 
c5b project but it was a bumpy ride 
lockheed won the contract in 1982 beating out boeing and 
mcdonnell douglas the original pact was for 78 billion 
production of the planes predecessor the c5a was marred by 
revelations that the air force had purchased ineffective repair 
kits from lockheed that included 22994 nickelsized washers 
shortly before the first c5b was to be delivered in late 1985 
it was discovered that tens of thousands of nuts on the planes had 
to be replaced because the ones installed were the wrong kind 
the pentagon accused the company of inflating the c5b contract 
by as much as 500 million by withholding details of a proposed 
twotier wage system for its new employees by 1987 the price tag 
had been whittled down to 69 billion 
a review by the general accounting office congress 
investigative arm found that in late 1986 lockheed proposed to 
charge the government 21113 for an inchlong shim a metal wedge 
that was an excess part from c5b production and originally valued 
at 2209 
last month the air force said it had imposed flight 
restrictions on 20 c5bs because of a problem with the pylon the 
assembly that holds the jet engine to the wing 
lockheed has proposed to the air force that the plant maintain 
its c5b tooling company spokesman doug oliver said 
their decision will pretty much tell us what the future of the 
c5b is he said

boise cascade corp monday reported alltime 
quarterly records for profits sales and earnings per share 
during the first three months of 1989 the boisebased wood 
products company said aftertax income rose to 782 million up 14 
percent from 685 million in the same quarter a year earlier 
sales came to 11 billion in the latest quarter up from 1 
billion a year before 
earnings per share were 168 in this years first quarter 
compared to 144 in the corresponding 1988 quarter 
it was the second straight quarter and the sixth in the last 
seven in which new highs were posted in net income 
we expect the company to have another excellent year in 1989 
if the economy continues to grow at a modest rate chairman and 
chief executive officer john fery said relatively strong markets 
for most paper grades and for office products should largely offset 
a soft market for newsprint 
all three of the corporations major segments paper and paper 
products building products and office products posted increased 
sales and operating income over the first quarter of 1988 
in the paper segment which produces over half the companys 
sales price increases for uncoated papers offset softness in the 
newsprint sector and continued tight margins in the corrugated 
container business as well as disruption of pulp and paper mill 
operations due to severe weather in february 
office products posted record sales and operating income as 
volume increased 17 percent over a year earlier and the corporation 
maintained and increased its market share in almost every major 
urban area it serves fery said 
the building products segment showed only modest improvement 
over a year ago but the gain came despite the sale of three 
woodproducts plants that were contributing to the corporate 
balance sheet during the first quarter of 1988 
with prices for western lumber and plywood up from yearearlier 
levels fery said we expect our building products segment to do 
as well as it did last year

the us dollar fell sharply monday against major 
currencies in european trading after signs of a slowdown in the 
american economy gold prices also dropped 
foreign exchange dealers said recent us economic statistics 
had confused their market about whether the dollar was headed 
higher or lower and the uncertainty caused a drop 
they said the main factors had been the 209 percent swelling in 
the us trade deficit to 105 billion in february and the slowing 
of the growth rate in us producer prices 
the us consumer price index due on tuesday could set the 
dollars tone for the rest of the week dealers said one dealer 
said if the rise in the index is small the dollar could drop from 
185 german marks to 183

the start of multibilliondollar industrial 
waste cleanups around the nation has triggered a legal war between 
insurance companies and corporate polluters over who should foot 
the bill 
insurers last week won their second battle in recent months 
when a new jersey judge ruled that 126 insurers for former diamond 
shamrock co bore no liability for injuries caused by the 
production of a toxic byproduct of the defoliant agent orange 
lawyers said the decision by superior court judge reginald 
stanton in morristown will have bearing on more than 50 similar 
lawsuits involving billions of dollars around the country 
potentially the problem could involve thousands of cleanup sites 
the diamond shamrock case is part of a larger struggle thats 
going on between the insurance industry and companies facing 
cleanup costs said jacquie warren a lawyer with the natural 
resources defense council in new york 
in december a jury found shell oil co liable for cleaning up 
the rocky mountain arsenal near denver where the company leased 
land from the army from 1952 to 1982 for a pesticide production 
plant 
the jury ruled that shell could not collect from its more than 
250 insurers for cleanup and injury costs at the site estimated by 
the federal government in 1983 at 18 billion 
i think that the insurance companies are now engaged in a 
massive nationwide effort in courts and the media to try to renege 
on their obligations to their policyholder said eugene 
anderson a new york lawyer whose firm represents more than 40 
policyholders fighting for insurance coverage 
judge stanton ruled that diamond shamrocks insurance policies 
do not cover an industrial cleanup of more than 25 million because 
the company knowingly bypassed environmental controls polluting 
the passaic river and land around a newark plant with dioxin 
the company then known as diamond alkali made agent orange and 
other herbicides at the newark plant from 1951 to 1969 a byproduct 
was dioxin which has been linked to various cancers liver 
disease birth defects and a severe skin rash 
diamonds conduct in operating the newark plant was 
unacceptably wrong and irresponsible stanton wrote in a 50page 
opinion diamond always put its narrowly perceived economic 
interest first it deliberately and persistently cheated on the 
limited environmental regulations which were in place 
but stanton did order the insurers to pay the companys 23 
million share of a 180 million settlement with vietnam war victims 
of agent orange which was used to strip natural cover from 
guerillas 
for maxus energy corp of dallas diamond shamrocks parent the 
cleanup cost in newark will exceed 25 million maxus said it 
intervened as soon as dioxin was found at the site in 1983 and 
cooperated with environmental officials in its removal 
diamond alkali was a predecessor of diamond shamrock which was 
sold to occidental petroleum corp in 1986 maxus energy assumed 
liability for cleanups of certain sites including the newark plant 
after the 1986 sale maxus set aside a 75 million reserve for 
cleanup costs spokeswoman ginger shearburn said 
maxus called stantons ruling on the dioxin incorrect and is 
considering an appeal its stock dropped 12 cents to 762 
wednesday a day after the decision was released to lawyers and 
was trading in the 7 range monday 
stantons ruling goes against much of the states case law on 
the subject which is generally favorable to policyholders 
lawyers said more than a dozen such lawsuits have been filed in 
new jersey the most in the nation 
diamond shamrock sued its insurers over the newark plant in 
1984 two years later it again sued its insurers seeking coverage 
for about 20 nondioxin sites nationwide 
robert bates attorney for american reinsurance co of 
princeton a defendant in the morristown lawsuits said stantons 
decision could have a major impact on the second case in which 
cleanup costs were not available 
ms warren of the natural resources defense council an 
environmental activist group said insurance policies should be 
expensive enough and companies should assume enough risk to 
guarantee they handle and dispose of dangerous materials properly 
but she added that society needs an insurance cushion to 
protect an innocent third party if a company cannot pay for a 
cleanup its a fine line to draw she said

stock prices on the london stock exchange closed 
mixed monday in lackluster trading 
at the close the financial times 100share index was up 11 
points or 05 percent at 20547 
the narrower financial times 30share index was down 49 points 
at 16861 reflecting losses by several major capitalized stocks 
volume was thin as 4681 million shares changed hands compared 
with fridays 6481 million shares 
shares got off to a buoyant start on the back of continued 
enthusiasm following fridays rally in london and on wall street 
but the positive tone wore thin as participants steered clear of 
the market and as doubts about the underlying health of the british 
economy returned 
theres a general degree of uncertainty about the british 
economic picture said one trader 
a major worry at the moment is whether higher wage settlements 
will add to inflationary pressures he added 
there was little reaction to news that british retail sales in 
march were unchanged in volume terms from the previous month while 
rising 47 percent from a year earlier 
while perhaps signaling a slowing of consumer demand the 
provisional figures could be revised significantly in coming weeks

a federal judge has refused to dismiss a 
21 billion antitrust lawsuit filed by fuel alcohol producers 
against four major oil companies 
us district court judge harold baker on friday rejected the 
oil companies argument that the ethanol producers were not in 
competition with them and therefore had no financial interest that 
would lead them to sue 
seven ethanol producers allege that the oil companies marathon 
petroleum co shell oil co amoco oil co and chevron usa 
conspired to ruin the market for gasohol a blend of 90 percent 
gasoline and 10 percent ethanol 
attorney bob wright of lafayette la representing the 
plaintiffs has argued that the oil companies tried to retard 
the growth of the ethanol industry 
the judge ruled the oil companies and the ethanol producers were 
in competition for the nondiesel automobile fuel market 
the ethanol makers contend the oil companies used signs on their 
gasoline pumps saying such things as our gasoline contains no 
alcohol or ethanol to discourage motorists from using gasohol 
ethanol which can be made from corn increases the octane of 
gasoline and reduces pollution in automobile emissions according 
to the national corn growers association 
the plaintiffs are greater rockford energy and technology corp 
of rockford shepherd oil inc of jennings la vidalia ethanol 
ltd of vidalia la lakefield ethanol inc of lakefield minn

a federal bankruptcy judge granted a oneweek 
extention today to eastern airlines and its creditors to devise 
plans for a sale or restructuring but he warned delays were 
devouring the strikecrippled carrier 
the order by judge burton lifland came as lawyers for pilots and 
eastern confirmed the existence of another possible bidder besides 
the three previously known exbaseball boss peter ueberroth 
hotelier jay pritzker and takeover investor carl icahn but the 
lawyers wouldnt identify the fourth bidder 
directors of easterns parent texas air corp meanwhile said 
they have decided it should no longer pursue the sale of eastern 
but will consider selling a substantial part of the companys 
assets to pay its debts 
the texas air boards statement essentially approved eastern 
managements decision last wednesday after a deal with ueberroth 
fell through to reduce eastern to about 60 percent of its 
prestrike size 
as time goes by there are fewer alternatives to explore 
lifland told a manhattan courtroom crammed with about 50 uniformed 
pilots and lawyers for texas air creditors and the striking unions 
this airline is hemorrhaging he said it is not tolerable 
that this process be so lengthy that the parties have nothing left 
to consider 
burton had called a hearing today requesting that management 
creditors and the unions show cause why he shouldnt put the entire 
airline up for auction including assets owned by eastern before 
texas air bought it three years ago 
we are not here selling a used car at a foreclosure sale 
creditors committee attorney joel zweibel told the judge we are 
selling a complicated business 
at the urging of zweibel and lawyers for eastern management 
lifland gave them one more week to negotiate and review possible 
options for the miamibased airline one of the nations largest 
and most unprofitable he set a new hearing for 11 am next monday 
lifland granted the delay over the objection of attorneys for 
the unions and a dissident creditor who sought the hearing they 
have been pushing for more aggressive court action to get eastern 
flying again either through a sale or the appointment of an 
outsider to run the airline eastern management has said it wants 
to restructure into a much smaller operation 
eastern workers have been on strike since march 4 charging 
texas air boss frank lorenzo has butchered it and plotted to 
destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to sister 
carrier continental airlines 
lorenzo put eastern into bankruptcy court refuge march 9 and 
sought a buyer ueberroth the former baseball commissioner and 
olympics organizer nearly completed a 464 million deal to buy 
eastern but the sale collapsed 
however sources familiar with the eastern situation have said 
ueberroth remains interested in making a new offer pritzker owner 
of the hyatt hotel chain and icahn chairman of trans world 
airlines also have been lurking in the background as possible 
buyers 
after the lifland hearing today pilots union attorney bruce 
simon and eastern attorney harvey miller told reporters there was a 
fourth bidder 
in a statement issued today lorenzo was quoted as saying the 
texas air board believes a sale of eastern is not in texas air or 
easterns best interests or in the best interests of easterns 
creditors 
the board made the decision at a meeting this morning and its 
vote was unrelated to liflands action today texas air spokesman 
art kent said from the companys headquarters in houston 
the statement said in order to resolve promptly the eastern 
situation texas air had been willing to agree to a quick sale 
even at a price which did not nearly reflect easterns net asset 
value and had selected the prospective buyer the group led by 
peter ueberroth who it believed was most likely to be able to 
consummate a transaction promptly 
with the collapse of those efforts because of totally 
unreasonable and unworkable union demands texas air has determined 
that further sale efforts are unlikely to be successful and in 
fact would be counterproductive 
pritzker resurfaced friday with a 500 million proposal to buy 
eastern which his representatives presented to the 15member 
committee of easterns major creditors sources close to the 
situation said ueberroth remained interested in reviving his bid 
and icahn the owner and chairman of trans world airlines inc 
talked to union officials this weekend about a possible deal said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
lawyers representing eastern and its unions also met during the 
weekend but little of significance was said to have emerged from 
the talks 
parameters were being drawn said one participant who 
insisted on anonymity

its a long way from wall street to the 
6th floor of bridgeport superior court but a lawsuit being heard 
here is being closely watched by stockbrokers 
closing arguments are to begin tuesday in a legal dispute that 
pits painewebber inc against one of the socalled superbrokers 
it hired away from competitors in the early 1980s most from lehman 
brothers kuhn loeb inc 
five of the brokers were fired in 1984 they filed suit against 
painewebber and its parent painewebber group inc claiming the 
investment firm lured them away just to capture their multimillion 
dollar client base 
four of the brokers agreed to arbitration before the case could 
go to trial in federal court in manhattan but geoffrey j winters 
pursued the case and is asking for at least 16 million in damages 
he claims he was fired unjustly 
the case ended up in the connecticut courts after painewebber 
obtained a lien against winters greenwich home to recover a 
300000 signing bonus he was to repay if he was fired within four 
years because of poor performance 
perrin long an analyst with lipper analytical securities corp 
in new york said wall street is watching the case with interest 
largely because it is highly unsual for brokers to sue their former 
employers 
if there is any disagreement they try to settle it 
inhouse he said monday they are watching this very closely 
to see whether the suit sets a precedent for future suits 
winters 46 calls painewebbers actions outrageous 
alan r spirer an attorney representing painewebber says 
winters has failed to prove the brokerage house did anything 
malicious or false 
the case had its origins in october 1982 when winters left 
lehman brothers kuhn loeb now shearson lehman hutton inc to join 
painewebber he and other new employees were touted as 
superbrokers in brochures painewebber sent out to potential 
customers 
the brokers earned the nickname because each had produced more 
than 1 million in annual commissions 
when he joined painewebber winters was given two promissary 
notes one for 240000 and another for 60000 that were secured 
by an advance compensation agreement the principal amounts for 
both were due in five years without interest 
but on march 23 1984 painewebber fired winters for alleged 
willful misconduct 
after winters filed his original lawsuit in new york 
painewebber went to court in connecticut seeking to collect on its 
promissary notes 
winters denied that he owed painewebber any money and filed 
seven counterclaims seeking damages for breach of employment 
contract false and fraudulent promises and defamatory statements 
painewebber won a judgment against winters who appealed to the 
state supreme court the court granted him a new trial in march 
1988 
winters attorney john h chaman and spirer told the judge 
they had agreed on most points to be covered in the final arguments 
and would be ready for the arguments tuesday 
spirer also has asked the court to dimiss winters counterclaims 
before the case gets to the jury 
judge dennis f harrigan reserved a decision on the request he 
indicated he would rule after hearing the closing arguments

in a growing movement to force 
corporations to disclose more information about animal 
experimentation animalrights activists are taking their fight 
directly to shareholders 
this year shareholders at 10 companies will vote on resolutions 
proposed by animalrights activists an increase of two over 1988 
according to the washingtonbased investor responsibility research 
center 
its a thoughtful and sophisticated way to encourage companies 
to seriously consider questions of humane treatment of animals in 
connection with their business said attorney alan lovenheim who 
has represented about a dozen groups seeking animalrights 
resolutions 
corporations generally have opposed the proxy resolutions 
after years of fruitless picketing against us surgical corps 
use of dogs in product tests activists secured a resolution on the 
companys proxy ballot for its may 2 annual meeting demanding a 
halt to the tests 
people for the ethical treatment of animals has proxy 
resolutions asking eight corporations american home products 
corp avon products inc bristolmeyer co colgatepalmolive 
co gillette co greyhound corp scheringplough corp and 
johnson amp johnson to cite progress in developing alternatives to 
animal testing 
for the third year international business machines corp has 
included an animalrights resolution on its ballot 
the proposal filed by an individual shareholder simply asks 
the company to disclose information on animal experiments that it 
may conduct ibm has opposed the resolution 
on all issues 170 proxy resolutions have been proposed this 
year about half dealing with south africa according to the 
investor responsibility research center which monitors 
shareholders resolutions 
in 1985 lovenheim successfully sued greenwichbased iroquois 
brands ltd in which he held stock to get his animalrights 
resolution included for vote in the companys proxy ballot 
lovenheim wanted to know whether the french farmers who supplied 
the company with goose liver were treating the fowl humanely 
the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
drafted a resolution for the mcdonalds corp proxy ballot this 
year but withdrew it after mcdonalds agreed to assess farming 
practices used to produce its meat and eggs 
it was gratifying this year to find mcdonalds was willing to 
sit down and discuss the proposal said lovenheim who 
represented the aspca 
lovenheim said the securities and exchange commission has 
supported every resolution he has proposed or defended despite 
corporate objections 
the new england antivivisection society last week filed suit in 
federal court in boston against norwalkbased us surgical 
charging the company used false information in recommending that a 
resolution calling for suspension of animal testing be rejected 
the society has owned 66 shares of us surgical which 
manufactures surgical products since 1983 
us surgical has been a target of protests by animalrights 
groups for years but the dispute drew national attention in 
november when an animal activist allegedly planted a 
remotecontrolled bomb outside the companys headquarters 
authorities said animal activist fran trutt of new york city 
intended to detonate the bomb and kill us surgical chairman leon 
hirsch no one was injured in the incident trutt is awaiting trial 
on a charge of attempted murder

132 percent to 288 million that division provides data in a

helped push up prices of crude oil and other refined petroleum 
products traded on the new york mercantile exchange

international futures inc said the rise in gasoline futures 
largely reflects concern about whether supply will meet growing 
demand as the summer driving season approaches

million gallons of oil in valdez alaska last month temporarily 
choking off crucial oil shipping lanes

a us marketing firm said monday it 
will sell 1500 laptop computers made in hong kong to the soviet 
union for use by reporters for tass news service 
holographic systems inc said the defense department tried to 
block the 21 million sale of computers with cyrillic keyboards 
but received commerce department approval 
the computers made by bondwell international of hong kong and 
fremont calif use intel corps 80286 chip and are more powerful 
than the laptops most commonly used by american reporters 
the defense department initially objected to the sale citing 
the quantity of computers and complaining they were ruggedized 
for possible use in military situations 
glenn g smith president of holographic systems denied the 
charge he said the deal went through recently after the defense 
department failed to file a further objection following a 
recommendation for approval by commerce 
smith who also is negotiating a joint venture with the soviet 
ministry of railways for a 20 million executive center and health 
fitness club for foreign executives said the laptop sale took 
three months to get an export license 
the government ought to find a way to expedite the licensing 
and get the defense department out of some of these nonstrategic 
items like personal computers smith said the soviets can 
go to singapore and get a license in seven days

the dollar lost ground monday against most other 
major currencies in worldwide foreign exchange trading tempered by 
anticipation of yet another report due tuesday on us inflation 
gold prices edged up in new york trading after falling overseas 
republic national bank of new york quoted an afterhours bid for 
gold at 38530 a troy ounce up 30 cents from fridays late bid 
traders have grown increasingly uncertain about the prospects 
for the dollar as recent us economic reports provided an 
inconclusive view of the economy the us trade deficit widened in 
february but the growth in producer prices slowed in march and the 
level of industrial production held steady 
traders were looking to tuesdays scheduled release on the 
consumer price index for march to see if inflation is slowing 
we wont see any major direction until we see the cpi 
number said jack barbanel manager of futures trading at gruntal 
amp co in new york 
he said trading was relatively quiet and there was no sign of 
central bank intervention in the currency markets 
foreign currencies are begining to generate an upswing and we 
may see a little bit of correction against the dollar in the short 
term but in the long term we still see the dollar relatively 
strong he said 
barbanel said he did not think the federal reserve would tighten 
credit conditions on the basis of a strong consumer price rise 
alone because the producer price figure showed slower growth in 
march 
that gives shortterm rates a respite for a while he said 
rising us interest rates usually give the dollar a lift 
in tokyo the dollar fell to 13183 japanese yen from 13255 yen 
on friday in london the dollar was quoted at 13170 yen in new 
york the dollar edged up to 132155 yen from 13205 yen late 
friday 
but the dollar finished lower against most other major 
currencies 
in london the british pound rose to 17095 monday from 17000 
late friday in new york the pound rose to 17133 from 17055 
late friday 
other dollar rates as of 4 pm in new york compared with late

palladium futures prices came crashing down monday from 8year 
highs as speculators took profits and lowered their expectations 
that nuclear fusion research would lead to explosive demand for the 
metal 
platinum futures also declined sharply while gold and silver 
advanced 
on other markets petroleum futures soared grains and soybeans 
were sharply higher and most livestock and meat futures also 
advanced 
on the new york mercantile exchange all palladium contracts 
except the spot april contract fell the permitted daily limit of 6 
a troy ounce the april contract which has no limit pending its 
upcoming expiration plunged 1230 to 16835 an ounce 
platinum settled 18 to 1850 lower with july at 55070 a troy 
ounce 
both metals were components in a university of utah chemistry 
experiment announced on march 23 in which researchers claimed to 
have recreated in a bottle the elusive nuclear reaction that powers 
the sun and stars 
the discovery raised hopes that nuclear fusion could become a 
major energy source 
last thursday palladium rocketed to an 8yearhigh and platinum 
surged to its highest price in four months as other scientists 
replicated the utah experiment 
but the speculative fever began cooling friday and disappeared 
monday morning amid media reports that the fusion research was not 
likely to create significantly stronger demand for palladium and 
platinum 
fred demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc 
in new york said both markets had become sorely overbought and 
due for a correction 
gold and silver futures inched higher on new yorks commodity

troy ounce silver was 05 cent to 06 cent higher with may at

crude oil prices spurted above 21 a barrel on the new york merc 
for the first time in 20 months 
analysts said the buying was inspired by chart signals rather 
than new supplyanddemand developments the rally was led by the

midfebruary 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 53 cents 
higher with may at 2122 a barrel heating oil was 85 cent to 
119 cents higher with may at 5376 cents a gallon unleaded

cents a gallon 
corn and soybean futures surged on the chicago board of trade 
amid forecasts for dry and much warmer weather in the western corn 
belt later this week 
many traders remember the dramatic price increases for corn and 
soybeans that accompanied last summers drought and each day 
without rain in the midwest bolsters the bullish trend despite the 
fact that farmers in the region have barely begun their spring 
planting 
this is awfully early to be having a weather rally said

with fanfare and a closedcircuit 
broadcast ford motor co patted itself on the back monday for the 
mustang introduced 25 years ago as an inexpensive sporty car that 
took the country by storm 
it spawned a whole new class of cars said michael marsden 
a professor of pop culture at bowling green state university who 
was on hand for the birthday party the chevrolet camaro 
wouldnt exist if the mustang hadnt come along 
on april 17 1964 about five weeks after the first one rolled 
off the line at the dearborn assembly plant the mustang was 
introduced formally living up to the executives promises it 
weighed 2570 pounds and cost 2368 
since that day ford has built and sold more than 57 million 
mustangs making millions of dollars off the cars its best sales 
year was in 1966 when 549000 of the cars were sold its worst 
sales year was 1983 when 117000 mustangs were driven off dealers 
lots 
the first mustang now in the henry ford museum in dearborn was 
sold to an airplane pilot in st johns newfoundland in april 
1964 the pilot stanley tucker now of montreal was convinced by 
ford to trade in job 1 for job 1000001 two years later so that 
the original could be preserved 
on monday ford rolled out a vintage mustang as officials and 
workers gathered to cut a cake in the shape of a ford oval and 
topped by an edible model of a mustang behind the ceremony 
mustangs continued to be assembled at a rate of 52 an hour 
the executives were brought to the plants finishing area in 
mustangs of course to the beat of wilson picketts tune mustang 
sally the ceremony was telecast live to all ford plants in the 
united states and canada through an inhouse broadcast system 
plant manager lou callaway who began his ford career at the 
dearborn assembly plant and got a rousing cheer monday when he 
stepped from a new mustang said in an interview before the 
birthday party there was a feeling that the car would do well even 
before it was introduced 
you can always tell when a car is going to be successful he 
said because the employees are excited about it 
one of the employees there when the first mustang rolled off the 
line and who is still working at the plant is milton bevins 62 
whose enthusiasm for the car continues 
we make the best cars in america said bevins whose family 
has had three mustangs a blue 1966 a blue 78 and a brown 80 
they were all driven by other members of his family 
i have a 77 ford grenada he said i refer to it as my

a federal judge monday refused to modify an 
order preventing the free worlds largest gold concern south 
africalinked minorco sa from acquiring any more shares of no 2 
gold producer consolidated gold fields plc 
the decision by us district judge michael b mukasey continues 
a preliminary injunction he issued last october barring minorco 
from acquiring the 704 percent of gold fields shares it doesnt 
already own 
last fall minorco a luxembourg corporation largely controlled 
by two south african concerns anglo american corp of south africa 
and de beers consolidated mines ltd launched a 49 billion 
hostile takeover bid since upped to 6 billion for consolidated 
gold fields 
but gold fields a british concern resisted and filed an 
antitrust action in new york claiming that a takeover could result 
in minorcos dominating the strategically important world gold 
market 
this court enjoined the takeover because the resulting 
combination would control 323 percent of the noncommunist world 
gold market mukasey said in a 45page opinion issued monday 
minorco through its various holdings is the largest gold 
producer in the west accounting for 203 percent of all 
production gold fields with about a 12 percent share is the 
secondlargest according to court papers 
mukaseys injunction also prevents minorco from selling its gold 
fields holdings to other entities within the south african 
conglomerate without court approval 
minorco sought to modify the injunction allowing it to complete 
its acquisition of gold fields while promising to sell off certain 
us australian and south african assets within a year to resolve 
antitrust allegations made by gold fields 
but mukasey rejected that bid saying there was no guarantee that 
anglo and debeers wouldnt eventually repurchase the divested 
concerns because south african laws enable companies there to 
conceal the source of their overseas investments in order to avoid 
the effects of antiapartheid laws 
last month a federal appeals court upheld mukaseys preliminary 
injunction on antitrust grounds and ordered him to consider whether 
the takeover bid violates us securities laws 
in mondays ruling however mukasey rejected gold fields 
claims that minorco had failed to fully disclose its south african 
interests in violation of us securities laws 
gold fields sought to widen the scope of the injunction by 
claiming minorco violated the antifraud provisions of us 
securities laws for allegedly making and false and misleading 
statements about how much control south african corporations and 
individuals have over it 
gold fields claimed the oppenheimer family of south africa 
indirectly controls minorco anglo american and debeers and that 
the stigma of south africas apartheid racial policy could make it 
difficult to conduct business in some countries 
but mukasey found those claims were only part of a delaying 
tactic to push minorcos offer past its april 26 deadline which 
under british law would bar it from renewing its bid for more than 
a year 
gold fields has significant gold mining holdings in south 
africa australia and the united states including 90 percent of 
newmont gold the largest gold producer in the country

apple computer inc will stick to making 
personal computers for the mass market rather than going upscale in 
the battle against invaders like sun microsystems inc chairman 
john sculley said monday 
sculley said some hot new technologies are too expensive and 
untried to be offered by apple itself although other companies may 
offer them as addons to the popular apple macintosh 
apple will offer the new technologies on the macintosh once they 
become cheaper and better accepted he said 
as examples he cited artificial intelligence and digital signal 
processing chips which take voices and video signals and turn them 
into code that can be acted on by a computer 
sculley appeared to be staking out the middle ground of the 
personal computer market as apples own putting less emphasis on 
the high ground where apple faces its sternest competition 
sun microsystems last week unveiled a family of lowpriced 
sparcstation computers that can zoom through more than 12 million 
instructions per second 
steve jobs who cofounded apple and went on to create next 
inc is pitching a speedy next workstation that comes in an 
elegant black magnesium box 
sculley said he does not foresee a collision between personal 
computers and workstations which are cousins of pcs that cost 
more run faster and have superior graphics 
there are a lot of things you have to do to be successful in 
the personal computer industry beyond offering hardware under 
10000 sculley said in a news conference 
suns compact sparcstation starts at less than 9000 but 
sculley said it is still about twice the price of the new macintosh 
iicx which he described in an earlier speech as possibly the 
companys best computer ever and he said software for the sun 
machine is much more expensive than macintosh software 
still analysts say the sun and next machines are tough 
competition for the most expensive apple models such as the 
macintosh iix which sells for 10000 to 12000 
thats one of the reasons they want to emphasize the midrange 
of the products the competition is getting pretty fierce at the 
high end said laura lederman an analyst at duff amp phelps inc 
she said she was concerned that waiting too long to put new 
technologies into the macintosh could leave apple playing catchup 
i dont think theyre really any longer at the forefront of 
technology 
sculley gave the keynote address at the macintosh business 
conference and exposition which was billed as the biggest 
macintosh event ever in new york he followed the speech with a 
news conference

a federal bankruptcy judge gave eastern airlines 
and its creditors an extra week monday to invite buyers and explore 
a possible breakup but parent texas air corp said the 
strikestrapped airline wasnt for sale 
the developments added a new twist to the miamibased airlines 
tortuous labor crisis now in its seventh week and suggested a 
solution was growing more elusive 
as time goes by there are fewer alternatives to explore 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland told a manhattan courtroom 
crammed with about 50 uniformed pilots and lawyers for texas air 
creditors and the unions 
this airline is hemorrhaging he said it is not tolerable 
that this process be so lengthy that the parties have nothing left 
to consider 
bruce simon an attorney for the pilots union told a news 
conference that texas air appears to be in an especial state of 
disarray with the company and its lawyers giving conflicting 
signals about their planned course of action 
lifland held a hearing to determine why he shouldnt put the 
entire airline up for sale including assets held by eastern before 
texas air acquired it three years ago for about 676 million 
lawyers for eastern and its creditors talked him into giving 
them an extra week to study alternatives over the objection of 
attorneys for the unions and a dissident creditor atlanta attorney 
moreton rolleston jr they have been pushing for more aggressive 
court action to get eastern flying again either through a sale or 
the appointment of an outside trustee to run the airline 
after the hearing lawyers for eastern and the pilots union said 
there was another possible bidder besides the three previously 
known exbaseball boss peter ueberroth hotelier jay pritzker and 
takeover investor carl icahn they wouldnt identify the fourth 
bidder 
simon said david i shapiro the bankruptcy examiner for 
eastern described the fourth bidder to the lawyers involved as a 
group of substantial capital willing and able to do the 
transaction shapiro told the lawyers monday he had been in 
contact with all four potential suitors simon said 
the judges order meant that during the week potential buyers 
would gain access to confidential financial data concerning eastern 
in exchange for their pledge to keep the information secret 
participants in the case said 
joel zweibel the lead attorney for the 15member committee 
representing easterns creditors said the miamibased airline has 
agreed to provide the necessary financial documents 
there might be someone whos interested at the right price 
said eastern attorney harvey miller 
texas air however said its directors had decided not to pursue 
the sale of eastern but will consider selling a substantial part 
of the companys assets to pay down debts 
the texas air boards statement essentially sanctioned eastern 
managements decision announnced last wednesday after a deal with 
ueberroth collapsed to reduce eastern to about 60 percent of its 
prestrike size texas air spokesman art kent said the statement 
was unrelated to liflands hearing 
eastern workers have been on strike since march 4 charging 
texas air boss frank lorenzo has butchered it and plotted to 
destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to sister 
carrier continental airlines 
lorenzo put eastern into bankruptcy court refuge march 9 and 
sought a buyer ueberroth nearly completed a 464 million deal to 
buy eastern but the sale flopped over a dispute between the unions 
and lorenzo over who would run the airline until ueberroths 
investor group could assume control 
sources familiar with the eastern situation have said ueberroth 
remains interested in making a new offer pritzker owner of the 
hyatt hotel chain and icahn owner and chairman of trans world 
airlines inc also have been lurking in the background as possible 
buyers 
the lifland hearing was jammed with interested bystanders among 
them was former pan am corp chairman ed acker who declined to say 
why he was there

a federal appeals court on monday allowed 
the state of california to go to trial with claims that six major 
oil companies conspired to depress the price of oil they pumped 
from stateowned tidelands in long beach 
the suits in federal and state court claim losses to the state 
and the city of long beach totaling 789 million in 197177 and 
198085 damages tripled under antitrust law would exceed 23 
billion and could be increased further by 2500aday penalties 
sought under state unfaircompetition laws 
most of the claimed losses were to the state which uses 
tidelands oil money for school construction the city of long beach 
gets a small fraction of the oil money 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals voted 30 to reinstate the 
suits which had been dismissed by us district judge william gray 
of los angeles 
the suits accuse the six companies standard oil co of 
california texaco inc union oil mobil corp shell oil co and 
exxon corp of holding down the prices they paid for heavy crude 
oil while agreeing secretly to exchange oil among themselves at 
higher prices a seventh defendant atlantic richfield co settled 
in 1984 by paying 225 million 
still pending before the appellate court is an appeal by 
california and four other states from a ruling by gray dismissing a 
separate antitrust suit against the same seven oil companies which 
accuses them of conspiring to create a gasoline shortage and fix 
gasoline prices in the early 1970s 
in mondays ruling the court said the state and city had 
presented enough evidence to proceed to trial with claims that the 
oil companies conspired to keep artificially low the prices they 
paid to long beach for heavy crude oil 
royce schulz a lawyer for the city said retail prices for oil 
products in california were about the same as those elsewhere in 
the period an indication that the companies actions didnt help 
consumers 
refiners simply pocketed that profit he said 
the suits contend the companies agreed secretly in the early 
1960s at meetings involving all of them except exxon to keep the 
posted price for heavy crude below its real value while exchanging 
different grades of oil among themselves at higher rates 
lawyers for long beach said the elaborate exchange procedure 
unique to california was disclosed by a state auditor in 1973 but 
was being used as late as 1984 
types of oil were used as a currency a medium of exchange 
and a new value system reserved to the majors oil companies and 
kept secret from the state and the city schulz said in a 
background paper on the case 
gary halling another partner in schulzs firm said the secrecy 
of the exchange system let the oil companies evade a provision of 
their contract with long beach that required them to pay the city 
the highest price they paid any other seller of oil 
but david destino a lawyer for exxon said the exchange system 
simply allowed oil companies to move their product to market while 
guaranteeing that they would get equal value when trading the same 
grade of oil from different sources 
the appeals court said the exchange system did not amount to 
pricefixing by itself but could point to the existence of a 
conspiracy 
at various times market conditions should have caused some of 
the companies to post higher crude prices said the opinion by 
judge jerome farris posted prices did not correspond to market 
value 
farris also rejected grays conclusion that federal price 
controls and other regulations during the 197177 period made it 
impossible for the city and state to show any damages even if they 
could prove a pricefixing conspiracy

holly farms corp trying to block a 115 
billion takeover by a rival poultry processor said monday it 
failed to convince its stockholders to approve a merger holly 
managers proposed with conagra inc and would abandon the idea 
holly farms said a preliminary count showed that only 325 
percent of its stock was voted in favor of the merger with conagra 
and 478 percent against it the tally was taken friday with a 
twothirds affirmative vote required 
ted bailey a holly farms vice president said holly notified 
conagra on monday that the merger was off 
holly farms directors announced the proposed merger with omaha 
nebbased conagra last november to ward off a takeover by tyson 
foods inc of springdale ark 
they had to have a twothirds vote and they didnt even get 
onethird jim blair general counsel for tyson said of the 
shareholder voting i would hope the holly board would start 
paying a little attention to the wishes of their shareholders i 
think this is a mandate to take our deal 
the merger agreement included a provision aimed at allowing 
conagra to purchase key holly assets in the event the merger 
failed the assetoption agreement remains in effect though it 
has been temporarily blocked by delaware chancery court on a 
challenge by tyson bailey said 
the court also blocked another provision of the merger proposal 
requiring holly farms to pay conagra 15 million plus expenses if 
the deal failed 
walt casey a conagra vice president said his companys 
expenses for the merger attempt total 5 million 
casey said conagra still is interested in holly farms but he 
declined to say if his company will make a higher offer to counter 
tyson 
tyson is offering holly stockholders 6350 a share in cash for 
their 181 million shares 
the offer is contingent however on removal of the assetoption 
agreement between conagra and holly farms 
the conagra merger which would have made holly farms a conagra 
subsidiary called for a 11 billion stock swap worth about 61 a 
share 
the board will be meeting and reviewing alternatives available 
to shareolders and will be asking that the shareholders do nothing 
in respect to their stock until they hear from the board bailey 
said 
tyson foods is the nations largest poultry processor and holly 
farms a diversified company is heavily involved in fresh poultry 
sales conagra is one of the largest food companies in the country 
with revenues of 94 billion last year 
the assetoption agreement between conagra and holly farms 
allows conagra to purchase about onethird of hollys assets at 
prices already negotiated if the memphis company is bought by 
anyone else within the next nine months 
tyson contends the asset agreement was an illegal attempt to 
make holly farms unattractive to any buyer other than conagra 
the delaware judge hearing tysons suit has blocked any 
execution of the asset agreement until the legal disputes 
surrounding it are settled

the nuclear regulatory commission on monday 
gave a pennsylvania nuclear plant permission to resume operations 
two years after it was shut down because 33 control room operators 
slept on the job or neglected their duties 
the nrc voted 30 to lift an order that had kept the peach 
bottom nuclear plant closed since march 31 1987 when the 
commission said its continued operation posed a threat to the 
health and safety of the public 
in granting permission to restart the facility the commission 
nevertheless warned the plant operator against complacency we 
will be watching you very closely said nrc chairman lando zech 
plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items 
before bringing the plant to full power which will take several 
months and be scrutinized by nrc inspectors 
the vote followed a presentation by philadelphia electric co 
the plant operator which said it had undergone radical changes 
since the nrc issued its order following a tip about the sleeping 
that prompted an investigation 
the changes successfully addressed the root causes of the 
problem the nrc staff said in recommending that the commission 
permit the plant to restart 
those problems had included a lax peach bottom culture in 
which plant problems either were ignored or unnoticed by top 
managers the staff said 
it would at least appear to me that management before the 
shutdown either was not aware of conditions or if they were aware 
of it they condoned it zech said before the vote 
the operators must never again betray the special trust and 
countenance of the public zech said we will be watching you 
very closely 
nrc commissioner james curtis was out of the country and missed 
the vote commissioner kenneth rogers did not vote because he once 
served on the philadelphia electric board the nrc said 
the shutdown cost the company about 250 million in plant 
modifications purchases of replacement power and its share of a 
125 million fine the largest in nrc history 
many of the problems at peach bottom occured on the overnight 
or graveyard shift 
on at least two occasions according to nrc testimony in 1987 
three of the four control room employees responsible for running 
the plant were asleep at the same time another time several of 
the operators were found huddled around a personal computer playing 
video games 
of 39 control room operators now at the plant 24 were there at 
the time of the shutdown and all have been retrained to end 
catnaps by operators plant officials also replaced comfortable 
highbacked chairs in the control room with lowbacked models 
in another development meanwhile zech indicated the committee 
would vote thursday on awarding a fullpower license to the 
shoreham nuclear plant on long island after hearing the nrc staff 
report that the 55 billion reactor is safe and ready to operate 
all indications are that the fullpower license will be awarded 
but whether it will ever be used is doubtful the long island 
lighting co is one step away from selling the plant to new york 
state for 1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of 
up to 5 percent the state would then decommission and dismantle 
the plant 
lilcos board of directors is recommending that shareholders 
approve the plan to shut the plant the final step to ratifying the 
settlement is a vote by lilco shareholders on or before june 15 in 
the meantime lilco has agreed not to operate the plant even if it 
receives a 25 percent or fullpower license before then 
shoreham which was completed in 1984 13 years behind schedule 
received a lowpower testing license in 1985 but lilco was 
thwarted in its quest for an operating license because the state 
and local governments refused to participate in emergency planning 
contending that area around the plant could not be safely evacuated 
in the event of a nuclear emergency 
in late 1987 the nrc changed its rules to allow utilities to 
prepare their own evacuation plans assuming that in the event of a 
real emergency state and local governments would live up to their 
responsibilities and participate nrc finally removed lilcos last 
obstacles to a license the state and local governments by 
dismissing them as legal intervenors before the nrc

mondays midnight deadline for filing federal income tax returns 
brought the usual deluge of lastminute mailings as people held 
onto their money as long as possible or procrastinated until time 
ran out 
the postal service took a tip from the fast food industry in 
columbus ohio where traffic was directed through the front 
parking lot of the citys main post office so people could drive 
through and hand their completed returns to postal workers 
stationed outside 
any returns we get by midnight well make sure they get 
postmarked on the 17th said debbie rinehart a mail processing 
clerk at the columbus main post office 
people making the mad dash to beat the mailing deadline were 
offered entertainment or moral support to improve their mood in 
some cities 
at lawrence kan the lawrence barnstorm cloggers band was to 
perform at the post office from 10 pm until midnight said 
spokeswoman laurie mackey 
we just want to lift peoples spirits mackey said 
in los angeles rock station klsxfm offered coffee and donuts 
at the downtown terminal annex the citys main mail processing 
center which posted buckets at curbside until midnight 
we want to add some merriment and not make the people feel bad 
that theyre procrastinators said klsx disc jockey peter tilden 
in kansas city mo a performance art group called the stimulus 
amp response co prepared a show for its fourth annual taxathon 
outside the citys main post office 
at midnight we release balloons and scream its too late 
said eric george one of the participants its a touching 
moment the feeling that theyve got your money and theres nothing 
you can do about it 
in some cities protesters used the day to demonstrate against 
the use of income tax money for military purposes 
members of the northern california war tax resistance based in 
berkeley distributed 6000 to various charities saying the money 
came from people who refuse to pay all or part of their federal 
taxes because the money is used for war and war preparations 
actually not everyone had to have their returns in the mail by 
midnight monday 
residents of rhode island new hampshire maine connecticut 
upstate new york and massachusetts got an extra day this year 
because monday was a holiday patriots day in massachusetts 
residents of those states mail their returns to the internal 
revenue service office at andover mass 
but for the rest of the country april 17 was the deadline 
because april 15 fell on the weekend 
brooks drake a district manager who oversees 18 hampr block inc 
offices in dayton ohio said that when he assured worried clients 
that they had not missed the filing deadline it was like people 
on death row finding out they had gotten a reprieve 
whatever the deadline irs form 4868 request for a filing 
extension is the mostrequested form this late in the season 
said roslyn russell of the irs office in south bend ind 
officials of the irs center at fresno calif said they 
expected to receive the majority of the 114 million returns from 
central and southern california and hawaii regions by wednesday as 
of last week the center had received 59 million returns 
but the deluge of work doesnt mean irs workers dont have time 
for an occasional smile 
in the irs arkansas offices laughs have sprung from requests 
for form 911 which is reserved for taxpayers who cite unusual 
circumstances in requesting a speedy refund or relief from paying 
taxes said irs spokesman ken hubenak in little rock 
one person in particular was trying to get us to speed up the 
refund check because he had pawned his tools and wanted us to call 
the pawnbroker and explain it to him hubenak said another 
asked that they call a grocery store and say the check was on the 
way

exxon will hire 4000 people to scrub at 
least 305 miles of shoreline fouled by americas worst oil spill 
and says the job can be finished by the third week in august 
according to a plan released monday 
the cleanup can be be completed by august if a hotwater 
cleaning method that can damge beach life is used aggressively or 
by midseptember if environmentally safer methods play a larger 
role the draft plan says 
those projections were disputed by a state ecologist who said 
after reviewing the plan that only about 150 miles could be cleaned 
before winter and the top state environmental official called for 
the plan to be broadened to include areas where the oil has spread 
outside prince william sound 
its a start said department of environmental conservation 
chief dennis kelso it needs more work 
the plan estimates that by june 1 the company will have 2500 
alaskans working on the shoreline with 1500 other people in 
support roles it says 11 barges 28 landing vessels 150 utility 
ships and six washvacuum ships will be used 
according to the plan the total shoreline in prince william 
sound affected by the march 24 exxon valdez wreck is 366 miles 
about the distance from new york city to norfolk va or los 
angeles to phoenix ariz 
concentration of oil on the beach runs from 1260 gallons to 
12600 gallons per mile with an average of 4200 gallons per mile 
the oil company said the plan said exxon so far has recovered 
924000 gallons or 9 percent of the spilled oil 
the plan proposes to clean up 305 miles it estimates that 54 
miles are heavily oiled 86 moderately oiled and 165 lightly oiled 
it assumes that needed permits will be promptly issued and that no 
additional oil will wash ashore 
but steve haavig of the department of environmental conservation 
estimated after reviewing the plan that crews would be able to 
scrape and spray greasy black sludge from only about one mile of 
beach per day 
a mile a day is optimistic haavig said 
at most there are 150 days from the time workers and gear are 
mobilized two or three weeks from now until winter descends in 
september 
haavig said crews might make good time on lightly oiled beaches 
but the more heavily polluted stretches will slow them 
asked for comment exxon spokesman dennis stanczuk said the 
company wanted to confer first with the coast guard commandant 
adm paul yost who was sent by president bush to hasten the 
cleanup 
kelso in a letter to yost demanded that exxon improve its 
cleanup of oil still in the water 
he said the company should come up with a plan by april 25 to 
clean beaches beyond prince william sound in the gulf of alaska 
where the oil has spread he said he also wants data on how to 
manage and dispose of wastes 
meanwhile wildlife officials brought grim reports from the nuka 
island and nuka bay area on the kenai peninsula about 175 miles 
southwest of where the exxon valdez smashed into bligh reef 
they found a lot of dead birds and a lot of live oiled 
birds glenn seaman of the alaska department of fish and game 
said in homer theres otter tracks on every beach 
part of the herring grounds at the north end of the kodiak 
islands remained closed monday because of oil sightings it was 
feared the more important herring fishery at kamishak bay might not 
be able to begin as scheduled later this week 
prince william sound lies south of valdez the seaport where the 
transalaska oil pipeline ends until the spill its waters and 
islands had been among the most scenic in the nation and few 
places in the world are richer in wildlife and fish 
yost spent part of sunday at block island in the sound where 
muck was puddled ankledeep in places exxon had assembled state 
and federal officials and reporters for a demonstration of cleanup 
methods including an environmentally risky steamcleaning 
technique that sterilizes the shore 
haavig also was on block island checking the depth of the beach 
contamination in some places the oil had soaked in only an inch 
in others it was found several inches deep theyre never going 
to get it all he said 
in portland ore meanwhile state environmental chief fred 
hansen said the crippled exxon valdez appeared sound enough to make 
it to the port of portland for evaluation he said he expected 
exxon to agree to several conditions before officials allow the 
tanker to travel up the columbia river
