federal officials knew that workers at the 
nevada test site were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation from 
nuclear bomb blasts in the 1950s and 60s according to government 
records cited by the new york times 
but the officials decided not to reduce the exposure or inform 
the workers out of fear that changing procedures and equipment 
could disrupt nuclear testing according to thursday editions of 
the times 
the documents were made available to the newspaper by las vegas 
lawyers alan r johns and larry c johns who allege in a lawsuit 
against the government that radiation from bomb tests caused the 
cancer deaths of 200 nevada test site employees and cancer illness 
in 18 others 
according to minutes of a sept 23 1952 meeting of the atomic 
energy commission predecessor of the department of energy the 
commissioners expressed concern that workers might be exposed to 
radiation hazards for too long a time 
two weeks later the commissioners were told that the program 
for determining how much radiation hundreds of workers were exposed 
to was not reliable the times said 
by may 13 1953 some commissioners were calling for the 
reduction of worker exposures by lowering the governments annual 
safety limit which stood then at 12 rems 
dr john c bugher the aecs chief health officer at the time 
advised against lowering the limit saying it would make it 
impossible to conduct operations at the test site without major 
changes 
today the annual safety limit is five rems rems measure 
radiation doses 
the records show miners were ordered soon after nuclear blasts 
to recover instruments from tunnel filled with radioactive dust and 
contaminated debris in the 1950s workers cleaned up rubble at 
detonation sites without respirators to protect their lungs the 
times said 
on nov 24 1961 108 miners were pulled from two tunnels after 
they absorbed doses exceeding safety limits the miners were 
offered as much beer as they could drink for a week to flush the 
contaminants from their bodies the times said 
on june 6 1963 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from a 
tunnel on the night shift were found to be contaminated by 
radioactive iodine produced by a test in the tunnel the day before 
miners on the next shift were ordered to continue work in the 
tunnel despite the contamination the times said

the syracuse university students who died 
aboard pan am flight 103 last december were remembered by nearly 
600 people wednesday during an allfaith vigil marking the first 
anniversary of the jetliners bombing 
they have given us a precious gift they have given us each 
other said the rev michael rothermel during a 45minute service 
at the universitys hendricks chapel 
in the deaths that seemed too soon and that never should have 
happened that way they gave us a grieving vulnerability to see 
each other anew to see the preciousness in each other to see the 
infinite value and worth rothermel said 
rothermel and five other clergymen told those in attendance the 
vigils purpose was to keep alive the memories of the 35 students 
who were among 259 who perished when the jumbo jetliner exploded 
over lockerbie scotland last dec 21 
eleven residents of lockerbie also were killed when pieces of 
the jet crashed onto the village 
the students 25 of whom attended syracuse were returning to 
the united states after a semester studying overseas under the 
universitys division of international programs abroad 
the mood of wednesday nights vigil was not as oppressive as 
that which weighed on mourners last year when the chapel opened its 
doors in the immediate hours after news of the crash reached the 
campus 
heads were bowed as a silent processional of 35 students made 
its way into the chapel each carried a single lighted candle in 
memory of their dead classmates 
emotions became more visible as senior marcela honigman read 
aloud the names of those who perished in the bombing but it was 
rothermels words that struck the deepest passions 
it still hurts doesnt it during the past few days the 
images have beguntumbling back in my mind he said 
many in the gathering made up mostly of students began 
weeping holding hands or reaching out for one another 
tonight we keep vigil to stay awake those memories he said 
the service was scheduled for wednesday eight days before the 
anniversary to allow students to attend final examinations begin 
thursday and conclude on dec 20 the chapel will be open dec 21 
for private prayer

the remains of william shakespeares globe theater 
have been designated an ancient monument by the government 
guaranteeing them state protection 
the discovery of three chalk and brick foundation walls part of 
the back of the historic globe was announced oct 12 by the 
british conglomerate hanson plc which owns the site and the 
museum of london 
the remains on the south bank of the thames river near southwark 
bridge were granted the protection wednesday by environment 
secretary christopher patten as an ancient monumen said david 
trippier heritage minister at the department of the environment 
the globe saw the first performances of shakespeares great 
tragedies hamlet othello king lear and macbeth 
the theater was built in 1599 rebuilt after a fire 14 years 
later and destroyed in 1644 by the puritans who detested theaters 
it appeared in panoramic drawings of london made at the time but 
its exact shape and location had been a matter of argument among 
scholars for some 200 years most of the site was covered later by 
brewery buildings 
hanson invited archaeologists in after acquiring the site for 
development and paid for the dig 
pattens decision brings the globe site into the care of the 
historic buildings and monuments commission a government body of 
experts dedicated to saving hstoric structures 
once a monument is scheduled nothing can be done to it without 
consent from the environment department acting on the commissions 
advice 
the decision follows a national outcry earlier this year when 
developers were given the goahead to construct an office block 
over the site of another elizabethan theater near the globe called 
the rose 
the environment department said the remains of the globe were 
very fragile whereas the remains of the rose are safely buried 
beneath a thin layer of concrete to protect them whilst development 
is in progress

when drought parched 1988 crops a relief 
program was already in place but that program federally 
subsidized crop insurance has been a shambles for years the final 
story in a series cashing in on the drought shows even 
critics believe congress must rely on a stronger insurance network 
to eliminate big bailouts that follow natural disasters 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1980 congress expanded its 42yearold federal crop 
insurance program the goal was simple farmers would better cover 
themselves against the vagaries of nature and taxpayers would be 
spared costly disaster payments to farmers 
it hasnt turned out that way 
sales of crop insurance are well below expected levels the 
program is billions deep in red ink and under scrutiny after years 
of alleged mismanagement congress still bails out farmers with 
huge relief programs like the 1988 drought bill 
farmers are just the same as wall street theyll take a 
gamble if it means money said ed jones a farmer and former 
tennessee congressman who sponsored the 1980 bill they dont 
care about insurance if they think they are going to get a disaster 
payment 
last year was perfect illustration with only 13 percent of the 
nations estimated 33 million farmers relying on 
governmentsubsidized insurance they collected 39 billion in 
direct aid and an additional 11 billion in crop insurance 
payments 
an associated press study of the 1988 disaster program found 
farmers who said they were made whole by both programs earning 
as much or more in insurance claims and disaster payments as they 
would have with normal harvests 
while congress passed a law for crop insurance to be the 
single source of aid in a time of disaster that never happened 
because congress refused to let it happen said cliff fowler an 
assistant director at the general accounting office which issued 
20 reports on problems with crop insurance over the last nine years 
congress would come in with disaster payments a free bailout 
any time there was a disaster said fowler if you were a 
farmer why would you buy insurance if congress is going to bail 
you out for fre 
farmers wise to the ways of politics agree 
youd be crazy to buy insurance if you can count on a disaster 
program said m donald clifton ii a milton del farmer who 
received a 100000 disaster payment for peas and lima beans lost 
to drought last year 
clifton also collected insurance on some losses but he is no 
fan you could hit it close if you bought insurance on odd number 
years and didnt on election years when youre more likely to get 
aid he said 
yet crop insurance is still considered the best protection for 
farmers a september gao report said insurance is a more 
equitable and efficient way to provide disaster assistance than 
emergency loan and direct payment programs 
until this decade crop insurance begun in 1938 was limited to 
26 crops on 10 percent of the nations farmland 
that changed with the federal crop insurance act of 1980 a bill 
to make insurance all farmers first line of defense against losses 
from drought flood insects and blight 
congress envisioned a selfsustaining program farmers would buy 
insurance to cover losses just like any other business enterprise 
government clerks would be replaced by private agents selling 
policies amid corn rows and wheat fields 
most importantly disaster payments would be phased out 
banishing these expensive programs essentially free insurance for 
farmers would trim the budget and make growers more responsible 
there were abuses examples of people planting even when 
there was no soil moisture and they knew there would be no 
harvest said james johnson a former staff member with the house 
agriculture committee farmers used bad management knowing there 
was this entitlement at the end of the crop year 
crop insurance coverage grew slowly over the decade last year 
only 25 percent of the nations farm fields were insured well 
under the 50 percent targeted by congress 
the figure hit 40 percent this year but only because farmers 
who were paid for losses greater than 65 percent last year had to 
buy insurance for 1989 
the federal crop insurance corp has lost money every year since 
1980 a total of more than 4 billion losses in 1988 alone 
amounted to 579 million 
as the federal tab for crop insurance went up so did the cost 
of the special disaster programs the insurance was to eliminate 
from 1974 to 1980 farmers received 3 billion in disaster payments 
the cost has soared beyond 7 billion this decade 
insurance rates are based on the risk insurance companies run of 
paying a claim car insurance rates for example are based on 
actuarial study of losses to accidents and theft the amount of 
money the insurer is likely to pay and the amount of premium money 
the company is likely to collect and invest 
but the fcic without a certified actuary until 1986 made 
optimistic forecasts that didnt match experience one example 
premium income grew by only 10 percent from 1982 through 1986 
never exceeding 440 million a year yet the fcic predicted premium 
income of 700 million in 1987 it collected little more than half 
that 
the program is actuarily unsound acknowledged john 
marshall fcic manager since 1988 to some extent our problems 
are the result of expanding too rapidly we didnt get our rates 
policies and procedures in place based on good research 
jackie king a rehoboth del insurance agent recalls a policy 
that lumped lima beans and snap beans together even though they 
have different growing seasons and risks 
when i called to talk to the man who wrote the policy he 
said i didnt know there was a difference between a lima bean and 
a snap bean she said i told them i was going to put the 
policy under my desk i wasnt going to insult these farmers 
the corporation has been criticized for not keeping a tight rein 
on the private insurers who sell and service crop insurance a 1987 
gao study found farmers were overpaid an average of 31 percent on 
claims 
at present farmers can insure 50 65 or 75 percent of their 
crop in the way a car owner chooses a deductible on auto 
insurance farmers also choose what percentage of market price to 
be compensated for the fcic subsidizes 15 percent to 30 percent of 
premium costs depending on coverage but rates and regulations 
change yearly 
if youre going to insure a 1981 bronco you get a quote and 
its done said ms king with crop insurance you have 
different levels of coverage and different price selections it can 
get really confusing 
with all its problems even critics believe crop insurance is 
improving a recent gao study found the overpayment rate had 
dropped to 16 percent the fcic is studying decades of weather and 
crop reports to bring premiums in line with the actual cost of 
insuring a crop 
we are seeing some bright spots said marshall 
but concern remains that the crop insurance program cant 
succeed if farmers believe they will be protected by special 
disaster programs 
you either have a permanent disaster payment program or you 
never do it again and have insurance said johnson the former 
staff member with the house agriculture committee 
you have to do that before people will believe in one system 
or the other

to hear agriculture department economists tell 
it the nations farmers as a group havent had it so good in 
years 
that would seem to go against all evidence in plain sight the 
money crunches of the middle 1980s and the droughts of the last two 
years were painful sometimes terminal for thousands of farm 
families 
no one is sure how many farmers had to leave the land annual 
estimates by the agriculture department indicate that about 267000 
farms disappeared in the 1980s a decrease from 244 million in 
1980 to about 217 million in 1989 of those 40000 have dropped 
out since 1987 
but not all of those left farming due to failure bankruptcy 
foreclosure or drought each decade realizes some attrition 
compare the 267000 dropouts in the 1980s with 516000 in the 
1970s 1 million in the 1960s and 17 million in the 1950s 
drought in 1988 hurt vast areas particularly the midwest and 
upper great plains and in places the land remains parched with 
too little moisture soaking below the surface 
but most farmers profited as the 1988 drought reduced crop 
yields and drove up prices this fall bigger corn yields have 
driven down prices of feed grains making it cheaper to feed 
cattle hogs and chickens but hurting the grain farmers 
the 1989 corn harvest is up 54 percent from last years 
droughtshriveled crop wheat is up 13 percent and the soybean 
crop is 25 percent larger 
in 1987 according to the departments economic research 
service farmers net cash income rose to a record 577 billion 
from 518 billion in 1986 and 467 billion in 1985 
the climb marked a turnaround in farm fortunes after falling 
land values high interest rates and heavy debts squeezed hard in 
the early 1980s 
in 1988 net cash income rose further to 599 billion 
reflecting higher crop prices because of the drought nearrecord 
government payments and sales of stored surpluses 
this year with government payments declining surpluses running 
out and farmers spending more to expand crop acreage net cash 
income is expected to decline to 53 billion in 1990 according to 
the latest projections net cash income may rise to almost 55 
billion 
net cash income as defined by the economic research service is 
the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses in a 
calendar year its money left over that can buy new equipment 
retire debt and support the farm family 
another measurement is called net farm income this includes the 
value of farm inventories of grain cattle hogs and other 
production in a calendar year along with allowances for other 
nonmoney items such as the value of homegrown food and 
existing dwellings 
by that reckoning net farm income rose to 324 billion in 
1985 38 billion in 1986 and 471 billion in 1987 last year 
according to this method net farm income declined to 457 billion 
still the second highest on record 
net farm income this year is forecast at about 48 billion and 
it may be in the range of 44 billion to 49 billion in 1990 
these are national figures and agency analysts are quick to 
acknowledge that many farmers are suffering financially even when 
farmers as a group are enjoying the best of times 
but even some state statistics show farmers have fared better in 
recent years than many would have believed likely in the early 80s 
for example net cash income increased in 33 states in 1988 
despite the drought even in some of the states that were hardest 
hit 
on the basis of net farm income which take farmerheld 
inventories into account 27 states showed increases from 1987 
overall the countrys farm financial performance continued to 
improve in 1988 as it had in 1986 and 1987 said usda economist 
mitch morehart 
morehart noted that direct government payments to farmers which 
peaked at 167 billion in 1987 dropped 13 percent to 145 
billion in 1988 the latest estimates put direct payments at 11 
billion in 1989 and 8 billion to 11 billion in 1990 
annual records kept by the agriculture department indicate that 
total farm assets mostly land have been increasing since they 
dropped to 7871 billion in 1986 the record high was more than 
11 trillion in 1981 this years assets are forecast at 849 
billion and may grow to as much as 890 billion in 1990 
total farm debt by 1988 was 138 billion and may drop to 136 
billion in 1989 in the early and mid1980s us farm debt was as 
high as 2065 billion including family household debt

as crews put the finishing touches on 
a grandiose central palace that has swallowed billions of dollars 
the masses in romanias capital scramble to keep warm and to feed 
themselves 
romanians stop and gape at the exclusive stores lining the 
threemile boulevard of the victory of socialism which extends 
from the base of the towering white palace of the republic 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of 
retribution said recently the palace of the republic and its 
surroundings have cost about eight billion lei 800 million at 
the official rate annually since construction began in 1984 
day and night water spouts from dozens of fountains despite the 
energy shortage that keeps radiators cold for most of the day and 
private cars idled for lack of gasoline 
luxury marblefronted apartment buildings along the boulevard 
built after about 40000 people were uprooted await the arrival of 
communist party functionaries and their families sometime next year 
behind them lie the narrow muddy streets of the old town where 
shoppers crowd to present identity cards for their ration of eight 
ounces of meat a week when meat is available 
a woman behind the counter of a dingy bar recently measured out 
glasses of bitters the only drink available and laughed 
derisively when asked for coffee or tea 
interconti interconti she said pointing in the general 
direction of the luxury hotel that is reserved for westerners 
paying in hard currency 
a sixth winter of strict food and energy rationing looms 
despite expectations of substantial improvements following the 
announcement in march that the country is debtfree for the first 
time in more than four decades 
the first winter of privation was in 1983 two years after 
maverick communist president nicolae ceausescu launched an allout 
drive to pay off the 11 billion borrowed to industrialize his 
agrarian nation 
as part of the campaign romania exported much of what it 
produced for hard currency including food and refined petroleum 
products and cut imports to a minimum the results were 
predictable 
the debt shrank romania managed to pay back an estimated 25 
billion annually in recent years but empty shelves cold and dark 
homes and long lines at gasoline stations became commonplace 
romanians cowed by decades of strict secret police 
surveillance refuse to go on the record with criticisms of the 
standard of living but several raised their eyebrows recently when 
told that ceausescu in interviews with western media denies there 
are shortages 
the authoritarian ceausescu who has defied moscow in the past 
and continues to fight the political reforms sweeping eastern 
europe is commonly considered to be poorly informed about the real 
situation in his country with fearful aides scrambling to present 
a picture that meets his expectations 
but in october in a rare move probably triggered by growing 
dissatisfaction the socalled supreme leader made an unexpected 
tour of poorly stocked bucharest markets and promised better food 
supplies 
although romanians and foreign residents say food supplies have 
improved somewhat since then few appear to expect a real 
turnaround at least this winter 
the export drive appears to have slackened but it has bled 
the country dry said one western diplomat who specializes in 
economic analysis its going to take a long time to build up the 
kind of surplus needed to offer a steady variety of goods 
in addition to meat eggs cheese butter and oil are under 
strict ration other products such as salami sausages flour corn 
meal toilet paper napkins wine and a coffee substitute are sold 
only in small quantities although not formally rationed 
random surveys of several butcher shops and grocery stores 
recently saw long lines for the single kind of cold cuts available 
a pink thickskinned salami 
in one butcher shop where customers waiting for deepfrozen 
chunks of unidentifiable meat overflowed into the street a 
shabbily dressed older woman complained loudly when told someone 
already had picked up her ration 
heat also remains scarce radiators in centrally heated 
buildings were on only five hours a day in early december and 
even then theyre only lukewarm said one resident hot water 
was available for three hours daily 
drivers are allotted about eight gallons of gasoline a month in 
some counties and although lights are somewhat brighter than in 
past winters bucharest remains dim compared even to other east 
european capitals 
compounding the hardships are mammoth construction projects 
decreed by ceausescu the last hardline soviet bloc leader in a 
drive to put his imprimature on what state media call the ceausescu 
epoch 
western estimates put a price tag of 2 billion on a 35mile 
canal completed in 1984 linking the danube above its estuary to the 
black sea 
most of the ships plying the canal are romanian and revenues 
from user fees have been modest as a result western diplomats say 
construction on another canal of the same magnitude that is to 
connect bucharest to the danube began in 1987

while an epidemic of drugrelated crime plagues 
detroit allegations of misuse of a secret police fund used to 
fight the drug war are threatening to topple the citys 
longrespected police chief 
william hart a former vice cop who has a dozen meritorious 
service awards in 37 years on the force has denied misusing the 
14 million fund used to pay informants and finance undercover 
drug buys in the nations seventhlargest city 
however records show that he signed checks totaling 72000 to 
californiabased companies that paid the rent on a beverly hills 
calif home occupied by his daughter and soninlaw a report in 
the detroit free press on tuesday said investigators found several 
checks written to cash and signed by hart 
the fbi and a federal grand jury are investigating the fund and 
a former civilian deputy chief whose whereabouts is unknown no one 
has been charged with a crime 
i had no idea that money was used to pay for a house in 
california michigan or ohio or anywhere else on earth the 
65yearold hart has said with god as my witness i swear i did 
not do that 
there have been many calls for hart to resign or at least step 
aside during the probe a recent poll of free press readers found 
79 percent in favor of hart resigning 
but mayor coleman young who is harts boss said he is standing 
behind the chief as he has often before young blamed the media 
for sensationalizing the story 
the man has been tried and convicted without even a chance of 
acquittal young said monday night at a news conference 
the city council voted last week to subpoena 49 checks from the 
fund after the police department barred auditor general roger short 
from seeing them the department has until dec 19 to surrender the 
records 
young has said he will not release the checks signed by hart 
which total more than 1 million the mayor said they might hamper 
confidential police operations 
young has assigned deputy police chief james d bannon to take 
over an internal police investigation that was begun by hart 
city officials say they are unsure if hart is involved with the 
alleged mismanagement of funds but they agree that the pending 
investigation could interfere with his job 
the police department was an issue in the recent mayoral 
election which young won handily challenger tom barrow said 
during the campaign that he would revamp the department and fire 
hart if elected 
the fbis investigation focuses on whether top police officials 
took money from the secret fund by diverting proceeds to dummy 
corporations owned by kenneth weiner a former civilian deputy 
police chief 
hart has blamed weiner for the misuse of the funds he said he 
made legal disbursements to weiner a former friend and that 
weiner used the funds illegally 
its that simple he stole money hart said 
weiner was in charge of performing sensitive security work for 
the city from 1980 to 1986 he left after an investigation into his 
involvement with speculative precious metals investments in which 
several wealthy detroit residents allegedly lost thousands of 
dollars 
a federal grand jury has subpoenaed records at the university of 
michigan in ann arbor where weiner worked as a parttime security 
consultant weiners trail has led from michigan to california to 
georgia 
the secret fund scandal further taints the police department 
which came under fire for drug use by officers 
nine of nearly 3000 police officers screened for drug use 
tested positive earlier this year the detroit board of police 
commissioners suspended six officers for having cocaine in their 
urine young said three others volunteered for drug treatment 
before being tested 
drug testing became an issue last year after an offduty police 
officer was shot to death outside a suspected crack house around 
the same time 14 other officers were suspended for using drugs

the word on the street is that georgette watsons 
head is worth 5000 if shes shot and doesnt die its 1000 
thats how badly street gangs want to get rid of the founder of 
dropadime a hot line that fields tips on drug pushers watson is 
under 24hour police surveillance and says she can accept that 
for now but she wont live in a fishbowl forever 
i want to be free she said wednesday they feel they can 
kill anyone who goes against their stance this is a fight not just 
for me but for the whole community if we take a stand now we 
wont have to pay later 
deputy superintendent william celester said police informants 
had received solid tips this week that local gang members had 
set a price on watsons life 
georgette watson has been getting various threats ever 
since she began to speak out about the drug dealers and everything 
else he said from time to time weve offered her police 
protection and shes always turned those offers down this time 
were insisting 
the idea of gang bounties is not particularly new tensions ran 
high this fall when similar threats were made on police officers 
patrolling this citys dorchester mattapan and roxbury 
neighborhoods 
georgette has become a symbol of the little person standing 
up celester said shes been out there standing up for the 
community and fighting back shes become a symbol that these gangs 
want to stop 
the 46yearold knows shes in danger but prefers not to think 
about it too much theres something broader and more important at 
stake she said 
theyre violating my freedom to take a stand she said we 
have to let them know that they will not control this community or 
control people they disagree with 
watson is willing temporarily to accept the constant presence of 
police the shadows of two officers parked outside her home each 
night shes willing to stay away from dropadime hot lines 
office and cancel speaking engagements 
but the mother of three says she knows who the kids are behind 
the bounty offer shes heard it on the streets and now shes using 
those same streets to put out a message of her own 
i want to talk to them watson said adding that her only 
conditions for the meeting are that it take place in a daylit 
neutral location and that two or three community escorts be present 
ive tried to go out there and meet with them and they refuse 
to meet with me she said id like to just go up there where 
they are with the whole comunity really send them a message 
since about nov 17 watson said a different message has been

thrilling children as santa claus was 
the delight of charlie cathers life so he will be buried in a 
santa suit 
for 20 years cather was known to children as santa charlie 
on tuesday the 65yearold retiree died of complications from 
diabetes that confined him to a huntsville hospital bed as the 
christmas season approached 
one of the last things he told me maybe a month ago was that 
he had to turn things around so he could get out and be santa claus 
again longtime friend yvonne meigs said 
being santa claus was one of his greatest delights in life 
and its so ironic that this had to happen at christmas when 
he was always there for everyone else 
in the spring and summer the retired shoe salesman volunteered 
for telethons and other community fundraisers playing santa at 
christmas in august parties for young fans of the huntsville 
stars baseball team and taking children with cerebral palsy to 
ballgames 
in the fall cather began touring with reindeer inc a 
huntsville company that shows reindeer throughout the nation 
before returning home to sit patiently in a shopping mall 
listening to whispered requests and assuring youngsters that santa 
was watching over them as christmas approached 
charlie believed in the spirit of love and generosity the 
kind of spirit that touches other peoples lives with kindness the 
kind of spirit that is santa claus the rev carl malm cathers 
pastor for the last 10 years said as he prepared for fridays 
funeral 
cather who was born in canton ohio brought his family to 
huntsville about 25 years ago 
driving his family home from a trip to guntersville in 1970 
cather lost his wife and two of four sons in a fatal wreck friends 
said he may have turned to santa claus to recover from the 
emotional impact of the tragedy 
as cathers hair turned naturally frosty he grew a white beard 
and his paunch expanded until it shook when he laughed 
he was santa claus because he never quit believing larry 
holder of reindeer inc recalled when you quit believing you get 
old and he never quit believing he had a gleam in his eye 
till the very end

a sea of gleaming brass bobbed in unison for 
a holiday concert that might best be described as like totally 
tubaular 
two hundred musicians clutching the imposing instruments offered 
the unusual merry tubachristmas program tuesday at the elegant 
dorothy chandler pavilion 
elephantine sousaphones were positioned at the top of a 
staircase below were doublebelled euphoniums smaller orchestral 
tubas and even an ophicleide an instrument that preceded the tuba 
more than 150 years ago 
i cant even hear myself but i know im playing said 
roland boyer 13 
santas hohoho seems most suitable for the deep throaty 
horns but the scores of tuba players made a joyful noise in the 
program organized by indiana university music professor harvey 
phillips who conceived of the idea in 1974 as a tribute to the 
great tuba composers

with the biggest case of their investigation 
fast approaching irancontra prosecutors are trying to turn oliver 
north into a witness for the government 
north said wednesday he does not want to testify against his 
former boss exnational security adviser john poindexter 
poindexter scheduled to go on trial jan 22 was the only one 
who didnt hang ollie north out to dry during the 
congressional irancontra hearings north said at a pretrial 
hearing in the poindexter case 
us district court judge harold greene will decide whether 
north was tainted by poindexters immunized congressional testimony 
and cannot testify at his criminal trial 
this is the fourth christmas that my family has had its door 
darkened by the independent counsels investigation and 
prosecution of the irancontra affair north complained 
north is not a friendly witness not to the independent 
counsel greene observed 
but prosecutors need norths testimony 
it was poindexter who directed north to step into a meeting with 
congressmen where he lied about assisting the contras 
well done poindexter said in a followup computer message 
after the aug 6 1986 meeting 
north suggested poindexter was unaware of norths false answers 
when the national security adviser who hadnt attended the 
meeting sent the computer message 
at one point during the seven hours of testimony from north this 
week irancontra prosecutor dan webb emphasized that poindexter 
had received a written summary of norths comments before sending 
the computer message poindexter is accused of obstructing congress 
in connection with the denials about contra assistance 
north watched as poindexter tore up a presidential finding on 
nov 20 1986 an aspect of four of the criminal charges against 
poindexter 
north quickly agreed with defense attorney richard beckler that 
he hadnt actually seen what document poindexter had torn up 
irancontra prosecutor michael bromwich brought out that the 
document destruction was preceded by poindexter and north 
discussing the finding the politically embarrassing document 
depicting the iran initiative as a straight armsforhostages deal 
referred to knowledge by the reagan administration of previous arms 
shipments to iran 
entering the fourth year of its investigation the office of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh has been forced to rely on a 
series of reluctant witnesses 
testimony from norths loyal secretary fawn hall was crucial 
to prosecutors in proving that north altered documents 
former cia employee glenn robinette was accused by prosecutors 
of giving misleading answers on a witness stand yet robinettes 
testimony was critical in the conviction of north for accepting a 
13800 home security system 
this week north said his perceptions of the irancontra affair 
had been influenced by poindexters capitol hill testimony given 
under a grant of immunity 
bromwich suggested north is falsely raising the taint issue so 
that he will be disqualified by the judge as a government witness 
in the poindexter case north denied it although he acknowledged 
i am familiar with the legal concept of taint 
north is raising the issue in the appeal of his three felony 
convictions in the irancontra scandal he contends his immunized 
testimony tainted the governments criminal case against him

unidentified assailants fired two 
rifle grenades thursday at a us government residential compound 
causing minor damage and no injuries us officials said 
there was no indication of who fired the grenades which 
exploded about noon at the seafront compound but the incident 
occurred following threats against us interests by rebel soldiers 
whose coup attempt failed last week 
a us embassy statement said the grenades were fired 
indiscriminately at the compound which includes the american 
club an embassy commissary and housing areas for embassy and 
military personnel 
embassy spokesman david andriessen said americans had been 
warned to avoid travel to the embassy compound and other us 
installations in the capital for the next few hours 
during the recent coup attempt hundreds of american families 
were evacuated to seafront to escape fighting between mutineers and 
government forces in the financial district makati 
rebels who sought to topple president corazon aquino expressed 
anger at the united states after american f4 phantom jets flew air 
cover for government forces on dec1 the first day of the coup 
attempt 
us jets did not fire a shot but their presence was considered 
crucial in turning the tide against mutineers who had launched air 
attacks against malacanang palace and military camps 
rebels gave up their last position saturday when about 400 
mutineers surrendered at an air base near cebu 350 miles south of 
the capital 
on wednesday defense secretary fidel ramos said remnants of the 
rebel force still retain the capability to launch terrorist 
attacks sabotage and assassination 
brig gen alexander aguirre chief of the capital command said 
there are indications that they are moving toward terrorism to 
continue the struggle against mrs aquino 
i hope they will be reasonable enough that they will be men of 
conscience aguirre said they should not resort to terrorist 
acts that will prejudice innocent lives

the aerospace industry is marking record sales 
but is braced for heavy weather in future years with the 
prospect of peaceful coexistence with the soviet union an industry 
leader says 
aerospace industries are likely to decline in sales volume over 
the next decade according to a yearend industry report by the 
aerospace industries association 
this years record sales are due primarily to delivery of 
military aircraft and related equipment that were ordered in 
previous years and to a boom in commercial airliner sales 
association president don fuqua said wednesday 
longrange declines are expected as a result of the prospect of 
peaceful coexistence with the soviet union and predicted defense 
budget cuts fuqua said much of the decline will be offset by 
gains in civil aviation and commercial space programs but the 
overall result will be a modest decline he said 
i do not minimize the impact on our industry of the defense 
spending cuts we know are coming fuqua said we are braced for 
heavy weather particularly among those aia member companies most 
deeply committed to defense work 
we do not expect impact of catastrophic dimension but rather a 
moderate decline in real inflationadjusted sales volume fuqua 
said the united states is not going to abdicate its global 
defense responsibilities nor is the defense industry going out of 
business 
the association also released the results of a survey which 
showed that 67 percent of its responding members including most of 
the countrys major aeronautical corporations have a shortage of 
scientists and engineers and 55 percent report a shortage of 
production workers more than 80 percent said they expect more 
shortages in the future 
the problem is made more serious by rapid changes in the 
technology needed in aerospace industries by a lack of young 
people preparing for jobs with a technological focus by the 
failure of women and minorities to choose such careers and by the 
fact that us students generally are doing poorly in science and 
math said the aia study 
fuqua and the report noted that us students dont measure up 
to their foreign counterparts in science and math and fewer are 
entering those fields 
the aerospace official predicted that defense sales will be 
significantly lower in the 1990s than in the decade just ending 
but he said were declining from an alltime peak 
the industry will set a sales record in 1989 of 1206 billion 
and aia is projecting another overall sales record next year of 
137 billion fuqua said 
he said the statistics are based mostly on deliveries because 
there is a long lead time between the time an order is placed and a 
major aerospace system is delivered 
the growing prospects for peaceful coexistence with the soviet 
union and the warsaw pact nations will exert an additional downward 
pressure on the defense budget fuqua said 
but that will be offset partly by other opportunities for 
aerospace manufacturers he said including development of the us 
space station new emphasis on space science and a technology 
effort for missions to the moon mars and other bodies of the solar 
system 
the expected upturn in 1990 arises mostly from a dramatic 
increase in commercial aircraft deliveries fuqua said jetliner 
manufacturers are several years behind on their orders 
market surveys suggest that airline traffic will double by the 
year 2005 and that the worlds airlines will need some 8500 new 
transports to handle the growth and replace older aircraft he 
said 
civil aircraft sales for 1989 will top 20 billion a record 
that will be broken next year when they will go beyond 32 billion 
fuqua said

a lawsuit in federal district court faults the 
social security administration for failing to establish a required 
homeless outreach program but the agency insists it has aggressive 
plans to reach the needy 
the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court for the 
district of columbia charges that the agency illegally failed to 
act on 1987 legislation requiring it to offer grants to states for 
demonstration programs to help the homeless obtain federal benefits 
the suit maintains that thousands of homeless people who are 
elderly or disabled are incapable of applying for the supplemental 
security income benefits to which they are entitled making it 
essential for the government to provide special outreach programs 
ssi provides a minimum income to 45 million lowincome blind 
aged and disabled people maximum monthly benefits are 368 for an 
individual and 553 for a couple this year rising to 386 and 
579 respectively in 1990 
an estimated 25 percent of the nations homeless are mentally 
disabled another 10 percent are physically disabled and 20 percent 
are elderly according to the lawsuit 
the suit was filed by the national law center on homelessness 
and poverty the states of michigan and massachusetts homeless 
washingtonian ramon willis rep fortney pete stark dcalif 
and two local organizations that offer help to the homeless 
social security spokesman phil gambino said the agency had not 
seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it directly 
however he stressed that social security commissioner gwendolyn 
king has been on the job just five months and is committed to an 
aggressive ssi outreach program to both the homeless as well as the 
aged and disabled 
gambino said mrs king had worked with congress to obtain a 3 
million appropriation for a broad outreach program in fiscal 1990 
that will include grants to states this program is not targeted 
exclusively toward the homeless but will include the homeless as 
well as other aged and disabled individuals he said 
congress authorized 125 million for fiscal 1988 and 25 
million for fiscal 1989 for homeless outreach the lawsuit charges 
that the department of health and human services of which the 
social security administration is a part decided on its own that 
congress had made a poor choice and that the outreach program was 
not needed 
the suit said michigan and massachusetts were ready willing 
and able to participate in a program with hhs to reach homeless 
people in those states 
it said willis is entitled to receive ssi benefits but has 
been unable to secure such benefits due to the physical and 
psychological trauma he has suffered as a result of his infection 
with the aids virus 
although he is very interested in applying for ssi benefits 
he knows nothing about the program and has no idea how to go about 
applying

attorney mb ben rustan tried to 
negotiate a 20year lease for his law office back in 1981 when he 
was 91 years old 
when he turned 99 he told a bank cashier he wanted to buy the 
longest term certificates of deposit possible 
rustan expected to be practicing law july 4 on his 100th 
birthday 
but the man who hung his law shingle in this iron range town of 
northwestern minnesota in 1918 died sunday of a heart seizure 
what made rustans achievements even more remarkable was the 
fact he was blind his eyes were removed when he was 5 as the 
result of spinal meningitis he wore glasses with frosted lenses 
but no one seems to mention his blindness until theyve talked 
about how dedicated to his job he was how meticulous in dress he 
was how serious he was 
he couldnt be considered an elder statesman because he never 
retired but he garnered that type of respect it was appropriate 
that his home address was 1 first st 
rustan suffered the seizure his first serious one nov 28 in a 
car on his way to work with his secretary 
he was buried wednesday 
he certainly was a credit to his profession longtime friend 
nick dasovich told the duluth newstribune theres one word to 
describe him sharp age didnt take a toll on his mind 
in all the years that he practiced law to the best of my 
knowledge he never had a dissatisfied client much less a 
malpractice claim said district judge john a spellacy of nearby 
grand rapids even had he not been blind he would have been 
considered an outstanding lawyer in all departments 
he never thought of himself as old maybe that was his 
secret said vicky shofner rustans secretary the past 17 years 
shofner said her boss worked a 40hour week and checked into the 
office on saturdays and sundays 
rustan worked mainly in real estate transactions transfers of 
deeds and titles when he went to the courtroom he took braille 
notes with a slate and stylus a picklike instrument that punches 
holes in paper held by the slate he dictated his documentation to 
shofner 
herb latvala president of first national bank worked with 
rustan on many matters 
i think the greatest service he provided for people around 
here were that his fees were so reasonable latvala said he 
never overcharged anyone people will miss him for many reasons

president bush in a gesture of personal 
solidarity for colombias battle against the drug cartels will 
join the leaders of the andean nations in cartagena colombia on 
feb 15 for a oneday summit on the drug war 
cartagena a port city 680 miles north of bogota is located in 
a medellin cartel stronghold in a country ravaged by bombings and 
assassinations since colombian president virgilio barco declared 
war on the drug traffickers three months ago 
the white house played down security concerns wednesday as it 
formally announced bushs plan to go to colombia 
we wont take him where it isnt safe said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
he insisted the security challenge in colombia is less 
formidable than at the annual economic summits with the major 
industrialized countries where seven heads of state require 
protection 
weve had heavy security lots of places fitzwater said 
the plan is for a oneday summit meaning neither bush nor his 
large entourage will require lodging in colombia fitzwater said it 
was always intended to be a oneday affair 
the drug terrorists are blamed for a bombing outside a police 
building in bogota last week that killed 63 a judge a prosecutor 
and a bank official were assassinated tuesday night in colombia 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson is currently 
leading a us delegation to the andean nations to lay the 
groundwork for the february meeting 
the other participants in addition to bush and barco will be 
president alan garcia of peru and president jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia 
on monday bush expressed determination to attend the south 
american summit but said i will not do anything imprudent 
praising barco for battling the drug cartel bush said i 
dont want to undermine the courageous stances hes taking and 
i dont want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should 
go to colombia because they cant be protected 
one top administration official said the drug summit probably 
will be held at a colombian naval base the official said that for 
better security the entire washington entourage including staff 
and reporters would remain at the same location instead of 
operating from a separate site than the talks as is often the case 
on presidential foreign trips 
earlier wednesday bush signed legislation authorizing 240 
million in aid for colombia bolivia and peru to help wage the 
fight against drugs in the region where most of the worlds cocaine 
is produced 
the legislation authorizes spending 115 million for narcotics 
control assistance and 125 million for military and law 
enforcement aid to the three countries 
the violence in colombia shows the drug cartels are entrenched 
and powerful international cooperation is essential if they are to 
be defeated and the united states in particular must be generous 
in providing assistance bush said 
the measure waives restrictions on using us foreign aid to 
train police 
meanwhile bushs drug policy chief william bennett labeled 
stupid and morally atrocious a call to legalize cocaine heroin 
and other illicit drugs 
us district judge robert h sweet a former republican 
prosecutor made the proposal in a speech in new york joining such 
figures as former secretary of state george shultz in arguing that 
prohibition has failed and legalizing drugs would curb the violence 
it doesnt make any sense responded bennett 
elsewhere sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee proposed a 1 billion research effort to find 
medical ways to reduce addicts craving for cocaine and other drugs 
also a gallup poll released wednesday said 60 percent of 
american workers favor drug testing by their firms the poll 
released by the institute for a drugfree workplace said 24 
percent reported they had seen or heard of drug use by coworkers 
on the job while 31 percent said such use occurred outside 
business hours 
the institute includes 14 large corporations concerned about 
employer rights in battling drug abuse 
the gallup organization interviewed a random sample of 1007 
fulltime workers around the nation last month including 
professional blue collar and clerical workers the survey had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 31 percent

two agriculture department economists say 
subsidized sales of wheat have helped boost the volume of wheat 
sold overseas and have generally been good for farmers 
but the net financial gain has not been large because of the 
costs to carry out the subsidies under the export enhancement 
program or eep which began in 1985 
analysis shows that us wheat exports prices and gross 
export revenues rose due to the eep the report said the gain 
in export revenues slightly exceeded the value to the us 
government of the commodities offered as bonuses 
under the program designated foreign countries can buy 
specified us commodities wheat has been the main item at 
prices lower than otherwise would be charged the private exporters 
then are given surplus commodities held by usda to make up for the 
lower prices charged the foreign buyers 
as of dec 7 since the program began a total of 872 million 
metric tons of grain have been sold overseas under eep 
arrangements wheat made up 655 million tons of the total 
overall the commodities sold were valued at more than 92 
billion the subsidies or bonuses cost 264 billion 
the report by the departments economic research service 
compared several research studies of eep in an attempt to sort out 
the programs contribution to wheat exports during 198588 
us prices rose slightly due to the eep the report said 
higher wheat prices improved market earnings for us wheat 
growers and reduced government outlays for direct income payments 
to us farmers 
one of the studies reviewed by usda economists ann hillberg 
seitzinger and philip l paarlberg showed that the volume of wheat 
exports rose 2 percent to 3 percent early in the eep campaign 
another showed an increase of 20 percent from june 1986 to may 
1987 and one put the wheat export increase at 10 percent to 30 
percent from july 1986 to june 1987 gains of 12 percent to 14 
percent and one of 7 percent through may 1988 also were cited 
one of the purposes of the program was to counteract similar 
subsidized exports by the european economic community 
eep wheat sales to some countries replaced unsubsidized 
commercial sales the report said competitors displaced from 
markets targeted for eep sales sometimes moved into other markets 
where the united states previously had been a major supplier 
the analysis said that increases in us wheat exports and 
market prices resulted in larger gross export revenues 
but net us export revenues changed only slightly once the 
value of the commodities from government inventories awarded to 
exporters under the eep was weighed against the benefits to wheat 
exports and prices the report said

the head of a house armed services 
investigative panel contends the navy irresponsibly rushed to 
judgment in citing gunners mate clayton hartwig as likely to blame 
for the uss iowa shipboard explosion 
summing up two days of hearings on the blast that killed 47 
sailors rep nicholas mavroules dmass told vice adm joseph s 
donnell iii youve pointed your finger when theres that little 
chance the blast could have been accidental 
wouldnt it have been better off to say we dont know 
mavroules asked the vice admiral 
we believe we do know donnell said alluding to the navys 
finding that hartwig most likely caused the blast by inserting some 
type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 
16inch guns 
i find it quite irresponsible that the navy would issue a 
report on a probable cause rather than have the documented evidence 
that they can prove mavroules said 
mavroules made the statement after hartwigs onetime friend and 
shipmate kendall truitt testified with the backing of another 
sailor that he thought the gunturret explosion was an accident 
clayton michael hartwig did not cause the explosion truitt 
said i do not think he committed suicide i believe the report 
is very misleaing 
its a big coverup in my opinion he said clayton 
hartwig was not the suicidal freak they make him out to be 
as members of hartwigs family looked on truitt and petty 
officer john mullahy disputed the navys finding citing personal 
observations about hartwig and concerns about technical problems 
aboard the iowa 
mullahy said that on the night before the explosion he and 
hartwig discussed his impending transfer to london and the seaman 
even made a list of the items he needed to buy 
in addition hartwig didnt learn until the morning of the blast 
that he was going to be at the center gun in the no 2 turret so 
there would have been not time for planning a suicide truitt 
said 
mullahy and truitt were part of the crew engaged in the firing 
exercises that day both repeated the last words of petty officer 
eric lawrence who was in the center gun position with hartwig 
he lawrence wouldnt have had as his last words im not 
ready to fire yet weve got a problem in here truitt said 
he would have said hey excuse me guys he put a bomb in 
here truitt said 
it tells me the situation was not dangerous was not 
lifethreatening if clay was going to blow up the ship lawrence 
would have stopped him they were literally standing shoulder to 
shoulder 
truitt said his theory is that the blast was caused by a 
defective hydraulic rammer the piece of equipment used to shove 
the powder bags up against the projectile 
he said he had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in no 2 
gun turret about a year earlier describing it as behaving like a 
transmission stuck between neutral and drive he theorized that the 
rammer might have suddenly taken off putting too much pressure 
on the propellant 
mullahy who has served in the navy for 19 years and was 
assigned to the iowa in december 1988 said a possible explanation 
for the explosion could be found in the world war iiera gun powder 
bags that were improperly stored 
navy officers have said that while some safety lapses were 
discovered in the course of the investigation there was no 
substantial risk involving the 16inch guns and the powder used to 
fire them 
during the course of the hearing mullahy said hartwig and 
truitt did not talk to each other for several months although 
truitt was the beneficiary on hartwigs 101000 life insurance 
policy 
they hated each other mullahy said 
nevertheless hartwig never had truitt removed as the 
beneficiary on the policy truitt said that in settlement of the 
policy claim he gave hartwigs family 2500 his lawyer 40000 
and kept the rest

american telephone amp telegraph co wants to 
make it easier for americans to reach out and touch someone in the 
soviet union 
atampt said wednesday that if the federal communications 
commission approves it will start routing operatorassisted 
direct dialed data and video services onto the soviet intersputnik 
satellite system for the first time 
atampt currently has the only western phone facilities to the 
soviet union with other long distance companies leasing space on 
atampt lines the traffic is carried on 32 circuits by undersea cable 
and land lines as well as the intelsat satellite consortium 
despite these links which since last month has included atampt 
direct dial service to moscow demand still far exceeds existing 
capacity the phone company said 
atampt plans to add 24 more circuits in january and the 
proposal we made today could add as many as 150 additional 
circuits atampt spokesman herb linnen said 
the plan would require construction of a new 1 million antenna 
at atampts roaring creek earth station near catawissa pa linnen 
said 
it would take six months to construct the antenna which then 
would be aimed at an intersputnik satellite located in a 
geostationary orbit 22300 miles above a point just off the coast 
of liberia 
intersputnik is a consortium of 15 socialist countries that 
provides satellitedelivered communications among its member 
nations currently cable news network uses intersputnik for 
satellite news feeds linnen noted 
in a letter to president bush announcing its new plan atampt 
chairman robert allen said expanded communications capacity will 
result in direct economic benefits to the united states as we 
expand world trade through commercial relationships with eastern 
europe 
linnen said presidential approval was not needed for the plan 
which he said did not involve any national security issues such as 
transferring hightech equipment to communist nations 
he said the plan which was negotiated over the past 12 months 
was forwarded to bush as a matter of courtesy given bushs 
statements since the malta summit on improving ussoviet 
relations 
an atamptintersputnik link would be a blow to intelsat the 
117nation satellite cooperative that handles the bulk of 
international telephone traffic intelsat recently launched the 
first of a series of five new satellites it plans to put aloft over 
the next two years to handle increasing international 
communications traffic 
atampt said the soviets prefer using their own satellites for 
additional circuits because moscow then incurs expenses solely 
within the soviet union payable in rubles rather than in western 
currencies rubles are not traded officially in international money 
markets 
intelsat officials would not comment wednesday 
under the proposal atampt and the soviets would continue to use 
intelsat for some circuits and would split future increases in 
demand for circuits among undersea cables intelsat satellites and 
intersputnik satellites

the recent shutdown of the nations only 
producer of purified plutonium for nuclear weapons could last two 
months or longer energy secretary james d watkins says 
in his most specific comments about the rocky flats plants 
outlook since it completed a phased closure of plutonium operations 
earlier this month watkins said wednesday it was too early to set 
a date for restarting the troubled facility 
i hope well be back on in a couple of months he told 
reporters during a break in a hearing on national energy policy 
options 
the indefinite shutdown was considered necessary to review 
safety procedures and to perform an annual plant plutonium 
inventory a restart date is expected to be announced next month 
outside inspectors have raised many safetyrelated questions 
about rocky flats operations in recent weeks the fbi in june 
raided the plant located near denver to search for evidence of 
possible criminal violations of environmental laws 
the plants future is further jeopardized by the accumulation of 
plutonium wastes beyond a 1600 cubic yard limit set by colorado 
gov roy romer the limit is projected to be reached in april 1990 
and rocky flats may have to be closed down then unless watkins can 
find another site to store the excess waste 
in response to reporters questions watkins said the current 
closure at rocky flats would not give him more time to resolve the 
waste storage problem unless the shutdown lasted more than about 
two months that is because the plutonium inventory itself will 
result in more waste than if the plant were operating normally 
watkins said 
its a wash on waste accumulation if the shutdown is for 
two months he said 
if the closure lasts longer the waste problem could be eased 
but watkins has asserted that a lengthy shutdown of rocky flats 
would endanger us national security because it is the only source 
of purified plutonium for warheads 
in a related development wednesday an energy department 
advisory panel told watkins there appears to be acceptable 
confidence that a longdelayed permanent dump for the rocky flats 
wastes can meet national environmental standards 
the waste isolation pilot plant an underground waste repository 
near carlsbad nm is supposed to be the longrange answer to 
plutonium waste disposal but it has been repeatedly delayed by 
political and scientific uncertainties 
the advisory panel told watkins in a letter released wednesday 
that he should go ahead with plans to put limited amounts of 
plutonium waste in the repository for testing purposes as soon as 
he is confident that environmental standards eventually can be met 
watkins has said the new mexico facility will not open at least 
until next july

the bush administration is pumping 200 
million into a loan package to carry poland beyond the christmas 
season and challenging wealthy nations to make good on promises of 
aid to warsaw and hungary 
trying to bolster the process of democratic reforms in eastern 
europe secretary of state james a baker iii said pledges alone 
arent enough 
baker speaking in brussels to a gathering of two dozen foreign 
ministers joined the white house in announcing a 200 million 
contribution to a multination 500 million loan for poland as it 
awaits a comprehensive aid package from the international monetary 
fund 
the loan reflects support for polands economic reform program 
designed to restore sustained growth said deputy presidential 
press secretary stephen hart 
other countries contributing are belgium canada west germany 
france italy japan the netherlands sweden switzerland and 
britain the treasury department said 
the loan is in addition to a previously announced 1 billion 
stabilization fund for poland the united states is contributing a 
200 million grant for that 
in addition president bush last month signed a 938 million aid 
package over three years for poland and hungary most of the money 
is earmarked for warsaw 
referring to the fall of hardline communist governments in 
eastern europe baker said it is our task to support this 
courageous reform effort 
after the streets empty of demonstrators after the people 
select new leaders after governments become the servants of the 
people after all this the economies must put food on the table 
and goods on the shelves of stores he said 
the foreign ministers in brussels committed their governments to 
a coordinated assistance program valued at up to 6 billion over 
the next several years 
most of the aid will be in the form of investment and trade 
credits not to be paid out immediately 
on capitol hill agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter said 
that more than money poland needs a westernstyle legal system 
accounting system banking system marketing and distribution 
systems and the private ownership of assets 
poland will not be able to attract foreign investment until 
the institution building takes place said yeutter who recently 
led a highlevel us delegation to warsaw to assess its economic 
needs 
as important as all of our aid programs may be poland really 
needs people help institutional help more than it needs monetary 
assistance yeutter said without that it will be wasted it 
will be money lost 
he testified before the senate foreign relations committee 
speaking to reporters later yeutter acknowledged that some 
assistance will be of help in helping poland to deal with its 
immediate problems 
but its not just a matter of throwing money at poland he 
said the situation in poland and the rest of eastern europe is 
not comparable to western europe immediately after world war ii 
when the united states organized the marshall plan to spur economic 
recovery 
contrary to yeutters testimony economist john kenneth 
galbraith told the senate panel that a marshall plan is precisely 
what is needed and needed soon 
there is a notion as regards poland as also regards to the 
soviet union and other socialist countries that such is the magic 
of the market that a movement in that direction will produce 
immediate and quite wonderful results 
this to put it bluntly is idiot ideology he said

some disliked their roles others were too young 
to remember theirs but 10 surviving cast members of gone with 
the wind are excited about the hoopla surrounding the classics 
50th anniversary celebration 
thank god i had a part in it said ric holt who played beau 
wilkes son of melanie and ashley wilkes 
the civil war sagas lone surviving star olivia de havilland 
who played melanie was at wednesdays reunion in spirit 
de havilland who lives in paris sent her warmest 
salutations to the reunion in a letter read by a tearful rand 
brooks who played charles hamilton 
she signed the letter melanie hamilton wilkes and asked brooks 
to remember her to the cast especially the several beau 
wilkeses and my fond eternal greetings to the sole representative 
of the hamilton clan 
anyone who had read the book sensed they were into something 
that would belong to the ages and everyone was in a frenzy to read 
the book said ann rutherford who won the role of scarlett 
oharas youngest sister carreen because judy garland was filming 
the wizard of oz 
the specialness of this is with each generation of young 
people who are touched by gone with the wind she said as 
long as there are little children there will always be a mickey 
mouse on an adult version gone with the wind does that 
the cast members were in town for the weeklong anniversary fete 
of the movies dec 15 1939 world premiere in atlanta the 
movies repremiere is scheduled for friday 
at the reunion were butterfly mcqueen who portrayed the slave 
prissy patrick curtis and mickey kuhn who played beau wilkes at 
various ages gregg geiss who played bonnie blue butler 
scarletts and rhetts daughter as an infant evelyn keyes who 
played suellen ohara cammie king conlon who portrayed bonnie 
blue as a child and fred crane who as brent tarleton spoke the 
movies opening lines 
mcqueen whose portrayal of the flighty maid who didnt know 
nothing bout birthing babies won her acclaim said she sometimes 
hated her role because she thought it demeaning to blacks 
to me it was just a job but at times i hated the role she 
said 
ms mcqueen was typecast as a domestic in such films as since 
you went away and mildred pierce but finally refused such 
roles saying they were an embarrassment 
brooks also said he despised his part as scarletts 
mildmannered husband 
it was an asinine part he said i wanted to be more 
macho 
geiss who won the part of the baby bonnie blue despite being a 
boy because of his blue eyes said he was 10 days old during the 
filming but still knew at an early age how significant the movie 
was 
ms keyes now an author and scriptwriter said it is ironic 
that although she has appeared in more than 40 films including 
the jolson story she is unable to get away from gone with 
the wind 
i wrote my second book about me and my publisher wanted to 
name it scarlett oharas younger sister i said but its not 
about gone with the wind and he said thats all im known for 
she said laughing 
ms rutherford concurred that no matter what else the cast has 
done our obituary will say we were in gone with the wind and 
well be proud of it 
though long dead gone with the wind stars clark gable and 
vivien leigh rhett and scarlett producer david o selznick and 
author margaret mitchell were remembered fondly by cast members 
ms conlon calling gable kind of a daddy remembered that 
gables mustache scratched when he kissed me my mothers friends 
swooned when they heard that 
ms rutherford recalled that the night of the premiere ms 
mitchell invited the cast to her atlanta home for scrambled eggs 
gable and ms mitchell disappeared 
clark gable and margaret were hiding in the bathroom clark on 
the edge of the tub and margaret you know where just talking 
she chuckled they had to get away from the photographers

the white house agrees to propose a funding 
increase of at least 35 percent next year for the preschool head 
start program for lowincome children according to a government 
source 
the final figure for president bushs proposed 1991 budget is 
still being worked out and could go higher but the source said the 
white house has agreed to seek at least 49 million more for the 
139 billion program 
the department of health and human services had proposed such an 
increase in head start funding for the fiscal year beginning oct 
1 1990 the office of management and budget has agreed to propose 
a minimum increase of 49 million said an hhs source who spoke 
wednesday on the condition of anonymity 
bush is to send his proposed 1991 spending plan to congress on 
jan 22 
congress approved 139 billion for head start for the current 
fiscal year 99 million less than the administration had sought 
head start a nutrition health screening and education program 
that helps prepare lowincome children for school is the only 
major unresolved budget issue between the department and the white 
house budget office said sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
agreement has been reached to propose trimming growth in 
medicare spending by about 9 billion without any changes in 
payment schedules the program is projected to cost 130 billion in 
the next fiscal year but the administration will propose cutting 
that to about 121 billion sources said 
secretary louis sullivan fared well in negotiations with omb on 
the national institutes of health and spending for aids 
the department had proposed raising the nih budget to 72 
billion next year while omb wanted to freeze spending at this 
years level around 66 billion the final figure will be over 
7 billion the hhs source said 
aids spending will be proposed at around 17 billion the 
source said sullivan had sought 176 billion omb initially 
wanted to keep spending at the 16 billion congress approved for 
this year which was slightly less than the administration had 
sought 
one recommendation that sullivan lost was to require states to 
expand medicaid coverage to cover all pregnant women and infants 
with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line governors have 
called for the federal government to hold the line on medicaid 
expansions 
the reductions in projected medicare growth would be achieved by 
trimming increases in payments to hospitals and physicians but hhs 
officials say benefits under the program would not be affected 
hospitals would take the largest hit sources say the 
administrations proposal would chop more than 35 billion from 
projected payment schedules for hospitals including about 15 
billion less for capital equipment reimbursements and 1 billion 
less in payments to teaching hospitals which receive more money 
than other hospitals to compensate for their costs in training 
physicians 
michael bromberg executive director of the federation of 
american health systems which represents private hospitals said 
congress is unlikely to accept such large cutbacks in hospital 
payments 
they went so far in these numbers that theres going to be a 
pretty quick reaction against it he said 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said she has gotten 27 republican 
senators to sign a letter telling bush that any proposal to make 
significant cuts in the medicare hospital program is likely to face 
serious opposition on capitol hill 
rep bill archer rtexas ranking member on the house ways and 
means committee is circulating a similar letter among 
representatives

an independent counsel says he will not seek 
to retry charges of illegal lobbying against former white house 
aide lyn c nofziger now that the supreme court has refused to 
reinstate his conviction 
james c mckay the special prosecutor said in a statement he 
has decided not to proceed further with prosecution of 
nofziger once a top aide to thenpresident reagan 
on monday the supreme court let stand without comment a us 
circuit court of appeals ruling that overturned the conviction 
mckay said his decision was prompted by the lapse of time since 
events involving nofziger and by the appeals courts interpretation 
of the ethics in government act of 1978 
in these circumstances mckay concluded that the substantial 
expenditure of public funds that would be required to reconstitute 
his office and prosecute nofziger further would be unwarranted 
the statement said 
nofziger who served as white house political director from 1981 
until early 1982 was convicted in 1988 of violating the ethics in 
government act 
the legislation imposes a oneyear ban on lobbying former 
colleagues after a person leaves service in the federal 
governments executive branch 
nofziger was sentenced to 90 days in jail and fined 30000 for 
lobbying top presidential aides within a year of his resignation on 
behalf of three private clients the scandalplagued wedtech corp 
a maritime workers union and the fairchild corp 
but the appeals court in a 21 decision overturned the 
conviction last june the court said the indictment should have 
been dismissed because it did not charge nofziger with having 
knowingly lobbied on matters in which white house officials 
possessed a direct and substantial interest 
mckay said he was disappointed the supreme court did not review 
the governments interpretation of the ethics act he said he 
believed the justice department had understood the statute 
correctly while the appeals court wrongly decided to overturn 
the nofziger conviction

a south carolina pillow factory accused of 
hiring more than 100 illegal aliens including a 12yearold boy 
is being fined a record 580000 by immigration officials 
the 12yearold was earning 4 to 5 an hour doing menial labor 
said thomas p fischer head of the immigration and naturalization 
service office in atlanta 
working conditions for three mexican boys including the 
12yearold and two 15yearolds almost bordered on bondage when 
you look at the age of these people fischer said they were 
being paid in cash there was no documentation 
the boys were among 85 illegal aliens from mexico and peru found 
working at the piedmont quilting corp in walhalla sc during a 
july 17 raid fischer said 
the administrative fine is the largest imposed by ins under a 
1986 law that bars employers from hiring illegal aliens it was 
announced a day after the company its owners and nine managers 
were indicted on charges of illegally recruiting and harboring 117 
illegal aliens 
the criminal indictment returned tuesday in greenville sc 
was based on evidence that the company had employed 32 illegal 
aliens in addition to those found during the raid fischer said 
plant owner alfred mizhir 55 and his wife gail mizhir 30 
both of spring lake nj face possible prison terms of 653 years 
and fines totaling 51 million if convicted on all charges 
the nine other indicted company managers or officers also each 
face up to 653 years in prison if convicted 
the criminal charges resulted from a sixmonth investigation 
which included the use of an undercover ins agent who posed as a 
plant worker fischer said 
fischer said working conditions were unsafe for children who 
are not mature enough to understand the danger posed by large 
machinery and 150pound bales of fabric used to make pillows 
quilts and comforters 
if something goes wrong do you think that a 12yearold is 
going to complain or quit he is going to shut his mouth fischer 
said 
the company refused to comment on the charges or the civil fine 
which it has 30 days to contest 
there is no comment said a woman who answered the telephone 
at the factory she refused to identify herself 
the administrative fine also covers the companys failure to 
comply with procedures to verify that more than 400 employees were 
not illegal aliens fischer said

a special prosecutor has been appointed to 
investigate a report of a rape at the governors mansion and gov 
george mickelson said the investigation is causing agony for his 
family 
the special prosecutor craig kennedy said wednesday he expects 
the pierre police department to complete its investigation into the 
rape report within the next few days 
well make a decision on what legal steps are appropriate 
after weve received the results and completed the investigation 
said kennedy who is the yankton county states attorney 
kennedy and other officials refused to discuss details of the 
allegations 
police received a report on nov 30 alleging that there had been 
a forcible rape at the mansion two days earlier a statement on a 
police log sheet said four boys at mansion raped her 
the republican governor was in washington at a us department 
of agriculture conference on nov 28 his wife linda was in texas 
at the time 
the mickelsons 17yearold son david a senior at riggs high 
school is the only other family member who is a permanent resident 
of the mansion the mickelsons two older children do not live in 
pierre 
asked whether david was traveling with either parent on nov 28 
mickelson press secretary gretchen lord anderson replied we 
dont feel that where david was is relevant 
mickelson has not met with reporters since the rape was reported 
in a statement wednesday the governor and mrs mickelson said 
they were pleased that the local prosecutor has said preliminary 
indications are that no rape took place at the governors residence 
our family is going through one of the most agonizing times we 
have ever experienced we have always held closely to the principle 
that it is not how you fall that counts the most but how you get 
up and carry on the mickelsons said 
we very much appreciate the compassion which so many people 
have expressed to us during this difficult period and we ask your 
continued prayers and understanding the statement said 
hughes county states attorney mark moreno said he appointed a 
special prosecutor because he wanted to avoid the appearance of any 
impropriety or conflict of interest 
moreno said one of his law partners mark barnett intends to 
run for attorney general next year he said another law partner has 
represented the family of one of the people involved in the case 
when moreno acknowledged the investigation was being conducted 
earlier this week he said from what pierre police have told me 
preliminary indications are that there was not a rape at the 
mansion 
kennedy who has six years experience as a prosecutor said he 
hasnt seen any written report on the case but has talked 
informally with investigating police officers 
the special prosecutor said the fact that hes a democrat and 
the governor is a republican wont affect his handling of the 
investigation 
im going to handle this case like i would any other and 
political affiliation has nothing to do with it kennedy said

the race for president is getting 
seamier as it gets closer with the former girfriend of one 
candidate accusing him of hating blacks and trying to bribe her 
into having an abortion 
the latest public opinion polls say the candidate socialist 
luis inacio lula da silva has drawn nearly even with rightist 
opponent fernando collor de mello in the last days before sundays 
election 
an estimated 250000 brazilians gathered in rio for a da silva 
rally on wednesday the biggest political turnout of the campaign 
i will unmask collor on national tv and show brazil that he is 
the greatest political lie this country has ever seen da silva 
told the crowd referring to a nationally televised debate to be 
held tonight 
meanwhile collor de mello concluded his campaign with a 
rainshortened rally in the southeastern city of belo horizonte he 
told about 12000 people he would save the country from the 
dictatorial candidate of the workers party 
this leftist will not turn the green and yellow colors of our 
flag red collor de mello said 
candidate rhetoric isnt the only blunt talk in the campaign on 
tuesday and wednesday collor de mellos organization had 
commercials broadcast showing a former da silva girlfriend 
he ruined my life miriam cordeiro says 
ms cordeiro said da silva couldnt stand blacks most of 
brazils 150 million people are black or mixedrace 
she also accuses him of offering her money to have an abortion 
the candidate says his daughter lurian now 15 was born after 
an affair with ms cordeiro following the death of his first wife 
in 1969 
he offered me money to get an abortion ms cordeiro said in 
the spot when she was born i put her in his lap and said now 
go ahead and kill her because when she was in my belly i wouldnt 
let you 
da silva in his own tv spot wednesday was shown standing 
beside lurian lurian was the product of a gesture of love he 
said 
after his affair with ms cordeiro da silva married marisa 
leticia the widow of a slain taxi driver 
ms cordeiro says in the spot that her testimony was voluntary 
but a former campaign worker for collor de mello claims the woman 
was paid about 23000 
the brazilian press has roundly condemned collor de mellos 
tactics 
da silvas campaign coordinator vladimir pomar called the 
interview a low blow 
analysts say collor de mello a 40yearold advocate of a free 
market has assumed a rightwing posture of late and turned the 
campaign into an ideological showdown in an attempt to depict da 
silva as the radical leader of a backward party 
the tactic is seen as a response to polls showing da silva 
gaining ground 
a poll taken this week by the respected datafolha institute 
showed collor de mello with 46 percent da silva with 45 percent 
and 6 percent undecided 
datafolha interviewed 5250 voters the margin of error was 3 
percent 
a poll released wednesday by the toledo and associates 
institute based on interviews this week with 4073 people said 
447 percent supported collor de mello and 442 favored da silva 
the margin of error was 2 percent 
just 10 days ago collor de mello led by 15 points 
sundays election is a runoff the two candidates were the top 
votegetters in a 21candidate field in the first round on nov 15 
analysts say da silvas campaign took off last week after a 
strong performance during a nationally televised debate with collor 
de mello 
da silva also gained votes by airing effective television ads 
and by consolidating his support among other prominent leftwing 
politicians 
the election is brazils first popular balloting for president 
since 1960 when janio quadros was elected he resigned after seven 
months in office and three years later the armed forces took power 
and ruled the country until 1985 
civilian president jose sarney was chosen by an electoral 
college controlled by the generals

aids patients blood contains hundreds of times 
more virus than doctors once thought and a single aidstainted 
syringe may carry enough to cause 700 infections according to a 
study published today 
until now the amount of aids virus in victims bodies seemed 
strangely low considering the ravages it inflicts but new 
measurements show those estimates were wrong and the actual levels 
are very high 
in the typical aids patients blood the virus infects one in 
400 of the broad class of white blood cells known as lymphocytes 
and monocytes previously scientists believed the virus had 
penetrated just one in 100000 
the answers were quite surprising said dr david d ho who 
directed the project we found that the levels within the blood 
cells were orders of magnitude higher 
the study also found that even when infected people seem well 
the virus produces new copies of itself that float freely outside 
of cells in the blood plasma this finding challenges the widely 
held belief that the infection frequently lies dormant for years 
after the initial infection 
hos research at cedarssinai medical center in los angeles was 
published in todays new england journal of medicine along with a 
related paper by dr robert w coombs and colleagues from the 
university of washington 
because the level of virus in infected people had seemed to be 
so low some researchers have questioned whether the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv really causes aids 
in an accompanying editorial drs david baltimore and mark b 
feinberg of the whitehead institute for biomedical research said 
the latest data should dispel any lingering doubts about whether 
hiv is the true culprit in aids 
ho said the amount of virus in victims bodies may be high 
enough to account for all the damage seen in acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
a few years ago we were struggling with the apparent dilemma 
that we have a lot of immune destruction and yet very little virus 
to account for that destruction said ho therefore people in 
the field are looking for indirect mechanisms by which the immune 
system is damaged maybe if we have this much virus present we 
could think more about the direct consequences of virus infection 
as a major contributor toward immune deficiency 
dr william haseltine of the dana farber cancer institute agreed 
and said the research demonstrates the importance of virusfighting 
drugs 
the most important implication is that antiviral drugs are in 
fact the right approach he said there were people who 
suspected that the primary disorder was caused by autoimmunity it 
very much looks now like its a direct effect of the virus 
hos study calculated the number of infective doses in tainted 
blood one infective dose contains perhaps 1000 or so individual 
aids viruses and is enough to infect a tissue culture 
his study found that one pint of blood from an aids patient 
contains 18 million infective doses while blood from someone who 
carries the aids virus but is free of symptoms contains 15000 
infective doses 
these values clearly show why the transfusion of contaminated 
blood results in an extremely high rate of hiv1 infection among 
recipients the report concluded 
blood banks routinely screen donations for signs of infection 
and transmission of aids through blood transfusions is rare 
however the virus is still being spread by dirty syringes shared 
among drug addicts the researchers estimated that a contaminated 
syringe could carry between onehalf and 700 infective doses 
depending on the amount of tainted blood left behind and the stage 
of the infection in the previous user 
health workers who accidentally prick themselves with needles 
also risk infection the researchers calculate that a needle 
contaminated with the infected blood of someone who is free of aids 
symptoms would carry sixhundredths of an infective dose while a 
needle from someone with aids symptoms could carry seven infective 
doses 
one infective dose can cause an aids infection in a test tube 
under ideal laboratory conditions while this also could be enough 
to cause a human infection ho said that exposure to 10 or 15 
infective doses may be necessary to reliably spread the virus

guerrillas of plo chairman yasser arafats 
fatah faction mounted a predawn raid against syrian troops in 
south lebanon thursday police said at least 10 combatants were 
killed and 15 wounded 
the raiders estimated at 150 stormed and ransacked the 
threestory headquarters of the syrian garrison commander in the 
twohour foray that started from sidons ein elhilweh refugee camp 
at 3 am police said 
the attackers used jeepmounted recoilless guns shoulderfired 
rocketpropelled grenades and ak47 assault rifles in the attack 
according to police 
it is the first assault they have ever staged against the 
syrian army across the awali river said a police spokesman who 
cannot be named under standing regulations 
the syrians are moving troops and armor to the area 
apparently to counterattack the situation is frightening the 
spokesman added 
the river on the northern edge of sidon provincial capital of 
south lebanon is 40 miles north of the israeli border and nearly 
25 miles south of beirut 
israel which invaded lebanon in 1982 to drive out arafats 
guerrillas from his main west beirut redoubt made it plain when it 
withdrew from sidon in 1983 that it would not tolerate any syrian 
military presence south of the awali river 
arafat has been on loggerheads with syrian president hafez assad 
since his army backed palestinian dissidents in 1983 who forced 
arafat to evacuate lebanons northern port of tripoli where he had 
set up command after his expulsion from beirut 
arafats palestine liberation organization guerrillas filtered 
back in the last three years and western military sources estimate 
their strength in the sidon region at about 5000 hardcore fighters 
the police spokesman said fatah raiders punched three miles 
north from their base in sidons ein elhilweh refugee camp to 
attack the syrian commanders headquarters on south lebanons 
coastal highway 
the fate of the commander col ziad could not be determined 
but his top assistant maj ali was among those killed the 
spokesman said 
also killed were three militiamen of the leftist nasserite 
organization the sunni moslem group that has ruled sidon since the 
1975 outbreak of lebanons civil war the three were manning a 
checkpoint on the awali bridge

a former janitor who spent nine years 
on death row and came within six days of execution says an 
appellate court decision to set aside his murder conviction has 
made this christmas as bright as can be 
in a 63 decision the texas court of appeals on wednesday said 
38yearold clarence brandley did not get a fair trial when an 
allwhite jury convicted him of the 1980 strangulation and rape of 
cheryl fergeson 
the 16yearold white girl was killed while attending a 
volleyball tournament at conroe high school where brandley who is 
black was a janitor 
brandleys first trial ended with a hung jury his attorneys 
contended the conviction in the second trial was racially motivated 
the appellate court called miss fergesons slaying both 
senseless and tragic but it added our outrage over her murder 
cannot justify the subversion of justice that took place during 
the investigation which ultimately affected the trial of her 
accused perpetrator 
montgomery county district attorney peter speers said he was 
disappointed with the courts ruling 
i felt the conviction should have been upheld said speers 
who planned a news conference today to discuss whether he will 
pursue a third trial 
brandley heard of the courts decision on death row at the 
department of corrections ellis unit 
this will make this christmas as bright as can be it was 
worth the wait brandley said from the visiting area its been 
a long time im very thankful i didnt know what it was going to 
when it was going to be 
its a prayer thats been answered its going to take some 
time to sink in to soak in 
the appellate court said investigators failed to follow up leads 
from witnesses and failed to take blood and hair samples from other 
janitors who had been brandleys chief accusers the judges said 
the investigators provided an opportunity for a common account of 
the killing from the janitors threatened witnesses and lost 
evidence 
three white janitors testified during the first trial that they 
had seen brandley follow miss fergeson to a restroom but when one 
of the men recanted his testimony he was not called to testify in 
the second trial 
brandleys attorney mike degeurin said he would ask the court 
to set a 10000 personal recognizance bond for his client and he 
hoped brandley would be home for christmas 
the appeals court refused wednesday afternoon to set bond but 
degeurin said he had also filed a similar motion in district court 
in galveston 
thank you jesus said brandleys mother minnie ola 
brandley when told of the courts decision pray for us and 
lets hope everything works out 
we feel better said his brother the rev ozell brandley 
we have hope in the system that when its all said and done 
montgomery county will do the right thing because we all want this 
country to be the greatest country on this earth 
brandley received a stay six days before his execution date in 
march 1987 in granting the stay a state judge recommended that 
the court of criminal appeals determine if an evidentiary hearing 
was necessary which it did 
on oct 9 1987 after the 10day hearing state district judge 
perry pickett recommended a new trial because the previous two had 
been tainted with racism 
it could have gone either way brandley said wednesday 
you always have some doubts but when judge pickett got the case 
it gave me a whole lot more hope 
brandley is the third texas inmate in a year to have his 
conviction overturned amid national attention 
the capital murder conviction of randall dale adams whose case 
was the subject of the movie the thin blue line was dropped 
he spent 12 years in prison and a new trial was granted to joyce 
ann brown a dallas woman who spent years behind bars for a 1980 
furstore robbery

when she left this small town 10 years 
ago jennifer casolo was a spunky and popular teenager who had 
been a high school cheerleader the social activism came later but 
her enthusiasm never waned 
wednesday night friends placed a welcome home sign on the 
town green and waited her to return home from miami earlier 
wednesday she was deported from el salvador where authorities 
earlier dropped terrorism charges 
the decision brought to a close an unlikely drama for casolo 
28 who grew up in a workingclass family and followed a spiritual 
quest to el salvador wracked by a bloody civil war 
in high school casolo was a popular student who finished at the 
top of her class in her senior year honors came easily yearbook 
editor student body president voted most ambitious most 
creative and did the most for thomaston high school 
she was the hit of the school said edward wilkinson now a 
vice principal she was very intelligent inquisitive a bundle 
of energy if anything needed to be started for school spirit or 
something she would always do it 
shes got a spirit that keeps her going said ann lutterman 
who worked with casolo in el salvador in 1987 and 1988 she was a 
cheerleader in high school and its that same kind of bubbly 
spirit only for her its directed toward the poor 
during that period casolo whos barely 5 feet tall and weighs 
less than 100 pounds was known as little miss hyperactivity 
recalled maureen torrence 
but torrence and other friends say there was little sign then of 
the spirituality casolo would say she found working among el 
salvadors poor 
in a letter sent to former clasmates last summer casolo 
recalled how ashamed i was of being poor in high school and how 
pained she was by the memory of demanding that her mother buy her 
expensive blue jeans like those her friends wore 
after her parents divorced casolos mother supported the family 
by working as a bookkeeper at a vocational high school in 
waterbury casolo has one younger brother 
friends say casolo became more religious and more interested in 
social work during her years at brandeis university a prestigious 
liberal arts college in waltham mass 
at brandeis she took a double major in american studies and 
latin american studies was captain of the soccer team graduated 
summa cum laude and wrote a senior thesis on american popular 
literature that her professor lawrence h fuchs described as 
brilliant and totally nonpolitical 
friends say casolo experienced some anxiety about choosing a 
career torn between an attraction to social work and a feeling of 
obligation to find a wellpaying job to help her mother 
social work won out after working with salvadoran refugees in 
seattle casolo fluent in spanish left for el salvador in 1985 
since then she has worked for christian education seminars a 
texasbased ecumenical religous group that organizes visits for 
americans among them us congress members to el salvador 
i think that she was something she felt called to do rather 
than simply take a job and make a lot of money said susan 
abbott a close friend from high school 
casolo quickly formed a spiritual attachment to the country and 
its people particularly the poor in one letter to a friend she 
spoke of joining the catholic church to become a nun in another 
letter she wrote im a pastor without religion only with lots 
of love 
her work in el salvador ended abruptly late last month when 
armed government police stormed the rented white stucco house 
where she lived in san salvador from the walled garden in the back 
yard they dug up dynamite mortar shells and 22000 rounds of 
ammunition casolo and two salvadoran guests were arrested and 
jailed 
according to abbott casolos strong feelings for the country 
made it inevitable that she would form opinions about what was best 
for el salvador but abbott is certain that casolo had nothing to 
do with the arms 
if you know jennifer you know how important jennifers work 
was to her abbott said and if she were seen as being 
supportive of the leftist rebels the government would never talk 
to her or allow her to bring delegations in

women who take aspirin during the early months of 
pregnancy apparently do not increase the risk of having babies with 
defective hearts a study published today concludes 
women usually are advised to avoid aspirin during pregnancy 
because it might contribute to excessive bleeding during 
childbirth despite the warning aspirin use is common during 
pregnancy especially during the first three months when women may 
not realize that they are pregnant 
a recent study suggested another potential hazard of aspirin 
the possibility that it might increase the risk of malformations of 
the heart in the developing fetus 
however the latest research based on a review of 8821 
mothers discounts this concern 
the findings of this study indicate that aspirin use during 
the first trimester of pregnancy does not increase the risk of 
congenital heart defects in relation to that of other structural 
malformations the researchers wrote 
the study was conducted by dr martha m werler and colleagues 
from the slone epidemiology unit at boston university school of 
medicine it was published in the new england journal of medicine 
the researchers identified 1855 women in boston philadelphia 
southern ontario and iowa who had given birth to babies with heart 
abnormalities they were questioned about their aspirin use during 
pregnancy their responses were compared to those of 6966 women 
who had babies with other forms of birth defects 
no difference in aspirin use was found between the two groups

scientists said today they had confirmed a key 
assumption used in forecasts of global warming from the greenhouse 
effect and that the effect is unexpectedly strong over warm ocean 
water 
the finding of this super greenhouse effect over the western 
tropical pacific ocean is a cause for concern said coauthor 
veerhabdran ramanathan 
if it occurs because the water there has surpassed some 
threshold temperature the earths overall warming may accelerate 
as more of its water warms beyond that temperature said the 
university of chicago climatologist 
but its cause is not known and its implications for the future 
cannot yet be assessed he said in a telephone interview 
in the greenhouse effect the atmosphere traps some energy 
radiating from earth rather than letting it all escape into space 
with buildup of certain gases in the atmosphere such as carbon 
dioxide more energy is trapped resulting in a global warming of 
climate 
ramanathan said results of his study are consistent with 
predictions that a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead 
to a warming of about 4 degrees fahrenheit 
he and graduate student ameet raval present the work in todays 
issue of the british journal nature 
they measured the amount of trapped energy by comparing sea 
surface temperatures to the amount of energy escaping into space 
as measured by satellites the readings were taken during 1985 and 
1986 
they found that the higher the sea temperature the more energy 
was trapped in the atmosphere above 
analysis gave compelling evidence for existence of a natural 
process that amplifies atmospheric warming caused by other factors 
the authors wrote the effects of such a process are incorporated 
in current computer models used to study the greenhouse effect 
essentially the process is that as the sea surface and air get 
warmer the atmosphere accumulates more water vapor the extra 
vapor traps more energy radiating from the earth leading to 
further atmospheric warming 
the nature paper is the first really decent demonstration of 
this process commented robert cess of the state university of new 
york at stony brook who wrote an accompanying editorial

a powerful tamil separatist group 
drove a rival militia from this city in a fierce battle that killed 
at least 130 people many of whom were gunned down after 
surrendering witnesses said 
in a threepronged attack launched shortly before midnight 
tuesday the liberation tigers of tamil eelam surrounded the 
eastern coastal town of 60000 people and clashed with the tamil 
national army 
the tigers seized control of the town and drove out the national 
army members who had been based in batticaloa witnesses and sri 
lankan officials said most of the dead were national army members 
india sent peacekeeping troops to sri lanka two years ago to 
help end an insurgency by tamil separatists the sri lankan 
government claims indian troops who left the batticaloa area last 
month created the tamil national army to fight the tigers 
india denies the allegations and sri lanka has outlawed the 
national army 
at batticaloas general hospital today blood trickled out of a 
drain from the mortuary and ran into a small concrete trench a 
group of somber women entered the building and screamed as they 
recognized the bodies of loved ones 
military officials said 130 tamils were killed 
nearly all the casualties were purportedly killed after 
surrendering to the tamil tigers relatives and hospital officials 
said 
everyone was shot at very close range said one man who said 
he saw 42 bodies he said all but four had their hands tied behind 
their backs 
according to an account pieced together from witnesses 
relatives and hospital employees at least 50 members of the 
national army had surrendered to the tigers who then disarmed them 
and bound their hands 
what happened was they surrendered but one of them pulled a 
gun and shot a tiger the tigers just went wild said one man who 
asked not to be identified further 
outside the batticaloa mortuary weeping women who had just 
identified the bodies of sons and husbands said they were still 
glad the tigers had ousted the tamil national army because now the 
fighting would end 
the women said their sons many of them high school students 
had been forcibly recruited by the tamil national army other 
residents and police gave the same story 
tamil tigers say they want an independent nation because of 
discrimination against the tamil minority by the sinhalese who 
account for about 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
control the government and military 
tamils make up 18 percent of the islands population sinhalese 
are mainly buddhists and tamils are mostly hindus 
at least 17000 people have died in sri lanka in the past six 
years in the tamil separatist rebellion and a backlash by militant 
sinhalese upset with concessions made to the tamils 
the national army is comprised of members of former rebel groups 
that agreed to end their secessionist war and accepted an 
indiamediated peace agreement with the government in july 1987 
but the most powerful of the four rebel groups the tigers 
reneged on the agreement and began attacking indian peacekeeping 
soldiers sent in to enforce the accord 
hospital officials said about 50 bodies had been brought to the 
hospital but they were arriving so fast the officials were unable 
to keep the records exact the small mortuary overflowed with 
bodies and the smell of death wafted out of the door and into the 
hot morning sun 
the freezer has not been working for the last few years 
said a nurse 
asked if this was the worst single killing in batticaloa he 
shook his head and said there has been so many 
residents said sri lankan troops stayed indoors during tuesdays 
and wednesdays violence 
in colombo a sri lankan military official confirmed the 
fighting and said government troops did not get involved 
we do not want to be accused of using our largely 
sinhalesedominated armed forces to fight the tamils said the 
official speaking on condition anonymity 
india withdrew its troops from batticaloa under a phased pullout 
program india has agreed to withdraw the remaining 22000 soldiers 
from sri lanka by dec 31 
in june the tigers agreed to cease attacks on government troops 
after negotiations with president ranasinghe premadasa and other 
senior officials

opponents of a proposed radioactive waste 
dump claimed a firstround victory after chasing members of a state 
team scouting for sites through snowy fields and holding them 
captive for four hours 
protesters were ready to be arrested wednesday but state police 
agreed instead to file trespassing charges against members of a 
field team from the state lowlevel radioactive waste siting 
commission 
protest organizers said they were ready to block inspection of 
two other potential dump sites in allegany county today if the 
field team returned 
also wednesday 20 protesters were arrested on disorderly 
conduct charges in cortland county 100 miles to the east when 
they refused to allow a state inspection team to leave one of two 
potential sites there 
antidump activists in both counties have been camping out all 
week at the five proposed dump sites watching for the state 
inspectors 
dump opponents fanned out along the edges of the allegany sites 
at dawn armed with citizens band radios portable heaters and 
thermoses on sleds as they waited throughout the morning in 
freezing weather 
bill mura who lives near one potential site opened his home as 
a rest area and warming station for protesters 
we moved out here 22 years ago to get away from it all mura 
said gesturing toward the hilly forested countryside this is 
what we get thrown at us 
his house like almost every building in allegany and cortland 
counties bears a fluorescent orange sign reading no dumping 
dont waste new york 
the five sites were chosen by the commission in september under 
federal law states must have a place to store lowlevel 
radioactive waste by 1993 
the commission plans to complete soil testing and other 
preliminary evaluations by spring and then narrow the number of 
sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests 
allegany protesters planned to block the state field team from 
getting on the sites wednesday but the team was not spotted until 
it was already on the site in the town of allen at about 1230 pm 
several dozen people tracked the officials footprints through 
the fresh snow chasing them up and down wooded hills until they 
surrounded seven team members on a county road 
about 100 protesters linked arms and formed a human chain to 
prevent the officials from leaving the site 
allegany county sheriff lawrence scholes who has no deputies 
other than jail officials called in state police 
the two officers who arrived made no arrests 
at this point in time i dont see a need for arrests lt 
charles mccole said what i see is a group of concerned 
citizens 
dump opponents produced landowner william giovanniello who said 
the state team had failed to give him notice that they would be on 
his land and asked that its members be arrested for trespassing 
they never notified me giovanniello said no phone call 
no nothing 
commission staff member bruce goodale called giovanniellos 
charge absolute sheer nonsense 
police and protesters began an hour of negotiations with the 
dump opponents demanding that the state team be arrested before 
they would allow them to leave 
the protesters eventually agreed to let the team members leave 
after giovanniello signed a complaint against them and police filed 
charges with the district attorneys office 
exuberant protesters whooped and hollered see you in the 
morning as the team members were allowed to return to their cars 
jay dunkleberger executive director of the siting commission 
said he did not consider wednesdays events a victory for the 
protesters 
i consider it a draw he said we did accomplish the task 
we set for ourselves for the day

energy secretary james watkins release 
of longclassified plutonium production documents sends a message 
to the public that the energy departments secretive years are 
over a spokesman said 
watkins released figures at the hanford nuclear reservation from 
1944 to 1960 on radioactive gas release and plutonium production 
long among the nations most closely guarded secrets 
an independent panel of scientists overseeing a study of 
radiation releases at hanford had requested the data saying the 
figures were essential in estimating radiation doses the public may 
have received 
watkins announced the release of the figures in a letter to the 
group friday 
its never been done before said ken morgan a hanford 
spokesman its pretty dramatic 
he said the documents would be released in small batches as they 
are requested by the panel of 18 independent scientists overseeing 
the hanford environmental dose reconstruction project copies will 
be made available for public examination 
john till the chairman of the scientists overseeing the study 
said the release of the information was fundamental to the 
credibility of the study 
the project and a separate study by the federal centers for 
disease control are the first steps in determining whether the 
health of people living near the hanford site may have been hurt by 
radioactive releases in the 1940s and 1950s 
the releases were revealed when a huge collection of documents 
was declassified in 1986 and since then some area residents have 
contended their health was damaged by the radioactivity 
watkins refused to declassify newer production data for hanford 
citing national security concerns also still classified are all 
production data from the savannah river plant the south carolina 
plutonium production site 
but morgan said the period covered by the documents was a time 
of heavy production with eight reactors operating at hanford 
thats all im going to tell you he said to say more is 
telling people exactly how much plutonium we ever made he said 
an energy department source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the decision to release the production figures was made by 
watkins over opposition from the pentagon which felt the figures 
could be used to calculate the size of the us nuclear arsenal 
morgan said release of the data will not reveal how many nuclear 
weapons the united states has 
hanford was created in 1943 as part of the manhattan project 
push to beat nazi germany to an atomic bomb eventually there were 
nine plutonium reactors on the sprawling site all are now closed 
the documents to be declassified do not include any production 
from the most recent hanford reactor the n reactor which has been 
closed since 1987 
plutonium has a half life of 24000 years meaning that in 
24000 year half of a given amount is expected to decay because of 
that nearly all the plutonium produced in the nation is either 
still in warheads or is stockpiled said jim thomas of the hanford 
education action league a watchdog group

us officials knew that nuclear test site 
workers were exposed to radiation in the 1950s and 60s but decided 
not to reduce exposures because a change in procedure might have 
disrupted testing a newspaper reported today 
government records show that miners were ordered to retrieve 
instruments from tunnels filled with radioactive dust and 
contaminated debris soon after nuclear blasts at the nevada test 
site the new york times reported 
according to the minutes of a sept 23 1952 meeting of the 
atomic energy commission predecessor of the department of energy 
the commissioners expressed concern that workers might be exposed 
to radiation hazards for too long a time 
two weeks later the commissioners were told that the program 
for determining how much radiation hundreds of workers were exposed 
to was not reliable the times said 
by the following may some commissioners were calling for 
reduction of worker exposures by lowering the governments annual 
safety limit which was 12 rems or radiation doses 
dr john c bugher the aecs chief health officer at the time 
advised against lowering the limit saying it would make it 
impossible to conduct operations at the test site without major 
changes 
today the annual safety limit is 5 rems 
the government documents were made available to the newspaper by 
las vegas lawyers alan r johns and larry c johns who allege in a 
lawsuit against the government that radiation from bomb tests 
caused the cancer deaths of 200 nevada test site employees and 
cancer illness in 18 others 
in the 1950s workers cleaned up rubble at detonation sites 
without respirators to protect their lungs the times said 
on nov 24 1961 108 miners were pulled from two tunnels after 
they absorbed doses exceeding safety limits the miners were 
offered as much beer as they could drink for a week to flush the 
contaminants from their bodies the times said 
on june 6 1963 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from a 
tunnel on the night shift were found to be contaminated by 
radioactive iodine produced by a test in the tunnel the day before 
miners on the next shift were ordered to continue work in the 
tunnel despite the contamination the times said

the food and drug administration plans to 
increase the number of its food inspectors by 10 percent to ensure 
that food manufacturers adhere to regulations aimed at reducing 
confusion over product labels 
fda commissioner frank e young announced the move while several 
dozen consumer groups expressed their concerns over current labels 
during a hearing wednesday the fourth and final session held by 
the fda in a twoyear effort to restructure the nations food 
labeling regulations 
food manufacturers are spending 36 billion advertising and 
some of their claims are misleading said bonnie guiton 
president bushs adviser for consumer affairs 
officials have said labels containing words such as light 
mislead consumers because manufacturers use the word to describe 
texture or color instead of calorie content 
fda spokesman james carroll said the new regulations expected 
to take effect in mid1991 call for manufacturers to use specific 
definitions of such terms he said the regulations are aimed at 
ending chaos that exists in the market now 
allen goldberg a spokesman for a group which represents 130 
large food manufacturers said most companies do not object to the 
new labeling requirements but do not want states to impose even 
stricter regulations 
the new labels would put less emphasis on vitamin and nutrient 
content and focus more on cholesterol fat and sodium in the 
product officials said 
the form of the new labeling remains undecided but some 
consumer groups suggested that officials aim for a simple uniform 
system of labeling 
charles mitchell an attorney for the washingtonbased center 
for science in the public interest suggested a system of red 
green and yellow squares on packages be used to alert consumers to 
the amount of cholesterol fiber and salt in a product 
basically youre using trafficlight colors to signal 
consumers he said green for high fiber red for high salt

president alan garcia says a us proposal to 
give peru more financial aid to offset its drop in drug income will 
open a new era in cooperation between the two countries 
the bush administration plans to ask congress next year to give 
peru bolivia and colombia more money to counter economic losses 
caused by their efforts to stem the drug trade that is the 
lifeblood for many farmers 
the proposal was outlined wednesday in a document released by 
bernard aronson deputy secretary of state for latin american 
affairs 
aronson was in lima to discuss with garcia the agenda for a feb 
15 drug summit involving garcia president bush and presidents 
virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of bolivia the 
summit is to be held in cartagena colombia 
garcia hailed the proposal as a change in perspective by the 
united states he said it marks a new epoch in economic and 
antidrug collaboration between the countries 
the document a preliminary agenda for the summit outlined 
other themes to be discussed including 
military and police aid to fight drug smugglers 
leftist guerrillas ties to the narcotics trade 
crop eradication and substitution programs 
cooperation in extraditing drug suspects and stopping the 
laundering of drug money 
the document did not specify how much aid would be involved and 
exactly what form it would take 
the united states is open to considering support in the 
balance of payments such as subsidizing imports and contributing 
to debt service with international financial institutions the 
document said 
it also left open the possibility of financing alternative crop 
programs through research assistance and credits to establish 
markets for new products 
bolivia and peru produce 90 percent of the worlds coca leaf 
most is transformed into paste and shipped to colombia where it is 
refined into cocaine the drug trade brings billions of dollars 
into the three countries each year and regional leaders have said 
they need the aid to help them find substitute sources of income 
bushs earlier had proposed 22 billion during the next five 
years for the three andean nations including 261 million the 
first year mostly in military and police aid 
garcia criticized that proposal saying bush was trying to turn 
a social and economic problem into a military one garcia said it 
was necessary to open markets and find ways to help peasant coca 
growers earn a living from other crops 
peru the source of 60 percent to 70 percent of the worlds coca 
leaf was designated to receive only 73 million of the 261 
million in the first year of the program compared to 90 million 
for colombia and 98 million for bolivia 
the proposal included only 3 million in aid for peru the first 
year a us embassy spokesman said the amount for peru was low 
because of its unstable economy the spokesman said officials were 
worried economic assistance would not be spent efficiently 
inflation the last 12 months in peru was 2950 percent 
however an agreement was recently signed opening a new line of 
credit with the international monetary fund and committing peru to 
make payments on its 1 billion debt with the fund the fund cut 
off credit in 1986 after garcia declared a moratorium on interest 
payments 
us embassy spokesman gene bigler said the rapprochement 
indicated perus desire to stabilize its economy he described it 
as an essential step in opening the door to us economic aid

governmentbacked forces and rebels in sri lanka 
have murdered more than 1000 people each month since the 
government reimposed a state of emergency in june amnesty 
international said today 
the human rights organization said security forces and 
paramilitary groups trying to quell ethnic violence in southern 
regions of the indian ocean island have killed hundreds of unarmed 
rebel suspects at random 
minority tamils seeking a separate homeland as well as the 
ultranationalist sinhalese peoples liberation front group also 
have slain hundreds of people many of the governing united 
national party the report said 
amnesty said the rebel groups tactics of criminal violence 
were being adopted increasingly by the security forces and the 
allied paramilitary groups the government dominated by the ethnic 
majority sinhalese claims the paramilitary groups operate as 
unauthorized vigilantes 
amnesty also blamed indian peacekeeping forces for a rising 
incidence of unlawful killings of unarmed rebel suspects in 
northeast sri lanka 
the report said progovernment forces and tamil guerrillas have 
mutilated burned and dumped bodies of their victims in public 
places to instill terror in others 
on the indians amnesty cited witness reports that indian troops 
killed as many as 46 civilians in an aug 2 reprisal attack in 
valvettiturai hours after the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
ambushed and killed six indian soldiers 
the indians arrived in 1987 to enforce a peace accord and 
failing to disarm the liberation tigers began fighting them india 
has promised to withdraw its remaining 22000 troops from sri lanka 
by dec 31 
several lawyers pursuing the fate of people who have disappeared 
after being detained in the south have been killed by unidentified 
assailants the report said three witnesses at an inquiry into a 
young mans shooting by police also were reported killed in june 
amnesty said an emergency regulation allowing government troops 
to dispose of bodies without having autopsies or inquiries 
encourages deliberate killings by the security forces 
president ranasinghe premadasa lifted a 5yearold state of 
emergency in january but reimposed it june 20 amid widespread 
killings and strikes 
the government said there were 1705 politicalrelated killings 
in the first six months of 1989 including 650 politicians and 
political party supporters and 740 listed as civilians 
amnesty said many more killings undoubtedly remain 
unrecorded 
the number of killings rose markedly under renewed emergency 
regulations with well over 1000 people being killed each 
month through september the group said 
the right to life can never be suspended even in times of 
national emergency amnesty said the violent activities of 
armed opposition groups can never provide justification for grave 
human rights violations such as extra judicial executions by 
governments forces or their agents

a former policeman pleaded 
guilty today to the murder of an antiapartheid activist saying he 
was a member of a police assassination squad and had acted on 
orders from superior officers 
after years of suspicion among activists that police death 
squads existed this was the first time anyone confessed in court 
to serving on such a unit 
the black former policeman butana nofomela first made his 
allegations in an affidavit oct 19 the night before he was to 
hang for a separate murder with no political overtones 
armed with the affidavit human rights lawyers obtained a stay 
of execution for nofomala so he could assist in investigations of 
death squad activity 
subsequently two other former policemen named by nofomela as 
death squad members confessed in newspaper interviews that they 
were involved and the issue has become a major national 
controversy 
last week president fw de klerk rejected requests to appoint 
a judicial inquiry commission saying the allegations could be 
handled through normal legal procedures justice minister kobie 
coetsee announced that nofomela would be prosecuted for the 1981 
stabbing of griffiths mxenge a black lawyer and activist from 
durban 
in a statement read in magistrates court in pietermaritzburg 
capital of natal province nofomela 32 said he and three other 
black policemen abducted mxenge and took him to a stadium where 
they kicked punched and stabbed him until he died 
at the time of the murder i was a member of the police 
special branch assassination squad nofomela told the court i 
was instructed by brig willem schoon and capt dirk coetzee to 
proceed to durban and there to kill one griffiths mxenge 
schoon now retired from the police has not issued any formal 
statement on allegations he ordered mxenges assassination 
coetzee who has fled south africa made detailed claims about 
death squad activities including mxenges murder in a lengthy 
interview last month with vyre weekblad free weekly an 
antiapartheid afrikaanslanguage newspaper 
police have issued a warrant for coetzees arrest and have said 
they will try to extradite him if necessary 
after nofomela read his statement in court his case was 
adjourned until feb 28 
in addition to the alleged police death squads police 
investigators claim to have uncovered other assassination squads 
run by farright white extremists outside the ranks of the security 
forces 
antiapartheid activists and human rights lawyers have suggested 
that disclosures about these extremist groups have been timed to 
divert attention from the alleged police hit squads

the rand corp is warning employees about a 
computer disk that is advertised as a database for aids 
information but which is believed actually to destroy stored 
information 
were safe we have not been hit said ann shoben a 
spokeswoman for the santa monicabased research firm the concern 
is for others that use personal computers and those who work on 
aids research might pick up this program and have their databases 
destroyed 
ms shoben said wednesday that rand employees were given a 
memorandum after learning of the disk from computer expert john 
mcafee 
mcafee chairman of the computer virus industry association of 
santa clara calif said it is unusual for his group to issue such 
a blanket warning against a particular disk 
but because he has received calls from personal computer users 
around the world mcafee said he believes the threat is real 
this is not a hoax he said this is not a simple case of 
a hacker in a back bedroom somewhere 
it is a well orchestrated and undeniably well financed 
terrorist act he said few groups or individuals can afford to 
waste hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring harm to a party and 
bring nothing in return 
in london scotland yard issued a warning wednesday to banks 
hospitals universities and other institutions to be on guard 
against the disk scotland yard said the disks have destroyed 
information in at least 10 computers 
mcafee said he believes the topic of aids was used by the 
creator of the damaging program because many computer users are 
likely curious about the deadly disease 
people are encouraged to use the disk because it is advertised 
as being able to predict the chances a person has of contracting 
aids he said 
unlike an accounting program this is a subject everyone is 
aware of and virtually all people will want to learn more about 
risks of having aids mcafee said 
rand which has 15 people working on acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome research took the message from mcafee seriously ms 
shoben said 
the people who are researching aids are very upset she said 
ms shoben said her company was warned that a flyer accompanying 
the unsolicited disk states the disk program is titled aids 
informationan introductory diskette and adds that its price is 
378 
the program also carries this ominous advice ms shoben said 
warning do not use these programs unless you are prepared to pay 
for them 
mcafee said a company calling itself pc cyborg inc with a 
bogus panamanian post office box number has distributed the disks 
unsolicited to major corporations and personal computer user groups 
around the world 
he said chase manhattan bank was one of the first to report 
problems with the software the companys office in new york was 
not available for comment late wednesday 
david kanouse who directs rands aids research group said the 
disk is for use with a personal computer and would not be an 
immediate threat to a computer system like rands 
it is unclear whether it is contagious he said its 
probably not contagious from machine to machine but it would 
destroy the system in which it is entered it will destroy the 
system its installed in

earlier this week convicted armed robber 
kay smith planned a menu for christmas dinner and mailed it to her 
husband and two sons in maryland confident she would be released 
from prison in time for the holiday 
her faith was rewarded wednesday when a state panel granted her 
parole nearly 12 years after she escaped from prison changed her 
name and embarked on a new life that ended with her recapture in 
1988

hearing in which she pleaded i just ask for forgiveness i just 
want you to know i have changed my way of thinking

knowing freedom is imminent mrs smith said at a news conference 
after the boards vote 
asked what she would do in her final hours behind bars mrs 
smith replied i think that i can do a lot of reflecting back 
over that time and just feel very thankful its not much 
longer

supervision by maryland authorities until march 1996 she also must 
make restitution to a jewlery store that she robbed of 4300 in

severn md 
her second husband ray smith and her sons daniel rodgers 19 
and james rodgers 18 had been unaware of her past life 
after her recapture south carolina allowed mrs smith to serve 
her time at a prison in jessup md so she could be near her 
family she was brought to columbia this week for the parole

i hope to just be settled and have a routine day with a 
routine job and a routine home life she said

that i could take it all back but i cant 
she also said she had matured as a result of her recapture and 
incarceration 
ive learned to work out my problems step by step and be 
rational mrs smith said most of all i take responsibility 
for my own direction and life pamela rodgers was not quite there 
at all 
ew pace owner of a greenville jewelry store robbed by mrs 
smith said he wants her to return the money stolen from his store 
and then get on with her life 
as far as im concerned they can let her go and she can go 
back and keep enjoying life pace said 
a police officer in greenville who worked on mrs smiths case 
and the solicitor who prosecuted her last year for the escape 
charge both wrote letters to the board recommending her for parole

a centrist opposition candidate was the 
favorite today as chileans turned out in droves to elect a 
president for the first time in nearly two decades of ironfisted 
rule by gen augusto pinochet 
authorities reported calm throughout the country as polls opened 
at 8 am 6 am edt lines formed before dawn and by 9 am 
they stretched for several blocks at many precincts 
the nations 20023 polling stations were to remain open until 5 
pm 
voting was mandatory and most of the 75 million registered 
voters were expected to cast ballots in a resumption of a long 
democratic tradition broken by 16 years of military rule 
voters were to pick a new president in a threeman race as well 
as fill the 38 seats in the senate and 120 in the house of 
deputies the first official results were expected tonight with 
final results anticipated early friday 
patricio aylwin 71 a leader of the centrist christian 
democratic party and the candidate for a 17party opposition 
coalition voted at 830 am in a crush of photographers and 
television cameramen at a school near his santiago home he is 
favored in most preelection surveys to win the presidency 
his main rival was hernan buchi a 40yearold independent 
technocrat who served for nearly five years as finance minister 
under pinochet buchi however badly trails aylwin in opinion 
polls 
the third candidate millionaire conservative businessman 
francisco javier errazuriz was expected to finish last buchis 
advisers hoped to keep aylwins vote total below a majority and 
force a runoff 
pinochet who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup was obliged to 
call the elections after losing a referendum last year in which 
voters rejected a military proposal that he remain in power until 
1997 
the opposition coalition aylwin heads led the effort that ousted 
pinochet from the presidency the general says however that he 
will remain army commander for eight more years sheltered by a 
constitutional provision that prohibits the new president from 
dismissing him 
pinochet led the armed forces in the coup that toppled the 
3yearold elected government of president salvador allende a 
leftist at a time of social political and economic turmoil 
pinochet said at the time the armed forces would remain in power 
only as long as as circumstances demand 
interior minister carlos caceres in a news conference with 
foreign reporters on the eve of the vote said the military 
government had kept their word to restore democracy once it 
restablished order straightened out the economy and created a new 
legal framework for the country 
buchi on wednesday said that regardless of who wins the 
election we should all celebrate thursday as the day of the 
victory of democracy 
also wednesday the opposition angrily denounced a new law 
barring future congressional probes into the pinochet regime and 
its officials the law was passed tuesday by the fourman military 
junta that now acts as legislature 
enrique silva aylwins campaign manager said the new law is 
in our judgment manifestly unconstitutional 
the law is one of several being pushed by the pinochet 
administration in its final months in power and seen by the 
opposition as aimed at limiting the powers of the future government 
aylwin and his top aides have repeatedly said they will seek to 
repeal or change those laws in the future congress

church activist jennifer casolo was back in the 
united states today after being held 18 days in el salvador on 
charges of storing weapons in her garden for leftist rebels an 
arrest her supporters suggested was a frameup 
casolo 28 of thomaston conn read the bible and wept over 
letters of support from friends after being deported and put aboard 
a commercial flight wednesday from san salvador friends said she 
also expressed concern about two salvadoran friends who were 
arrested with her nov 26 
i dont think ive suffered as terribly as thousands of 
salvadorans have suffered here she told reporters before leaving 
el salvador 
she made no statement after arriving in miami 
its just tremendous her mother audrey said from 
connecticut weve already had our christmas present here 
casolo who gave tours of el salvador to visiting americans as a 
lay worker with christian education seminars was released after a 
salvadoran judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to hold her 
us ambassador william walker escorted casolo from the womens 
prison outside san salvador to the airport 
ms casolos whereabouts were not immediately known this morning 
a spokeswoman for sen christopher dodd dconn said ms 
casolo decided to spend the night in miami and return to 
connecticut today but roy lloyd a new york spokesman for the 
national council of churches which handles some business matters 
for chistian education seminars said he had lost contact with her 
lloyd said she had been booked as a guest on morning news 
programs today but those appearances were canceled because she 
couldnt be found wednesday night 
lloyd speculated that exhaustion and concern that she might say 
something that would harm coworkers still in el salvador may have 
been why she didnt appear he added that she had been described 
her as emotionally spent 
martin bailey a communications representative of the national 
council of churches who had met ms casolo in miamia checked out 
of his hotel room early today 
it was a very emotional time for her being taken straight 
from the prison to the airport and deported because of her love 
for the people and the country of el salvador said the rev 
daniel long who traveled on the plane 
she read the letters that she had on the way up today on the 
plane and she was very profoundly moved by the sentiment expressed 
by people in churches and friends here said long chairman of 
the san antoniobased board of christian education seminars 
casolo had lived in el salvador since 1985 she and her friends 
were arrested during a police raid on her rented house 
salvadoran police said they dug up 103 mortar shells 213 blocks 
of dynamite 405 detonators 150 feet of slowburning fuse and 
21945 rounds of ammunition for sovietmade automatic rifles in the 
garden 
casolo was charged with terrorism possessing weapons of war and 
criminal association she denied the charges 
the timing of her arrest during the biggest guerrilla offensive 
of a decadelong war and the first to deeply penetrate the capital 
appeared to link it to a concerted government backlash including 
raids arrests and harassment against clergy and church members 
casolos supporters said six jesuit priests were slain nov 16 and 
a witness blamed government troops 
the army and rightists politicians in the central american 
country accuse churches of aiding the guerrillas while those of 
the left claim the poor are forced into the guerrillas arms 
because the government quashes peaceful churchsponsored calls for 
change 
sen john kerry dmass an opponent of the bush 
administrations large military aid program for el salvador 
predicted that persecution of other church workers would not end 
with casolos release 
one has to ask if the government did not have the evidence to 
bring her to trial why did it see fit to deport her he said 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said there wasnt enough 
evidence to continue holding casolo but he said he was morally 
convinced that miss casolo is guilty 
cristiani said the case against casolo would proceed 
if the evidence against her becomes sufficient she will be 
summoned to return for trial he said acknowledging that little 
could be done to make her come back to el salvador 
in connecticut dodd who had spoken by telephone several times 
with cristiani in recent days said the decision to free casolo was 
not the result of us pressure 
there were no deals there are no conditions on aid dodd 
said 
i welcome this announcement for the signal it sends about the 
legal system in el salvador a system that has not exactly 
distinguished itself for fairness or even humaneness in recent 
years dodd said 
she sounds very good mrs casolo said after speaking with 
her daughter by telephone but she was upset about the two people 
she left behind 
casolos father john casolo thanked volunteers and officials 
for bringing our daughter home 
maureen torrence a friend from high school predicted that 
casolo would try to return to el salvador 
knowing jennifers desire and love for the people of el 
salvador i would say she would love to go back i dont know if 
she can certainly not under this current regime 
but thats her calling and thats what she loves to do

marijuana is no more harmful than alcohol 
says national drug control policy director william j bennett but 
he still strongly opposes efforts to legalize it or any other drug 
the last thing i would want to do is recommend the wider use 
of a drug that makes young people stupid bennett said in an 
interview wednesday as he launched yet another counteroffensive 
against the increasingly visible and voluble drug legalization 
movement 
while he said he does not think marijuana is more harmful than 
alcohol bennett said we have enough of a problem with liquor 
thank you 
bennett who has consistently denounced the legalization of any 
drugs spoke on the issue monday at harvard university where he 
decried intellectuals who are on the editorial and oped 
pages telling us with an ignorant sneer that our drug policy 
wont work 
the next day a federal judge for the first time joined the 
ranks of drug legalization advocates 
us district judge robert w sweet a republican and former 
prosecutor appointed by president carter as a trial judge in the 
southern district of new york said in a speech that drugs 
including cocaine and heroin should be legalized taxed and 
dispensed by the state because the war on drugs is being lost 
i suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition to cease 
treating indulgence in mindalteration as a crime sweet told the 
cosmopolitan club in new york the result he said would be the 
elimination of the profit motive the gangs the drug dealers 
obviously the model is the repeal of prohibition and the end of al 
capone and dutch shultz 
interviewed this morning on nbctvs today show sweet said 
i have been surprised by the furor raised by his suggestion 
this is a huge industry 150 billion it ought to be taxed 
regulated 
terrence burke acting deputy director of the drug enforcement 
administration said on the same program that he was outraged 
by sweets proposal 
the judge should get off that bench and get down to the 
street get out of the club and get down to bellevue hospital 
and see some of those crack babies i really believe its an 
insult to people who are working in law enforcement in the 
streets burke said 
i know all about bellevue and im not about to go off the 
bench sweet responded this is a very complicated problem 
and it doesnt lend itself to comments about insults i 
certainly believe in the agents who are doing their job as i hope i 
am doing mine 
bennett led a chorus of political and law enforcement officials 
wednesday rebutting sweets speech and the drug legalization 
argument 
the argument bennett said is as stupid and morally atrocious 
as it ever was it doesnt make any sense 
judges arent any more immune to ignorance than people in 
other professions he said being a judge doesnt mean youre 
wise it means somebodys made you a judge 
if he doesnt like his work if hes tired of sentencing 
people he should find another line of work bennett said its 
better to have clogged courts than crowded jammed pediatric 
wards of cocaine babies which we will have a lot more of if we 
take his proposal seriously 
in new york sen alfonse damato rny said sweets speech 
shows a shocking lack of reality this almost comes from 
fairyland 
if his policy were accepted he would be consigning millions of 
more to lives of addictions damato said during a press 
conference he would be responsible for the deaths of millions of 
more it is a policy that is irresponsible 
robert stutman head of the drug enforcement administrations 
new york office said nearly threequarters of the children who are 
beaten to death in new york had drugabusing parents 
if you advocate a policy that says more parents are going to 
use drugs you are therefore advocating a policy that says more kids 
are going to be beaten to death stutman said i think that 
stinks 
sterling johnson jr the special new york state prosecutor for 
narcotics added this is not the time to be advocating 
legalization of drugs when we are trying to tell every young man 
and child drugs are wrong for you 
the drug legalization movement recently was boosted by the 
addition of president reagans secretary of state george p shultz 
he argued during a speech at stanford university that it seems 
to me were not really going to get anywhere until we can take the 
criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for 
criminality out of it we need at least to consider and examine 
forms of controlled legalization of drugs 
the movement already included a broad crosssection of the 
political spectrum on the conservative side are economist milton 
friedman and political commentator william f buckley on the 
liberal side are such people as democratic mayor kurt schmoke of 
baltimore a former prosecutor journalist and carter 
administration state department spokesman hodding carter iii and 
former attorney general ramsey clark

the european parliament today urged 
britain to stop repatriating vietnamese refugees from hong kong and 
blamed britain for not generating international support to deal 
with the influx of refugees 
the parliament also said the united states which fought the 
vietnam war has a special responsibility to help settle the 
refugees 
on tuesday the first 51 vietnamese were flown to hanoi britain 
is determined to return 44000 of the wouldbe immigrants from 
communist vietnam arguing they are economic migrants not 
political refugees 
the european parliament comprising 518 members from all 12 
european community nations said the distinction between 
political and economic refugees was arbitrary in the 
context of vietnam 
the collapse of the vietnamese economy has resulted in large 
measure from the imposition of a stalinist economic model it 
said in a resolution that blamed the continuing refusal of both 
the ec european community and the united states to develop 
economic relations with vietnam 
there are 57000 boat people in hong kong living in cramped 
conditions 
the parliament said while it recognized the immense 
difficulties faced by the government and people of hong kong in 
coping with the influx of boat people britain must abandon the 
policy of forcible repatriation 
it blamed london for failing to generate international support 
to deal with this refugee problem in a humanitarian manner 
it asked the ec executive commission and the 12 ec states to 
draw up an action program to resettle the boat people

in strasbourg france the european parliament today urged 
britain to stop the forced repatriation saying london had not done 
enough to try to resettle the refugees it also said the united 
states should help solve the problem given that fact that it 
fought the vietnam war 
the parliament comprising 518 members from all 12 european 
community nations said the distinction between political and 
economic refugees was arbitrary in the context of vietnam 
the hong kong government issued a statement saying a vietnamese 
man who tried to commit suicide had been found hanging inside one 
of the camps today he was taken to a hospital where his condition 
was listed as fair 
there have been fears that forced repatriation could lead some 
boat people to attempt suicide but the statement said the incident 
did not appear connected to the demonstrations 
on wednesday about 6000 vietnamese protested at three centers 
with some shouting that they would rather die than return to 
vietnam 
the protesters are among about 44000 vietnamese who have sailed 
into hong kong since june 1988 and are considered illegal 
economic migrants unless they can prove they fled their 
communist homeland out of fear of persecution 
nearly 6800 have been denied refugee status after being 
screened by immigration officials compared with slightly more than 
700 who qualified 
the first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked 
screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police and 
put on a plane to hanoi 
british and hong kong officials say more repatriations are 
coming and argue that returning the vietnamese home is more humane 
than keeping them indefinitely in the camps which are overcrowded 
and rife with violence and malnutrition 
but among the signs at sham shui po was one that said thatcher 
no heart a reference to british prime minister margaret 
thatcher who has strongly defended involuntary repatriation 
another sign read vietnamese today hong kong 1997 
recalling concerns of some hong kong people who believe involuntary 
repatriation will hurt the territorys chances of obtaining 
international protection from communist china which takes control 
of the colony in eight years 
hong kong now houses about 56000 vietnamese those who arrived 
before june 1988 automatically were granted refugee status and are 
eligible for resettlement

north american wetlands will grow by nearly 2 
million acres and the everglades national park in florida will 
expand by 110000 acres under a pair of new laws intended to 
reverse dwindling wildlife habitats 
the wetlands bill will provide a steady source of funds for 
the purchase of critical wetlands in the united states canada and 
mexico president bush said at a signing ceremony wednesday the 
measure authorizes spending 15 million annually over a fouryear 
period 
an additional 10 million would be generated for purchases each 
year by putting excess receipts from excise taxes on hunting 
equipment into interestbearing accounts fines and forfeitures 
collected under a migratory bird act amounting to about 850000 a 
year also would be used to purchase wetlands 
this bill is an excellent first step in reaching our national 
goal of no net loss of wetlands bush told a white house audience 
of environmentalists and lawmakers 
he said the steady decline in the duck population is largely due 
to the continuing loss of wetland areas he does not favor a ban on 
development projects that destroy wetlands but wants any 
development offset with an equal amount of acreage restored as 
wetlands 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who introduced 
the bill last april said it would allow the nation to begin 
rebuilding waterfowl populations by conserving nearly 2 million 
acres of us wetlands under a 1986 agreement with canada 
there has been relatively little progress made during the 
past three years mitchell said in a statement its important 
that no more time be lost less than half the original 200 million 
acres of wetlands in the 48 contiguous states remain and the 
destruction continues today at a rate of half a million acres per 
year 
the expansion of the everglades will be undertaken in 
cooperation with the state of florida which will donate 35000 new 
acres to the federal park the government estimates it will cost 
40 million to acquire the rest of the new acreage with florida 
paying 20 percent of the costs 
the everglades the second largest national park in the 48 
contiguous states is home to 13 endangered species but problems 
with the flow of waters have harmed the habitat for both birds and 
alligators 
the woodstork heron ibis egret and roseate spoonbill have 
all declined dramatically over the years bush said the 
florida panther the alligator and many species of fish are 
declining

medicares controversial catastrophic coverage 
act which sparked a senior citizens tax revolt is no more 
president bush signed the repeal wednesday night of the yearold 
program that elicited howls of protest from affluent retirees 
facing income tax surcharges up to 800 apiece 
bush who stayed on the sidelines all year as congress debated 
whether to modify the program or abandon it altogether signed the 
bill in private offering no comment 
the white house press office simply issued a oneparagraph 
release noting that bush had signed the repeal bill 
the government expects repeal of the catastrophic coverage act 
to raise the federal deficit for fiscal 1990 by 48 billion but 
reduce the deficit by 158 billion over the next four years 
some advocates for the elderly have warned that the elderly are 
likely to face steep price increases for socalled medigap 
insurance policies now that medicare has been shorn of the 
catastrophic illness benefits 
when president reagan signed the act into law in july 1988 it 
was billed as the biggest benefit expansion in medicares history 
reagan called it a move that would remove one of the worries of old 
age going broke from illness 
instead it triggered a flood of complaints from elderly 
taxpayers appalled at the prospect of higher taxes 
in enacting the catastrophic coverage reagan and congress made 
the beneficiaries foot the bill entirely by themselves all 33 
million medicare beneficiaries were charged an extra 4 per month 
in medicare premiums and the wealthiest 40 percent were to be 
docked a 15 percent surcharge on their income taxes up to 800 
many elderly griped they already had sufficient insurance from 
their old jobs or private policies and thus were being forced to 
pay for something they didnt need 
the law now repealed would have limited their expenses to 592 
for the first days stay in a hospital and to 1370 in other 
outofpocket medical expenses starting in 1990 after that 
medicare would have paid all charges it deemed reasonable it also 
would have provided some prescription drug benefits 
the critics said the catastrophic act did little to address the 
biggest cause of impoverishment from ill health nursing home bills 
that can run 25000 a year or more 
bush had backed the medicare expansion during the 1988 campaign 
and denied that it involved a tax increase he took no position 
this year as lawmakers beat their retreat from the program 
the social security administration says it will take several 
months to reprogram its computers so the premiums will still be 
taken out of social security checks into early next year after 
which people will get a lump sum refund for any payments made in 
1990 
the income tax surcharge meanwhile was repealed retroactive to 
the start of 1989 when the program started because this years 
income tax forms were printed before the catastrophic law was 
repealed they include lines related to the surcharge 
rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the house select 
committee on aging said he is asking the internal revenue service 
to expand its efforts to notify medicare beneficiaries that they 
need not pay the surcharge 
the repeal legislation left standing some provisions that 
expanded medicaid coverage for pregnant women and infants up to age 
1 states are now required to cover poor women and their babies 
living at or below the poverty line 
also left intact was a requirement that state medicaid programs 
start paying medicare premiums for the elderly poor or disabled

the new government said today it 
has begun talks with moscow on the pullout of 80000 soviet troops 
from czechoslovakia 
also today the communist party denied it had reached a final 
agreement with the opposition on choosing a president saying a 
final decision must be made at a party congress dec 2021 
but the party did not deny the substance of an agreement with 
opposition leaders that will lead to the nations first 
noncommunist president in 41 years the agreement was reported 
wednesday by opposition sources 
in his first news conference since becoming foreign minister 
sunday jiri dienstbier said he held preliminary talks with 
soviet representatives on the pullout of 80000 soviet troops 
the discussions extended those begun by dienstbiers 
predecessor jaromir johanes in moscow following the malta summit 
between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush 
i believe that we shall soon be able to arrive at some 
concrete conclusions some common understanding dienstbier said 
the bilateral talks should run parallel with disarmament talks 
in vienna between nato and the warsaw pact which already have set 
the goal of agreement on troop cuts in europe by the end of next 
year 
he noted that the moscow protocol and the agreement allowing the 
presence of soviet troops in czechoslovakia have been rendered 
invalid unter international law because these agreement were made 
under pressure 
alexander dubcek who led the reforms of the prague spring 
crushed by the soviet invasion in 1968 signed the agreements after 
he was ousted and flown to moscow 
the government and the opposition agreed wednesday that 
parliament will choose czechoslovakias next president by the end 
of january with the stipulation that he be a czech not affiliated 
with any political party 
no agreement was reached on who would be president but the 
accord sets the stage for the election of vaclav havel the 
playwright and former political prisoner has been the key figure in 
the peaceful revolt that ended the communists monopoly on power 
it also seemed to rule out any chance at the presidency for 
dubcek a slovak a czech is stipulated for the presidency to 
balance the ethnic background of the new communist premier marian 
calfa also a slovak 
the presidency is largely ceremonial but it has great symbolic 
importance because of the respect the first president tomas 
garrigue masaryk enjoyed in the independent czechoslovakia he 
founded in 1918 
a statement issued at the conclusion of the talks wednesday 
night also called for the ouster from parliament of lawmakers who 
do not provide guarantees of political democracy 
the statement did not specify how the deputies would be replaced 
a strong communist majority runs the 350member parliament 
which under the constitution had 14 days from the resignation of 
president gustav husak on sunday to choose a new president 
it was agreed at wednesdays talks to extend that deadline to 45 
days participants said 
the opposition coalition civic forum had hoped to see havel 
voted into office during a twoday parliamentary session this week 
last week the coalition said there was virtual agreement with the 
communists that the president should be a czech with no political 
affiliation 
but communist deputies abruptly swerved in another direction 
proposing instead that the matter be put to a public referendum in 
the hopes of buying more time to regroup and slow the quicksilver 
reform process 
civic forum objected to the referendum on the grounds it could 
delay the more important task of moving swiftly to free elections 
for an entirely new parliament expected by july 
political observers in prague speculated that communist deputies 
in parliament rebelled against the party leaders who conducted the 
negotiations with the opposition last week 
opposition negotiators at wednesdays talks petr pithart and 
michal kocab and the leader of the small peoples party josef 
bartoncik said it was decided at wednesdays meeting not to scrap 
czechoslovakias 70year tradition of parliament electing the 
president 
communist negotiators did not comment as they left the talks 
while the presidential negotiations were being held the 
government said wednesday it was drafting laws to ensure freedom of 
religion assembly and association and provide more protection to 
people who are arrested 
the proposed legal reforms were announced to parliament by 
deputy premier jan carnogursky a dissident lawyer released from 
jail two weeks ago who on sunday was named to the first government 
in 41 years led by noncommunists 
changes in the penal code would strengthen the independence of 
the judiciary and reduce the time a person can be held before 
charges are filed carnogursky said 
carnogursky also has joined a threeman government commission 
overseeing czechoslovakias secret police 
his elevation and that of nine other dissidents who became part 
of the 21member cabinet on sunday has been the greatest of the 
historic gains made by the reform movement which since nov 17 has 
used mass demonstrations to force the communists to open borders 
promise free elections and surrender their monopoly on power 
husak 76 resigned wednesday from his last position of power in 
the communist party his seat on the party central committee the 
state news agency ctk reported

democratic national chairman ron brown today 
criticized president bush for his overtures to the chinese 
leadership that crushed student protests last spring saying it is 
part of a disgraceful us policy 
brown who recently returned from a visit to berlin also 
attacked bush for being timid and failing to make the united states 
a force for democracy amid dramatic changes in eastern europe 
brown addressing a breakfast meeting of the us chamber of 
commerce called us policy toward china disgraceful and said the 
administrations highlevel meeting last week in beijing 
compounded that disgrace 
the meeting he said amounted to embracing that regime that 
was crushing students with tanks just a few months ago 
i think that sends the wrong kind of signal around the 
world brown said 
bush dispatched national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to beijing last 
weekend for the first highlevel meetings with chinas leaders 
since the crackdown in tiananmen square in june 
brown said that as communism recedes in eastern europe the 
united states should take a more active role in assisting those 
countries in establishment of democratic institutions 
we ought to be there to help he said we know more about 
democracy than any country in the world 
brown said eastern europe represents a large potential market 
for us business a consequence of bushs caution in europe he 
said may be that american businesses will get their too late 
after west german businesses win the new markets 
theyre reaching out to us he said im not sure were 
reaching out to them

control of this indian ocean nation in a coup last month are 
planning to leave but their commander is still negotiating terms 
for his departure a south african diplomat said today 
thirty french and belgian mercenaries led by bob denard have 
been under pressure to leave the former french colony since the 
nov 26 assassination of president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane 
denard a veteran soldier of fortune in africa and asia said 
today he wanted a formal transfer of power to the french army 
before leaving said the star newspaper of johannesburg south 
africa 
comorans who are mainly african believe the mercenaries who 
run the 600man presidential guard are responsible for killing the 
president denard has acknowledged he was in the room at the 
presidential palace when abdallah was shot but says he is not to 
blame he said a guard shot abdallah by mistake

have suspended aid and are pressuring denard to leave denard has

the big three tv networks are asking the ac 
nielsen co to change the way it gathers ratings data including 
shortening the use of people meters to avoid buttonpushing 
fatigue among viewers 
the recommendation was contained in a twoyear study released 
wednesday and paid for by abc nbc and cbs 
in a key recommendation the study which cost more than 1 
million calls for a reduction from two years to one the length of 
time viewers involved in nielsens peoplemeter audience sample 
are asked to participate 
the 2yearold system is in 4000 homes it requires each viewer 
in participating households to press buttons on devices that either 
are handheld or atop the tv set the devices indicate who in the 
family is watching and which program is being seen the data is 
translated into ratings which provide the demographic information 
that advertisers seek 
the study said viewers get tired of pushing buttons and that 
such buttonpushing fatigue sets in before the end of the 
twoyear period 
the study by statistical research inc also found a major 
problem in getting households to join the peoplemeter sample more 
than half of those asked by nielsen to participate declined 
i would say unquestionably the cooperation rate is the 
biggest challenge david poltrack cbs senior vice president for 
research 
the report also urged a joint industry study of ways to measure 
viewing by children under 6 and it urged that nielsen appoint an 
ombudsman whose sole job would be to set and monitor research 
standards 
john dimling executive vice president of nielsen media 
research praised the study as an outstanding effort and said 
the key i think is that the system is good but can be 
improved 
the report was prepared for the committee on nationwide 
television audience measurement founded in 1963 by the three 
networks and the national association of broadcasters to study tv 
audience measurement 
with the growth of cable and videocassettes total network 
shares of audience in prime time are in the lower 60 percent range 
down from nearly 90 per cent only 10 years ago 
but the contam study wasnt done to try to raise network ratings 
and doesnt even mention them alan wurtzel abc senior vice 
president for research said wednesday 
its recommendations for improvemed audience measurement would 
benefit the entire industry including cable and advertisers he 
said

a woman who thought an inoperable brain tumor 
would make this christmas her last has been told she can leave her 
hospital bed for home with a clean bill of health 
kym curbow was scheduled for release this afternoon because the 
holiday came a little early this year as her mother put it on 
wednesday 
we got ours on the afternoon of december fourth linda 
curbow said 
that was the day doctors determined that the mass next to her 
20yearold daughters brain stem where vital functions take 
place was a cyst not a tumor and removed it 
when i walked in and said we have the final diagnosis 
everyone held their breath said her neurosurgeon dr george 
dohrmann i said kym christmas has come early 
a national brain tumor hot line made the difference for the 
nursing student who refused to settle for the bleak prognosis she 
was given in august 
a few months ago i didnt think id have the rest of my 
life curbow said as she prepared for her release from the 
university of chicago medical center now i know the whole thing 
is over that its all gone 
curbow of conyers ga was referred to an atlanta neurosurgeon 
after complaining to her internist about severe headaches the 
neurosurgon performed a biopsy in august and just told her it was 
inoperable mrs curbow said 
the family was told kym would likely lose her sight her memory 
would be affected and that there was very little hope for a 
positive outcome 
every report we got was worse than the one before mrs 
curbow said kym was only 19 at the time and we werent willing 
to just sit and wait for this it was a very stressful time 
using her own medical skills kym tracked down the brain tumor 
information service a national hot line the university of chicago 
operates for people who need information on tumors 
doctors who volunteer for the service talk with those who call 
frequently send additional medical information to them and often 
ask to see medical records 
after looking at curbows medical report and pathology slides 
from her atlanta neurosurgeon we said two things dohrmann 
recalled we werent convinced it was a tumor and second we 
thought there would be a way to remove it safely 
the cyst which shouldnt return likely began with irregular 
cell development before kym was born and may have been the cause of 
the headaches said dohrmann 
dohrmann said curbows atlanta doctor was not at fault but that 
sometimes there are known treatments that can help people like 
this and doctors just arent aware of them 
the hot lines purpose he added is making national resources 
available so that people dont have to depend just on whats 
available locally 
and although not all calls have the happy ending curbows has 
dohrmann said in nearly half the cases in which hot line doctors 
ask to see medical records something more can be done 
kym curbow said she is looking forward to returning to georgia 
baptist hospital school of nursing and now has a new future in 
mind i want to be a neuronurse i think ive had all the 
experience necessary

the louisiana pardon board today 
recommended early release for gary tyler a black man who contends 
an allwhite jury wrongly convicted him of murdering a fellow 
teenager during racial violence in 1974 
amnesty international and other organizations have urged freedom 
for tyler 31 who has spent much of his life on the state prison 
farm at angola for a shooting that occurred when he was 16 
tylers case has produced marches and rallies and most recently 
petitions to the pardon board with more than 12000 signatures the 
british reggae band ub40 recorded a song about tyler and he was 
described by the soviet communist party newspaper pravda in 1978 as 
a political prisoner 
the pardon board voted 32 to recommend gov buddy roemer cut 
tylers life sentence to 60 years that would make tyler eligible 
for release in five years once he has served a third of his 
sentence 
roemers spokesman said the governor was not available for 
comment this morning 
tylers mother juanita tyler said she was happy with the 
decisionbut believes pardon board members would have voted for an 
immediate release had they interviewed him board members routinely 
do not interview inmates unless they are facing death and tylers 
death sentence was commuted in the 1970s 
if they would have talked to gary i think things might have 
been different they dont know gary said mrs tyler 
joseph weber the father of the 13yearold tyler was convicted 
of killing said he would try to influence roemer not to commute 
the sentence 
in october 1974 tyler was an outspoken backer of school 
integration in destrehan a small town on the mississippi river 25 
miles north of new orleans 
state police in riot gear were patrolling the streets amid 
racial fights sparked by the presence of ku klux klansmen led by 
david duke now a republican state representative 
as whites surrounded buses of black students at destrehan high 
school shouting and hurling bottles cans and rocks a shot was 
fired from one of the buses timothy weber standing with his 
mother across the schoolyard fell dead 
witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand tyler was 
the only one on the bus wearing gloves said police 
those who believe tyler was framed say a student who testified 
against him was known as a liar and that police planted a pistol 
found in the stuffing of the torn seat where tyler had sat 
tylers death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when 
the us supreme court struck down the states death penalty law 
but the conviction has withstood appeals

defense secretary dick cheney plans to move 
ahead with building five b2 stealth bombers next fiscal year but 
has not decided on the fate of the full 132plane 70 billion 
program in later years pentagon officials said today 
cheneys decision came as he was putting the final touches on 
the defense budget for fiscal 1991 which is due to be submitted to 
the white house in the coming days for final review before going to 
congress in january the year begins oct 1 1990 
five planes is right for 91 but theres been no decision 
made on the outyears said one source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
amid the reforms under way in the soviet union and the political 
changes in eastern europe congressional critics of the 
radarevading bomber have ridiculed the idea that the full number 
of planes would ever be built 
but cheney has stressed throughout the budget process that he 
prefers to cut entire weapons programs rather than stretching them 
out over longer production periods which makes each unit more 
costly 
the advanced technology bomber is designed to replace the air 
forces aging b52 strategic bomber fleet 
the los angeles times reported in todays editions that cheney 
had decided to build five bombers in 1991 10 in 1992 21 in 1993 
and 24 in 1994 the rest would be completed by fiscal year 1996 
the newspaper said 
officials said later however that no such decision has been 
made 
mr cheney has not reached any decision on his plans for any 
programs in the outyears said defense department spokesman pete 
williams 
williams refused to discuss any of cheneys plans for the 1991 
budget but he noted that the secretary has backed the longrange 
bomber program as an essential part of the nations strategic 
defense 
the pentagon has invested about 23 billion in the program and 
had expressed hopes of purchasing 132 bombers at a cost of about 
70 billion 
but the price of the plane produced sticker shock in 
congress when lawmakers learned the price tag could be in the range 
of 530 million for a single plane 
cheneys decision to move ahead with the program for a single 
year comes as the air force recommended that the production be 
stretched out over a longer period of time 
under the 1990 budget signed by bush last month the congress 
appropriated 45 billion for the program and provided money to 
build two in that fiscal year plans also called for funds for 
components for five more of the radarevading batwinged aircraft 
in 1991 
the pentagon has proposed spending about 24 billion over a 
threeyear peak period for the bomber 78 billion in fiscal 
1992 84 billion in fiscal 1993 and 77 billion in fiscal 1994 
air force secretary donald rice told reporters last week that he 
was looking at plans to extended purchases of the planes beyond 
previous deadlines to meet budgetary constraints and prevent cuts 
to other air force programs 
air force officials have begun studying conventionalweapons 
roles for the b2 as its original mission delivering nuclear 
weapons to soviet targets comes under question with warming 
superpower relations

college and university presidents must regain 
control of their athletic departments an american council on 
education official said today in urging those with ncaa programs to 
attend the sports organizations annual meeting 
james whalen president of ithaca college who is completing his 
term as chairman of the ace board of directors said the ncaa will 
meet jan 79 in dallas to deal with issues vital to the future 
of our institutions 
whalen in a letter to the presidents of about 840 ncaa 
institutions urged them to support a proposal requiring colleges 
to disclose how many of their athletes graduate 
pointing to proposed legislation that would require such 
disclosure whalen said if the ncaa does not adopt such a policy 
the congress of the united states will do it for us 
federal intrusion in this area would set a very dangerous 
precedent and would open a door that we will never be able to close 
again said whalen 
the highest number of presidents to ever turn up at the ncaa 
meeting was 199 whalen said and 25 percent participation is 
simply not enough he said many presidents designate another 
person usually the athletic director to attend the convention 
unless the presidents recognize the need to participate actively 
in the ncaa were making a very serious mistake and our 
credibility will be very very poor he said 
the letter also asked for support of a proposal to shorten the 
lengths of season for football and basketball 
we genuinely believe that these are meaningful proposals and 
that they represent real steps toward reform whalen said in the 
letter they are not the final answer of course but they are a 
good beginning and they will be adopted only if we have the 
support of our colleagues across the nation 
whalen acknowledged that the presidents at many ncaa 
institutions have little control over their athletics departments 
and some have grown used to the extra revenue generated by the 
various programs but he insisted the president must take 
responsibility for all aspects of that institution including 
athletics 
attending ncaa meetings has not been high on the agenda of 
presidents for a number of years but this is a very important 
responsibility that they have he said

a former leader of a just say no chapter 
drew 60 days in jail and a 1000 fine for possessing cocaine and 
not paying tax on it becoming the first person prosecuted under an 
idaho law levying a tax on drugs 
victor h smith 23 also was placed on three years probation 
wednesday he entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges 
under which he retains the right to appeal the case and challenge 
the law which took effect july 1 
police said they found almost an ounce of cocaine in a car he 
was driving in july 
the drugtax law imposes both civil and criminal penalties for 
not affixing tax stamps to illegal drugs at least 18 other states 
have taxes of some kind on illegal drugs according to the council 
of state governments in lexington ky 
the state tax commission is prohibited from trying to establish 
the identity of anyone who buys tax stamps 
however supporters say the law raises the cost of dealing in 
drugs and gives prosecutors another charge to throw at a suspect 
arrested on a drug offense 
smith was vice president of the local just say no antidrug 
organization until he was removed from that position in april 
no ones perfect defense attorney charles stroschein said 
lots of people have responsible positions and fall off the 
bandwagon 
judge ron schilling delayed execution of the sentences pending 
smiths appeal 
the tax stamps are about 2 inches square and are green for 
marijuana blue for controlled substances sold by quantity and red 
for those sold by dosage they cost 350 per gram for marijuana 
and 200 per gram for cocaine

house democrats complain that the white house 
is more prepared to dispatch highlevel officials across the world 
to reach out to the leaders of china than to send one official to 
capitol hill to explain the action 
members of a house foreign affairs panel had sought the 
testimony of deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger who 
over the weekend accompanied national security adviser brent 
scowcroft to china 
when the white house blocked eagleburgers appearance on 
wednesday democrats accused the administration of hiding out 
to avoid embarrassment 
it seems the bush administration is willing to send mr 
eagleburger 6000 miles to apologize to the chinese leaders but it 
was not willing to send him two miles to capitol hill to explain 
this action to congress said rep sam gejdenson dconn 
the us officials apologized gejdenson asserted for being 
offended by the savage squelching of those who courageously sought 
basic freedoms in tiananmen square 
meanwhile the state department announced wednesday that china 
has approved a new voice of america correspondent to replace the 
newsman expelled after the government crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
we welcome the decision to approve stephanie mann nealers 
accreditation the state department said in a statement 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today its 
difficult to assign a specific motive to why they did it but we 
think its a good sign 
asked if the administration considered it an important step 
fitzwater said well this is a world where signs and signals are 
important which is a lot of what all this is about as we 
reconsider our diplomatic relationship 
nealer is head of the voas east asia and pacific news 
department voa correspondent al pessin and associated press 
newsman john pomfret were expelled from china after being accused 
of spreading rumors and lies about the military crackdown 
gejdenson and other democrats vowed to press early next year for 
the imposition of punitive sanctions against the chinese government 
in retaliation for the killings of demonstrators 
the democrats also stepped up their verbal attack 
by bowing and scraping to the butchers of beijing the 
administration has sent china and the world a message that is not 
worthy of the worlds greatest democracy and one which does not 
represent the views of the american people gejdenson said 
this mission will not be recalled with honor but with a deep 
sense of shame said rep peter kostmayer dpa 
but rep jim leach riowa defending bush said the democratic 
criticism has become so shrill and partisan that it may well 
backfire 
i dont know of a soul who believes that the scowcroft mission 
went to beijing to apologize to the chinese leach said 
this congress and this administration have no intention of 
kowtowing to illegitimate chinese actions leach said but added 
that he believes the united states has an obligation to take 
whatever steps it can to persuade the chinese to lift the yoke of 
political oppression 
leach said the scowcrofteagleburger mission can be seen as a 
test of the administrations ability to help extricate a proud 
nation from an embarrassing corner 
president bush is prudentially betting that an historically 
xenophobic china is more likely to temper its stridency at home and 
abroad if it isnt perceived to be capitulating to the pressure of 
foreign powers leach said 
two witnesses professor merle goldman of boston university and 
minxin pei a chinese graduate student at harvard university said 
they believed the president made a serious error in sending the two 
officials to beijing 
this visit is being trumpeted by the conservative hardliners 
in china as a triumph of their reactionary policies and as a 
seal of approval on their repressive regime pei said 
but doak barnett a veteran china scholar and professor emeritus 
at johns hopkins university said bush made the right move because 
it is imperative to have a dialogue with the chinese leaders at 
the highest levels especially at this time 
i believe congress should allow several months to permit 
president bushs initiative to be tested barnett said adding 
that he believes there is reason for hope that the reform movement 
in china will eventually be revived

a littleknown moslem group today 
threatened to kill pope john paul ii because it said he has 
supported lebanons rebellious christian leader gen michel aoun 
the communique from the group the organization for the defense 
of the oppressed also told the roman catholic envoy living in this 
country papal nuncio pablo puente to leave lebanon soonest 
the statement was delivered to a western news agency as the pope 
was criticized by lebanese leftists for failing to receive arab 
mediators seeking to end the 14yearold civil war between moslems 
and christians 
the organization for the defense of the oppressed after 
consultations with its forces fighting international arrogance 
announces that it has issued the death sentence on the pope of 
rome said the handwritten arabic message the 92word statement 
said the killing will be carried out sooner or later it 
charged that the pontiff has become the spiritual guide of the 
mutinous crusaders in east beirut a reference to aoun and his 
supporters in the christian enclave north of the capital who have 
rejected a new christianmoslem government aoun wants guarantees 
that syrian forces will pull out 
last month the pope said the vatican cannot remain neutral 
and that it is time for sacrifices for the sake of peace 
in what at the time appeared to be an appeal to aoun to back down 
the message added one should sometimes choose the less painful 
options 
there was nothing to authenticate the moslem groups statement 
which used shiite moslem fundamentalist language similar to that of 
proiranian extremist factions holding most of the 18 western 
hostages in lebanon including nine americans those groups usually 
send a phototograph of a hostage with their statements as 
authentication 
the organization for the defense of the oppressed issued one 
previous unauthenticated statement aug 28 threatening to kill the 
pope if he visited lebanon the group has not claimed 
responsibility for any terrorist acts and its leaders size and 
overall goals are unknown 
aoun has rejected an arab peace plan under which a new 
christian president elias hrawi was elected nov 24 because the 
accord did not specify when syrias 40000 peacekeeping troops 
would leave lebanon 
hrawi fired aoun from all his posts but aoun and 20000 loyal 
troops are holding out at the presidential palace in the christian 
enclave 
newspapers and radio stations controlled by the leftist and 
moslems in beirut said the saudi arabian moroccan and algerian 
foreign ministers were in rome on wednesday during a tour of arab 
and western countries aimed at bringing pressure on aoun to stop 
defying the hrawi government 
the beirut media quoted vatican officials as saying the pope was 
unable to meet the delegation because he was preoccupied with 
religious preparations for christmas newspapers said the ministers 
turned down a papal suggestion they meet his foreign secretary 
cardinal augustino casarolli 
there was no immediate comment available from the vatican or the 
algerian and moroccan embassies in rome an unidentified official 
at the saudi embassy said his countrys foreign minister was not in 
the city 
newspaper and radio reports said the popes attitude would 
hamper the peace process and help cement lebanons de facto 
partition into sectarian states

chinas largest computer company has survived 
despite the involvement of its former head in the prodemocracy 
movement but it has seen a decline in business because of the 
governments current economic policies its new president said 
thursday 
shen guojun president and chairman of the board of stone co 
also said his ousted predecessor and former partner wan runnan 
has no legal right to any assets in the company 
wan and two other senior officials of stone fled china following 
the military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in which they 
had been deeply involved 
the government alleged the 43yearold entrepreneur had donated 
54000 to the student movement although for some of that amount 
wan is believed to have acted only as a gobetween for other 
contributors to the students 
police are believed to have issued a warrant for his arrest as 
an instigator of what is officially called a counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
shen said at a news conference that wan decided by himself to 
take part in the turmoil against the will of the company and that 
as a result he was fired from his posts 
shen insisted no employees had been punished for assisting wan 
in supporting the students wans brother and father still work in 
the financial section of the company he said 
he said the government froze company bank accounts until 
september for political reasons apparently to keep wan from 
withdrawing money but has not interfered with stones management 
or independence 
stone is still getting a lot of favorable treatment from the 
government he said 
but he said turnover and profits are down 20 percent this year 
due to a government austerity program which has left customers 
short of funds and the political turmoil of may and june 
stone which commands 80 percent of chinas word processor 
market had a turnover of 203 million in 1988 double the 1987 
figure and profits of 135 million 
shen said stone also has had to adjust its product line as the 
government now moving to strengthen its socialist central planning 
system emphasizes heavy industry and other basic industries 
another company official said the company previously put too 
much emphasis on electronics and office automation and now has 
shifted to marketing industrial control devices 
stone also has abandoned the idea of selling shares to the 
public 
we dont think its a proper time right now to put stone 
shares on the market said hu zhaoguang president of the beijing 
special zone for high technology in the haidian university area of 
northwest beijing 
stone was founded in 1984 by wan shen and two other former 
computer experts at the chinese academy of sciences 
it quickly became chinas foremost computer company and a symbol 
of the entrepreneurial spirit encouraged by senior leader deng 
xiaopings marketoriented reforms 
the independently run collective employs nearly 700 people and 
accounts for 50 percent of the business in the haidian district 
known as beijings silicon valley 
but in may wan is said to have joined student leaders in 
calling for deng and premier li peng to step down members of a 
stone research institute collected signatures for a petition 
calling for a meeting of chinas legislature to discuss ending 
martial law imposed by li on may 20 
wan fled china soon after the june 34 military crackdown and is 
based in paris where he is an active participant in the overseas 
chinese prodemocracy movement 
shen acknowledged wans role in the success of stone he did 
his part and contributed to the development of this company

palestinian guerrillas armed with guns and 
grenades attacked a syrian garrison in southern lebanon before dawn 
today police said at least 10 combatants were killed and 40 
wounded 
about 150 raiders ransacked the threestory headquarters in a 
twohour foray that started from sidons ein elhilweh refugee 
camp police said 
police and other sources said the attackers belonged to plo 
chairman yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction police and other 
sources said 
but the palestine liberation organization without explicitly 
denying launching the attack issued a statement at its tunisia 
headquarters condemning the raid by unidentified armed men the 
kuwaiti news agency said 
also today a moslem group threatened to kill pope john paul ii 
claiming he supports the christian leader gen michel aoun the 
general has refused to surrender to a new christianmoslem 
government trying to end the countrys 14yearold sectarian war 
and has demanded that syrian troops leave lebanon 
the organization for the defense of the oppressed also said in a 
communique that the roman catholic envoy in lebanon papal nuncio 
pablo puente must leave lebanon soonest there was no way of 
authenticating the message 
the littleknown group which has never claimed responsibility 
for a terrorist attack in august threatened to kill the pope if he 
visited lebanon 
the attackers in sidon used jeepmounted 107mm recoilless guns 
shoulderfired rocketpropelled grenades and ak47 assault rifles 
police said 
some of the dozen or so syrian guards who were caught by 
surprise fought handtohand to stop the attack but they were 
hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned a police spokesman said 
he said it was the first attack the palestinians had ever staged 
against the syrian army whose southernmost garrisons in lebanon 
are across the awali river which is on the northern edge of sidon 
40 miles north of the israeli border and nearly 25 miles south of 
beirut 
the syrians are moving troops and armor to the area 
apparently to counterattack the situation is frightening said 
the police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations 
he was evidently alluding to fears the syrians might cross the 
river to take revenge on fatah even at the risk of sparking a 
confrontation with israel 
police could not give a complete breakdown of the 10 killed 
they said they included at least two attackers also killed were 
three militiamen of the leftist nasserite organization the sunni 
moslem group that has ruled sidon since the 1975 outbreak of 
lebanons civil war who were manning a checkpoint on a nearby 
bridge 
sidon lebanons third largest city with a population of 
350000 closed down in daylong general strike called by the 
nasserites to protest the attack which they blamed exclusively 
on fatah 
arafat has been at loggerheads with president hafez assad of 
syria since assads army backed palestinian dissidents in 1983 who 
forced arafat to evacuate lebanons northern port of tripoli 
arafat had set up command there after his expulsion from beirut 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to drive out arafats guerrillas 
from his main west beirut redoubt and made it plain when it 
withdrew in 1983 that it would not tolerate any syrian military 
presence south of the awali 
the syrians had withdrawn most of their 100man garrison from 
the twomile coastal strip just across the awali three weeks ago 
when they massed on mountaintops in central lebanon to put pressure 
on aoun 
fatah guerrillas filtered back into lebanon the last three years 
and western military sources estimate their strength in the sidon 
region at about 5000 hardcore fighters 
the syrians maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league mandate to smother lebanons moslemchristian civil war

nato leaders today disclosed that arrangements 
are being made for an unprecedented visit by soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to the organizations headquarters 
the move was announced after the 16 foreign ministers meeting 
here set aside a squabble over a turkish port and approved the 
draft of a treaty to reduce western and warsaw pact forces in 
europe 
a nato spokesman said shevardnadze had requested a meeting in 
brussels on monday or tuesday with secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner 
we are now trying to arrange for mr shevardnadze to have a 
meeting said the spokesman robin stafford 
it would be the first visit to nato headquarters by a soviet 
foreign minister the purpose and agenda of the meeting were not 
immediately known he had already planned a trip to brussels to 
sign a trade agreement with the european community 
the initiative originated at a dinner meeting wednesday night 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and the foreign 
ministers of britain france and west germany sources said 
nato and the warsaw pact are moving to complete a treaty to 
reduce their nonnuclear forces in europe the two military 
alliances appear to be moving into a new stage as east and west 
draw closer together 
among the key provisions of the draft are setting a ceiling of 
275000 for us and soviet troops on foreign soil and sharp 
cutbacks in tanks artillery and other nonnuclear weapons 
in vienna where the negotiators are meeting nato presented the 
proposal polish ambassador wlodzimierz konarski speaking on 
behalf of the sevennation warsaw pact said his alliance is eager 
to examine western proposals 
earlier the warsaw pact presented proposals that would reduce 
six categories of weaponry and have an agreement ready for signing 
by next year 
greece had demanded the nato draft explicitly cite the turkish 
port of mersin as subject to the reductions that are to take place 
across the vast expanse of europe the port was used by turkey in 
its 1974 invasion of cyprus 
after several hours of deliberatiion the ministers decided to 
set the dispute aside but also to give greece an opportunity to 
make its case outside the text possibly in a footnote 
it was agreed hurd said that the text should be tabled 
by everybody ie the consensus was maintained 
he said woerner was told to note that there were certain 
matters covered by several articles which required further 
elaboration 
a nato official demanding anonymity said of the dispute it 
was left open it wont be an obstacle to presenting the text 
the ministers wanted to move quickly because the warsaw pact was 
expected to present its version of the treaty by the end of the 
week the current round of negotiations will be recessed dec 21 
for yearend holidays 
at the start of the nato meeting woerner the alliances top 
official urged the western military alliance to maintain a strong 
defense to ensure the spectacular changes unfolding in the east 
remain peaceful 
since august poland has elected the first noncommunistled 
government in the soviet bloc hungary has ousted its hardline 
communist leaders and disbanded the party east germany has lifted 
travel restrictions opened the berlin wall replaced its hardline 
leaders and scheduled free elections and a government dominated by 
noncommunists has taken control of czechoslovakia 
woerner said a solid security base was needed so that no 
government will ever be tempted to resort to force to solve its 
domestic problems 
the twoday meeting of nato foreign ministers is focused on a 
us prescription for an architecture for a new europe that 
would gradually extend natos mission to the political arena 
woerner a former west german defense minister said the 16 
western governments must make arrangements for transition from a 
postworld war ii order to a europe whole and free and to a state 
of peace in europe in which the german people regains its unity 
through free selfdetermination 
baker who outlined the us plan in a speech tuesday in west 
berlin envisions the alliance as a permament monitor of troop 
reductions now being negotiated with the warsaw pact and as a 
mediator in regional disputes 
woerner told the ministers that the alliance must remain in 
place to provide security and stability throughout the long 
period of transition that we are now entering change needs 
stability 
the developments we have seen thus far have been impressively 
peaceful he said but the pressures which might be released by 
longoverdue change could prove explosive 
norways foreign minister kjell magne bondevik cautioned that 
periods of rapid change carry with them the inherent danger of 
instability 
the tasks that face the reformers of eastern europe are 
enormous he told his colleagues 
he said the reforms that have taken place must be consolidated 
it will take time to establish new stable political and 
economic structures he said we have no guarantee against 
setbacks 
us officials said they did not expect bakers plan to be 
implemented at the twoday meeting of the north atlantic council 
the plan is designed to address the possibility of a reunified 
germany anchoring it in a western political and military alliance 
east germany has been moscows staunchiest ally in the warsaw 
pact and the soviet union opposes german reunification 
within nato itself baker is unlikely to encounter any serious 
opposition 
woerner told a news conference wednesday that he was fully in 
line with bakers approach 
and joe clark the canadian foreign minister said both 
alliances can become instruments of stability amid the upheaval 
in the communist arena 
clark at a separate news conference said nato would take on 
more of a political role with an eye on regional disputes and the 
environment

after the big weekend party 
celebrating a heady revolution the opposition woke up to a new 
battle with the communists over whether playwright vaclav havel 
could be president of czechoslovakia 
the opposition appeared to have prevailed on wednesday when the 
communists agreed that parliament would choose a president not 
affiliated with any party that apparently paved the way for havel 
but communist party spokesman josef hora today denied an 
agreement had been reached he said the partys negotiators were 
not authorized to offer a binding commitment and that only the full 
party congress on dec 2021 can do that 
the battle was a reminder that the communist party which in 
three weeks surrendered its 41year monopoly on power still wields 
some clout 
tens of thousands of communists are rumored to have handed in 
their party cards since a nov 17 police crackdown on peaceful 
student demonstrators drove a disgusted nation into revolt 
but those left in the party like everybody else in 
czechoslovakia have already started campaigning for the free 
parliamentary elections next year and are using what remains of 
their power as skillfully as they can against the opposition 
picking right up on the newest trend in east european politics 
where the largest opposition groups in hungary east germany and 
czechoslovakia all are called forums communist reformers 
founded a democratic forum to give the party a new liberal 
face 
the image makeover is expected to go further with another 
leadership overhaul at the partys extraordinary congress next 
week just a month after thediscredited hardliners who had ruled 
for 21 years were ousted 
meanwhile thousands of orthodox communists remain in powerful 
positions in factories offices villages and towns across the 
country many of them handpicked to run czechoslovakia after the 
1968 warsaw pact invasion 
the factual power of the party is not broken yet noted 
marek benda son of a wellknown dissident and a student leader 
the students lauded as national heroes for their role in 
starting the revolt were the only ones who did not join in the 
general celebrations of the end of oneparty communist rule 
instead displaying the same political determination that 
powered the revolt they decided to continue their strike two of 
their reasons were that local communists were still obstructing 
opposition activists in remote regions such as east slovakia and 
that havel was not yet president 
we knew from the beginning that the communists would try to 
make things dark and to cheat said benda 
the tussle over the presidency proved the students suspicions 
right 
civic forum spokesman lubos dobrovsky says it was implicitly 
agreed last week at talks between all parties and the opposition 
that a nonparty czech would become president 
the description clearly fit havel a former political prisoner 
who symbolizes czechoslovakias peaceful fight for freedom 
the communists wont say what happened to that agreement 
either there was a revolt by the communist deputies in 
parliament a conservative group picked in the last elections 
in 1986 or the communist leaders decided to play for time 
they demanded a referendum instead of a straight parliamentary 
election on the presidency finally they agreed on wednesday that 
the president should be elected by parliament before the end of 
january 
in the eyes of the opposition havel is the only person who can 
be president because as cerny put it his slate is clean 
after four years in jail and 13 years standing up to police 
harassment havel is viewed as a guarantor of the new freedoms just 
won in czechoslovakia someone who will make sure there is no 
backsliding 
thus civic forum has mounted an enthusiastic campaign for havel 
handing out thousands of posters at its prague headquarters for 
visitors to take back to the country and plastering thousands more 
all around the city center 
many opposition activists are determined to go all out to make 
havel president 
any other president would delay the cause said composer 
michael kocab a key negotiator with the communists 
he believes havel will best calm the situation in 
czechoslovakia encouraging reform and western investment 
others who did not want to be named want havel as president 
but say this is less important than the victory already won over 
the communists 
a great debating point this week has been which posters of 
havel give the wouldbe president the best image 
this is not america we are not running an american 
campaign cerny told a czech visiting civic forum headquarters 
who complained about havels image either he wins as he is or 
he loses we are not afraid of that

author shana alexander didnt libel a new 
york city psychologist accused of sleeping with a patient new york 
states highest court ruled today 
the court of appeals refused to reinstate psychologist herman 
weiners 1 million libel suit against alexander and the doubleday 
book company publisher of nutcracker money madness murder a 
family album 
in a separate opinion today the court also refused to reinstate 
an austrian research companys libel suit against a scientific 
journal a lower court had dismissed both lawsuits before any 
damages were awarded 
alexanders book detailed the murder of franklin graham and the 
trials of his grandson marc schreuder and daughter frances 
schreuder for the crime 
weiner an advocate of the controversial primal scream 
therapy treated ms schreuder court papers said 
the book reports a claim by richard behrens a friend of ms 
schreuders that the woman always slept with her shrinks 
according to the book grahams mother sister and brotherinlaw 
said they had always suspected hankypanky between weiner and 
ms schreuder 
weiner who is married has denied having sex with ms schreuder 
but the court refused to reinstate the libel suit saying 
alexander had sufficiently confirmed the challenged statement 
because she or her researcher had talked to the people most 
familiar with ms schreuders personal life 
under state case law when a topic is one of legitimate public 
concern a defamed person must establish that the publisher was 
grossly irresponsible in gathering information to prove libel 
the court said the case didnt meet that standard 
alexanders lawyers had asked the court to rule that the 
statement was opinion and therefore deserving of constitutional 
free speech protection but the court refused 
we leave for another day the question whether opinion 
protection whould be enlarged to encompass the type of work that is 
the focus of the present controversy judge judith kaye wrote in 
a unanimous decision 
the other libel case involved immuno ag a company that conducts 
research on chimpanzees the company sued the editor of the journal 
of medical primatology accusing dr jan moorjankowski of 
knowingly publishing false material in a letter to the editor 
immuno ag said the letter which accused the company of killing 
chimpanzee mothers to get animals for testing made it the target 
of animal rights activists 
the letter was preceded by an editors note identifying its 
writer as an animal rights activist and said that the companys 
lawyers considered her statements to be inaccurate 
the court in a decision also by judge kaye concluded that the 
letter reflected someones opinion and was protected by 
constitutional free speech guarantees

parliament today postponed action on a 
motion to abolish the communist partys 43yearold monopoly on 
power provoking an outraged response from thousands of 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
bulgarians had widely expected the legislature to approve a 
request by the central committee of the communist party to strike a 
clause from the constitution guaranteeing the partys leading role 
after state radio announced the decision to defer discussion on 
the motion for a month more than 20000 protesters outside 
parliament became angry 
we are here the demonstrators shouted in unison to the 
communist deputies inside come on out 
officials justified the decision by citing a littleknown law 
stating that any motion to change the constitution must be acted on 
not less than a month after it is made but no later than three 
months afterward 
on wednesday the partys governing central committee closed a 
threeday meeting by voting to propose that parliament strike two 
clauses from the constitution that enshrine the partys leading 
role 
if the proposal had been adopted by parliament romania and the 
soviet union would have become the only warsaw pact countries where 
the communists political supremacy is legally guaranteed 
the bulgarian party also expelled former hardline leader todor 
zhivkov from the party he ran unchallenged for 35 years until his 
ouster last month opening the possibility that zhivkov could be 
prosecuted for corruption 
in other developments regarding eastern europe today 
east germany met another opposition demand by abolishing the 
agency that controls the countrys oncefeared secret police 
in brussels the 16 nato foreign ministers approved the draft 
of a treaty to that sets a ceiling of 275000 for us and soviet 
troops on foreign soil and sharp cutbacks in tanks artillery and 
other nonnuclear weapons the nato llies also considered a us 
plan that would gradually extend natos mission to the political 
arena to better cope with the reforms in eastern europe 
petar mladenov who replaced zhivkov as bulgarias party chief 
and has charted a reform course told the central committee 
meeting on wednesday to prepare for free elections in may 
we have to conquer this time in the real sense of the 
word the hearts and minds of the millions of bulgarians 
soon we will face a nationwide exam free and democratic 
elections and it is there we must show that we are not only 
worthy of but also practically capable of leading the country 
some of mladenovs remarks at the closing session were carried 
by bta the official news agency 
mladenov who served as foreign minister for 18 years under 
zhivkov has moved swiftly to oust associates of his predecessor 
from the partys ruling politburo in favor of people more likely to 
embrace reform 
politburo member andrei lukanov told a news conference wednesday 
that the central committee would call also on parliament to draft a 
new electoral law guaranteeing the possibility of holding free 
and democratic elections next year lukanov considered second in 
the new hierarchy after mladenov said the communists were ready 
for dialogue with all public forces and movements in bulgaria 
asked if the party was willing to go into the opposition if it 
loses the elections lukanov said we have to wait and see 
elections for a party are there to be won and we aspire to win 
them 
at a communistsponsored rally wednesday evening about 60000 
people cheered mladenov when he told them that party had decided to 
scrap its guaranteed leading role 
this has been a key demand of the opposition for which 
thousands of people expressed support in recent days by joining in 
mass rallies 
our glorious party doesnt need this guarantee anymore 
mladenov told the rally outside party headquarters without it we 
can win 
in a speech to the central committee on monday mladenov said 
the party should start talks with independent groups immediately 
and relinquish the guarantee of sole power as has been done this 
year in poland hungary east germany and czechoslovakia he 
proposed that free elections be held by may 
lukanov said the decision to expel zhivkov from the party was 
unanimous he said the former leader was ousted for gross 
violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics which brought the 
country to a serious crisis 
there have been widespread calls for the 78yearold zhivkov to 
be prosecuted for corruption and abuses of power during his 
autocratic rule 
zhivkov has been accused publicly of living lavishly in a 
workers state in 13 opulent official residences and six hunting 
lodges his son vladimir and milko balev a close associate were 
also thrown out of the party 
officials say the residences and lodges will be turned over to 
the public

the parliament of the principality 
of liechtenstein voted unanimously thursday to have their wealthy 
but tiny nation bid for membership in the united nations 
all 25 legislators backed a government proposal to send a formal 
application to un secretary general javier perez de cuellar in 
the spring 
hans brunhart the chief of government said the vote was a 
historic step in liechtensteins foreign policy if the un 
general assembly approves the bid in its session next fall 
liechtenstein would be the smallest member state 
chief advocate of a un role has been prince hans adam ii who 
became head of state last month following the death of his father 
franz josef ii 
hans adam has said that only by joining the world body could 
liechtenstein obtain worldwide recognition as a sovereign state he 
said the principality might one day face locked doors if it 
stayed outside 
the road toward un membership was cleared in march when 
liechtenstein voters narrowly rejected a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would have made accession to any international body 
subject to popular approval 
in a 1986 referendum in neighboring switzerland a government 
proposal to seek un membership was defeated by a large majority 
the exportoriented nation of 26000 people is linked to 
switzerland in a customs and currency union and has one of the 
highest percapita incomes in the world after world war i members 
of the league of nations the forerunner of the un had 
successfully opposed admitting liechtenstein officially on the 
grounds that it has no army then a characteristic of as sovereign 
nation 
since 1978 liechtenstein is already a member of the council of 
europe in the past few decades it also has joined several other 
international organizations and is a signatory of the helsinki act 
of the conference for security and cooperation in europe

house republican whip newt gingrich has run up 
more than 125000 in legal fees in preparing his defense against 
ethics charges and is appealing to past campaign contributors to 
help pay the bills an aide said thursday 
spokesman rich galen said gingrich has had two lawyers working 
to prepare a defense so he would be ready should the house ethics 
committee decide to launch a formal investigation of two compliants 
that have been filed against him by rep bill alexander dark 
its like buying insurance galen said you hope you dont 
have to use it 
both complaints are pending before the ethics committee the 
first alleges that gingrich violated house rules and federal 
campaign finance laws by getting 21 investors to put up 5000 each 
to promote his 1984 book window of opportunity 
an outside counsel hired to evaluate that complaint concluded in 
october that there was no reason for the panel to investigate 
gingrich who rose to prominence in the house after filing the 
ethics complaint that led to the resignation last june of former 
house speaker jim wright 
a week after the outside counsel made its recommendation 
alexander filed another complaint along with 670 pages of 
supporting documents accusing the georgia congressman of ethics 
and campaign finance violations in seven new areas 
galen said the legal work on gingrichs defense has been done 
primarily by two washington attorneys former arkansas rep ed 
bethune and dan swillinger he said other lawyers also may have 
been consulted during work on the defense 
because gingrich does not have enough money in his campaign 
account to pay the attorneys bills galen said a fundraising 
appeal to about 12000 past contributors was mailed out last week 
in his most recent filing with the federal election commission 
gingrich reported that as of june 30 he had 35847 in leftover 
debts from his 1988 reelection campaign and had a cash balance in 
his 1990 campaign account of 50297 
in the fundraising letter gingrich described the ethics 
complaints as a political witch hunt the liberals launched 
against me earlier this year in the form of hundreds of baseless 
charges 
this fight has severely weakened the financial condition of my 
campaign committee the letter continued and this is precisely 
the result these liberals wanted to achieve my campaign is very 
financially vulnerable going into an election year 
urging his contributors to show them they will have to fight 
it out at the ballot box rather than through smears at the ethics 
committee gingrich asked for a very special contribution of 
100 75 50 or even 25 
during the wright investigation gingrich repeatedly used his 
ethics campaign against the former speaker as a fundraising tool 
for a political action committee created to help elect republicans 
to state and local offices

about a dozen of larry mahoneys 
relatives went to court today in a show of support and to hear him 
tell his story about the night his pickup collided headon with a 
church bus and killed 27 people 
the 36yearold factory worker from rural owen county was 
expected to take the stand after crossexamination today of an 
accidentreconstruction expert 
mahoneys parents son brother and sisters were among those in 
the courtroom at his murder trial 
i would have crawled to get here said judy odonovan his 
sister 
mahoney has been very emphatic about taking the witness 
stand and giving his version of events leading up to what 
authorities say is the nations worst drunkendriving accident 
said defense attorney william summers 
he wants to tell his story he will tell his story summers 
said wednesday he obviously feels bad for all the people 
involved in this tragedy 
on wednesday a defense witness disputed official 
reconstructions of the accident saying mahoney tried to avoid a 
headon collision with the bus wilbur r meredith iii also 
testified that the bus had several serious design flaws and was not 
being used for its intended purpose 
twentyfour youngsters and three adults died and a dozen 
children were seriously burned in the may 14 1988 bus crash on 
interstate 71 south of carrollton the prosecution contends the 
tragedy was caused after an intoxicated mahoney driving the wrong 
way crashed into the bus 
mahoney faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the 
charges 27 counts of murder 42 of wanton endangerment 12 of 
assault and one of drunken driving 
meredith on wednesday confirmed the prosecutions basic finding 
mahoneys pickup truck hit the loaded church bus 
but merediths account differed from those of the national 
transportation safety board and the state police 
the prosecution had said mahoney took no evasive action before 
colliding into the right front section of the bus 
meredith said mahoney may have believed he was on a twolane 
highway when he came upon the bus and a blue cadillac 
the sedan was passing the bus on the right side and swerved to 
avoid mahoneys truck he said the pickup also swerved and 
sideswiped the car the truck then struck the frontright part of 
the bus and spun away he said 
in the prosecution version the truck struck the bus first 
rotated and hit the rear drivers side portion of the cadillac 
meredith based his version on at least 400 computer simulations 
of the crash in part by using ntsb computer programs the jury 
viewed a videotape showing a computerized diagram of the crash 
with rectangular boxes representing the three vehicles

business inventories climbed to their highest 
level in two months in october the government said thursday and 
some analysts said that while the backlog had not reached dangerous 
heights yet it was flashing warning signs 
we have not reached the point where we need to call out the 
marines but there are some warning signals said robert g 
dederick chief economist for the northern trust co in chicago 
on the other hand economist michael p niemira of mitsubishi 
bank in new york said that while businesses need be cautious they 
have better inventory control now and should be able to correct 
problems before they become too serious 
the commerce department said inventories climbed 04 percent to 
a seasonally adjusted 7939 billion in october after remaining 
flat in september the september report was revised from a 02 
percent increase reported earlier and followed a 04 percent 
advance in august 
business sales meanwhile dropped 07 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 5192 billion in october after falling a revised 07 
percent in september september sales originally were reported to 
have fallen 03 percent after rising 3 percent in august 
the october business activity produced a slight increase to 
153 in the ratio of sales meaning it would take 153 months to 
exhaust inventories at the october pace the ratio was 151 in 
september and 150 in august 
if inventories were to pile up excessively it could mean 
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs perhaps leading to a 
recession however neither dederick nor niemira found the ratio at 
a dangerous level yet 
niemira suggested it reflected the end of the slowgrowth cycle 
and predicted that things will begin to look better in 1990 
in fact things began to look better on wednesday when the 
commerce department reported an 08 percent improvement in retail 
sales in november the biggest in four months as shoppers began 
the christmas giftbuying season 
that and other recent economic indicators reflect the easing in 
federal reserve interestrate policies analysts say the fed had 
kept a tight rein on credit for more than a year to slow inflation 
but began loosening its grip last june permitting shortterm rates 
to fall gradually 
the october report showed retail sales slumped 13 percent 
while retail inventories edged down 03 percent excluding the 
automobile category inventories rose 1 percent 
the commerce department reported that retail automobile 
inventories fell 37 percent in october but niemira said that 
represented some problems with the governments seasonal adjustment 
factor since car sales have plummeted since the end of september 
inventories at the manufacturing level which represent about 45 
percent of the total rose 03 percent manufacturing sales on the 
other hand dropped 06 percent 
wholesalers inventories jumped 17 percent while their sales 
were off 01 percent 
overall inventories were 41 percent above those of a year ago 
while sales increased 69 percent over october 1988

the vatican warned catholics on thursday 
that such methods as zen yoga and transcendental meditation can 
degenerate into a cult of the body and it urged proper 
christian prayer 
a document issued by the vaticans congregation for the doctrine 
of the faith the popes guardian of orthodoxy said increased 
attempts to fuse eastern and catholic meditation pose dangers and 
errors 
it said these efforts need to have their contents and methods 
ever subjected to a thoroughgoing examination so as to avoid the 
danger of falling into syncretism the merging of different 
religious practices 
it was believed the first time the vatican has addressed 
publicly the problems raised by what it ackowledged is the strong 
attraction for some catholics of methods inspired by eastern 
religions such as hinduism and buddhism 
the 23page document approved by pope john paul ii and 
addressed to bishops said some forms of eastern meditation can be 
positive 
one can take from them what is useful as so long as the 
christian conception of prayer its logic and requirements are 
never obscured the document said 
the love of god the sole object of christian contemplation 
is a reality which cannot be mastered by any method or 
technique it added 
the congregation president cardinal joseph ratzinger of west 
germany said the report was not condemning eastern methods but 
elaborating on guidelines for genuine christian prayer 
the fundamental affirmation of the document is very simple 
ratzinger told a news conference christian meditation is not 
submersion in an impersonal divine atmosphere in an abyss without 
face or form 
without identifying them ratzinger and other vatican officials 
said the document was directly especially to religious movements 
associations prayer groups monasteries and convents that have 
strayed in the use of eastern meditation practices 
the document defined christian prayer as a personal intimate 
and profound dialogue between man and god 
such prayer flees from impersonal techniques or from 
concentrating on oneself which can create a kind of rut 
imprisoning the person praying in a spriritual privatism 
in a footnote the document described eastern methods as zen 
transcendental meditation and yoga which involves prescribed 
postures and controlled breathing 
the document said some catholics turn to these techniques for 
therapeutic reasons and to escape from the stress and pressures of 
modernday life 
without doubt a christian needs certain periods of retreat 
into solitude to be recollected and in gods presence rediscover 
his path it said nevertheless his method of getting 
closer to god is not based on any technique in the strict sense of 
the word 
the church has faced the problem of erroneous ways of 
praying from its early history the document said these forms 
seem once more to impress many christians appealing to them as a 
kind of remedy be it psychological or spiritual or as a quick way 
of finding god it said 
the document expressed particular concern over misconceptions 
about body postures in meditation 
it said the exercise of the jesus prayer which is adapted 
to the natural rhythm of breathing can be of real help to many 
people the jesus prayer consists of repeating a formula of 
invocation and supplication such as lord jesus christ son of 
god have mercy on me 
but other forms of eastern psychological symbolism can 
degenerate into a cult of the body and can lead surreptitiously 
to considering all bodily sensations as spiritual experiences 
the document said 
some physical experiences it added automatically produce 
a feeling of quiet and relaxation pleasing sensations perhaps 
even phenomena of light and of warmth which resemble spiritual 
wellbeing to take such feelings for authentic consolations of the 
holy spirit would be a totally erroneous way of conceiving the 
spriritual life 
a false mystical experience represents a kind of mental 
schizophrenia which could also lead to psychic disturbance and at 
times to moral deviations 
ratzinger said improper forms of meditation are based on 
egotistical concerns 
the spiritual or infinite which has assumed an impersonal 
dimension becomes simply a bath in which the human being 
strengthens himself religion becomes a flight into pleasing 
sensations or therapeutic means he said 
asked whether he accepts yoga ratzinger said it was a 
simplistic question which he could not answer simply but he said 
he opposed forms which become only a therapeutic technique or a 
type of sport

a nurse was convicted today of killing 
four patients by injecting them with a powerful drug in a scheme to 
revive them and look like a hero 
a jury deliberated eight days before finding 27yearold richard 
angelo guilty of murder in two deaths manslaughter in one and 
criminally negligent homicide in the fourth all four deaths 
occurred in 1987 at a long island hospital 
the lindenhurst man was also convicted of assault in connection 
with the deaths and on three counts of assault for giving 
injections to a patient who survived he was acquitted of assault 
in connection with two other patients whose deaths could not 
conclusively be linked to injections 
the injections of a muscle relaxant occurred at good samaritan 
hospital in west islip in the fall of 1987 angelo said he had 
planned to inject the patients then be first on the scene to 
revive them and be seen as a hero 
angelo could receive 50 years to life in prison at sentencing 
jan 17 on the murder charges he was ordered held without bail at 
the suffolk county jail where he had been since his 1987 arrest 
defense attorney eric naiburg had conceded that angelo injected 
the patients and may have caused some of their deaths but naiburg 
argued that angelo was not aware the injections presented a grave 
risk to the patients a condition necessary for a murder conviction 
prosecutor john collins calling angelo a monster in nurses 
whites contended that angelo had to know the risks especially 
after the first victim died 
im not saying he intentionally killed anyone collins said 
in closing arguments im saying he just didnt give a damn 
angelo who was a nurse in the intensive care unit for about six 
months was arrested after a patient complained that angelo had 
injected him with an unknown drug 
the patient gerolamo kucich a 75yearold yugoslavian 
testified that a man with a beard and a white coat gave him an 
injection to make me feel better kucich the only victim now 
alive said how almost immediately after the injection he couldnt 
breathe and his body went limp 
authorities exhumed 33 bodies of patients at good samaritan who 
died suspiciously during angelos tenure 
the medical examiner found traces of pavulon in six of the 
bodies he determined that pavulon directly caused the death of 
four of the victims buit that there was insufficient evidence in 
the two others to determine if pavulon contributed to the deaths 
the prosecution linked angelo to the pavulon through angelos 
statements and a pavulonlaced syringe found in his apartment the 
day before his arrest

china thanked president bush on thursday for 
sending a special envoy to beijing and suggested a solution was 
possible for fang lizhi the prodemocracy dissident hiding in the 
us embassy 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua in a weekly briefing 
devoid of the antiamerican rhetoric common in recent months also 
said he hoped uschina ties badly strained by the june military 
crackdown on prodemocracy dissent in which hundreds of protesters 
were killed could be normalized soon 
jin however declined to say whether china would make any 
concessions or change its policies as a result of the weekend visit 
by national security adviser brent scowcroft the first senior us 
official to visit china since bush banned highlevel exchanges in 
june 
democratic congressmen have sharply criticized the visit 
accusing bush of kowtowing to chinese leaders responsible for 
the bloody quelling of the tiananmen protest movement 
we appreciate president bushs action to send his emissary mr 
scowcroft to china for a visit jin said 
the chinese government sets great store by the sinous 
relations and believes that with joint efforts china and the 
united states will be entirely able to overcome the existing 
difficulties and restore to normal soon their relations and even 
push them to further development 
asked about fang who took sanctuary in the us embassy with 
his wife after troops crushed the student movement in june jin 
said thats a sensitive question involving chinas sovereignty 
law and norms of international law 
in a statement suggesting china was open to negotiations on 
fang he added to resolve this problem requires the efforts of 
both sides 
on previous occasions the foreign ministry always has stated 
that fang and his wife li shuxian are counterrevolutionary 
criminals wanted by chinese police and demanded that the us side 
hand them over immediately 
jin also softpedaled other issues such as sanctions against 
the licensing of three americanmade communications satellites that 
china hopes to launch for australian and hong kong concerns 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday that no 
decision has been reached on a possible waiver on the export ban 
for the satellites 
jin commented that the issuance of export licenses would 
facilitate smooth cooperation between the two sides and the 
chinese side would welcome it 
the foreign ministry spokesman also stressed several times that 
although differences remain under the current circumstances 
where the international situation is undergoing the most profound 
changes since the end of world war ii the constant exchange of 
contacts between china and the united states is both necessary and 
beneficial 
he said both sides were gratified with the results of the 
scowcroft visit 
in one move possibly linked to the visit the foreign ministry 
on wednesday approved the accreditation for a beijing resident 
correspondent from the us governmentfinanced voice of america 
china expelled voa beijing correspondent alan pessin in june 
after charging that voa radio broadcasts heard by millions of 
chinese were spreading rumors about the prodemocracy 
demonstrations and the governments bloody suppression of them 
the application for pessins replacement has been pending for 
four months 
china continues to jam voas mandarin and cantonese broadcasts 
as it has since june but does not interfere with englishlanguage 
broadcasts

a fire at a retirement home early today 
killed four residents and sent people in wheelchairs and pajamas 
into the freezing cold at least 23 people were hurt in the homes 
third fatal blaze in 13 years 
tv crews dropped their cameras to help rescue people from the 
burning sixstory shenandoah homes retirement community and 
residents designated as floor fire captains knocked on doors 
and led their neighbors to safety 
the dead ages 77 to 86 were found in four rooms on the third 
floor where the fire broke out about 230 am but the blaze 
spread heavy smoke to the upper floors before it was brought under 
control 2 hours later authorities said 
about 135 residents some using wheelchairs and dressed only in 
pajamas were evacuated in 19degree cold to a roller skating rink 
authorities said some were sent to hospitals others picked up by 
relatives 
the smoke was horrible said louise dudney 79 a 
sixthfloor resident sitting on a bench at the rink i thought i 
couldnt make it but told myself im going to make it i ran out 
and started knocking on doors 
twentythree people were taken to three hospitals with most of 
them suffering from smoke inhalation chest pains or injuries 
related to falling authorities said the injured included three 
firefighters and a police officer 
seven victims remained hospitalized this afternoon one listed 
in serious condition with smoke inhalation the rest were treated 
and released 
it is a sad day said roanoke county fire chief tommy fuqua 
it was the third fatal fire at the brick building which has no 
sprinkler system but was equipped with smoke detectors and fire 
barriers authorities said in 1976 a fire killed four residents 
of the home three months earlier a blaze started by a dropped 
cigarette killed a woman 
todays blaze came two months after a fire at a nursing home in 
norfolk killed 12 residents that home had no sprinklers prompting 
demands that the legislature make such systems mandatory at all 
nursing homes 
the cause of the fire today was under investigation 
they have all the equipment they are required to have fuqua 
said the alarm system worked the smoke detectors worked 
the fire caused major damage to only one room said fire marshal 
ken sharp 
rc wilson the retirement home chaplain said able residents 
had been trained as fire captains or fire assistants 
ottis burgher administrator for the home said it was just a 
marvel how these elderly people reacted under pressure 
early reports incorrectly described the home which has 124 
apartments as a nursing home 
only one floor is licensed by the state as a home for adults a 
lower level of care than a nursing home according to richard 
martin of the virginia department of social services and welfare 
the rest of the building was not subject to state regulation he 
said 
fuqua said officers and camera crews from tv stations were the 
first to arrive and some reporters and photographers helped in the 
rescue 
everybody that was out here were heroes fuqua said they 
evacuated people before they even tried to put out the fire 
killed were rada powell 77 edna s aliff 77 linard h mann 
86 and marcie l keith 80 the sheriffs department said

a former policeman pleaded 
guilty thursday to the murder of an antiapartheid activist saying 
he belonged to a police assassination squad and acted on orders 
from superiors 
activists for years have suspected the existence of police death 
squads but butana nofomelas statement marked the first time 
anyone confessed in court to serving on such a unit 
in another development recently freed african national congress 
leader walter sisulu said the government was trying to drive a 
wedge between his jailed colleague nelson mandela and militant 
black leaders outside prison 
sisulu a codefendant of mandelas who was freed in october 
after 26 years in prison said he was surprised to learn of 
wednesdays meeting between mandela and president fw de klerk 
but sisulu said the talks did not contradict the ancs position 
that conditions are not yet right for negotiations with the 
government 
the government always wants to drive a wedge between him and 
leaders outside sisulu said in a radio interview we are quite 
aware of that and i think mr mandela is very much aware of that 
exchanging views with an individual is not negotiations 
sisulu said 
sisulu said mandela was likely to explain his position during 
meetings planned at his prison quarters next week with leaders of 
the militant congress of south african trade unions the countrys 
largest labor federation 
de klerk was expected to discuss mandelas status when he 
travels to a meeting friday with mozambiques president joaquim 
chissano the south african press association said there was 
speculation de klerk could announce a date for mandelas release in 
a speech saturday commemorating the day of the vow a major holiday 
for the afrikaners who control the government 
mandela the countrys bestknown black leader has been 
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plotting 
an antigovernment sabotage campaign six anc leaders convicted 
along with him including sisulu were freed in october 
nofomela the confessed death squad member first made his 
allegations in an affidavit oct 19 the night before he was to 
hang for a separate murder with no political overtones human 
rights lawyers obtained a stay of execution so nofomela could 
assist in investigations of death squad activity 
subsequently two expolicemen named by nofomela as death squad 
members confessed in newspaper interviews that they were involved 
the issue has become a major national controversy 
last week de klerk rejected requests to appoint a judicial 
inquiry commission saying the allegations could be handled through 
normal legal procedures justice minister kobie coetsee announced 
that nofomela would be prosecuted for the 1981 stabbing of 
griffiths mxenge a black lawyer and activist from durban 
in a statement read in magistrates court in pietermaritzburg 
capital of natal province nofomela said he and three other black 
policemen abducted mxenge to a stadium then kicked punched and 
stabbed him until he died 
i was a member of the police special branch assassination 
squad nofomela told the court i was instructed by brig 
willem schoon and capt dirk coetzee to proceed to durban and 
there to kill one griffiths mxenge 
schoon now retired has not issued any statement on allegations 
he ordered mxenges assassination 
coetzee who has fled south africa made detailed claims about 
death squad activities including mxenges murder in a newspaper 
interview last month police have issued a warrant for coetzees 
arrest 
nofomelas case was adjourned until feb 28

south floridas water managers 
today responded to the worst dry spell in 27 years by imposing 
restrictions on washing cars and watering lawns and golf courses in 
the region of more than 4 million people 
the governing board of the south florida water management 
district approved the restrictions 70 effective monday in four 
heavily populated counties from key west to the west palm beach 
area 230 miles to the north 
the board also approved a 410000 media campaign to publicize 
water conservation 
the first regional water restrictions in nearly nine years are 
the product of miamis driest year since 1962 low water storage 
levels and a longrange forecast for lower than normal rainfall in 
the winter dry season rainfall this year has totaled about 42 
inches or 14 inches below normal 
tom macvicar deputy executive director of the water district 
said the region is entering its winter dry season and more 
stringent restrictions will follow unless the rainfall trend 
changes 
theres not much social cost to having a dirty car macvicar 
said theres a social cost to not having water 
even if we do get a wet winter the philosophy is well still 
need the water restrictions said district spokeswoman ann 
overton its better to get people on board with the idea of 
mandatory cutbacks while we still have a little bit of breathing 
room rather than waiting until we have our backs against the wall 
the board limited residents of monroe dade broward and palm 
beach counties to lawn watering and car washing from 4 am to 8 
am three days a week 
restrictions also were placed on golf courses car washes 
agriculture pool filling and rinsing off boats ms overton said 
fountains and outdoor water displays would be turned off and 
street driveway and sidewalk washing banned 
enforcement is up to local authorities the district has told 
authorities that violations should be handled with a warning for a 
first offense and fines starting at 25 for repeat offenses 
farmers have been asked for the past two months to cut back 
their water use by 10 percent and those voluntary limits will 
continue 
similar restrictions are in place from the area north of tampa 
across the peninsula to jacksonville and as far west as blountstown 
on the florida panhandle 
california also continues to have problems rainfall has reached 
only 60 percent of normal for this time of year and the central 
part of the state is facing drought for a fourth straight year 
from san jose to the mexican border is the urban area hardest 
hit by the continuing drought suzanne butterfield deputy chief 
and drought response coordinator for the state department of water 
resources said wednesday 
on average water in californias reservoirs is at 75 percent of 
normal for this time of year but some reservoirs along the coast 
are bone dry butterfield said the extended drought has meant 
water rationing or strict conservation programs for 10 million 
residents in 130 california communities she said 
in south florida public agencies are pressing to meet the 15 
percent water use reduction goal set by the district the 
miamidade water and sewer authority serving the miami area has cut 
water pressure and wants to impose a 10 percent surcharge on all 
water bills as an inducement to conserve 
lake okeechobee the largest freshwater lake outside the great 
lakes and a primary drinking water source for south florida is 
about 3 feet below normal 
miami received 4223 inches of rain for the year through 
wednesday compared with 4227 inches in 1962 and 4178 inches in 
1961 national weather service records show

hiromasa ezoe whose company gave its name to a 
scandal that brought down a government and tarnished the japanese 
establishment goes on trial friday charged with buying influence 
and favors 
being tried with him are toshiro ono an executive of recruit 
co the information conglomerate ezoe founded and two politicians 
accused of taking bribes takao fujinami a former cabinet 
minister and katsuya ikeda of the opposition komeito clean 
government party 
if convicted the defendsants could be sentenced to five years 
in prison each 
their trial is the last of five which began nov 22 in tokyo 
district court and will last for months as the legal system delves 
into allegations of corruption in in the cozy relations between 
japanese government and business 
the recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down prime 
minister noboru takeshita who resigned last spring after 
acknowledging he received large donations from recruit 
other key figures in the governing liberal democratic party have 
been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking 
bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from 
recruit 
ezoe 53 is charged with seven counts of bribery and ono a 
39yearold former company department head with two counts 
fujinami 56 was chief cabinet secretary under prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone takeshitas predecessor he is accused of 
receiving 20 million yen 140000 and 10000 shares in 
recruitcosmos a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential 
people at a reduced price before going on the market 
he allegedly put pressure on the labor ministry not to change 
the traditional season for recruiting college graduates which 
would have hurt recruits sales of jobplacement magazines 
ikeda 52 is harged with receiving 2 million yen 14000 for 
himself 5 million yen 35000 for his wife and 5000 shares in 
recruitcosmos for his brother 
according to prosecutors he gave prorecruit speeches in 
parliament in return ikeda resigned his seat fujinami remained in 
parliament but resigned from his party 
the other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other recruit 
executives 
prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe 
japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or 
politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the 
official is in a position to supervise 
recruit offered millions of discount shares in recruitcosmos to 
hundreds of politicians bureaucrats and businessmen before the 
stocks were available to the general public 
when it was offered on the overthecounter market the price of 
the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits fujinamis 
shares were said to have gained him 30 million yen 215000 
we offered stocks to those who would bring benefits to recruit 
directly or indirectly it was a form of advance investment i 
regard the stock transaction as a business practice but i admit it 
contains some peculiar aspects ezoe was quoted as telling 
prosecutors who read the statements in a related trial wednesday 
on wednesday the former chairman of nippon telegraph and 
telephone corp hisashi shinto 79 acknowledged he made about 21 
million yen 145000 in 1986 on recruitcosmos shares but denied 
favoring recruit with special treatment when it entered the 
telecommunications market 
i accepted the offer of shares but i never regarded it as a 
bribe he said rejecting such an offer is considered rude in 
japan 
defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal between 
businesses and the powerful bureaucracy in japan where an entire 
industry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts to 
cement personal and business ties 
businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specific 
favors but at establishing relationships with business associates 
supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to do 
business with them 
prime minister toshiki kaifu has pledged to reform japans money 
politics but few measures have been enacted 
on wednesday parliament passed legislation providing punishment 
for politicians who give donations for weddings and other 
ceremonies they do not attend and for voters who demand such gifts

the rev bruce ritter founder of the covenant 
house for runaways today denied charges of financial improprieties 
leveled by a former male prostitute the priest has helped 
they are simply nonsense ritter said the priest said that 
news reports on the matter have been inaccurate and that a special 
audit just completed by an accounting firm showed no misuse of 
funds whatsoever 
a day earlier the district attorney said an investigation of 
the allegations was still at an early stage 
no determination has been made as to the truth of the 
allegations nor can such a determination be made until the 
investigation has been concluded manhattan district attorney 
robert morgenthau said in a statement wednesday 
the new york post first disclosed the investigation reporting 
tuesday that it began when a former male prostitute told 
prosecutors the roman catholic priest provided him with an 
apartment money and gifts and took him on trips 
a law enforcement source identified the young man for the 
associated press as timothy warner 20 
the post reported today that investigators had the youth wear a 
recording device during a conversation with ritter in an effort to 
confirm allegations that they had a sexual relationship it is not 
clear what warner recorded 
ritter a 62yearold franciscan priest had not spoken publicly 
about the allegations before today but the post quoted him earlier 
this week as denying any sexual misconduct and suggesting that 
emotional problems led the young man to make scurrilous 
allegations 
the shelters chief executive officer james harnett and 
ritters lawyer stanley arkin denied any financial wrongdoing by 
ritter or covenant house covenant house officials have said that 
such expenditures are normal and that warner was put in a safe 
house to keep him away from his criminal past 
there is no case and there never was any case arkin said 
i think it was outrageous and disgusting for the district 
attorney to outfit this kid with a wire to try to entrap father 
ritter harnett said i can tell you father ritter is a lot 
calmer about this than i am 
ritter founded covenant house for homeless teenagers in 1969 
and has built it into an 85 millionayear operation with seven 
shelters in the united states one in toronto and four in latin 
america more than 90 percent of its funding is private 
morgenthau said covenant house is cooperating with the 
investigation and subpoenas have not been necessary 
ritter brought warner to new york from new orleans in february 
after the young man told the priest he wanted to escape 
prostitution 
harnett acknowledged ritter and warner took trips in which they 
were alone together 
the two men attended the wedding in june of a covenant house 
staff member in wyomissing pa and shared a room he said ritter 
is categorical that he and the kid slept in separate beds and 
nothing sexual went on nothing 
in february they spent a night at a board members rhinebeck 
ny country home which is used frequently for group outings the 
two stayed in a guest house harnett said 
the post reported wednesday that an employee at covenant house 
had said ritter might have been involved with a second youth the 
district attorneys office refused to comment 
in a statement supporting ritter cardinal john oconnor said 
in all my personal association with father ritter and those who 
work with him i have seen nothing but selfsacrifice and 
commitment to the most abandoned in society

after chinese troops rolled in he has said that china is trying to 
wipe out tibets culture

us criticism of britains forced repatriation of 
vietnamese from hong kong has stirred resentment in the thatcher 
government and raised new doubts about the special relationship 
between the two nations 
britain also faces more criticism from an announcement expected 
shortly that it will admit only a select minority of hong kong 
chinese if things go wrong when the colony reverts to china in 1997 
officially foreign office minister francis maude described as 
misguided a us state department statement tuesday that the 
forced repatriation of 51 vietnamese boat people was unacceptable 
the deportations were the first of thousands expected in the coming 
years 
but the british government resentment goes deeper than the 
diplomatic parlance 
it is no good complaining unless they are prepared to take 
more vietnamese refugees prime minister margaret thatcher was 
quoted as saying in a newspaper interview thursday referring to 
the united states and other critics 
i know what their reason against taking more is it is that 
the more they take the more will come she was quoted as saying 
in the londons daily star one doesnt like having to do it but 
we have to think of our responsibility to the people of hong kong 
it is a phrase likely to be used against her when in an 
announcement scheduled before the end of the year the government 
says how many of the 6 million hong kong chinese will be granted 
rights of residence in britain they include 325 million people 
who now have british passports without the right of abode 
most analysts expect britain will give residence rights to 
between 100000200000 hong kong chinese mostly people who have 
worked for the british administration or members of the colonys 
thriving entrepreneurial class 
the latter find it easiest to get into other western countries 
notably canada the united states and australia they already 
leaving at the rate of about 1000 a week 
british officials complain privately that what one called a us 
hangup about vietnam has brought london and washington into 
open conflict over the forced repatriation of vietnamese refugees 
classified as economic migrants 
the clash comes when mrs thatcher is already widely portrayed 
as sidelined by the united states the 12nation european economic 
community as a bloc and west germany in particular have become the 
focus of us attention amid the rapid changes in eastern europe 
there are signs the dispute will get worse as thousands more of 
the 44000 vietnamese whom britain is determined to deport are 
bundled out of the colony with tv cameras recording scenes of 
emotion 
given the major changes in europe it is just an enormous 
waste of political capital for britain and the united states to 
have a row about this said gerald segal an analyst at londons 
royal institute of international affairs 
but it is going to get worse without any question segal 
said in an interview because of the focus on west germany the 
united states may also feel that there is little cost in having a 
major argument with britain on the repatriation issue if it comes 
to that i think britain will turn fairly nasty 
right now britain sounds aggrieved at the universal criticism 
from its allies as hong kong the last significant remains of a 
once globeencircling empire turns into an international 
controversy 
we do not look for the worlds applause but we are entitled 
to ask for the worlds understanding said sir david ford chief 
secretary in the britishrun hong kong administration 
this is not a role or responsibility we have sought it is one 
that geography and circumstances have thrust upon us 
as well as attracting western disapproval mrs thatcher is 
under ferocious attack from british opposition parties and some 
newspapers over the repatriation issue 
the government whose move is highly popular with the hong kong 
chinese and beijing officials retorts that no one else has offered 
to take the boat people 
more than 90 percent are peasants from north vietnam while the 
majority of the 900000 vietnamese settled in the united states 
since the war ended in 1975 are from the south 
british officials said the united states is reluctant to take 
the northerners

the united states is turning up the heat in an 
effort to persuade syria to kick out the terrorist believed 
responsible for the bombing of pan am flight 103 a state 
department source said thursday 
its a matter of degree of frequency and of language the 
source who spoke only on condition of anonymity said about 
increased diplomatic contacts with syria 
the official said the increased pressure did not include direct 
threats but that there had been a measured turning up of the heat 
in the most recent contacts some of which have come through us 
ambassador edward djerejian 
threats the source said would be counterproductive against a 
toughminded leader such as syrian president hafez assad the 
source also said that us relations with syria already are cool 
leaving the united states little with which to bargain 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the united 
states is unhappy with syrias refusal to eject ahmed jibril 
believed to have engineered the pan am attack a year ago 
the headquarters of jibrils organization the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command are in damascus and 
he has at least one training camp outside damascus 
this is a major item on our bilateral agenda with syria 
boucher said in response to a question thursday at the daily state 
department briefing to date were not satisfied with the syrian 
governmnents responses and we think the syrian government can do 
more 
boucher said the united states had had extensive discussions 
and has made repeated demarches on the issue of terrorism and 
syrian support for terrorism groups 
syrias response has been to insist that it be shown hard 
evidence linking gibril to the explosion over lockerbie scotland 
that killed 270 people the united states has been reluctant to do 
so because such a move might jeopardize the criminal investigation 
or expose sensitive intelligence sources 
the syrian government at the highest levels has told us that 
if it is presented with firm evidence that any group or individuals 
within its purview are responsible for pan am 103 the syrian 
government will take action against them boucher said 
however the department source said the united states believes 
the syrians should bounce jibril just as they bounced abu 
nidal another terrorist because of his overall record of 
violence independent of the pan am case 
us officials are unsure whether assad knew of the plans for 
the pan am bombing before it occurred but believe he now is well 
aware of jibrils involvement 
jibril is a former syrian army major believed to have continuing 
close ties to syrian intelligence

the daring escape of three war 
correspondents from a confederate prison 125 years ago will be 
commemorated this weekend in a ceremony organizers hope will also 
focus attention on hostage terry andersons plight 
on dec 18 1864 new york daily tribune reporters albert 
richardson and junius browne and the cincinnati gazettes william 
davis masterminded an escape from salisbury prison after 19 months 
in captivity 
contemporaries referred to their 340mile journey to freedom 
across the blue ridge mountains as the walk of the journalists 
these gentlemen were not unlike terry anderson said mark 
mcdonald the executive director of the historic salisbury 
foundation inc which is cosponsoring the event with the society 
of civil war correspondents they were 19th century political 
prisoners they were imprisoned not because they took up arms but 
because of what they wrote 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press has been held hostage since his capture in beirut lebanon 
in march 1985 
wherever terry is being held we fervently wish he might find 
some inspiration from the successful struggle of richardson browne 
and davis mcdonald said 
joining the journalists in their escape 125 years ago were 
connecticut merchant marine capt thomas e wolfe and sgt charles 
thurston of the 6th new hampshire infantry 
mcdonald said richardson and browne who were captured during 
the battle of vicksburg in may 1863 were granted special status at 
the prison 
richardson was given the job of collecting usable clothing 
from the dead he said wednesday richardson was given a pass 
that allowed him to go outside the prison walls to perform his 
duties 
the reporters later used the pass to trick the guards and make 
their escape 
the escape itself did not feature any cloak and dagger 
mcdonald said their journey had a lot more daring associated 
with it 
mcdonald said they had a good reason to escape when they did 
the current commander of the prison major john ghee was 
being replaced by general bradlee johnson a strict 
disciplinarian he said they decided to get out while the 
getting was good 
twentysix days later on jan 13 1865 they arrived in 
unionheld knoxville tenn 
within a day of their arrival the tribune which was run by 
staunch abolitionist horace greeley reported their exploits under 
the headline out of the jaws of death 
salisbury prison which was constructed around an abandoned 
cotton mill held more than 10000 prisoners in october 1864 
between that date and february 1865 3419 of its prisoners died 
the prison was destroyed by union cavalry in april 1865 
beginning on friday the escape will be commemorated in downtown 
salisbury with lectures a walking tour living history portrayals 
a banquet and a recreation 
the escape will be recreated saturday at 330 pm the hour of 
the flight 
gerald a regan a copy editor with usa today and us naval 
academy english professor robert madison will portray richardson 
and browne they will also give readings from books the tribune 
reporters wrote about their civil war exploits 
this is not a story of north vs south but of men caught up 
in a war who refuse to accept captivity said regan they would 
be free because they would accept nothing less no matter what the 
odds or dangers 
journalists dont set out to be heroes but heroic efforts are 
sometimes required in the pursuit of the news he said 
among the weekends speakers will be allen ellis an assistant 
professor at northern kentucky university and a descendant of dan 
ellis who helped guide the journalists over the mountains to 
freedom

nato foreign ministers said thursday 
that soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze would make an 
unprecedented visit to the alliances headquarters next week 
shevardnadzes request for a meeting next week at the north 
atlantic treaty organization overshadowed the opening day of talks 
at which us secretary of state james a baker iii called for a 
larger political role for the alliance 
baker called shevardnadzes visit a good thing and said 
its very natural in light of the changes that are taking place 
and continuing to take place 
it would be the first visit by a soviet foreign minister to the 
headquarters of the western military alliance a sign of the 
remarkable events unfolding in the soviet union and eastern europe 
this is a beautiful symbol of the growing cooperation between 
what can no longer be called the two military blocs but lets say 
east and west said belgian foreign minister mark eyskens whose 
government was instrumental in arranging the visit 
shevardnadze already was scheduled to be in brussels on monday 
and tuesday to sign a new trade and economic cooperation agreement 
with the 12nation european community the accord will expand 
commercial ties between moscow and prosperous western europe 
nato spokesman robin stafford said officials were trying to 
arrange a meeting between shevardnadze and nato secretarygeneral 
manfred woerner 
shevardnadze also was expected to meet informally with the 
ambassadors of all 16 nato nations 
a senior canadian official suggested the soviet officials visit 
might be more of a courtesy call 
i really dont expect it will be a deeply substantive meeting 
because its not what the soviets are looking for said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity they are not 
planning to negotiate with nato 
the western foreign ministers began their talks by agreeing to 
submit a draft arms control treaty to warsaw pact negotiators in 
vienna 
nato negotiators then placed the draft on the bargaining table 
in vienna several hours after the warsaw pact offered its plan 
the alliances presented the texts as part of efforts to reach a 
speedy agreement nato wants an accord wrapped up in 1990 the 
united states is pressing for a june deadline 
president bush has called for the united states and the soviet 
union to reduce their troop levels in europe to 275000 on each 
side that would require a cutback of 325000 in soviet forces and 
30000 in us troops president mikhail s gorbachev has offered 
to go down to 350000 
as of june the international institute for strategic studies 
lists 326400 troops for the united states european command as of 
june 1989 the soviets had 565000 troops outside the soviet union 
 
nato and the warsaw pact have also proposed both sides agree to 
equal ceilings in europe of 20000 tanks and 28000 armored troop 
carriers 
the warsaw pact draft proposed equal limits of 4700 on combat 
aircraft nato earlier proposed a ceiling of 5700 
the bargaining is seen as a key part of the western alliances 
efforts to redefine its role in an era of dramatically reduced 
tensions 
officials said baker outlined his plans for a wider political 
role for nato his plan unveiled in berlin on monday foresees the 
alliance as a permanent monitor of the reductions being discussed 
in vienna and as a mediator of regional conflicts 
it finds a positive resonance said the canadian official 
everybody wants the alliance to be functioning well as a 
political consultative body 
de michelis said the evolution of eastern europe obviously 
creates the necessity of evolution on the western side 
hurd said he supported the main thrust of bakers plan but 
he also reminded the ministers of natos need to keep its robust 
defense capability 
he said building up the alliances political role was no 
substitution for the defense role but should be seen as a 
reinforcement of it 
the american effort also is designed to address the possibility 
of a reunification of the two germanys anchoring it firmly in a 
western political and military alliance 
the ministers officials said were likely to include in their 
final statement friday the same reference to german unity made at a 
weekend summit of european community leaders 
the leaders gave their strong support to the eventual 
reunification of germany and said it should take place peacefully 
and democratically they said other european borders must stay in 
place to ensure stability at a time of uncertainty

soviet legislators trying to break the communist 
partys grip on power struggled thursday over whether to declare 
themselves a political opposition a step toward formation of an 
alternate party 
we cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the 
leadership is doing now said human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov a deputy 
it is leading the country to a catastrophe prolonging the 
process of perestroika many years he said 
the interregional deputies group which consists of about 400 
of the 2250 members of the congress of peoples deputies has been 
badly outvoted this week as it tried to raise discussion of the 
partys constitutional monopoly on power and a series of key 
economic laws 
since it was formed in august the group made up of some of the 
congress leading reformers has been careful to avoid calling 
itself an opponent of the communist party 
but historian yuri afanasyev told the group during an emotional 
threehour meeting that it was time to change its tactics 
we are against the socalled leading role of the communist 
party that is the monopoly on power of the ruling party leading 
the country to an unheardof disaster afanasyev said in a 
statement to the deputies meeting in the kremlin 
we are for a multiparty democratic system the statement 
said 
he said that allowing collective and state farmers to freely 
leave their farms with land buildings and seed was the only way to 
stave off famine threatening the country 
other east bloc countries pushed by president mikhail s 
gorbachev have been swept by political reforms this fall in 
hungary east germany czechoslovakia and poland the communist 
monopoly of power has ended and bulgarias communist party has 
proposed a multiparty system 
in related developments thursday 
bulgarias parliament said it could not repeal the communist 
monopoly on power for another month because of a legal 
technicality prompting the jeers of 50000 angry bulgarians in the 
square outside new party chief petar mladenov tried to speak but 
was shouted down 
czechoslovakis new government said negotiations had begun 
with moscow on the withdrawal of 80000 soviet troops about 40000 
people rallied in downtown prague in support of opposition leader 
vaclav havels candidacy for president 
east german reform activists pressured the government into 
abolishing the office for national security the hated secret 
police agency that tried to suppress their peaceful revolt 
nato leaders meeting in brussels disclosed that arrangements 
are being made for an unprecedented visit by soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to the organizations headquarters 
another reflection of reduced eastwest tensions 
several hundred of the soviet deputies ignored most of the 
afternoon session of the congress devoted to economic reform 
plans to debate proposals by afanasyev and several others 
many of the deputies who spoke at the meeting questioned 
afanasyevs terminology of a political opposition that calls 
itself the radicaldemocratic bloc 
they said that could be used against them by conservatives who 
control the congress and could hurt them in local elections with a 
population that many feel is becoming more conservative because of 
severe economic problems 
they formed a commission to work out a proposal to bring before 
a new gathering on friday 
the people dont want a declaration of a crisis said one 
deputy from the don river coal basin of the eastern ukraine they 
want the crisis to be over and something to be on the store 
shelves 
vladislav shapovalenko of orenburg said the reformers could be 
accused of further polarizing the congress the failure of the 
session could be blamed on us 
afanasyev interviewed after the meeting said that it was 
possible that if adopted by the group his proposal could be a step 
toward formation of an alternate political party 
my variant is a political opposition to the leadership of the 
communist party and the leadership of the country afanasyev said 
asked if his proposal could lead to formation of an alternative 
to the communist party afanasyev said it was fully possible 
but he said the group could also consider itself a faction 
within the communist party 
communist maverick boris n yeltsin chairman of the meeting 
said he thought the commission should come up with a more moderate 
proposal than afanasyevs 
on tuesday the first day of the session the interregional 
deputies group pressed for a debate on article 6 of the soviet 
constitution which calls the communist party the leading and 
guiding force of soviet society and the nucleus of its political 
system 
however they lost on that issue by a vote of 1138 to 839 and 
by a wider margin on their bid to debate legislation on land and 
property ownership

members and supporters of the ku klux klan 
will rally in a quiet college town in support of two high school 
students disciplined for wearing klan robes to school police said 
thursday 
but citizens groups are urging residents to ignore saturdays 
march 10 times the normal number of police will be on duty and 
based on previous klan attempts to hold rallies in southwestern 
ohio officials say the event probably will be a big todo about 
nothing 
frankly i think they have gotten far too much publicity over 
this city manager dennis stuckey said there is a group in the 
community that is actively promoting the shunning of the march it 
may well be that there are more media than there are marchers and 
spectators 
klansman ernie edwards of morrow received a city permit for the 
gathering telling police 500 people would participate 
saturdays rally follows an incident in which two students 
showed up at oxfords talawanda high school on halloween in klan 
robes and shouted racial epithets blacks held an 
antidiscrimination march the following week 
edwards who told police he represented a group called us 
knights has not been available for comment a woman who answered 
his phone hung up on a reporter 
the klan march will start and end at the high school where 
about 50 of the 1100 students are black 
but edwards was told his group would have to march on sidewalks 
unless enough marchers show up to make it worthwhile to close city 
streets 
we dont want to inconvenience a lot of people for a few 
marchers said lt dick mcvey acting chief of police in the 
town northwest of cincinnati 
i dont know what to expect whether curiosityseekers will 
come out to look at these individuals and thats one of our 
concerns our plan is tobe prepared for the worst 
mcvey will have 35 officers in the twoblocksquare march area 
including several county and township officers three or four 
officers patrol oxford on a typical saturday 
they say theyll have 500 people mcvey said i warned 
them that if not the expected number show up i might encourage the 
city attorney to seek payment for all these officers 
oxford home of miami university has a population of about 
20000 people mcvey said 942 percent are white 
i have personal feelings and official opinions about this 
stuckey said my official position is that they have as much 
right to congregate as anyone does we work with all kinds of 
groups because of the nature of the community i guess its more 
routine for us to have activities of this nature 
police departments say there probably are no more than 25 kkk 
members in the area but that it doesnt take many to stir things 
up 
the green ribbon committee of oxford was formed in response to 
saturdays march it adopted green ribbons as a symbol of antiklan 
sentiment and has been tying ribbons to trees and utility poles in 
town to protest the march which it wants residents to boycott

the justice department is investigating 
whether some airlines violated antitrust laws when they increased 
fares earlier this year department and industry officials said 
thursday 
the departments antitrust division has asked several airlines 
to submit information about how they determine fares including an 
correspondence between carriers about an increase that took effect 
sept 29 airline officials said 
several airlines increased fares on some routes between 10 and 
80 depending on how many days before departure tickets are 
purchased 
an antitrust expert who spoke on condition on anonymity said the 
government was probably examining the industrys practice of 
reporting fare increases before they take effect 
under this theory of antitrust violation the prepublication of 
fare increases to travel agents and an industry clearinghouse 
called the airline tariff publishers inc would be viewed as a 
facilitating device for price fixing the expert said 
while it would be difficult to prove an agreement among 
airlines to raise fares the justice department might try to show 
that the prepublication of fares is way to signal price increases 
this expert said 
an airline would run a price up the flagpole if everybody 
salutes it it goes into effect the expert said if no one 
follows suit the airline is free to cancel the planned increase 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said civil 
investigative demands were sent to a number of carriers within a 
short period of time after the sept 29 effective date 
she declined to say which airlines received the orders or to 
give details of the inquiry 
we have complied with requests for information but we really 
dont see any basis for the investigation said david messing 
spokesman for continental airlines 
delta northwest and american which was the first to indicate 
it was raising fares also acknowledged receiving requests for 
information 
three other airlines that the wall street journal reported were 
subject to investigation usair united and trans world declined 
comment 
the public affairs department at pan american also cited in the 
journal report said no spokesman was immediately available 
jim lundy of delta said the justice department asked for any 
correspondence between delta and other airlines over fares 
there was none he said 
the order also asked for information about the airlines 
ticketpricing operations and the way it makes decisions on fares 
along with the process used in determining the sept 29 increase 
when an airline files a fare increase it appears in a 
ticketpricing database available to all carriers and in the 
computer reservations systems used by travel agents 
no one can really afford to be at a competitive disadvantage 
for more than a few hours lundy said you have to move very 
quickly 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said the company ran an analysis 
of its sept 29 fare increase after the government inquiry and 
determined that we followed standard procedures 
he said once a fare increase is filed electronically each 
carrier has to decide whether to reduce increase or maintain its 
fare on each competitive route 
airlines say that prepublication of fares is necessary to 
enable the public to plan in advance 
if the government can prove its case it might be able to obtain 
an injunction either to stop the prepublication of air fares or 
some change in procedures to prevent airlines from signaling their 
increases

antismoking efforts need to target younger 
people who have relatively little schooling because the use of 
cigarettes drops sharply among the bettereducated federal health 
researchers said thursday 
a centers for disease control study said that while other 
factors may influence smoking education is an increasingly 
important one 
a 1988 behavioral risk factor survey of 36 states and the 
district of columbia found that the lesseducated who also tend to 
be of a lower social and economic status are more likely to be 
smokers than are others 
there has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking said 
dr luis escobedo of the atlantabased cdc who analyzed aspects of 
the survey 
but the study shows most of the progress is limited to the 
welleducated he said 
escobedo said the national cancer institute has a program in 
innercity schools working to reduce the odds of children becoming 
regular smokers and private institutes and some state health 
departments do the same 
results based on a random telephone survey of 19822 people 18 
years of age or older showed that for people over 35 the 
likelihood of being a current smoker increased with each decrease 
in the level of education 
however for those age 18 to 34 the chance of being a current 
smoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a high 
school education while smoking rates for high school dropouts and 
high school graduates were more nearly equal 
the study said cultural factors also may affect who smokes for 
example utah which has a high population of mormons whose church 
opposes smoking had the lowest rate of smokers 181 percent and 
former smokers 91 percent 
kentucky a tobaccogrowing state had the highest percentage of 
current smokers at 379 percent the highest percentage of former 
smokers was in maine 203 percent 
the median figure for current smokers was 262 percent meaning 
that half the states were above that figure and half below the 
median figure for former smokers was 151 percent 
the study said other factors affecting who smokes include school 
antismoking programs state cigarette taxes and the intensity of 
promotional events and advertising by the tobacco industry 
the survey was part of a study done annually since 1980 with 
more states participating each year he said

about 300000 southern sudanese face 
starvation because renewed fighting between government and rebels 
has suspended relief operations in the region a western official 
said thursday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said food 
stocks at the southern capital of juba were expected to run out in 
a week 
he said a new international operation to send about 90000 
metric tons of relief food to southern sudan in january is 
paralyzed until the government allows resumption of flights 
carrying aid to the south 
the un representative to sudan michael bristly left khartoum 
on wednesday for a meeting with un secretary general javier perez 
de cuellar to see what he can do to get things moving the 
official said 
some 300000 persons in the south will face famine because 
both the rebel spla sudan peoples liberation army and the 
sudanese government are reluctant to allow the safe passage of 
relief to the needy people in the south of sudan the official 
told the associated press 
if people are to be saved and a repetition of the 1988 plague 
is to be avoided food has to be taken to these people as urgently 
as possible he said 
some western relief officials believe more than 560000 people

than 2 million people from farms and homes since the rebels began 
their battle for more autonomy in 1983 the refugees fled either 
toward a handful of governmentheld southern towns and became 
dependent of relief or they trekked north to khartoum 
in april a ceasefire allowed the uncoordinated operation 
lifeline sudan to send about 70000 tons of food into southern 
sudan the relief prevented a repeat of the 1988 disaster

civilian contracting supervisor 
the scandal is at the heart of a multiyear investigation by 
government agents who codenamed their operation ill wind

that he solicted more than 80000 from lee telecommunications 
which was taken over by whittaker in 1986 in return for helping 
the company get electronics contracts

reform activists scored another victory for 
democracy thursday by pressuring the government into abolishing the 
hated secret police agency that tried to suppress their peaceful 
revolt 
the decision to shut down the office for national security came 
out of negotiations between communist leaders and opposition 
groups and amid increasing threats against secret police officials 
by citizens angry about previous excesses 
the interior ministry said threats and attacks against secret 
police have increased at an alarming rate and warned east 
germans against trying to take the law into their own hands 
the official east german news agency adn said government 
officials police and reform activists met late thursday to discuss 
how to keep the peace in east berlin adn said the discussion 
partners asked citizens to act responsibly 
the capital appeared calm and the rainsoaked central streets 
were nearly deserted after businesses closed but violent incidents 
have been reported in other major cities 
more than 10000 demonstrators braved bad weather in erfurt to 
push for reforms and warn against selling out to west germany but 
adn said banners supporting reunification were unmissable 
also thursday west german economics minister helmut haussmann 
met with communist premier hans modrow and the two sides agreed to 
set up a joint economic commission and broaden cooperation 
haussmann said more than 40 percent of west germanys booming 
industries have expressed interest in expanding their businesses 
into a reformed east german economy 
the soviet unions chief ideologist politburo member alexander 
yakovlev came to east berlin late thursday for a meeting with 
communist party chief gregor gysi before this weekends important 
party congress 
the east german party is trying to restructure itself into a 
movement for democratic socialism to win public trust and a 
chance at a role in government after next springs free elections 
the interior ministry said posters have appeared on factory 
walls calling communist party and secret police officials 
traitors who deserve the death penalty 
in dresden about 50 people dragged one man out of his car and 
tied a towing cable around his neck shouting communist swine 
well hang you the ministry reported in a statement carried by 
adn 
a lynching was prevented by a man who managed to bring the crowd 
under control the report said 
elke guenther of new forum the largest of east germanys 
prodemocracy groups praised the dissolution of the stasi 
secret police as a concession that may ease tension 
ms guenther said the secret police harassed leaders of the 
reform movement until weeks ago when the swelling force for change 
forced the ouster of erich honeckers 18year hardline leadership 
and burst open the door to the west 
the state security ministry already had been downgraded to the 
national security agency and about 10000 agents had been sent to 
work in industry 
dozens of soldiers stood guard around secret police headquarters 
in east berlin after the decision to shut down the service was 
disclosed 
a spokesman in the press office of the security agency said the 
government would divide the agencys responsibilites among other 
ministries 
this decision is another consequence of the roundtable 
talks government spokesman wolfgang meyer said at a news 
conference 
communist party officials last week opened talks with 
representatives of rival political parties and fledgling proreform 
movements to discuss the nations future the first session agreed 
on a may 6 1990 date for the nations first free elections 
the secret police apparatus was a major target of opposition 
criticism angry citizens took over secret police headquarters in 
leipzig gera and other cities to prevent destruction of evidence 
against officials accused of corruption 
honecker is among those accused of having misused their offices 
and indulged in high living as the national economy stagnated 
meyer said the wandlitz settlement where former leaders have 
been under house arrest will be converted to a rehabilitation 
center for handicapped children by february 
at talks on making western investment in east germany more 
secure and attractive haussmann laid out a plan that calls for 
measures to protect the assets of foreign investors and ease 
restrictions that discourage joint ventures 
haussmann said after his meetings with modrow and east germanys 
economics minister christa luft that he considered an agreement 
on western investment protection to be essential by february 
ms luft said seven major industrial complexes will be operating 
on a selffinancing and independent basis as an experiment in 
broadening the rights and responsibilities of east german 
enterprises

palestinian guerrillas attacked a syrian 
base in south lebanon thursday and freed 15 detained comrades in a 
twohour foray in which at least 13 people were killed police 
reported 
syrians troops and armor massed along the awali river on the 
northern edge of sidon apparently preparing for a retaliatory 
strike across the line beyond which israel has said it will not 
tolerate syrian military presence 
a group calling itself the organization for the defense of the 
oppressed threatened to kill pope john paul ii claiming he 
supports the lebanese christian military leader gen michel aoun 
aoun refuses to bow to a new christianmoslem government trying 
to end the 14yearold sectarian war and has pledged to drive the 
syrians out of lebanon 
thursdays statement was the second threat by the group against 
the pope the first in august said he would be killed if he 
visited lebanon 
police said about 150 fighters from fatah the mainstream 
guerrilla faction led by yasser arafat chairman of palestine 
liberation organization stormed and ransacked the syrian military 
intelligence headquarters for south lebanon 
bullet scars and smokeblackened shell pocks dotted the 
threestory headquarters the blownoff tin roof of a fruit stall 
lay next to the building and hundreds of oranges apparently 
spilled during the attack covered the alleyway 
the fighters based in the ein elhilweh refugee camp in sidon 
traveled 3 miles north and crossed the awali river to raid the base 
on the coastal highway the river is 40 miles north of the israeli 
border and 25 south of beirut 
the guerrillas used jeepmounted 107mm recoilless guns 
shoulderfired rocketpropelled grenades and ak47 assault rifles 
said police and palestinian sources in sidon 
a statement from plo headquarters in tunis tunisia did not 
deny fatahs involvement but condemned the attack 
it is incumbent on the palestinian leadership to reaffirm that 
it condemns totally such acts and that it immediately gave 
instructions for the opening of an investigation in collaboration 
with the forces present in sidon to identify the authors and 
commanders of this attack it said 
a police source said privately the raid might have been planned 
and executed without arafats prior consent by local fatah 
commanders seeking the release of their comrades 
we cant rule out this possibility since the fatah commanders 
had blamed the chain of assassinations and assassination attempts 
against them in sidon this year on syrias military intelligence 
the source said 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 with the stated purpose of 
driving out arafats guerrillas and warned syria when it withdrew 
in 1985 not to venture south of the awali 
arafat has been at loggerheads with syrian president hafez assad 
since a syrianbacked mutiny in plo ranks in 1983 
more than 2000 palestinian guerrillas remain in syrian jails 
they were arrested in 1983 during an offensive by militias allied 
with syria that forced arafat loyalists to evacuate tripoli a port 
in north lebanon arafat had set up his command there after the 
israelis captured beirut 
the police spokesman said 15 palestinians all from fatah were 
set free during the raid and taken back to ein elhilweh they were 
among 43 people wounded in the attack police said 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate it never discloses casualties but lebanese 
police said the dead included four syrians including a major and 
five attackers 
also killed were a communist party fighter and three militiamen 
of the leftist nasserite organization the sunni moslem group that 
has controlled sidon since the civil war began in 1975 who manned 
a checkpoint on the awali bridge

a leader of west germanys jewish community 
who died last year embezzled nearly 16 million in government funds 
intended for holocaust survivors according to a report released 
thursday 
the report prepared by federal officials and jewish officials 
added that attempts to get the money back have been unsuccessful 
after the january 1988 death of werner nachmann the 62yearold 
chairman of the central council of jews in germany investigators 
found he had run a massive embezzlement scheme involving 
reparations paid by the west german government 
it is the largest scandal to hit west germanys jewish community 
and led to calls for greater supervision of governmental funds 
intended as reparations for jewish survivors of the nazi terror 
investigators found that nachmann as the supervisor of the bank 
accounts where the money was kept had been routinely skimming off 
the interest for his own use 
the council has sued a bank which the report did not identify 
to try to get the money back other attempts to recover it have 
been unsuccessful according to the report 
most of the money went into a failing textile business and other 
firms nachmann ran and at one point the council threatened to 
bring charges against his family and coworkers to get it back 
however thursdays final report said there were no grounds for 
criminal charges against any other people most of the embezzlement 
took place between 1981 and 1987 and the scandal also led to the 
resignation of the councils general secretary in july 1988 
the embezzlement is based on the one side on nachmanns 
criminal actions and on the other on a lack of oversight said 
the report released by interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and 
nachmanns successor heinz galinski 
galinski said in july 1988 the affair had inflicted the worst 
damage on the west german jewish community which now numbers 
about 36000 people about 530000 jews lived in germany when the 
nazis took power in 1933 
galinski also has said the federal government in bonn should 
have played a more active role in supervising the fund which 
totaled 210 million 
overall west germany has paid more than 43 billion in various 
forms of reparations to survivors of the holocaust and their 
families about 6 million european jews were killed in the genocide

a roman catholic priest accused of sexual and 
financial misconduct by a male prostitute who once stayed at the 
priests home for runaways denied the charges thursday and called 
them deeply offensive 
i categorically deny these allegations the rev bruce 
ritter said at a crowded news conference in the covenent house 
cafeteria he said the charges were deeply offensive to me and 
had seriously harmed the image of the 20yearold nationally 
recognized organization that runs shelters in seven north american 
cities and four central american nations 
the manhattan district attorney is investigating charges of 
financial improprieties by ritter charges made by a 20yearold 
man who also reportedly claimed he had a sexual relationship with 
the 62yearold franciscan priest 
ritter firmly disputed the charges he said he served as a 
special mentor to the man who nonetheless later lapsed into his 
previous life of prostitution 
ritters covenant house opened in 1969 after six teens showed up 
at his apartment looking for a place to stay the organization now 
has more than 1500 beds and serves about 25000 children annually 
more than 90 percent of its funding is private 
ritters group was one of 18 honored by president bush in april 
as winners of ronald reagan awards for volunteer excellence 
ritter said the young man at the center of the dispute was one 
of a group of runaway prostitutes who say they are being pursued by 
organized crime members who run prostitution rings they are given 
special attention and a personal mentor 
i chose to become his mentor because frankly i had more 
experience than anyone else ritter said 
we tried so very hard and we failed he said it is 
probably better to say that i failed i thought i knew more 
than i did 
asked why the man would have accused him of such transgressions 
ritter replied i honestly simply do not know 
he said he last spoke with the man in early november and that he 
had chastised him for falling back into prostitution there was 
definitely a coolingoff of the relationship 
ritter and the authorities have not identified the man but a 
law enforcement source identified him for the associated press as 
timothy warner 
ritter produced a memo that he said detailed all the money 
covenant house spent on the man 9800 not 25000 as reported 
the organization which has an annual budget of 85 million for its 
various shelters spends an average of 15000 per person he said 
an audit he said found our books in perfect order every 
penny is accounted for 
the man was treated like other runaways who claim their lives 
are in danger from organized crime he said 
he stayed at covenant houses crisis unit then was set up in an 
apartment staffed by covenant house personnel staff members took 
him to their homes on special occasions and ritter acknowledged 
traveling with him a few times but said there were no sexual 
relations 
we provide for these kids a new identity and education 
necessary for survival their needs are enormous he said they 
are almost always boys they are bereft of family and friends they 
are terrified they are incapable of trust 
the new york post reported wednesday that investigators had the 
youth wear a recording device during a conversation with ritter to 
try to confirm allegations that they had a sexual relationship 
ritter said he was unaware of any taping though he acknowledged 
the conversation got a little weird a little inconsistent 
the post reported that during the taped conversation ritter 
said i decided a long time ago that if god doesnt like me the 
way i am then thats his problem 
ritter said thursday that he remembered telling the man who was 
distressed about sliding back into prostitution that sometimes 
we are what we are

a woman whose family burned to death in a 1982 
car fire has won a 432 million judgment against toyota the 
largest award ever entered against the company 
jurors in a state district court awarded 182 million in actual 
damages and 25 million in exemplary damages wednesday to nike 
adegbite 36 who watched while her husband and two daughters died 
in the burning car six years ago two other people also died in the 
fire 
ms adegbite escaped serious injury in the accident involving a 
1973 toyota corona station wagon which caught fire after being 
rearended on a houston highway 
lawyers on both sides expressed surprise at the size of the 
judgment against toyota motor sales usa inc and its parent 
company toyota motor corp 
we were of course surprised at the verdict not only by the 
extraordinary amount but that the jury decided against us said 
douglas west vice president and general counsel for toyota motor 
sales in torrance calif 
ms adegbite was surprised too said her lawyer stan pfeiffer 
i think everybody was shocked it was an emotional moment 
he added 
west said the verdict is the highest award against toyota by a 
very wide margin previously the largest award against toyota 
was about 5 million he said 
west said toyota will ask the judge to set aside the verdict if 
he doesnt the company plans to appeal 
neither west nor pfeiffer believed the award was the largest 
ever entered against an automobile sales company or manufacturer 
pfeiffer said the sept 26 1982 accident happened when the 
driver of the car boyo adetoye tried to steer off a roadway 
because he had a flat tire and his car was struck by a van 
the impact pushed the station wagons fuel tank forward 
pfeiffer said and the tank was punctured by an empty spare tire 
carrier and a valve on the rear axle 
upon impact the toyota burst into flames when the gasoline 
tank was punctured nike escaped to watch her husband and her two 
girls burn to death he said 
adetoye suffered minor injuries but his wife and child also 
died he reached a settlement with toyota the amount has not been 
disclosed 
pfeiffer claimed that if the spare tire had been in place it 
would have acted as a cushion for the fuel tank and prevented the 
fire he argued that toyota had an obligation to tell buyers that 
the tire must be in place as protection against rearend impacts 
but west said the missing spare tire played no part in the fire 
pfeiffer said the jury found that the design was defective and 
that toyota negligently designed the vehicle and failed to recall 
it 
toyota denies any defects or negligence in the vehicles design 
west said 
sam cole a researcher with the center for auto safety a 
nonprofit consumer group in washington said thursday that there 
were problems with the design of gas tanks on 196673 corona models 
he said the tanks were too close to the rear and had no 
significant structure to absorb the impact of a crash 
youre driving a time bomb if someone hits you from behind 
he said 
at least 17 people have died in fiery accidents involving the 
196673 corona models cole added he did not have any specific 
information concerning problems with the tanks when the spare isnt 
in place in 1973 station wagons 
toyota improved corona gas tanks after 1973 he said the model 
eventually was phased out

immigration commissioner gene mcnary said 
thursday he was studying a plan to bar central americans from 
working in overloaded labor markets such as miami and san diego 
while seeking political asylum 
under the plan being reviewed by the immigration and 
naturalization service work permits issued to aliens applying for 
political asylum would restrict them from taking jobs in cities 
where there is a glut of cheap labor caused by a large 
concentration of new arrivals 
the work permits may exclude miami or san diego or areas that 
are overrun at the present time by aliens mcnary said 
in miami alone there are 50000 people mostly central 
americans seeking refugee status the large concentration of 
wouldbe refugees places a strain on the local labor market and on 
community social services 
mcnary said he has asked the ins general counsel to review 
whether the agency has legal authority to place such restrictions 
on work permits granted to people who are applying for political 
asylum 
arthur helton director of the lawyers committee for human 
rights refugee project said restricting work permits would be an 
unlawful travel restriction under the constitution and the united 
nations refugee protocol 
helton said the only humane solution is to spend more money 
to hire more ins examiners to speed up the processing delays of 
months and years only encourages people to apply for work permits 
he said 
the new immigration commissioner who took office oct 26 
acknowledged in an interview with reporters that i dont feel as 
though i have control of the sprawling agency that has been 
criticized for mismanagement 
some decisions have been made without approval of headquarters 
but will be brought under our management mcnary said 
under mcnarys predecessor alan nelson ins came under repeated 
criticism for mismanagement and inefficiency an audit ordered by 
attorney general dick thornburgh sharply criticized the management 
of the agency under nelson 
while being careful not to criticize nelson mcnary said i am 
aware of a number of audits that have been conducted and are 
ongoing i view that as a benefit 
the commissioner said he has taken steps to centralize the 
agencys budget procurement hiring and policy development 
the lines of authority must be clarified because we have 
people who are taking orders from two different sources mcnary 
said 
because of the diversity of statements by ins officials around 
the country mcnary said he had found myself at a loss as to what 
the policy was on certain issues 
there is going to be one policy and its going to be 
established here at the central office said mcnary who last 
month ordered ins officials to clear public statements with 
washington 
the new commissioner said he wants to streamline deportation 
proceedings which often take years to complete because of 
cumbersome administrative appeals 
the way ins handles deportation is absurd he said any 
lawyer can kick a case for years 
mcnary said he needed more time to determine whether ins would 
continue to deport nicaraguans who came to this country 
about 70 were deported last spring after a crackdown on the 
texasmexico border during an eightmonth period as many as 
60000 central americans entered this country 
nicaraguans have enjoyed a special status in the sense that any 
ins deportation order is reviewed by a special justice department 
unit set up during the reagan administration 
mcnary also said he plans to issue new regulations for 
determining if an alien has a wellfounded fear of persecution and 
is therefore eligible for political asylum 
our adjudicators dont have the training they should have as 
a result there may be mistakes made mcnary said 
mcnary said he had no plans to change the ins policy of 
interviewing haitians on coast guard cutters that intercept boat 
loads of people headed toward us shores 
mcnary said he would not consider conducting the processing of 
these haitians on us soil because that would mean crossing the 
line of exclusion to deportation and deportation is a major 
problem 
the coast guard intercepts one or two boatloads of haitians a 
month on the high seas those refused political asylum by ins 
inspectors are turned back to their native land a practice that 
has been criticized by groups favoring a more open immigration 
policy for haitians

a citysponsored nativity scene 
sanctioned by the us supreme court in 1984 has a new home but 
neither religious nor civil liberties activists are happy with the 
location a monkey house at the zoo 
mayor brian j sarault pledged last week to find a new place for 
the creche after a councilman called the mayor a grinch and 
residents complained that the city had not planned to display the 
figures 
the nativity scene was not going to be displayed because the 
lawns at city hall and hodgson park where it usually stood were 
under repair officials said 
the new display depicting the birth of jesus was erected at 
the slater park zoo monkey house this week the city spent about 
900 to replace the scene which was badly in need of repair 
but placing the creche in the foyer of the monkey house is 
ludicrous and makes a mockery of a sacred religious symbol 
said the rev thomas e ahlburn at the first unitarian church in 
providence a critic of governmentsponsored creches 
i just hope the monkeys appreciate it he said 
steven brown local director of the american civil liberties 
union said it was another clear example of why the government 
should stick to the business of governing and let private citizens 
and churches sponsor religious symbols and treat them the way they 
should be treated 
using jesus christ to promote a zoo may be a good madison 
avenue technique im not sure it does a good job or promoting the 
sanctity of the creche brown said 
in 1980 the aclu challenged pawtuckets right to put a nativity 
scene on public property in a widely cited decision the supreme 
court ruled 54 that the scene could be erected because it 
contained secular elements such as santas reindeer a wishing 
well and candy canes 
paul savoie the mayors administrative assistant said the zoo 
location was only temporary because of the construction but he 
defended it as appropriate 
as a catholic myself i have to say that if jesus were born in 
a manger in a stable i certainly dont think he would have any 
problem with it savoie said

citizens jeered and whistled in the square outside when parliament 
decided thursday it could not legally repeal the communist monopoly 
on power for another month

to address the crowd later and was shouted down 
we will do our best to meet the demands of the people for 
democracy he called out the crowd responded we dont want 
you 
he shouted back we want to assure you of our responsibility 
for the fate of bulgaria that we all want democracy if you do not 
believe us this could lead us to tragedy 
the crowds answer resign resign 
about half the crowd in the square had heeded a call to disperse 
from zheliu zhelev an opposition leader by the time mladenov and 
other officials emerged from the building 
zhelev asked the crowd to return on friday 
well be here they shouted 
parliament later issued a declaration rejecting all attempts 
to pressure its decisionmaking process by undemocratic means 
the state news agency bta reported 
the statement said the protesters showed political vulgarity 
and intolerance and intended to bring disunity to the nation 
and to cause destablization 
mladenov rose to power when todor zhivkov who ran a stalinist

more than 1 million britons are wheezing running 
fevers and nursing headaches during the nations worst outbreak of 
flu in 15 years doctors said thursday five flurelated deaths 
have been reported 
among those who are suffering from what doctors call the english 
flu is queen elizabeth ii this strain physicians say is a 
variant of the hong kong flu that swept britain in the winter of 
197475 
the royal society of general practitioners said thursday that 
infection levels have reached epidemic levels and it expects 
400000 more cases to develop in the next four weeks 
it said 109 people in every 100000 had influenza last week and 
a further 154 in every 100000 had influenzalike illness when the 
sickness rate tops 100 per 100000 the outbreak is considered an 
epidemic 
infection levels in 197475 rose to an average weekly rate of 
350 per 100000 people the society said 
the dead are a 16monthold child a 7yearold two elderly 
people and a 35yearold woman who was six months pregnant her 
baby could not be saved 
symptoms of the disease include fatigue aching muscles 
headaches coughing and prolonged fever lasting four or five days 
three million doses of flu vaccine have been administered and 
new stock has been flown in from france west germany and the 
netherlands 
health secretary kenneth clarke said on british broadcasting 
corp television that the health services were unprepared for the 
epidemic 
we do try to predict epidemics but frankly its rather like 
trying to predict the weather clarke said a lot of these 
fairly basic diseases like flu do defeat sometimes the best 
forecasts that the experts can produce 
nearly 100 hospitals have canceled routine operations and turned 
away all nonemergency cases because of a shortage of doctors and 
nurses 
the queen has canceled engagements since dec 6 her sister 
princess margaret was confined to bed this week 
its a bonanza though for the medicine industry 
while many factories have been forced to slow their assembly 
lines because of reduced staff workers at beecham pharmaceuticals 
northern england plant are working overtime producing hot lemon and 
night nurse cold treatments 
demand for our products has risen dramatically in the last few 
weeks we are rushed off our feet trying to keep up said

the mother and stepfather of a 15yearold 
boy who died after being allowed to drink more than 25 ounces of 
brandy at home must face homicide charges a state appeals court 
ruled thursday 
stephen and jeanne garbarino will have to stand trial in the 
death of jeannes son justin russell who choked on his own vomit 
following the jan 18 1988 drinking bout said the appellate 
division of the state supreme court 
the court overturned a rensselaer county court decision throwing 
out charges of criminally negligent homicide reckless endangerment 
and endangering the welfare of a child against the two adults 
the court said the family began drinking together around the 
kitchen table of their suburban east greenbush home in response to 
an unspecified family crisis it soon escalated into a contest 
between russell and his stepfather over who could hold their liquor 
better the court said 
the boy began vomiting and eventually died he had a 
bloodalcohol level of 41 when he died the court said a person 
is legally intoxicated in new york state with a blood alcohol level 
of 10 
these people placed him in a very precarious position 
endangering his life and welfare by giving him this amount of 
alcohol said james canfield rensselaer county district attorney 
the county court threw out the homicide case arguing it was 
similar to another case where a court said a man could not be 
convicted of criminally negligent homicide for giving heroin to a 
person who later died of an overdose 
but the appellate division said that shouldnt apply in the 
russell case noting that the risk of death is greatly 
increased by the amount of alcohol consumed by the boy 
lawyers representing both garbarinos said they intended to 
appeal the decision to the states highest court they said it 
dangerously broadened the legal definition of criminal negligence 
peter moschetti jr lawyer for jeanne garbarino and donald 
shanley lawyer for stephen garbarino said if the appellate 
division decision is upheld it could place bartenders and party 
hosts in danger of criminal prosecution in cases when theyve given 
guests too much to drink 
were they negligent yes moschetti said of the garbarinos 
but were they criminally negligent theres a big difference 
between criminal negligence and regular negligence 
the lower court found that the garbarinos couldnt stand trial 
for endangering the welfare of a child because of a state law that 
says a parent cant be prosecuted for giving alcohol to a minor in 
the home 
but the appellate division said that provision only applied to 
guardians who give a minimal amount of alcohol to children the 
court said experts testified that even a seasoned alcoholic 
would be endangered by drinking as much as russell did that night 
what purpose is it going to serve to have them the 
garbarinos sit in front of a jury and have to look at autopsy 
photos of their son moschetti said 
there is no way they intended to have their child die 
moschetti said its obviously a tragedy its the worse thing 
that can happen to a parent

laws requiring use of car child safety seats 
enacted in the last decade by all 50 states have reduced infant 
and toddler traffic accident deaths more than 30 percent according 
to a study 
we found that after the laws were adopted there was about a 30 
percent drop in fatalities for toddlers and about a 39 percent drop 
for infants william evans associate professor of economics at 
the university of marylandcollege park said thursday 
the study sponsored by the harvard injury prevention center 
was written by evans and john d graham associate professor at the 
harvard school of public health 
the study compared each states child auto accident fatality 
rate before and after a child restraint law went into effect evans 
said 
child restraint laws save about 160 lives annually in this 
country according to the study which was based on statistics 
compiled by the us department of transportation and by the 
centers for disease controls fatal accident reporting system 
the findings confirm the rationale behind laws requiring 
children to be buckled in evans said 
we were trying to quantify did these laws actually save 
lives evans said we did know that child safety seats were 
effective the only question was how effective were they given the 
usage rates in the population 
tennessee was the first state to enact a child restraint law in 
1978 seven years later all 50 states had passed such legislation 
during that period usage rates rose from 17 percent to 78 percent 
according to federal statistics evans said 
while the department of transportation had compiled studies 
showing the rate of usage of child restraints evans said just 
looking at usage rates was not enough because there is this problem 
of gross misuse of child safety seats 
many parents do not use the restraints properly for instance 
not buckling children in properly 
however he said the study found that enough parents are using 
the devices properly to save a significant number of lives 
the study is to be published in an upcoming issue of the journal 
of health economics evans said

this citys first black mayor announced 
thursday that he wont seek the job he held for eight years 
speculation had been high for months that dutch morial who was 
mayor from 1978 to 1986 but was prohibited from seeking a third 
consecutive term would run against incumbent sidney barthelemy and 
challenger donald mintz 
at a news conference thursday morial 60 said he could have 
won the race but has decided that the demands on his family during 
a campaign would be too much 
its a difficult decision but the circumstances and the 
balancing the ups and downs and all of the other things that one 
has to weigh have dictated its in perhaps a mutual best interest 
that i not seek the office of mayor in 1990 morial said 
however that does not preclude other possibilities 
he didnt name those possibilities but hes been mentioned as a 
possible candidate for congress among other offices 
qualifying for the feb 3 mayors race ends friday afternoon so 
barring a lastminute candidcil member who was a thorn in 
the morial administrations side and mintz an attorney who has 
supported morial in the past 
barthelemy succeeded morial after morial supporters failed to 
persuade voters to change the city charter so the mayor could serve 
more than two consecutive terms

agreement was reached thursday by the united 
states and 31 other governments on 152 billion worth of easy 
loans for more than 50 of the worlds poorest countries over a 
threeyear period 
ninety percent of the money will go to countries where the 
average annual income is 400 a year or less said world bank 
president barber b conable 
the money will come from the 32 countries with the united states 
furnishing the largest share the total us contribution was put 
at 318 billion by george a folsum deputy assistant secretary of 
the treasury for developing nations 
conable said he expects president bush to ask congress for the 
first 108 billion in his next budget early in the new year the 
overall package of loan money will be available starting next july 
1 
we are very pleased with the size of this contribution because 
it maintains the size of the us contribution in real terms 
folsum said 
for the previous three years the united states made the same 
contribution 318 billion 
the new money will be lent out by the banks international 
development association for as long as 40 years at only nominal 
interest with repayments made on loans from earlier years the 
bank expects to have to have about 55 billion a year for this 
type of loan conable said 
japans contribution will be a close second 305 billion at 
the exchange rate folsum used up from 276 billion for the 
previous three years 
the announcement said that 302 million of japans contribution 
was critical to reaching the final agreement the accord had been 
held back by us delay in agreeing to its share 
conable said that china and india are expected to be the biggest 
borrowers taking about 23 billion each over the three years 
after chinas suppression last june of the movement for democracy 
conable cut off new loans though continuing to disburse loans 
granted earlier 
we hope to resume lending in the nottoodistant future but 
there is no specific date he said 
he added that the bank is analyzing chinese financial programs 
and other data were not a political institution he said 
we talk about economic performance he said 
bush nevertheless asked that loans to china be suspended as 
part of his measures against the chinese government last month he 
signed into law a bill that requires him to hold back 115 million 
of an earlier us contribution unless he certifies that the world 
banks loans to china will promote individual freedoms and human 
rights there

both the warsaw pact and nato presented 
proposals thursday designed to reduce six categories of 
conventional weapons in europe and produce an agreement that can be 
signed next year 
after the warsaw pact presentation polish delegate wlodzimierz 
konarski told reporters on behalf of the alliance 
the introduction of the east european project is an important 
step forward in the negotiations but it is not sufficient we need 
a similar presentation of the western side to have a good basis 
for cooperative drafting 
nato presented a proposal several hours later under which the 
superpowers would be limited to 275000 soldiers each and the 
numbers of tanks artillery and other nonnuclear weapons would be 
reduced sharply 
the western draft will strongly spur the negotiations west 
german negotiator ruediger hartmann said after spain introduced the 
proposal 
in geneva ussoviet talks aimed at speeding work on a global 
ban of chemical weapons adjourned thursday with the chief us 
representative expressing optimism 
i believe a chemical weapons convention particularly with the 
emphasis president bush has put on it is highly possible within 
the next year or two max friedersdorf said in the us missions 
official daily bulletin 
since the vienna talks on conventional weapons began in march 
both sides have praised the spirit of cooperation and expressed 
hope for speedy agreement their positions are close on ceilings 
for some weapons categories 
in the warsaw pact draft presented thursday moscow and its 
allies proposed a limit of 4700 combat airplanes each for each 
alliance 
they also suggested limits of 20000 battle tanks and 1900 
combat helicopters in an area extending from the atlantic ocean to 
the ural mountains 
nato proposed ceilings of 5700 combat airplanes and the same 
numbers as the warsaw pact for tanks and helicopters according to 
reports from within the meeting 
like the nato draft the 40page warsaw presentation contained 
suggestions for limiting callups of reservists and the scope of 
military exercises 
this round of negotiations runs through next week still to be 
resolved when the talks resume jan 11 is the problem of 
definitions the descriptions of some arms categories 
the soviet union insists for instance that more than 1000 
air defense interceptors protecting defenses around moscow and 
the urals be excluded from reductions in combat airplanes 
it says the jets are not suitable for either ground attack or 
surprise air attack

bonds issued by massachusetts have plunged to the 
bottom of the nations ratings as the states budget deficit has 
ballooned above 800 million and lawmakers have failed to come up 
with spending cuts or taxes 
the rating problem is really a political one not an economic 
one wayne ayers senior economist at bank of boston said 
thursday 
this week standard amp poors dropped the states bond rating 
from a to bbb the lowest in the nation in november moodys 
investors service dropped massachusetts from a to baa 1 tying it 
with louisiana for the bottom ranking 
im not aware of a state general obligation rating that has 
dropped so quickly robert swerdling assistant vice president of 
municipal finance at standard amp poors said thursday what were 
looking at is a situation that has gone on too long 
economists note that the state government reaped benefits from 
the boom years of the mid1980s while failing to prepare for 
cyclical changes some also say the presidential campaign of gov 
michael s dukakis diverted attention from the impending trouble 
its clear that the signs of the budget problem emerged early 
in 1988 and could have been addressed sooner said sara johnson 
managing economist at drimcgraw hill in lexington 
the deficit has its roots in the states economic downturn as a 
depressed real estate market and a slump in hightech manufacturing 
have led to lower state revenues but economists say government 
officials should have foreseen the trouble and should have saved 
money to avoid a fiscal crisis 
the deficit and the bond rating suggest a lack of foresight in 
the good years johnson said 
when the massachusetts economy was booming in the middle 1980s 
johnson said state officials sharply increased government 
spending rather than use the revenues to build up a surplus to 
protect the state in a downturn 
this has been building for a couple of years it might have 
been submerged because of the presidential campaign said peter 
kozel chief economist at shawmut bank in boston its just that 
the issue wasnt discussed very much 
george leung vice president for state ratings at moodys said 
he has not previously witnessed such a lack of resolve in the 
massachusetts government 
i think its been the lack of any real consensus in the 
government to address the problems both in the executive branch 
and in the legislative branch he said 
leung said while massachusetts and louisiana sit at the bottom 
of the rankings the two states have different situations in 
louisiana its more fundamental economic issues he said 
here its much different 
in massachusetts the growth in the deficit is related to a 
weakening economy but more importantly the lack of timely action 
to deal with it led us to lower the rating he said 
other states have had fiscal troubles but they have done a 
better job keeping their books balanced and maintaining their bond 
ratings 
there are many states with weaker economies than massachusetts 
that have higher bond ratings swerdling said 
bond rating officials said however that eliminating the debt 
will not simply return massachusetts to its lofty level forecasts 
call for continued softness in the state economy and this could 
lead to more fiscal strains in the future leung said 
also the lower bond ratings mean higher borrowing costs for the 
state which makes a bad situation worse ayers said

tree on the ellipse 
</TEXT>

this is the christmas that weve awaited for 50 years and 
across europe east and west 1989 is ending bright with the 
prospect of a far better christmastime than europe has ever known 
a far better future than the world dared to imagine 
and 50 winters have come and gone since darkness closed over 
europe in 1939 fifty years but last month as lech walesa was 
coming to the white house the wall in berlin came tumbling down 
and another winter descended across europe spring returned to 
prague and unconquerable people unquenchable dreams 
and today theres a new sound at the wall a new sound rings 
out not the hammer and sickle but the hammer and the chisel the 
glad sound you hear is not only the bells of christmas but also 
the bells of freedom 
and in this new season of hope the triumph looms its just 
like the joy of christmas not a triumph for one particular 
country or one particular religion but a triumph for all human 
kind 
the holidays are as weve seen here tonight a time of laughter 
and children and counting our blessings a time when songs fill the 
air and hopes fill our hearts for peace on earth goodwill to men 
weve worked hard this year all of us all of you to help to 
help build a better america help someone else help make this a 
kinder and gentler nation 
but there remains a world at need all around us 
and this holiday season reach out to someone right where you 
live because from now on in america theres no room at the 
inn thats simply not an acceptable answer from now on in 
america any definition of a successful life must include serving 
others 
for christmas is measured not by whats beneath your tree but by 
whats inside your heart so this year the spirit of the holidays 
is at long last matched by the spirit of the times 
and its the beginning of a new decade at the ending of an old 
century and whatever your dream whatever star youre following 
the future is bright with possibilities so barbara and i want to 
wish all of you a very merry christmas and now with simultaneous 
treelightings from coast to coast in charleston and santa cruz 
lets show our thousand points of light lets turn on the national 
christmas tree

about 400 ethnic albanians clashed 
with police thursday night in the kosovo town of pec denouncing 
serbian president slobodan milosevic and demanding release of 
former kosovo leader azem vlasi tanjug news agency reported 
the protesters hurled stones at security personnel as they 
marched through the streets before police dispersed them and took 
four albanians into custody

town near the border with albania the streets now bear names of 
serbian rather than albanian notables

enacted last spring that effectively curtailed the autonomy of 
kosovo one of two provinces of serbia the largest yugoslav 
republic 
vlasi kosovos former communist leader is on trial in titova 
mitrovica on counterrevolutionary charges he was accused of 
inspiring a weeklong miners strike and riots in the province in

the man charged with 27 counts of murder 
in the nations worst drunkendriving accident took the stand 
thursday and apologized to family members of some of the dead 
i really am sorry and i mean this larry mahoney said in a 
tight voice at the conclusion of one hour and 10 minutes of 
testimony both members of the victims families and mahoneys 
family broke into tears 
i would probably feel the same way that you feel about this 
the 36yearold factory worker said i wanted to let you know i 
really am sorry i mean it i know its not going to make you 
feel any different toward me 
behind mahoney on the witness stand was a large seating chart of 
the church bus with color photographs and names of the 67 
passengers the names of the 24 children and three adults killed in 
the fiery crash were designated with a black letter d 
mahoney faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the 
charges 27 counts of murder 42 counts of wanton endangerment 12 
counts of assault and a count of drunken driving 
mahoney said he had no recollection of leaving a small drinking 
party and colliding with a crowded church bus on interstate 71 on 
may 14 1988 mahoney who was testifying for the first time in the 
trial also said he had no intention of getting drunk that day 
its a fact i was involved in an accident but i dont 
remember seeing the bus mahoney said i remember waking up in 
the hospital 
mahoney said he hates hard alcohol because it irritates his 
ulcer at the party he remembered asking for a beer none was 
available a man he had just met offered him a mixed drink a clear 
liquid mahoney couldnt identify was poured into a glass 
i took a big drink of it and i coughed and choked on it he 
said some of the men laughed at him he recalled 
asked if he drank any more of the clear liquid mahoney said 
theres no way i could drink two glasses of something like that 
he then recalled drinking what he believed to be pepsi from a 
glass to get the taste of the alcohol out of his mouth 
in previous testimony witnesses had said the soda was mixed 
with vodka but mahoney said he couldnt taste anything in the 
drink he said he never remembered getting the keys to his truck 
and driving away 
the prosecution contends an intoxicated mahoney driving the 
wrong way on the interstate crashed into the bus the defense 
contends that the design of the bus built before federal safety 
standards were tightened contributed to the deaths which 
examiners said resulted from the fire not the original crash 
in earlier testimony the defenses accident reconstruction 
expert wilbur r meredith iii was crossexamined about his 
conclusion that mahoneys truck first hit a cadillac beside the bus 
and then struck the bus 
a previous reconstruction by kentucky state police relying on 
eyewitness accounts investigation of accident scene evidence and 
other information found that mahoneys truck first hit the bus and 
then collided with the cadillac 
mahoneys attorney william summers said the defenses 
reconstruction provides the jury with a more complete picture of 
what authorities say is the nations worst drunkendriving accident 
im a lawyer not houdini im not going to try to put him on 
the other side of the road summers said and im damned sure 
im not going to be able to sober him up 
during crossexamination by assistant attorney general paul 
richwalsky jr meredith said his reconstruction does not 
contradict eyewitness accounts of mahoneys truck colliding first 
with the bus meredith said the eyewitnesses couldnt see the 
collision with a cadillac from their viewing angle

about 100 vietnamese boat people attacked a 
guard with iron bars after two days of peaceful demonstrations 
against the new policy of forced repatriation officials said 
friday 
about 8000 refugees demonstrated without incident thursday 
against forced return to their communist homeland and protests 
spread to more detention camps before the violent incident the 
officials reported 
an officer of the correctional services department was attacked 
late thursday when he saw about 100 refugees in the chimawan 
detention center trying to tear something down the government 
information service reported whether it was an escape attempt was 
not clear 
after the attack the refugees ran back to their barracks and 
the officer was treated for minor injuries according to the 
report it said an investigation revealed that some window bars and 
iron bars for hanging clothes were missing 
protests wednesday and thursday were prompted by the 
repatriation of 51 vietnamese against their will tuesday they were 
pulled screaming and crying from their detention center and put on 
a plane to hanoi 
about 56000 vietnamese refugees are housed in squalid camps in 
hong kong 
under the new program those who arrived before june 1988 remain 
eligible for resettlement overseas but the approximately 44000 
who arrived later are to be sent back if they are classified as 
illegal immigrants 
about 6800 already have been given that designation compared 
with slightly more than 700 accorded refugee status 
the government said thursday a vietnamese man was found hanging 
inside one of the camps in a hospital his condition was described 
as fair 
there have been fears that forced repatriation would cause 
suicide attempts the information service report said the man was 
under investigation in connection with a robbery and his attempt to 
kill himself was not believed linked to repatriation 
more than 2000 vietnamese men women and children many 
wearing white headbands symbolizing protest marched through the 
sham shui po detention center in urban kowloon under banners that 
read forced repatriation is homicide and save our souls 
they thrust their fists into the air as they marched around the 
camps playground a few plainclothesmen kept watch 
at one point protesters gathered in front of a makeshift altar 
that had eggs piled on it and a sign that said requiem ceremony 
for 51 souls an official said the eggs were a religious offering 
for the repatriated vietnamese 
about 4000 vietnamese protested at two separate centers on hei 
ling chau island a former leper colony and 2000 more 
demonstrated at whitehead detention center in the new territories 
said francis ma spokesman for the correctional services department 
which runs the camps 
on wednesday about 6000 vietnamese protested at three centers 
with some shouting they would rather die than return to vietnam

the president thursday told lawmakers 
convened to consider naming gen manuel antonio noriega chief of 
government that the united states had declared war on all 
panamanians 
provisional president francisco rodriguez spoke at the 
inauguration of the new peoples assembly a legislature that 
noriega has been named to coordinate 
the assembly whose membership is entirely pronoriega was 
formed from 510 mayors and county chairmen nationwide to replace 
the legitimate national assembly whose mandate expired sept 1 
among the issues of the twoday meeting is naming noriega as 
panamas chief of government with powers greater than those of 
rodriguez 
noriega wanted in the united states on federal drug trafficking 
and money laundering charges is already the defense forces chief 
and the nations de facto ruler 
the general annulled may 7 national elections when returns 
showed the opposition was winning by a landslide blocking 
selection of a new national assembly and president 
afterward noriega named rodriguez a 51yearold economist and 
noriega associate as provisional president 
if the peoples assembly approves new powers for noriega 
rodriguezs post would largely be reduced to a ceremonial one 
however military and other sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they were advising noriega against accepting such an 
appointment for public relations reasons 
since the us indictments washington has been exerting 
diplomatic and economic pressure including trade and other 
sanctions to force noriga out of power 
but so far the strongman has remained in place weathering coup 
attempt by senior officers in march 1988 and october 1989 
talking to journalists before delivering his speech to 
lawmakers rodriguez praised noriega as a man who had all the 
qualities for becoming chief of government 
it is evident now that the true intention of the us in its 
campaigning in favor of a supposed democracy is a war against 
all panamanians against the government and against the opposition 
and against those who are not aligned with a political group 
rodriguez said in his speech 
the united states does not care even about the political 
groups that have repesented its political and economic interests 
here it is not noriega they want to do away with but our national 
ability to be independent he said 
in another development thursday the foreign ministry said it 
agreed to a request by european economic community ambassadors for 
the release of a group of civilian political prisoners 
acting foreign minister abelardo carles said the panamanian 
government will have a a positive answer 
french ambassador jacques rummelhardt said the request was made 
in the spirit of the christmas season 
the government did not say how many or who would be freed

assailants thursday fired two rifle 
grenades into an american housing and recreation compound causing 
no injuries and only minor damage us officials said 
the attack came a week after a bloody coup attempt that left at 
least 113 people dead was thwarted with help of us war jets 
later a grenade exploded at the house of an unidentified 
american diplomat in manilas makati financial district the us 
embassy said one filipino workman who was repairing the roof was 
slightly injured 
the army said more security patrols had been set up near the 
seaside compound and the us embassy 2 miles to the north 
embassy spokesman david andriessen said the device that exploded 
at the house could have been fired last week during coupassociated 
fighting not intentionally planted 
the us embassy denounced thursdays attack on the seafront 
compound as a cowardly act by terrorists who could have 
killed some of the hundreds of americans who live and work in the 
compound which includes the american club sports field 
commissary and housing for government employees 
police said four cars were damaged when the grenades exploded 
near the us military post office and near an apartment complex 
for us families 
president corazon aquino telephoned us ambassador nicholas 
platt to assure him that philippine authorities would take all 
measures to protect americans 
there was no claim of responsibility but brig gen alexander 
aguirre chief of the police capital command said the attackers 
could have been rebel soldiers who launched a coup attempt against 
mrs aquino on dec 1 
the incident followed threats against us interests by rebel 
soldiers after us f4 phantom jets flew air cover for government 
forces during the coup attempt which ended saturday 
police said five armed men were seen abandoning a van near the 
compound soon after the attack inside the van police found a 
plastic container for a rifle grenade with serial numbers identical 
to those on a grenade fragment recovered on the compound 
the owner of the van armando pantaleon told troops that three 
men with 45caliber pistols had taken his van at gunpoint about an 
hour before the attack 
the terrorists involved clearly did not care if they harmed 
innocent civilians including women children and men platt said 
in a statement 
americans were warned to stay away from the us embassy and 
other us facilities in the immediate future the us 
military banned nonessential travel to manila by the 40000 us 
troops military dependents and civilian employees at the six us 
military bases north and west of the capital 
authorities say about half the estimated 3000 troops who took 
part are still at large 
on wednesday defense secretary fidel ramos said remnants of the 
rebel force still retain the capability to launch terrorist 
attacks sabotage and assassination 
two people were killed and 18 injured when an assailant threw a 
grenade saturday into manilas main post office 
in other developments the governments intelligence chief told 
the senate intelligence oversight committee on thursday that rebels 
were planning another move against the government to be launched in 
the central visayas islands and on mindanao island 
rodolfo canieso chief of the national intelligence coordinating 
agency said 60 percent of the 160000member armed forces would 
accept whatever government emerged victorious in a future coup 
canieso a retired major general and former army commander 
warned that the entire philippine society was in a state of 
flux 
a joint legislative committee late thursday approved a 
compromise bill granting mrs aquino emergency powers for six 
months the committee will refer the new bill to the senate and 
house of representatives on monday both chambers had approved 
differing versions of the emergency bill 
mrs aquino declared an indefinite state of emergency dec 6 and 
this week asked congress to grant specific powers under the 
declaration

a planned agreement between the environmental 
protection agency and the army corps of engineers aimed at carrying 
out president bushs campaign pledge to preserve wetlands may be 
put on hold for 30 days an epa spokeswoman said thursday 
the memorandum of agreement which was scheduled to take effect 
friday has sparked an intense struggle within the administration 
the departments of energy and transportation oppose it and the 
council on environmental quality and the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration are in favor 
congressional sources who spoke on condition that they not be 
identified also said the interior department has split with the 
fish and wildlife service favoring immediate implementation and the 
minerals management service opposed 
environmentalists are keeping a close watch on the dispute 
which has been growing since epa and the corps initialled the new 
agreement early last month 
i think this is a real litmus test of bushs commitment to 
wetlands protection said jan goldmancarter counsel to the 
national wildlife federations fish and wildlife division 
we feel if the memorandum of agreement is secondguessed by 
the administration now it will signal the end of any real effort by 
the bush administration to reverse the wetlands losses we have been 
experiencing ms goldmancarter said 
alicia tenuta an epa spokeswoman said that while no decision 
had been made on whether to delay the agreement delay was a 
definite possibility 
ms tenuta said that other agencies and the white house have 
been very interested in the agreement 
the white house wants to make clear what this means to 
everyone ms tenuta said sure they had a hand in slowing it 
down and making sure we talked it over with the other parties 
in last years presidential campaign bush endorsed a policy of 
no net loss of wetlands like swamps bogs fens marshes and 
tidal estuaries often craved for residential commercial and 
agricultural development the goal emerged from recommendations of 
the conservation foundation whose then head william reilly was 
appointed epa administrator by bush 
in recent years environmentalists have come to recognize the 
value of these areas for wildlife habitat purification of polluted 
waterways flood control and other purposes 
there have been estimates that as many as 400000 acres per year 
of wetlands were being lost in recent decades 
on wednesday bush signed a bill authorizing 15 million a year 
aimed at rebuilding duck populations by purchasing 2 million acres 
of critical wetlands 
federal law requires that the corps grant a permit before 
developers may put fill in most wetlands epa may challenge the 
decision and has certain veto powers over it and the two agencies 
frequently had been at odds 
under the new memo the corps agreed to strive to avoid 
adverse impacts and offset unavoidable adverse impacts to existing 
aquatic resources and for wetlands will strive to achieve a goal 
of no overall net loss of values and functions 
the memorandum also formally implements guidelines for granting 
permits where an applicant first has to try to avoid hurting 
wetlands and if that fails to minimize the damage 
if the project would still cause significant harm the applicant 
would have to compensate for the loss perhaps by creating new ones 
or restoring old damaged areas 
this memorandum was a clear commitment on the part of these to 
agencies to move forward and protect wetlands said ms 
goldmancarter two agencies that were usually at odds had come 
together 
the agreement has come under fire from the oil industry in 
alaska and the alaska congressional delegation 
their approach to no net loss of wetlands would mean no net 
growth for alaska and its oil industry said sen ted stevens 
ralaska in a letter to white house chief of staff john sununu 
alaska gov steve cowper said in a letter to bush the 
agreement came as quite a surprise and he thought a special 
domestic policy council task force was going to develop a national 
wetlands policy not two agencies 
thursday cowper said alaska would sue if it failed to win the 
changes it wannted in the new policy 
it may make sense in the lower 48 where wetlands are scarce 
but its crazy in alaska the governor said

the pentagon has authorized plans by military 
units to capture fugitive drug criminals in foreign countries 
according to a report broadcast thursday 
cbs news reported that among the units to receive the 
authorization is the special delta hostage rescue team formed 
after americans were taken captive in iran 
the news program said the us military became involved after an 
informant told the us government last summer that pablo escobar 
one of the kingpins of the colombian drug trade was hiding at a 
seaside villa in panama 
cbs said troops and helicopters moved to a us base in nearby 
puerto rico to prepare for an attempted capture labor day weekend 
only to abort the plan because there was only a 70 percent chance 
the informant was correct 
as it turned out escobar was not in panama that weekend the 
report said 
cbs did not identify its sources referring only to officials 
maj david super a spokesman for the pentagon told the 
associated press on thursday that he knew nothing about the cbs 
report or any such authorization for us troops 
chief pentagon spokesman pete williams said we do not comment 
on such matters 
we cannot comment on possible contingencies or operations the 
bottom line is no comment said deputy white house spokesman 
roman popadiuk 
in october it became known that in july the office of legal 
counsel issued a memo authorizing the fbi to arrest fugitives 
overseas without the permission of the host country 
this came as a surprise to the white house and state department 
which insisted no such things would be done without full 
interagency discussion and presidential decision 
this reverses a 1980 policy that was issued in response to an 
fbi proposal to kidnap fugitive financier robert vesco accused of 
milking mutual funds of hundreds of millions of dollars before 
fleeing in 1973 
in 1987 the fbi lured hijacker fawaz younis to a yacht off 
cyprus and arrested him in international waters he was sentenced 
in us district court in washington to 30 years in prison for 
hijacking a jordanian airliner in 1985 that carried some us 
citizens 
luis arce gomez identified by cbs as the former minister of 
cocaine for bolivia was captured and brought to the united 
states earlier this week by bolivian police and agents from the 
drug enforcement administration 
cbs quoted abraham sofaer a legal adviser to the state 
department as saying recently that one drug syndicate has 
threatened to kill americans systematically including government 
officials 
if someone makes that kind of assertion i am going to have to 
tell my officials well you know you can treat this as an 
attack you might be able to exercise force in selfdefense he 
said

redoubt volcano erupted thursday on the 
west side of cook inlet hurling volcanic ash seven miles into the 
air and prompting the evacuation of seven oil workers as a 
precaution 
the volcano which last erupted 23 years ago is 115 miles 
southwest of anchorage 
we had confirmation from a markair pilot who sighted an ash 
plume at 35000 feet said john davies state seismologist as 
far as i know no health advisories have been issued yet well 
wait and see how much ash gets into the air 
an air force pilot flying a jet fighter west of anchorage when 
the eruption occurred shortly after 10 am said ash rose from 
15000 feet to about 40000 feet within 10 minutes 
we went right over that mountain on our way out to the 
training area and there was nothing happening said capt steve 
stoddard an f15 pilot he said he flew back over the area within 
30 minutes and saw the ash cloud 
as we were heading back i could see wed have to fly through 
it so we turned down south and flew around the south side of it 
stoddard said 
oscar nelson a breadtruck driver who was on a highway across 
the inlet from the volcano when it erupted said the ash was real 
white and fluffy almost like a cumulus cloud 
we didnt hear any sound said nelson we just noticed a 
plume starting to rise and thought we should jump out and get some 
pictures 
seven of 11 workers at the drift river oil storage facility the 
nearest habitation some 20 miles from the volcano were evacuated 
as a precaution because of the danger of flooding said harold 
mouser the manager of cook inlet pipeline co operator of the 
facility 
our people have seen nothing they felt nothing he said 
he said some of the workers were evacuated in a light plane that 
had gone to the site for a routine grocery delivery and the others 
were transported in a plane sent because of the eruption the oil 
facility was closed mouser said a helicopter was standing by for 
possible evacuation of the four employees who remained at the site 
as monitors 
the us geological survey had warned pilots wednesday that 
there might be an ash hazard from the 10197foot volcano 
gritty volcanic ash is abrasive and can damage aircraft engines 
davies said seismologists from several state and federal 
agencies had been monitoring activity beneath redoubt volcano for 
nearly a week and activity increased about midday wednesday 
we were here all night long he said from his office at the 
university of alaska fairbanks at 1013 this morning there was 
an obvious and very dramatic increase in activity it indicated 
magma moving at depth then increased activity at the summit 
concerns associated with the eruption include potential flash 
flooding of the drift river from melted snow the agency said such 
flooding occurred the last time the volcano erupted in 1966 
the alaska division of emergency services said a light dusting 
of ash was observed in the wasilla area about 40 miles northeast 
of anchorage shortly after noon thursday 
you can feel the grit said jim sey operations and planning 
chief for the division 
i dont think theres too much to be concerned about on this 
particular eruption at this time sey said rather he said 
concerns involved the possibility of successive eruptions 
its just sort of a waitandsee game sey said 
there were no immediate reports of ash in anchorage 
redoubt volcano is within the lake clark national park and 
preserve and has been active at least four times during this 
century until the last few years the volcano had an active steam 
vent near its summit 
an apparent steam flume from the flank of the volcano was 
visible from anchorage during clear weather friday the usgs said

because cbs refused to cut stories about air 
crashes and other airline problems from the daily inflight news 
shows it provides american airlines it is losing americans 
business on feb 28 a cbs official says 
so in march taped cnn newscasts without pictures of airline 
crash stories will continue on the airline thanks to an unusual 
contract turner home entertainment says it expects to sign next 
week with american 
americans rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers but 
its like passing out newspapers with holes cut in them says 
david berman a vicepresident of cbs broadcast international 
the agreement is limited to stories about air crashes 
says steve chamberlain vicepresident of turner home 
entertainment which merchandises programs of cable news network 
part of ted turners cable empire 
there will not be any other wholesale editing of our 
product he adds above all we have to preserve the 
journalistic integrity of our network 
although he said air crash stories would be edited from cnns 
inflight news packages for american mary oneill a spokeswoman 
for the airline said thursday that this doesnt mean a complete 
blackout of such stories 
what the contract with cnn calls for is that cnn will not show 
the video she said by phone from american headquarters in 
dallas they will talk in the audio portion about these kinds 
of incidents but they will not show the video 
she called this an arrangement worked out after americans 
surveys showed that its passengers complained that pictures of 
airline crash scenes deeply disturbed them 
she also said that americans decision to drop cbs was financial 
and wasnt based on an editorial dispute we didnt feel we were 
earning enough profit from our agreement with cbs she said 
acording to a source who asked not to be identified cbs had 
netted about 200000 annually from its inflight newscasts on 
american 
cbs for the past six years has provided american with daily 
tapes of the cbs morning news for daytime flights said berman 
whose division merchandises cbs news programs 
under americans guidelines he said cbs has pulled from 
flights sometimes after consultation with american officials 
programs with reports of airline crashes or virtually anything 
detrimental to the airlines 
cbs finally was told its contract wouldnt be renewed after it 
balked at americans request to simply delete adverse airline news 
and deliver the remainder of the show he said we said no 
absolutely not 
chamberlain characterized as a compromise the cnn agreement with 
american the nations largest air carrier 
there is no similar agreement he said with 11 other airlines 
including delta and quantas that show cnn newscasts during their 
flights 
cbs serves trans world airlines continental airlines and japan 
air lines with weekly summaries of the cbs evening news berman 
said and none ever has asked cbs to edit out reports of airline 
crashes 
we deliver that show to them and theyre responsible for 
duplicating it and putting it on the airplanes he says its up 
to them he adds to decide whether to show any programs containing 
airline crash reports

france has struck an agreement with european 
mercenaries controlling the comoros islands for the soldiers of 
fortune to leave and be replaced with french troops the french 
news agency reported thursday 
the french government had no comment on the reports 
a south african diplomat said earlier thursday the mercenaries 
planned to leave but their commander was still negotiating terms 
for his departure 
the french and belgian mercenaries led by frenchman bob denard 
took over the island nation off southeastern africa after the nov 
26 assassination of president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane denard 
was widely believed to have killed the president but says he was 
accidentally shot by his own bodyguard 
agence francepresse quoted unidentified sources in the comoros 
as saying six french and belgian mercenaries left thursday night on 
an air france flight for paris accompanying them were some wives 
and children the agency said 
the 24 remaining mercenaries including denard were to leave 
friday on a south african military transport plane for an unknown 
destination afp said 
the mercenaries controlled the islands through command of the 
600member presidential guard however some opponents took to the 
streets to protest in moroni the capital 
denard said thursday he wanted a formal transfer of power to the 
french army before leaving according to the star newspaper of 
johannesburg 
the south african paper said denard demanded assurance there 
would be no prosecution for the guards activities six months 
salary and an undisclosed additional payment and press attendance 
at a formal transfer of power 
denard said he was prepared to return to france where he faces 
arrest in a suit brought by relatives of mercenaries killed in an 
unsuccessful coup denard led in the west african country of benin 
in 1977 
the french and south africans the comoros two largest aid 
donors have been negotiating for departure of the mercenaries 
four french naval vessels with 90 commandos are stationed just 
outside comoros territorial waters 
on the french island of mayotte about 170 miles to the 
southwest 300 marine parachute troops and seven military transport 
planes await orders 
officially the french military force is there to evacuate 1600 
french citizens who live on the islands president francois 
mitterrand says france has no intention of a military intervention 
the comoros gained independence from france in 1975 
denard helped engineer a 1975 coup that ousted abdallah then 
led a 1978 coup that restored him to power denard and the 
mercenaries have remained a leading force on the islands ever since

the frigid ellipse behind the white house decorated to represent 
his theme of volunteerism the thousand points of light 
at this christmas season bush said 
weve worked hard this year all of us all of you to help 
build a better america to help make this a kinder and gentler

tumbling down and spring returned to prague

but also the bells of freedom bush told the crowd from behind a 
bulletproof enclosure 
in lighting the national christmas tree bush was continuing a 
presidential tradition begun by calvin coolidge in 1923 
unlike his predecessor ronald reagan who used to throw the 
switch from the white house bush and his wife barbara attended 
the ceremonies lighting the 35foot tall colorado blue spruce tree 
the white house said later 12000 people gathered in the 
nearfreezing temperatures to watch the ceremony 
bush took part in the tree lighting a few hours after he went on 
a quick shopping trip

to a sears roebuck store in washington to buy gifts for his 
grandchildren working with a gift list he spent 30 minutes in the 
stores childrens clothing section paying in cash

permanent spot on the ellipse in 1978 this year it is hung with a

a connecticut woman imprisoned on terrorism 
charges in el salvador for 18 days denied thursday that she hid 
munitions in her yard and said her ordeal has not diminished her 
love for the salvadoran people 
i wish you all could know the salvadoran people jennifer j 
casolo 28 said at a news conference at laguardia airport where 
she arrived around 5 pm after a night in miami 
they are a people of so much faith and love and what they have 
been through makes what i have been through seem this big she 
said making a small fist 
they deserve a country where they can eat where their 
children can go to school where they dont have to worry about 
being dragged away in the middle of the night casolo said 
a church worker who moved to el salvador in 1985 casolo was 
arrested nov 25 after authorities stormed her rented house in san 
salvador and unearthed dynamite grenades and more than 20000 
rounds of ammunition from the back yard 
a salvadoran military judge dropped terrorism charges against 
casolo for lack of evidence but salvadoran president alfredo 
cristiani said he remained convinced of her guilt salvadoran 
officials said a rebel had told them where the arms were buried 
casolo maintains she was framed 
maybe those weapons were there maybe a salvadoran guerrilla 
tipped them off but theres just as much possibility that they 
beat the hell out of someone to get them to say it and excuse my 
language casolo said 
she said that during her imprisonment she underwent several 
interrogations including one in which she was blindfolded and 
forced to stand for a long period 
she said that at night she couldnt sleep because of the sounds 
of others being beaten 
she said her female interrogator told her here you have no 
rights 
then she tells me she has permission to do with me what she 
wants and she doesnt want to be dishonest that she has treated 
people badly before casolo recalled 
she was held in ilopango for eight days of her 18day detention 
she said the prison was surrounded by military headquarters and she 
was afraid of being taken out by the soldiers 
she said that when soldiers stormed her house she shouted 
who could hate me this much 
she added maybe its because if you could discredit me you 
could discredit the work of the church i wanted to stay there 
and be part of the construction of peace the deportation broke my 
heart because it means i cant go back 
she blasted bush administration officials who earlier had 
indicated they believed she might be guilty she said she told the 
salvadorans she was innocent until proven guilty but i didnt 
know my own government representatives dont care about that same 
right 
casolo urged an end to us military aid to el salvador and 
expressed concern for what she said are more than 1000 political 
prisoners still held in el salvador 
on thursday salvadoran police raided the home of the lawyer who 
had defended her salvador ibarra and arrested his sister vilma 
and two others in new york casolo asked that the same sort of 
support shown for her be shown for ms ibarra 
casolo who is fluent in spanish worked for christian education 
seminars a san antoniobased ecumenical group that organizes 
visits to el salvador for americans including members of congress 
the rev dan long of christian education seminars accompanied 
casolo on the flights from san salvador to new york

at her hometown of thomaston conn where her parents awaited 
her return her mother audrey called her release an early 
christmas present today is like the day before the wedding

government which accuses them of aiding leftwing guerillas in the 
countrys decadelong civil war government troops are widely 
blamed for the slaughter of six jesuit priests last month when 
guerrillas began a major new offensive against the government 
she said the soldiers who stormed her house did not let her see 
what they were doing in the backyard

suspected collaborator thursday in the crowded casbah or old 
market in the west bank city of nablus arab reporters said 
an army official confirmed the death and said it was being 
investigated by police 
the slaying was the first of an alleged collaborator in nablus

radical group called the black panthers which had been blamed for 
killing 16 people on suspicion they cooperated with israel 
following those deaths the army announced through loudspeakers 
that citizens no longer need fear attacks from the black panthers 
however masked youths have appeared on the streets since chanting 
that the groups members would still punish collaborators 
thursdays death raised to 156 the number of palestinians slain 
by fellow arabs as alleged collaborators during the twoyearold 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
at least 631 palestinians have been killed by israelis during 
the revolt and 43 israelis also have died 
in nablus palestinian witnesses said several masked 
palestinians led the victim with his hands tied behind his back 
through the narrow streets of the casbah

unprecedented antismog proposals introduced 
thursday call for automakers and fuel industries to produce 
superclean cars for california by the year 2000 a goal some 
carmakers call impossible 
southern california air quality officials view the proposed 
state regulations designed to reduce statewide auto emissions by 
as much as twothirds as a crucial part in their efforts to meet 
federal clean air standards by the year 2007 
california motorists would be the first in the nation able to 
switch to lowpolluting cars under the plan which was formally 
unveiled at a meeting of the california air resources board 
all fuel sources including new gasolines methanol compressed 
natural gas propane ethanol and electricity would be permitted 
as long as vehicles meet stricter emissions standards officials 
said 
the resources board in calling for the standards seeks to 
stretch to new lengths its longtime campaign to force automakers 
and fuel companies to advance their antipollution technology 
in the past we have regulated the car industry and the fuel 
industry board spokesman bill sessa said thursday this is 
really an effort to regulate them at the same time it will require 
an uncommon amount of cooperation between car and fuel makers and 
other energy suppliers to reach the goals we are targeting 
no action was taken during the hearing held at the downtown 
state office building as the board begins gathering reaction from 
various groups including the western states petroleum association 
pacific gas amp electric southern california gas co and ford and 
general motors and others 
the board will review the draft proposal which was formulated 
by staff after consultation workshops with the auto and fuel 
industries sessa said 
a final draft of the pollutioncutting plan was expected by 
july with a board vote possible in september 
the proposal calls for oil and auto companies to join forces to 
develop new engines and fuels that produce fewer contaminating 
emissions 
the plan also calls for about 10 percent of all new cars sold in 
california each year between 1994 and 1996 to be cleanerfuel 
models 
in 1997 onequarter of new cars would have to operate on the 
cleaner fuels the quota would increase to half of cars sold in 
1998 and to 98 percent in 2000 
automakers have complained that cars using methanol cost 
hundreds of dollars more to operate than those using gasoline 
there are many ways to meet the standards through a 
combination of things such as a superior grade of gasoline with 
advanced catalyst systems or perhaps with lower technology engines 
coupled with cleaner burning alternative fuels such as methanol or 
natural gas sessa said 
but citing uncertainties in developing new technologies auto 
company officials said before thursdays meeting they planned to 
ask the agency to postpone its compliance deadlines 
this is going at such an unprecedented pace my fear is that 
they will adopt rules that cant be achieved said mike schwarz 
ford motor cos manager of emissions control in detroit 
schwarz said cleanerfuel cars could be introduced to state 
consumers in 1994 or 1995 but he said the auto industry needs at 
least until 1997 to meet any quotas 
sessa however said the deadlines were reasonable 
there will be much more discussion before a firm proposal but 
were confiden t that these deadlines could be met based on 
testing of prototype cars he said 
some 1 billion gallons of the cleaner fuel would have to be 
marketed in 1997 increasing to about 11 billion gallons in 2006 
according to the plan

opposition candidate patricio aylwin 
trounced gen augusto pinochets former finance minister thursday 
in elections to end the rightwing military presidents 16year 
rule 
official election results from 93 percent of the countrys 75 
million registered voters showed aylwin with 358 million votes or 
552 percent enough for an absolute majority 
interior ministry returns had hernan buchi the former finance 
minister credited with designing a policy of economic growth and 
low inflation from 1985 until may finishing a distant second with 
19 million votes or 294 percent 
at midnight interior minister carlos caceres formally 
recognized aylwins victory and pledged the government will abide 
by the result 
under chilean law aylwin is to take office for four years 
beginning march 11 
earlier thursday evening buchi conceded defeat declaring we 
have returned to democracy mr patricio aylwin has been elected 
president of the republic by the people of chile 
motorists honked their horns in celebration and supporters of 
the 71yearold aylwin a moderate christian democrat rushed into 
the streets of this capital to hail the victory fireworks dotted 
the sky and lines of flagwaving citizens crammed the main 
thoroughfares early friday 
on one large white banner was painted a portrait of expresident 
salvador allende a marxist whose elected 3yearold government was 
toppled by pinochet in a 1973 coup the banner quoted one of the 
final statements of allende who died during the coup i have 
faith in chile and its future 
in a victory speech delivered shortly after midnight 10 pm 
est thursday from a downtown hotel balcony aylwin declared the 
people of chile have taken their future destiny back into their own 
hands 
he then asked the crowd to return peacefully to their homes and 
prepare for an official street celebrations friday afternoon 
a longshot third candidate populist businessman francisco 
errazuriz also conceded defeat saying mr aylwin has won an 
absolute majority errazuriz had 998000 votes or 15 percent 
according to the count there were 114000 null and blank ballots 
the ministry said late thursday 
in his first public reaction pinochet applauded the 
peacefulness and normality of the voting and attributed the margin 
of victory to a better organized opposition 
one serious voting day incident was reported in this nation of 
12 million people police said a gunman fled after killing a 
23yearold officer guarding a polling station in a workingclass 
district in southern santiago no details were given 
voters also elected 38 senators and 120 house of deputies 
members but results were not immediately available scattered 
returns reported by local radio and television networks showed the 
opposition coalition leading in most of the races 
the senate also will include up to 10 members appointed by 
among others the president supreme court and national security 
council 
while a funereal atmosphere was evident at buchi campaign 
headquarters across town aylwin campaign official enrique krauss 
said with a smile the results show the unquestionable victory of 
patricio aylwin 
aylwin who represented an alliance of 17 centrist and leftist 
parties had been heavily favored in most preelection surveys 
the presidential count included returns from all of chiles 12 
official regions in only one the southern 11th region did aylwin 
win less than in absolute majority 46 percent 
with an absolute majority aylwin avoided a twocandidate 
runoff which the constitution required if no nominee won more than 
50 percent of the total 
buchi 40 was backed by progovernment parties errazuriz a 
47yearold millionaire had been expected to run a distant third 
pinochet and other top military officials claimed responsibility 
thursday for leading chile back to democracy it was a model in 
latin america before 1973 and economically has done well in recent 
years exporting wine copper fish fruit and lumber 
aylwin surrounded by bodyguards supplied by the government 
voted early at a school near his home in santiago and was cheered 
by bystanders as he pushed through a crush of journalists 
when buchi voted he was greeted by aylwin backers who taunted 
him with chants of aylwin president he did not respond 
voting is mandatory in chile and people failing to vote can be 
fined 95 for nearly half of the 75 million registered voters 
this was their first real election 
some people arrived before dawn at the polling places and waited 
in lines that stretched for blocks to receive their three paper 
ballots one each for president senate and house of deputies 
the peaceful atmosphere mirrored that of october 1988 when 
chileans rejected a referendum proposal that pinochet lead the 
country until 1997 forcing him to schedule elections 
hundreds of us and european observers are in the country 
although none have been officially recognized by the government it 
allowed them in as tourists saying no foreign supervision of the 
vote was needed 
pinochet complained bitterly thursday about their presence 
saying they came to control the pesos they gave to politicians 
pinochets rightwing administration frequently has accused the 
political opposition of selling out to foreign political parties 
and prodemocracy groups that donated money 
pinochet meeting with reporters at the presidential palace 
said he was angered by two things one because they come to 
control the pesos they gave to politicians and political parties 
second they come to meddle believing that there will be 
irregularities bad things and this isnt so 
among the polling stations thursday was national stadium in 
santiago which became a symbol of political repression after the 
1973 coup the military penned up thousands of dissidents in the 
stadium and according to human rights groups killed or tortured 
many 
similar roundups occurred elsewhere in chile 
although he must step down as president pinochet has said he 
will retain command of the 60000man army a provision of the 
constitution written by his regime prohibits the new president from 
dismissing him until 1998

presidential candidates luis 
inacio da silva and fernando collor de mello traded accusations and 
personal barbs thursday in the final tv debate of a bareknuckle 
campaign before the dec 16 election 
commentators labeled the 2hour encounter a draw in which 
neither candidate scored heavily off the other 
the two men are virtually deadlocked in nationwide polls and the 
campaign turned into a series of personal attacks over the final 
week 
collor de mello called his socialist rival intolerant and 
backward he said da silvas radical workers party would stir 
national strikes land invasions and economic chaos if da silva is 
elected 
da silva called collor de mello emotionally unstable and 
tried to depict him as a member of the dominant archaic upper 
class and the new face of the right 
analysts say the campaign turned ugly this week as opinion polls 
indicated the race was tightening 
an opinion poll published thursday had collor de mello clinging 
to a one percentage point lead over da silva two weeks ago collor 
de mello had a 15 point lead 
earlier thursday miriam cordeiro the mother of da silvas 
illegitimate 15yearold daughter lurian made further intimate 
accusations against him in a collor de mello tv campaign spot on 
national tv 
she said da silva wanted to continue their affair after he was 
married but she refused 
earlier this week ms cordeiro called da silva a racist and 
said he offered pay for her to get an abortion 
da silva says he had an affair with ms cordeiro after his first 
wife died in 1969 
ms cordeiro said her testimony was spontaneous and that she 
didnt get a cent for the interview but a former aide of 
collor de mello said his national reconstruction party paid her 
23000 for her statements 
the supreme electoral court granted da silva the right to reply 
to the charges thursday during collor de mellos assigned tv time 
i never thought anyone could sink so low neither my 
adversary nor this woman da silva said if i erred i want 
the people to judge me 
his camp attributed the attacks to desperation by collor de 
mello 
collor de mello finished first in the firstround election on 
nov 15 with 28 percent of the votes da silva was second with 16 
percent because neither had a majority the two went to a runoff 
a new poll released thursday by the datafolha institute 
indicated collor de mello had 46 percent of the vote and da silva 
45 percent with a margin of error of 2 percent 
datafolha interviewed 5250 people in their homes on tuesday and 
wednesday da silva a former lathe operator and union president 
was widely considered a longshot to reach the presidency 
collor de mello a former congressman and governor of tiny 
alagoas state has been the frontrunner since april his promises 
to clean up corrupt government and his sharp attacks on president 
jose sarney were popular with poor brazilians who make up most of 
the 82 million voters 
the last free election for president was in 1960 when janio 
quadros was elected the armed forces took power in a 1964 coup and 
ruled until 1985 
sarney a civilian was chosen by an electoral college 
controlled by the military regime

namibia will probably become independent 
in march after 75 years of south african rule martti ahtisaari 
the senior un official supervising the territorys independence 
process said thursday 
ahtisaari special representative in namibia for 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told reporters that 
political parties in namibia are making swift progress in drafting 
a constitution for the new nation 
there is the clear desire by all the parties to get this 
exercise done early 
if we are very lucky they might tie up the constitution 
during january and then set a date for independence he added 
asked how soon namibia could gain independence he replied 
the general feeling is sometime in march 
ahtisaari has been supervising namibias moves toward 
independence since april the un teams mission is due to expire 
at the end of march 
the team includes 4650 military observers and 1500 police 
supervisors 
ahtisaari also was asked when namibia also known as southwest 
africa might join the united nations as an independent country he 
said he hoped that would happen by september 
a newly elected constituent assembly must adopt the constitution 
by a twothirds majority before setting a target date for 
independence 
ahtisaari said he saw no stumbling blocks in drafting the 
constitution 
ahtisaari said the process gained momentum when the leading 
party the southwest africa peoples organization declared in 
november that it wanted to enshrine freedom of the press and 
assembly as well as principles of multiparty democracy in the 
constitution 
swapo had conducted a 23year guerrilla war against south 
african authorities in the territory and some namibians feared it 
would seek a oneparty socialist state 
ahtisaari was in new york to consult with senior un officials 
while the general assembly held a special session on apartheid the 
south african system of racial discrimination he said he expected 
to return to namibias capital windhoek on sunday 
south africa captured the territory from germany in world war i 
in 1966 the general assembly canceled a mandate from the league of 
nations the un precursor granting south africa the right to 
administer namibia 
last year south africa agreed to cooperate with the un plan 
for namibias transition to independence when cuba agreed to 
simultaneously withdraw its 50000 troops from neighboring angola

engaged in an angry exchange with gorbachev in the parliament over 
the partys monopoly on political power

sakharov as a historical figure who will be long remembered for 
his human rights efforts in the soviet union his voice was an

a tractortrailer carrying unknown 
hazardous materials overturned thursday on the interstate highway 
circling washington forcing the evacuation of about 100 residents 
and snarling traffic for hours during and after the evening rush 
hour 
the trailer had picked up more than two dozen chemicals in 
richmond va and was bound for harrisburg pa when it lost a 
tire and collided with a car at about 5 pm montgomery county fire 
officials said quoting the unidentified driver 
seven people were injured in the chain reaction of collisions 
that followed and two of the four admitted to suburban hospital 
were reported in serious condition 
traffic remained backed up for several miles at 1030 pm 
officials said officials took the evacuated residents to a nearby 
high school 
firefighters were unsure thursday night exactly how the 
chemicals were contained in the trailer and had not tried to open 
it or remove it from the road where interstate 270 intersects with 
the capital beltway interstate 495 at that point northwest of 
washington 
firefighters said it was important to know how the cargo was 
packaged and positioned before they tried to enter the trailer 
which was on its side they considered the situation so dangerous 
that they retreated to more than 1000 feet from the accident 
officials studied a tape made from a helicopter by a news camera

christine eckermann remembers that in east 
germany you had to tie three christmas trees together to make a 
decent one 
eckermann her friend uwe buschard and her six children have 
few regrets about coming west a month ago 
in good spirits they talk about how theyll bring christmas to 
their temporary home two rooms in a shabby former hotel 
requisitioned for refugees by the red cross 
eckermann and buschard both 30 dont have much spare room in a 
roughly 218squarefoot space they share with three of the children 
at night 
but amid the beds baby crib scuffed hotel chairs and 
bargainbasement wardrobe there will be a tree with ornaments and 
their presents 
were going put in a christmas touch eckermann said 
sitting in the shabby building in a central west berlin residential 
neighborhood where about 50 refugee families live the red cross 
also will be giving out presents 
im not going to be homesick said the former factory 
worker her friend agreed 
a few blocks away west berlins kurfuerstendamm shopping street 
is aglow in ornamental lights a lavish display of wares for west 
germanys traditional season of expensive presents and big family 
dinners 
though eckermann and buschard may not be topnotch western 
consumers yet he has landed an electrical engineering job with a 
monthly takehome pay of about 1100 apart from food and lodging 
provided by the red cross the couple also benefits from west 
germanys generous family support programs and eckermanns alimony 
payments 
i assume if we pay the red cross something for room and board 
it wont be very much otherwise were doing fine she said 
christmas eve has always been a family feast for eckermann and 
shes confident it will remain that way under east germanys new 
travel freedom she said she expects her mother to come over for 
the celebration 
eckermann and buschard packed up the children and moved to west 
berlin the day after the communist authorities opened the berlin 
wall on nov 9 
she and buschard who divorced his first wife in 1984 had a 
fourroom apartment in suburban east berlin but they were not 
happy 
it was on the sixth floor with no elevator no balcony 
cracks in the walls just the way they build in the east she 
said 
no playground just other apartment buildings all around i 
waited seven years to get that apartment 
a strong protestant tradition has survived in east germany 
despite 40 years of communist control with christmas marked in 
public and private as it is in west germany 
but its not quite the same buschard said 
by now stores in east germany dont have presents anymore 
a little chocolate santa claus costs six or seven marks 335 to 
395 then they later rewrap them to sell as easter bunnies he 
said 
packaging for toys is so gray over there added eckermann 
eckermanns children three boys and two girls aged 2 to 14 
are not shy about their wishes sixmonthold samira the couples 
first child sleeps peacefully in her crib 
ronny 11 sporting a new york yankees baseball cap wants a 
bicycle christmas will definitely be better this year he said 
asked why he replied because were in the west thats what 
everyone says anyway 
actually eckermann wants to give ronny his second remote 
control toy car for christmas portable cassette players are among 
the other gift ideas she is contemplating 
the move was tougher on the children than the adults she said 
they left all their toys over there so when they find one 
here in the hall they wont let go 
nearly 320000 east germans have left their country this year 
paired with massive prodemocracy protests the exodus forced major 
political changes in east germany including the opening of its 
western borders 
in west berlin 100 miles inside east germany the arrival of 
50000 east germans has sharpened an existing housing crisis about 
28000 of the refugees are in emergency shelters including school 
gymnasiums and trade fair halls 
we know how hard it is to find an apartment especially with 
six children we just have to deal with that eckermann said 
but well stay in this hotel as long as necessary even if its 
two years 
id rather go to the jungle than back to east germany she 
said maybe if everything changes but not as long as the berlin 
wall stands

as many as 300000 soviet jews are expected to 
flee in the next three years to israel where the prospect has 
exacerbated some deepset ethnic tensions 
a bitter debate over resettlement costs is pitting soviet 
ashkenazis jews of european descent against sephardis those of 
north african and middle eastern origin the sephardis complain 
that the new immigrants may further block poor israelis from moving 
up the social scale 
although the argument has been spearheaded by sephardi 
activists it appears to enjoy some support among other israelis 
on radio callin shows and in letters to newspapers some 
israelis have complained about absorption costs and even suggested 
that immigrants be put in tent camps like the jews who arrived in 
the 1950s 
the dispute reached its peak last week when a sephardi militant 
yamin suissa announced he sent a telegram to president mikhail s 
gorbachev and president bush asking them to curb the soviet jewish 
exodus 
i dont see people accepting these immigrants with a bear 
hug suissa said people still have a feeling in their guts 
towards the immigrants and im expressing exactly what they are 
feeling 
suissas followers and other sephardi groups held a protest 
outside prime minister yitzhak shamirs home handing out soup to 
the poor and demanding that israel deal with social problems before 
encouraging more immigrants 
an angry natan sharansky a human rights champion who spent 
nine years in soviet labor camps before immigrating in 1986 sent 
a letter to shamir saying suissas statements contradicted 
the very idea of immigration 
another former soviet prisoner yosef begun said you know 
that people sat in jail and suffered to come to the land of israel 
so it is sad for us to hear such ideas that the israeli people 
dont need the jews of russia 
others complain that suissas ideas run against israels law of 
return which promises citizenship to any jew 
the wave of immigration is expected because of soviet ethnic 
unrest and economic troubles as well as moscows liberalized 
emigration policy and tighter us immigration rules 
in januarynovember of this year 62540 jews left the soviet 
union of which only 9120 came to israel according to the 
quasigovernmental jewish agency here 
hoping to draw 300000 soviet jews in the next three years 
israel has announced a 3 billion resettlement plan the government 
wants to gather onethird of that sum from donations and loans 
mostly from the united states 
that large sum has frightened many israelis 
today when we have half a million citizens living in poverty 
the state must maintain the balance absorb new immigrants but also 
improve living conditions of old immigrants said elie 
benmenachem a parliament member of sephardi descent from the 
centerleft labor party 
benmenachem speaking to 200 activists from such neighborhoods 
referred to figures showing that 487939 of israels 4477 million 
citizens were living in poverty in 1988 with a monthly income of 
less than 390 per couple 
marko ohaion head of a residents committee in a workingclass 
neighborhood of beersheba told the daily yediot ahronot that 
unless the government deals with the 88 percent unemployment rate 
in addition to absorbing immigrants the tension will become 
unbearable 
sephardi activists tend to see the problem as an ethnic issue 
at a rally of sephardic neighborhood leaders shouts arose that 
ashkenazim need immigration to become a majority the daily 
haaretz reported 
sephardi jews including thirdgeneration immigrants constitute 
up to 55 percent of israels jewish population 
about 20 percent of sephardi jews are considered to be poor 
said yohanan peres a tel aviv university expert on israeli ethnic 
conflicts 
he noted that antiimmigrant emotions surfaced in the 1970s as 
immigrants began receiving improved housing loans and could 
purchase many taxfree goods now he said the feelings are even 
stronger

the aerospace industry is marking record sales 
but is braced for heavy weather in future years with the 
prospect of peaceful coexistence with the soviet union an industry 
leader says 
aerospace industries are likely to decline in sales volume over 
the next decade according to a yearend industry report by the 
aerospace industries association 
this years record sales are due primarily to delivery of 
military aircraft and related equipment that were ordered in 
previous years and to a boom in commercial airliner sales 
association president don fuqua said wednesday 
longrange declines are expected as a result of the prospect of 
peaceful coexistence with the soviet union and predicted defense 
budget cuts fuqua said much of the decline will be offset by 
gains in civil aviation and commercial space programs but the 
overall result will be a modest decline he said

house democrats complain that the white house

capitol hill to explain the action 
members of a house foreign affairs panel had sought the 
testimony of deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger who 
over the weekend accompanied national security adviser brent 
scowcroft to china 
when the white house blocked eagleburgers appearance on 
wednesday democrats accused the administration of hiding out 
to avoid embarrassment 
it seems the bush administration is willing to send mr

although she is the product of the 
most liberal of western schooling prime minister benazir bhutto 
still covers her head in public and never shakes hands with men 
in keeping with islamic fundamentalism 
pakistani womens rights activists say that in her first year in 
power the moslem worlds only female government leader is 
kowtowing to a small but powerful religious right 
the ascent to power late last year of her populist pakistan 
peoples party raised womens hopes for equality in this 
maledominated moslem nation of 109 million people 
but rights advocates now say those hopes have sunk into 
frustration even fear 
at the beginning we felt there was so much to look forward 
to said najma seddique a feminist and human rights activist 
its very sad shes got strength shes not using shes playing 
by the traditionalists rules 
the 36yearold prime minister educated at radcliffe college in 
cambridge mass and at oxford in england wears expansive tent 
dresses and blanketlike shawls the acceptable garments of moslem 
women 
her mother and an aunt arranged her marriage in 1987 to one of 
pakistans leading industrialists asif zardari she claims to have 
never seen zardari before a preengagement family meeting in line 
with orthodox islamic tradition 
benazir bhutto is trying to be more islamic than the mullahs 
moslem clerics but you cant be insisted sameena ahmed a 
longtime member of one of pakistans rare womens rights groups 
its not just disappointment were scared 
ahmed said no matter what concessions ms bhutto makes the 
fundamentalists will never concede her right to rule 
what are they going to give her not support she said 
feminists acknowledge that achieving equal rights for women 
means debunking some ageold traditions 
women can be bartered sold married off against their will 
said seddique the feminist and if they are found in the company 
of a man who isnt their husband or relative they can be killed 
they only have to be accused 
rape victims in pakistan seldom bring charges against their 
attackers out of fear of being accused of willingly having illicit 
sex which is punishable by stoning to death 
feminists and human rights activists say this charge which is 
called zina is the legal equivalent of she asked for it 
to disprove the charge a woman needs to find four men to 
testify that she was sexually assaulted or get the rapist to 
confess a womans testimony even the victims doesnt count 
nahida mahboob elahi president of a women lawyers group said 
a 16yearold girl was recently beaten and raped then charged with 
willingly having sex 
she spent two years in prison and gave birth to the rapists 
child 
until today nothing is done we are very worried elahi said 
nevertheless even ms bhuttos critics will acknowledge that 
subtle changes have occurred in pakistan during the past year 
more women are seen driving cars and somewhat fewer cover their 
heads dancing and singing are making a comeback on television 
a couple was seen holding hands at a neighborhood shopping 
center recently in islamabad a sight that would have attracted 
police attention a year earlier if they couldnt produce a 
marriage certificate they could have been jailed 
these newfound freedoms are not enshrined in law however 
women still languish in prisons charged under islamic laws 
enacted by the late military president gen mohammad zia ulhaq 
before he was killed in a plane crash in august 1988 zia 
launched a program he called islamization inextricably linking 
state and religion 
under zia women were officially made secondclass citizens 
said seddique 
pakistans womens affairs minister rehana sarwar said she 
discovered a woman jailed with her three children because her 
family opposed her marriage her husband was imprisoned elsewhere 
the law is very harsh and unjust she said the court 
presumes the woman is guilty and you must prove that you are not 
a prominent pakistani social worker ansar burney said more 
than 50 percent of an estimated 4000 female prisoners have been 
jailed on zina charges 
men who want to keep their women locked up while they are away 
charge them with zina burney added or a man who divorces a 
woman but doesnt want her to remarry will lay a charge against 
her even families who oppose a marriage may press charges 
however ms bhutto cannot repeal pakistans discriminatory laws 
on her own she needs the support of a rancorous political 
opposition for a twothirds vote in the senate where the 
rightwing islamic democratic alliance dominates 
amnar piracha a lawyer and member of ms bhuttos party said 
the government is committed to repealing the old laws but is 
treading lightly to avoid inciting a hostile opposition 
the political situation is very volatile she added the 
opposition is daily planning to destabilize this government 
womens rights activists claim ms bhutto is making dangerous 
concessions to pakistans religious right 
the prime minister has offered to reintroduce a sweeping islamic 
law that would effectively make all of pakistans legislation 
subject to islamic interpretation it caused women to riot when zia 
first introduced it but he was killed before it could be ratified 
the only way to undercut the power of the mullahs is by 
putting them back in the mosques said ahmed once you give 
them the right to interpret legislation you cant take it away

farhat sadiq once a nurse at karachi 
civil hospital hugged her knees to her chest a black scarf 
framing her face as she tearfully told a story of how three 
doctors raped her and a student nurse 
she said she cried for help but pakistans islamic laws put her 
behind bars 
farhat 22 said she was working the night shift aug 6 when 
three doctors called her and 18yearold shahnaz sardar to a 
private ward 
she said one doctor dragged shahnaz into a bathroom while the 
other two threw her onto a bed 
both of them raped me i was so scared i kept quiet farhat 
said through an interpreter they had a gun they theatened to 
kill me or kidnap me 
farhat claiming the doctors threatened both women into silence 
refused to go to the police until shahnazs sister told a hospital 
matron who reported the alleged crime farhat eventually agreed to 
identify only one of the doctors as khalid rehman but shahnaz 
refused to name any of them 
the result was that farhat and rehman both were jailed under 
broad provisions forbidding sex outside of marriage whether its 
willing or not 
but farhat remained behind bars for almost two months because 
the same court that granted bail to rehman denied it to her she 
appealed to the pakistan surpeme court which overturned the ruling 
and released her 
both women still face trial on sex charges under a pakistani law 
that allows countercharges in a criminal case 
if both were moslems they would face a maximum sentence of 
death by stoning under islamic law but farhat belongs to 
pakistans christian minority and she faces 100 lashes 
what will my life be after this farhat said 
no one willingly marries a rape victim she added 
my parents wont be able to find anyone who wants to marry 
me 
and in pakistani society where many women are still judged by 
the number of sons they bear remaining single is to be a social 
outcast 
pakistans womens rights groups have adopted farhats case as a 
cause celebre they say she was threatened and intimidated into 
silence 
said feminist najma seddique there is a widespread belief in 
our society that if a woman comes out of the house shes asking 
for trouble she deserves whatever she gets

the foreign ministry is sending emissaries 
across the land to try to persuade the japanese to be friendlier 
and closer to the people of the third world but the task is a 
complicated by ingrained prejudices in japan toward foreigners 
the intent of the foreign ministrys public relations campaign 
is get the japanese to give more heartfelt support to the aid their 
government now is giving in increasing sums to developing countries 
because of our geographic isolation it is important for 
people to understand our need and obligation to contribute to the 
rest of the world taro ishibashi director of public relations 
for the foreign ministry said in an interview 
people think why should we contribute to the developing 
world who dont work hard and are very lazy we need to persuade 
them that contributing to the third world is good for their own 
lives 
but japanese attitudes toward outsiders are seen as an obstacle 
many foreigners in japan for instance face resistance if they try 
to move into wellestablished japanese neighborhoods 
two recent incidents revealed prejudices even on the official 
level 
national police agency officials were obliged to apologize to 
the pakistan embassy for an internal police document that claimed 
pakistani suspects smell have skin diseases and tell lies an 
embassy spokesman mohammed sharif said the embassy had accepted 
the apology and trusted police promises that they would change the 
objectionable document 
prime minister toshiki kaifu was criticized by justice minister 
masao goto on grounds that he brushed off korean residents who 
complained they had been harassed following a scandal involving 
political donations by a group linked to communist north korea 
perhaps the bestknown slip occurred three years ago when 
thenprime minister yasuhiro nakasone said the average intelligence 
in the united states is lower than that of japan because of a 
considerable number of blacks puerto ricans and mexicans in the 
us population 
japan has small minority groups including 700000 koreans many 
of whom are descended from workers brought here for forced labor 
during world war ii when japan ruled korea as a colony hundreds 
of indochinese refugees and japanese war orphans raised in 
china have resettled here as have thousands of illegal migrant 
workers from asia and latin america 
the philippine government has occasionally protested treatment 
of its nationals in japan most employed in bars nightclubs and 
construction sites and often mistreated by criminal gangs 
most migrant labor is banned by japanese law and even legal 
immigrants face subtle and sometimes overt discrimination in their 
search for jobs housing and acceptance as members of japanese 
society 
despite government calls for kokusaika or 
internationalization many japanese express concern about coping 
with new neighbors from the third world people with different 
languages foods and customs 
the average person will oppose even the construction of a 
oneroom apartment next door osamu tateno wrote in a letter to 
the asahi shimbun the national newspaper i cant believe the 
same person will gladly lend a hand while their real estate 
values plummet as the number of apartment houses for foreigners 
mushrooms in their neighborhood 
japans still really a sakoku or closed country says 
retiree katsuji tsuchida referring to national seclusion during 
the tokugawa era of 16391854 japanese people are still 
prejudiced against southeast asians and other developing 
countries 
we need to become more international tsuchida said at a one 
day foreign ministry blitz in which officials explained japans 
foreign policy to some 1300 people in gifu a city in mountainous 
central japan 
the foreign ministry has sent officials experts and businessmen 
to more than 1000 communities since april seeking to drive its 
point home 
since taking office in august foreign minister taro nakayama 
has ordered additional efforts especially through television and 
cartoons to build a public consensus in favor of a generous 
internationalized japan officials say 
people think the government is trying to steal their money and 
throw it into the sea of the developing world said ishibashi 
the public relations director its a primitive but genuine 
feeling 
its important today for the government to reach the hearts of 
ordinary people he added 
japan became the worlds largest donor of nonmilitary foreign 
aid in 1988 surpassing the united states with its actual 
disbursement reaching 913 billion according to the foreign 
ministry 
more japanese foreign aid wont necessarily change ingrained 
prejudice against its recipients but foreign ministry officials 
say icreasingly active private aid groups are a sign that the 
message of internationalization is beginning to hit home on a 
personal level 
one example is a group on the southern island of kyushu called 
the karaimo sweet potato exchange foundation it has begun to 
send youths to villages in thailand and the philippines and to 
establish partnerships between farming communities for technical 
and emergency assistance 
the government hoping to fill gaps in its own aid program this 
year for the first time offered financial assistance to private 
groups doing overseas development work 
i still have some hope for the younger generation said 
ishibashi i hope they will understand the importance of the 
pleasure of voluntarily being part of the global community

attempts to reintroduce caribou to maine 
have been thwarted by disease and bears but based on the success 
of a hearty doe named daisy officials will keep trying to 
transplant animals from canada 
we were amazed she was in as good condition as she was in 
after a 600mile trek into and out of canada said wildlife 
biologist mark mccollough leader of the privately funded maine 
caribou project 
of a dozen north american reindeer released last spring in 
baxter state park only daisy is known to be alive although a 
second caribou that lost its radio collar may also be said richard 
b anderson project coordinator 
five caribou died after being attacked by bears and five died 
of the brainworm parasite others still being kept in pens have 
been ravaged by brainworm and ulcers said anderson more than two 
dozen caribou that were used as a breeding herd remain in pens at 
the university of maine at orono 
despite the troubles encountered by most of the herd daisys 
experience shows they can thrive in maine where caribou were 
hunted out of the state around the turn of the century mccollough 
said sightings and radio tracking mark a trek from the wilderness 
park in central maine to quebec and back 
daisy encountered everything possible said anderson it 
crossed highways stayed healthy undoubtedly survived meeting 
bears and coyotes and when we caught it was in just as good 
shape as when we let it go 
two dozen caribou were shot with tranquilizer darts in 
newfoundland three years ago rounded up on helicopters and trucked 
1200 miles to maine project leaders now have asked canada for 25 
more caribou in 1990 and if all goes well for another 25 in 
1991 and in 1992 
newfoundlands environmental and lands minister jim kelland 
agreed wednesday to give the project up to 75 caribou its 
something when you can share a bountiful resource that you have 
with some other area that has been deprived for one reason or 
another he said 
this is a great christmas present to all the people in the 
united states who believe that its important to make a commitment 
to restore native wildlife species said anderson a former maine 
conservation commissioner 
the maine caribou project wants to release about 50 caribou 
including most of those in the pens and those shipped from canada 
next year 
it would be the third release attempt in 1963 two dozen 
newfoundland caribou were released in baxter but they disappeared 
possibly as a result of poaching disease predation and dispersal 
poaching is no longer considered a major threat thanks to stiff 
new fines and jail terms for killing a caribou 
biologists have learned a lot from the setbacks of the latest 
attempt anderson said for example they learned that shots are 
more effective against brainworm than putting medication in the 
caribous food they also learned that bears are more likely to 
attack caribou than had been thought and that bears tend to attack 
their preys face while coyotes attack the hindquarters 
another lesson is that the caribou should not be kept in pens 
before being released because they do not learn to defend 
themselves and it appears caribou are more prone to brainworm 
while in captivity mccollough said 
if caribou are released again it will probably be in higher 
elevations where they are less likely to come in contact with deer 
infected by brainworm and they may fare better against predators 
he said 
biologists are even rethinking the way they should capture the 
caribou some animals died as a result of a tranquilizing drug that 
had varying results on different animals shot with darts during the 
december 1986 roundup 
while they are using a new drug newfoundland wildlife officials 
are also experimenting with a roundup method used by scandanavians 
in herding reindeer driving caribou into a large funnelshaped 
corral another possible plan is to drive them into a lake and 
catch them while they are swimming

international competition will become an 
increasingly important factor in the success of american 
corporations but some securities analysts are slow to adjust their 
forecasts 
in some instances the business globalization in the 1990s will 
be the biggest factor of all in corporate success or failure with 
brand new markets opening up simultaneously with brand new 
competition 
no previous decade ever has presented such opportunities or 
perils they include the opening of the eastern bloc the advent of 
the european economic community in 1992 and further development of 
the pacific rim nations 
these momentous changes will exert pressure on companies 
throughout the world but they arent the only evolving factors 
less developed nations also are restructuring their economies and 
in fact so is the united states 
stuart robbins research director at donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette calls it surprising therefore that most wall street 
recommendations and analyses have heretofore ignored many of the 
implications 
one possible reason for this is that the possibilities may be 
too new and complex to deal with the ultimate direction of 
governments in east bloc nations for example is still difficult 
to fathom 
on the other hand those nations together constitute a 
population of more than 400 million people with a desire for more 
consumer goods better housing hotels computer services and 
various components of infrastructure 
robbins says he feels no topic in the next few years will be of 
more relevance to investments or of greater importance to us 
companies than global competition and has advised his companys 
analysts to assume that perspective 
already according to a study by the massachusetts institute of 
technology about 70 percent of american industry is subject to 
foreign competition robbins believes that is bound to increase 
in recent years however a large number of american companies 
have learned how to deal with such competition many have cut 
overhead improved quality restructured operations and refined 
market focus 
already dlj researchers have spotted what they consider to be 
competitive advantages for some american industries among them 
changing technologies could sharply realign overall metals 
production but us minimill and specialty steelmakers should 
remain world leaders in technology and cost 
strong distribution brand recognition and product quality will 
provide soap and cosmetic firms with better than expected global 
opportunities 
us semiconductor concerns will gain considerable competitive 
advantages against japan in developing their positions as primary 
suppliers of proprietary logic components 
us telecommunications companies will begin to expand 
worldwide by selling current capabilities in network designs and 
systems and further developing their growing cellular relationships 
international entertainment will remain an american domain and 
us companies will derive more than 50 percent of their revenue 
from foreign sources 
the opportunities and competition arent necessarily limited 
to large companies small business has become better organized to 
understand and develop new markets in recent years and many have 
learned the techniques of exporting 
michael sumichrast former chief economist of the national 
association of home builders and now copublisher with arthur 
anderson amp co of real estate perspectives a monthly 
newsletter has this to say 
the eastern bloc needs just about everything from auto parts 
to hotels motels roads communication top office space and even 
ministorage 
sumichrast who is familiar with the eastern bloc having been 
born and brought up in czechoslovakia sees a need for a many 
building products ranging from nails to entire prefabricated 
homes perhaps in joint ventures 
yes he says there are problems in doing business overseas but 
then he cites the experience of the head of a small company who 
says he has sometimes found it easier to do business outside the 
united states

for two months residents of the nations 
capital have been sorting newspapers for recycling but most of the 
papers have gone no farther than a 60foot pit near an incinerator 
awaiting a buyer who still hasnt come 
its another example of the mounting newspaper glut and the 
growing awareness that a successful recycling effort means more 
than persuading citizens to sort their garbage 
steppedup recycling across the country has made an 
unprecedented amount of old newspapers available for reuse but 
markets have been slow in developing old newspaper inventories 
have mounted and prices for recycled papers have plummeted with 
haulers often charging to take them away 
in many cities the local newspaper is being viewed as a villain 
for not using more recycled newsprint we get telephone calls and 
we get scolded says dean myhran assistant to the business 
manager at the star tribune in minneapolis 
myhran says the star tribune is studying ways to use more 
recycled newsprint all but 5 percent of the papers newsprint now 
comes from virgin wood pulp 
nationwide about 14 percent of the 123 million tons of 
newsprint used last year came from recycled stock according to the 
american newspaper publishers association 
yet there is no buyer for an estimated 500000 tons of collected 
newspapers says sen timothy wirth dcolo who cosponsored 
legislation that would require pulp mills to use a certain 
percentage of recycled papers 
prices for old newspapers have dropped from more than 30 a ton 
to 5 or less if they are in good condition and well sorted 
we cant buy all the newspapers that are available to us 
says george elder purchasing manager at southeast recycling corp 
in marietta ga which this summer doubled its recycled newsprint 
production capacity to 500000 tons a year 
buyers paid up to 30 a ton for recycled newspapers in new york 
about a year ago but the city now pays 15 to 30 a ton as a 
processing fee says ivan braun deputy director for recycling 
in youngstown ohio where schools not long ago competed in 
paper drives newspapers now are going to the garbage dump we 
were getting 20 a ton then it dropped to 10 a ton and then to 5 
and when it went to zero we stopped collecting says george 
finnerty the citys litter control coordinator 
more than 6 million pounds of newspapers have been collected 
since oct 1 in the district of columbia but to date all but 250 
tons remain in a 60footdeep pit near a municipal incinerator 
officials say they expect to find a buyer eventually but will 
still have to pay hauling charges 
representatives of the recycling and newspaper industries 
acknowledge the new push for recycling is likely to change 
newsprint production and buying forever 
the newspaper recycling woes also may foreshadow pitfalls in 
other recycling efforts unless markets are developed for the 
recycled products 
lawmakers in dozens of states as well as in congress have gotten 
into the act connecticut newspapers will be required to use 
recycled newsprint for at least 20 percent of their needs by 1993 
and 90 percent by 1998 a california law calls for newspapers to 
meet a 25 percent goal by 1993 and 50 percent by 2000 florida 
implemented a 10 centperton waste recovery fee on virgin 
newsprint and a 10 centperton tax credit for use of recycled 
newsprint 
in congress legislation has been introduced that would require 
paper mills including importers to produce 10 percent and 
eventually 30 percent of their newsprint from recycled material 
for every ton of newspapers recycled three cubic yards of 
landfill space is saved says wirth 
the move by government to mandate newsprint recycling has not 
gone unnoticed among publishers the 1385member american 
newspaper publishers association declared in a formal policy 
statement last september the government should not intervene in 
determinations of newsprint quality 
regulating newsprint is regulating newspapers and it is 
intolerable in a free society the association said 
first amendment questions aside the publishers also are worried 
that governmentmandated newsprint content requirements will drive 
up costs of newsprint and restrict competition says tonda rush 
the associations director of newspaper plans and projects 
environmentalists say government pressure is needed to force 
increased production of recycled newsprint when mills often owned 
entirely or in part by newspapers are expanding production from 
virgin pulp the mills are adding 21 million tons of virginfiber 
capacity over the next two years according to industry officials 
as long as paper mills and publishers add capacity youre 
going to have a glut i believe thats deliberate and thats why 
you need to regulate says ruth caplan executive director of 
environmental action a washingtonbased environmental group 
many major newspaper chains and publishers are rethinking their 
buying practices 
knightridder inc has told its mills that it plans to increase 
the share of recycled newsprint at its 29 newspapers from 11 
percent to 25 percent by 1992 says homer taylor the companys 
vice president for supply 
dennis washburn director of purchasing at gannett co inc 
said the companys future contracts will favor suppliers that are 
increasing recycling capacity gannett plans to increase its use of 
recycled newsprint from 40000 tons to 100000 tons next year at 
its 83 newspapers 
under environmental protection agency guidelines a sheet of 
newsprint is considered recycled if at least 40 percent is from 
recycled paper 
according to the national solid wastes management association a 
trade group the amount of recycled newsprint is expected to 
quadruple to more than 55 million tons annually by 1995 that 
translates to a doubling of the 14 percent of newspaper stock that 
currently is recycled product 
the trade group predicts that percentage will exceed 40 percent 
by 2000 
newspaper executives say most of the past concerns about the 
quality of recycled newsprint have been eased with new deinking 
and recycling techniques 
in the stateoftheart mills there are no problems with 
quality older mills where they havent spent money to update 
facilities you still have color and brightness problems says 
knightridders taylor 
publishers point to other problems however in increasing use 
of recycled newsprint among them a shortage of deinking plants 
and the existing contracts that newspapers signed for virgin 
newsprint 
its going to be two or three years before the various 
industries that use old newspapers are going to be able to gear up 
and make a significant dent in the oversupply it worries me that 
communities even knowing there is a glut out there are beginning 
recycling programs theyre setting the programs up for failure 
says ms rush of the publishers association 
in the meantime there is concern that people will become 
discouraged with recycling 
theres nothing that angers any of us more than the thought 
that weve gone to an extra effort at home and find out that the 
sorted newspapers end up getting buried or burned says allen 
moore president of the national solid wastes management 
association

dan aykroyd sits in a manhattan hotel room with 
a cigarette all fired up puffs of smoke quickly fill the air his 
face temporarily obscured 
even without the dark glasses he wears as elwood of the blues 
brothers fame aykroyd remains mysterious part biker part 
bookworm hes a private man who is gifted at imitating others 
richard nixon jimmy carter julia child but without the 
distinctive mannerisms that would tempt anyone to mimic dan aykroyd 
thats why hes always enjoyed surrounding himself with 
instantly recognizable stars such as bill murray in 
ghostbusters and eddie murphy in trading places an assist 
is as good as a goal aykroyd reasons using the appropriate sports 
metaphor for a native canadian on or offcamera he likes staying 
behind the scenes 
so he happily accepted the advice of a fellow biker who urged 
the actor to audition for the film driving miss daisy based on 
the play by alfred uhry 
billed third behind veterans morgan freeman and jessica tandy 
aykroyds jitters about playing a dramatic role were eased by the 
presence of his fellow actors and director bruce beresford 
tender mercies crimes of the heart 
when youre surrounded by such a great cast with the 
qualities they bring to a piece youre pretty well insulated 
said aykroyd 37 who portrays boolie the patient but 
longsuffering son of tandys eccentric southern jewish matron 
daisy werthan 
i really like to lay on a thick voice a thick persona a 
thick accent its just the kind of character work i enjoy doing i 
think its more interesting than going on screen and being ones 
self which is an awful lot of screen performance today 
as a screenwriter himself ghostbusters dragnet 
aykroyd admired the dimensions uhry gives to his character 
boolies drive for success and the material world the desire to be 
accepted by high society as an actor he enjoyed adding another 
look to his cast of 1000 faces 
it was a period piece so you got to wear a costume and got to 
drive an old car he said all of that helps in enriching the 
performance i like costumes and wigs and funny glasses and hats 
whenever you put me in costume it helps me a bit 
the way they tandy and freeman played the age makeup was 
really spectacular here they are in full full face makeup and 
yet the changes in physical motion and the voice were really subtle 
i was ready to be he says in a deep voice foghorn 
leghorn the rooster 
talking about comics who have tried serious roles such as robin 
williams and steve martin aykroyd said i think the only 
limitations are not in the peoples talents but in the perceptions 
of the audience 
if people are going to be dragged down at all its by the 
smirkers in the audience who want them to do something wild 
aykroyd born in ottawa in 1952 always loved to do imitations 
as a child copying the voices he heard on radio and television 
he was active in drama at the university of ottawa and in 1972 
joined chicagos acclaimed second city improvisational troupe 
meeting up with john belushi chevy chase gilda radner and others 
who three years later formed the original cast of televisions 
saturday night live 
were reminded about its impact on the television form all the 
time said aykroyd who along with belushi left the show in 1979 
to pursue a film career 
weve lost john and lost gilda so weve had much cause to 
reflect and think about the past through those two losses i follow 
the new show i watch it all the time i like to feel im part of 
it in a spiritual way 
aykroyd a longtime science fiction fan cares deeply about the 
spiritual world while murray concerned himself with earthly 
matters in ghostbusters gleefully pursuing sigourney weaver 
aykroyd and softspoken harold ramis discussed demons and slime 
with the enthusiasm of kids playing dungeons and dragons 
i love working with harold he said we got to do all the 
technical exposition which a lot of actors dont like doing but i 
enjoy it i like all that verbiage long passages of technical 
dialogue 
science fiction does change the way you look at the world 
ghostbusters was essentially science fiction harnessed for 
comedys purpose 
this dimension as aykroyd calls it lately has kept him 
busy his wife actress donna dixon recently gave birth to a 
daughter danielle alexandra professionally aykroyd promises 
tricks old and new 
i have a cable project with al franken and tom davis wed 
like to make some day he said we call it nixon in the navy 
its about his old navy days what hes done there in the pacific 
wed do it in five parts on a comedy channel or something

he sits at his drawing board a 
benign grandfatherly figure whose mild manner belies his history 
as creator of some of the wildest funniest characters in film 
history 
you may not have heard of chuck jones but youre certainly 
familiar with the characters he helped bring to life during the 
heyday of the warner bros cartoon studio bugs bunny daffy duck 
porky pig wile e coyote pepe le pew road runner elmer fudd 
and more 
jones 77 lives in a spacious oceanview house in this orange 
county town and he still turns out drawings in his sunlit studio 
he also has done a book aptly titled chuck amuck farrar 
strauss and giroux 2495 which has been critically praised for 
its comic brilliance 
chuck amuck relates the artists carefree california youth 
as a kind of surfing huck finn and his natural drift into 
cartooning for most of the book he writes about those crazy years 
at warner bros when he tex avery and a band of other inspired 
animators created cartoons that were far more audacious and funny 
than those at the disney studio 
character was everything at warner bros and the wilder the 
character the funnier the cartoon jones recently talked about the 
wellspring of his creations 
all of the characters that i was involved with were characters 
i found within myself they were in two general categories he 
said most of them fell into the classic area of comedy going 
back to charlie chaplin and buster keaton and up to woody allen 
when he wasnt being ingmar bergman and richard pryor all of 
them are losers like the rest of us only more so that category 
would cover figures like daffy duck elmer fudd the coyote etc 
once in a while you run into another kind of character like 
bugs bunny he falls into a special category called comic hero 
it started with it happened one night in which clark gable was a 
comic hero and a hero at the same time there was nobody standing 
at the side and giving comic relief bugs falls into that category 
so when you begin a picture with bugs because he is so strong 
and can be a bully and a nuisance you always start him in a hole 
or the woods where you would expect to find a rabbit he would be 
reading a classic tome in sanskrit or something a quietliving 
rabbit then someone comes along to do him hurt such as take his 
foot off which is supposed to be good luck to set him off in a 
rocket or to eat him 
bugs is a natural person leading a normal life until someone 
aggravates him then he fights back in other words hes a sort of 
counterrevolutionary 
like bugs daffy duck originated in the inspired drawings of the 
late tex avery jones converted both into longlasting heroes 
tex did one of the first daffys porkys duck hunt but like 
the original bugs the character was just nuts said jones 
when i got acquainted with daffy i realized he was a person who 
was very much like me he was more courageous than i am he rushes 
in and fears to tread at the same time which i would like to do 
but dont have the guts 
daffy could be fawning and overweening and overbearing at the 
same time he can do strange things but within all of us dwells a 
daffy duck just as i later did how the grinch stole christmas 
for television i realized that all of us hate christmas a little 
bit i had the opportunity to direct someone who hated christmas 
completely that was neat 
road runner and wile e coyote were born more or less by 
accident the animator recalled he and his colleagues decided to 
make a parody on chases and become the jonathan swifts of their 
time they needed two credible antagonists all comedy is based on 
believability and they came up with a road runner and a coyote 
the pair so overwhelmed audiences that a series was born so much 
for parody 
we arbitrarily set down rules after the first cartoon jones 
recalled it would always take place on the southwestern american 
desert where both characters belong road runner would always stay 
on the road unless he was lured off by a detour sign 
road runners trademark came when an artist was carrying a stack 
of drawings down the hall unable to see ahead he called 
beepbeep 
the glory days of warner bros cartoons ended in 1962 because 
the theatrical market for short subjects had disappeared since 
then jones has helped produce features gay purree the 
phantom tollbooth shorts tom and jerry tv series 
curiosity shop and specials the white seal 
rikkitikkitavi his art works have drawn big prices and he 
now serves as a consultant to warner bros

thirty graduates of the west point class 
of 1966 died in the vietnam war the most of any class to see 
action in southeast asia 
many are buried beneath two rows of low white stones in section 
34 of the cemetery at the us military academy class of 1966 
is chiseled on each stone bonding the classmates in death as it 
did in life 
washington post reporter rick atkinson has written a book about 
the class of 66 tracing its arrival at the point as freshfaced 
plebes full of kennedyinspired idealism to the idealshattering 
experience of vietnam from postwar career changes to a 20year 
reunion of classmates sharing a fierce determination to honor the 
dead 
the young men of the class of 66 were caught between the 
rapidly changing social and moral values of the 1960s and the 
staunch traditions of a hallowed military academy 
they are a good way of looking at our collective social 
history said atkinson whose book the long gray line has 
made bestseller lists they straddle a kind of fault line of 
american history 
the class of 66 arrived at west point just a month after 
president kennedy delivered a rousing commencement address to the 
class of 62 the words of douglas macarthurs famous duty 
honor country speech delivered a month earlier still echoed 
through west points granite halls 
macarthur told them if you fail the country will be 
destroyed and they believed that said the author in a 
telephone interview during a west coast promotional tour 
atkinson first wrote about the class of 66 while he was a 
reporter for the kansas city times his fourpart series for which 
he won a pulitzer prize in 1982 grew from a conversation with a 
friend who was a 66 west point graduate 
he was talking how they had gone charging off to war and how 
they were going to win the war and come home to tickertape 
parades atkinson said they thought they had a kind of social 
covenant with the country theyd go to west point serve their 
country and in exchange they would be held in high esteem 
instead 66ers who served in vietnam came home to derision and 
distain many were disillusioned about the war and the army some 
questioned whether four years at west point prepared them for what 
they faced in vietnams jungles and rice paddies 
when youre 22 years old you presume yourself to be immortal 
these guys were no different atkinson said some felt west 
point and their army training had not prepared them for combat for 
seeing other men die 
the deaths of two 66 graduates in particular came to symbolize 
the futility and frustrations of fighting in vietnam the first 
died when he tried to pull a soldier out of some mud and the mans 
gun accidentally fired the second was killed along with 41 other 
soldiers when an american jet bombed their hilltop position in the 
midst of a fierce battle 
a hundred 66 graduates were wounded in southeast asia for some 
the tragedy continued after the war atkinson writes of two 
classmates who were murdered one by his business partner and the 
other by north korean soldiers in a border incident over the 
trimming of a poplar tree 
the author follows the odyssey of the class of 66 mostly 
through the lives of classmates john wheeler tom carhart and 
george crocker 
crocker became a career army man leading troops in vietnam and 
grenada in between he helped revive a drugridden demoralized 
army in west germany and served as a west point instructor when a 
cheating scandal and the admission of women sent the academy into 
turmoil in 1976 he is now chief of staff of the 82nd airborne 
division 
wheeler and carhart had both resigned their commissions by 1971 
as had a third of the 579 graduates of the class of 66 
carhart and wheeler also served in vietnam the former in a 
combat outfit and the latter in the rear echelon the two 
classmates clashed after the war when wheeler helped establish the 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington and carhart objected to 
the memorials design calling it a black gash of sorrow and 
shame 
the 36yearold atkinson the son of a retired career army 
officer grew up on army bases a fact that came in handy while 
writing the book 
i feel comfortable around military men he said i know 
they are fundamentally the same as anyone else their hair is cut a 
little shorter if anything else i know the lingo to a certain 
degree i dont now how far it will take you but it will help you 
get a foot in the door 
in 1970 atkinson received an appointment to the west point 
class of 74 but chose to attend college in north carolina to 
study english 
i just decided it wasnt for me he said it was the 
spring of kent state when the war and the army were as unpopular 
as they ever were 
the long gray line has received mostly favorable reviews 
from critics and west pointers both past and present at a book 
signing session this fall at west point a long gray line of cadets 
snaked through the academy bookstore waiting to buy copies and get 
them autographed by the author 
atkinson said he has met or talked to about half of the class of 
66 i keep running into them on the road he said 
some told the author that admitting female cadets and other 
attempts at humanizing west point have devalued the place in 
many ways 
others told atkinson that the intense hazing cadets suffer in 
their first year is juvenile and contrary to what constitutes the 
tenets of discipline 
despite whatever differences or disillusions they may harbor 
atkinson said west point still commands a special place in the 
lives of the class of 66 
most of them feel this great attachment toward west point 
its the fountainhead of their youth as one of them said the 
academy is was and always will be a very big part of their lives

with stocks diminishing in their own waters asias 
fishing nations are casting for new fishing grounds in a search 
that is bringing conflicts with allies and new links with 
traditional enemies 
the issue also has reached the us congress where senators and 
representatives act either for environmental reasons or to assure 
plentiful supplies of tuna and salmon for american west coast 
fishermen 
much of the conflict however is in the south pacific where 
environmentalists and governments charge that fish stocks are being 
wiped out by a sudden wave of japanese and taiwanese fishing boats 
using giant nets called driftnets 
japanese fishing officials say the criticism is another form of 
japanbashing motivated more by displeasure over japans rapid 
economic growth e the united states that once welcomed asian 
fishermen to their relatively unexploited 200mile economic zones 
now have developed their own fishing industries and are limiting 
foreign access to stocks that are seen increasingly as a limited 
resource 
its a whole new situation that fisheries is entering said 
ian kennedy fisheries officer at new zealands embassy in tokyo 
theres a definite trend from management not only within 200mile 
limits but with the high value of migratory species of fish 
migrating outside the limits 
in 1981 japan was allowed to catch about 12 million tons of 
fish within the united states 200mile zone but its quota was cut 
to virtually zero by 1988 
in their search for fish some countries are entering deals with 
nations they had little to do with before 
companies in anticommunist south korea have landed deals to 
fish in soviet chinese and vietnamese waters 
taiwanese fishing companies plan to visit the soviet union 
early in 1990 to explore fishing cooperation officials say 
china has established joint ventures with nigeria 
guineabissau senegal and morocco in africa and plans to increase 
its fishing fleet in foreign waters next year from 100 to 120 
boats according to official press reports 
japan is interested in entering joint ventures in soviet waters 
but is waiting for more signs of political stability in moscow 
before deciding us officials say 
but increasingly asian fishing powers are turning to 
international waters for their fish 
last season after japanese fishing researchers discovered large 
supplies of albacore tuna in the south pacific high seas japanese 
driftnet boats in the region increased from 20 to 60 and taiwanese 
boats surged to at least 60 and perhaps as many as 130 
driftnets which sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean at once 
consist of a line of nets each about two miles long separated 
from each other by about a quarter of a mile japanese fishing 
officials say the nets attached to floats are allowed to drift 
until they are picked up later 
driftnetting countries say the nets are the only economically 
feasible way to fish on the high seas where fish are less 
concentrated than in coastal areas 
in october however prime minister geoffrey palmer of new 
zealand asked the united nations to ban driftnetting calling them 
walls of death that catch and kill like a vacuum cleaner 
virtually every living creature including some endangered species 
which come in contact with them 
in november 20 south pacific nations decided to ban driftnets 
from their economic zones and urged japan and taiwan to agree to a 
regional prohibition on the method 
the two nations agreed to reduce their fleets but refused to 
discuss a total ban japan called instead for an international 
commission to oversee regional fishing stocks 
theres no scientific evidence yet that driftnetting is 
damaging fisheries resources so its premature to institute a 
ban said kunio kimura senior managing director of the japan 
fisheries association 
its true that there is an incidental catch of marine animals 
in driftnets said katsuyama the fisheries agency official 
but its a mistake to ban a method because one or 10 are caught 
if the number is too large then what we need to do is reduce it 
controversy over driftnetting originally began in the north 
pacific where us salmon fishermen protested poaching by asian 
squid driftnetters 
taiwan has acknowledged that violations occurred and along with 
south korea has agreed to let us officials inspect driftnet 
vessels suspected of illegally catching us fish 
american officials in tokyo say that because of the japanese 
governments tough monitoring they do not believe japanese 
driftnetters now are poaching substantial amounts of us salmon 
despite such charges by members of the us congress 
the us senate has voted for a prohibition of imports of tuna 
caught with driftnets while a congressional subcommittee has given 
its approval to a bill calling on the bush administration to seek 
an international ban on driftnetting 
that could be embarrassing to the united states said an 
american official in tokyo because the us has one of the 
biggest driftnet fisheries in the world for salmon in american 
waters near alaska and elsewhere 
environmentalists have a bad taste in their mouth regarding 
japan because of its whaling the us official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity theres a sense that if japan does it it 
must be bad environmentally but if japan does change its policy 
regarding driftnetting it could start pointing its finger at us

some say 1989 has been bangkoks year 
of the condominium others call it the year of greed 
the air of this once languid city of treeshaded canals and 
quiet temples now is filled with the thud of pile drivers and the 
thunder of traffic 
there seems to be no reprieve bangkok has become a vast work 
site of mushrooming highrises its streets choked with traffic and 
pollution at dangerously high levels 
the boom began about three years ago with annual growth rates 
around 9 percent to 10 percent thailand is talked about as asias 
next economic miracle and bangkok as the dynamic hub of peninsular 
southeast asia 
land prices in the city have soared to as high as 1115 a 
square foot in prime areas millions are being made in land 
speculation and construction rents not long ago among the most 
reasonable in the world are approaching the levels of new york 
hong kong and london 
in the upper class residential area along sukhumvit road more 
than 50 towering condominiums apartment blocks and office 
buildings are rising on what were once leafy family compounds and 
peaceful lanes 
what worries planners and many citizens is that bangkok is not 
only destroying its past but possibly also its future with 
unplanned growth 
forecasts are largely ominous 
the united nations predicts bangkoks population will nearly 
double to 12 million by 2000 making it the 10th largest city in 
the world 
the thailand development and research institute says the citys 
mighty menam chao phraya the river of kings will be devoid of 
all aquatic life by the end of the century unless decisive action 
is taken immediately every day the institute says tons of 
untreated waste pour into the river from sewers and the 
nowbefouled canals that earned bangkok the name venice of the 
east 
already serious pollution is expected to worsen as more 
factories sprout around the capital the main culprit now in air 
pollution is the omnipresent motor vehicle and its leaded fuel 
the national environment board recently found lead levels along 
bangkok streets to be up to four times higher than standards in the 
united states and hospitals are reporting children with abnormally 
high lead levels in their systems 
the topic of inordinate greed by the few has become the talk of 
the town a mefirst attitude is often held responsible for 
many of bangkoks woes 
i believe if they could dig up thailand and put it in a 
parcel they would sell the country too bangkok post columnist 
normita tongtham wrote recently of what he described as 
unscrupulous businessmen 
academics journalists and some technocrats criticize what they 
say is blatant pollution by commerical enterprises disregard for 
public wellbeing by real estate developers and the quick resort 
to bribery to circumvent regulations and laws 
the critics claim vast economic power and behindthescenes 
decisionmaking is still in the hands of a few chinesethai 
families and say it is their ethos that now pervades bangkok rather 
than the traditional thai one of being satisfied with a modest 
lifestyle 
standing in stark contrast is chamlong srimuang widely expected 
to win reelection in january as bangkoks mayor 
a 55yearold buddhist he seems to represent older rural 
values that still attract a large albeit still largely powerless 
segment of bangkoks population 
we must not be selfish is one of chamlongs tenets another 
is eat less and spend less 
he means what he says 
chamlong sleeps on a floor mat eats one meal a day and dresses 
in the roughspun cotton shirts of upcountry farmers he drives a 
battered old car and has donated his salary to the city

the search for the elusive peace dividend is 
under way and in an election year with the cold war thawing the 
government is going to have to deliver one in 1990 after watching 
the berlin wall come apart the voters are likely to insist on 
defense cuts more drastic than the administration deems wise 
even though pentagon planners say real savings are not likely to 
flow from events in the soviet union and its freed satellites until 
later the peace dividend is too politically appealing to be 
postponed 
when the tides here were not going to be able to shovel it 
back out to sea either said sen john glenn dohio he 
forecasts major cuts but worries that some may be premature 
a republican senator suggests the pentagon should recall the 
words of alexander ladrurollin a leader in the french revolution 
of 1848 there go the people i must follow them for i am their 
leader 
reduced defense spending next year will have more to do with the 
demands of deficit reduction and with plans that already were in 
place than with the dramatic changes in eastern europe and the arms 
cuts now under negotiation with the soviet union 
the budget benefits that flow from those changes will come 
later in 1991 and beyond pentagon planners say but patient 
cautious business as usual wont satisfy the political demands of 
the year ahead 
we can talk in neat terms of threat strategy translated into 
dollars in the budget but outside the halls of congress are some 
very active constituents in growing large numbers said sen john 
w warner rva and unless we have a real tight partnership 
with the president predicated on sound realtime information we 
might see that constituency get way out ahead of both the leaders 
in the executive branch and the legislative branch 
warner made that observation at a senate armed services 
committee hearing last week senate democratic leaders have asked 
that panel and the senate foreign relations committee to consider 
the changes in the communist bloc and weigh their impact on 
spending 
the new year will bring dozens of congressional inquiries in 
both house and senate as lawmakers look at potential savings and 
debate what to do with the money 
that debate may produce more sound than substance at the end of 
every war hot or cold theres a wave of optimistic speculation 
about what will be done with the resources that no longer have to 
be spent on the military the results dont match the expectations 
sometimes because of postwar recessions sometimes because the 
money has to go to old unmet needs or to new ones that stem from 
the conflict just ended 
former president ford says any money freed by the easing of the 
cold war should go directly into deficit reduction not into new 
federal spending 
president bush has said that would be his plan but he also has 
said it is premature to be talking about a peace dividend 
ford said there wasnt any after the vietnam war he said it was 
absorbed by federal spending it also was absorbed by a soaring 
inflation rate 
we really never saw any beneficial result with the cutback 
after vietnam he said at an american enterprise institute 
forum it scares me that well make the same serious error when 
it comes to whatever dividend you get 
president bush is expected to propose a 292 billion pentagon 
budget for the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 less than the 
last administration budget sought but more than congress actually 
approved for the current budget year not much dividend there 
the administration warns that changes in the east and arms cuts 
promised by moscow are incomplete and reversible if we attempt 
to pocket too quickly the benefits that we anticipate then we risk 
undercutting the very strategy that has brought us to the brink of 
success paul g wolfowitz undersecretary of defense told the 
senate hearing 
wolfowitz said hed plead guilty to caution and that the 
pentagon can foresee more substantial cuts in four or five years 
with department stores selling chunks of the berlin wall as 10 
christmas gifts caution and patience are going to be hard to 
maintain 
unless were able to predicate our budget upon sound 
intelligence sound planning then were not going to be able to 
hold a line said sen william cohen rmaine constituents 
will demand that we make massive or substantial reductions well 
beyond what might be militarily prudent

the writer based in beijing interviewed 
chinese student leaders in tiananmen square during last springs 
democracy activities six months after the beijing massacre she 
spoke again with some of them now in exile and trying to keep the 
reform movement in their communist homeland alive from half a world 
away 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
six months ago chinese students around 
the world rallied by the thousands and hastily formed aid 
committees after the bloody government attack on demonstrating 
classmates in beijings tiananmen square 
today foreign interest in their cause has waned donations have 
fallen off and internal bickering over personalities and policy has 
hurt their credibility 
the exiled students watch wistfully as movements of the people 
sweep eastern europes communist parties from power and chinas 
continuing crackdown from newspaper front pages 
nonetheless a core of activists led by students who survived 
the june 34 army attack and fled overseas are putting college and 
careers on hold and exposing themselves and their families to 
political retribution to organize a longterm fight for democracy 
from exile 
it is our duty to speak before the whole world chinese people 
are suffering said li lu 23 one of only two students who 
escaped in june while on the chinese governments mostwanted list 
of 21 students he now studies economics at columbia university in 
new york city but says his career will be fighting for human rights 
in china 
i feel deeply guilty said li pressing his hand to his 
heart his wife whom he married amid the bright student banners in 
tiananmen square remains in china 
in world history exile groups have a poor record of achieving 
change at home prospects are especially bleak for the exiles from 
china where many of the 11 billion people are semiliterate 
peasants with little awareness of events abroad 
what we do here is limited acknowledged an wei who came 
from beijing to study and now works parttime at the china 
information center in the boston suburb of newton the center was 
set up in may to get news about chinese political developments into 
and out of china including randomly faxing western news reports to 
chinese offices 
any change in china will have to happen from within but 
external pressure can have an impact he said if we send in 
100 faxes and only 10 get into the hands of concerned people that 
will help 
results may be slow in coming said 21yearold wuer kaixi the 
other key student leader to escape he is now studying at harvard 
we must wait for a good opportunity it could be deng 
xiaopings death or another student movement or changes in the 
military he said when it comes we have to be ready to 
return in a minute to china and play a role 
wuer is one of the leaders of the front for a democratic china 
founded in paris in september and the most prominent of the 
overseas chinese activist groups 
in an underheated apartment in an aging frame house in 
somerville just outside boston wuer and fellow chinese students 
run the fronts main us office they write speeches for his 
frequent public appearances lobby for foreign sanctions against 
china and plot to spirit other dissidents out 
from dozens of makeshift offices and homes across the united 
states and abroad other exile groups also churn out news releases 
and manifestos demanding democracy and smuggle antigovernment 
materials into china 
a week ago their goal of persuading foreign governments to 
pressure china on human rights was dealt a blow by the trip to 
beijing of national security adviser brent scowcroft deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and a white house aide the 
first highlevel american officials to visit since the killings in 
june the bush administration said the visit was meant to mend 
strained ties between the two governments 
but even before scowcrofts visit many activists said they were 
disappointed by the official american stance the us consulate in 
hong kong refused visas to many fleeing chinese dissidents 
president bush has vetoed bills that tried to widen sanctions 
against china and allow students to remain in the united states 
indefinitely 
bush ordered administrative protection for chinese students but 
activists remain dissatisfied noting he is free to cancel the 
order at any time 
next to their visa status financing is the main worry of the 
chinese groups which share a scruffy pennypinched look 
the china information center is one of the better housed in a 
twostory frame house provided by an ecumenical religious group it 
pays rent when it can 
the independent federation of chinese students and scholars 
based in washington was formed by chinese student groups on a 
number of campuses around the country in chicago six chinese 
students tape daily halfhour programs of news and commentary that 
are broadcast into china on shifting frequencies as the voice of 
june 4 
the movements only newspaper to date is the press freedom 
herald in los angeles yan zhongmei a chinese visiting scholar in 
tokyo has started a magazine democratic china 
spiritual grandfather to all the groups is the chinese alliance 
for democracy formed seven years ago by a chinese student 
defector from a small apartment in the new york city borough of 
queens the alliance publishes the anticommunist magazine china 
spring 
the alliance offers a sobering example to newcomers although it 
has found steady if sparse financial support and survived bitter 
internal splits it can claim to have influenced only small groups 
of urban chinese despite efforts by underground members in china 
the newcomers realize that to do merely as well they must 
become better organized and work together overcoming the 
historical tendency of chinese groups abroad toward factionalism 
already fellow exiles have criticized wuer in public for alleged 
immaturity and divisions have developed over whether the communist 
party can be reformed from within 
they also must figure out how to introduce democracy in a 
country with no tradition of popular participation in government 
the sad thing is everybody wants democracy and freedom but if 
you ask them what kind of democracy they cant answer an said 
yang lixin president of the chinese student association of 
columbia university said new groups such as the front have yet to 
democratize themselves very frequently it is because the 
exiles learned about democracy from books he said they dont 
know how it works 
they are trying to learn in part through lobbying activities 
but many fear americans will forget them as they believe the 
us government is doing 
in june the china solidarity committee set up in washington by 
feng shengping had seven fulltime volunteers answering telephone 
calls now one person can handle everything he said 
some say they have received vague warnings from chinese 
officials of eventual retribution or their families in china have 
been questioned 
feng predicts some activists will lose interest or be forced to 
find paying jobs 
but some will stay definitely just like after a big tide is 
over you still have rocks left behind he said 
people like me have burned our bridges if we want to go back 
to china to see our parents and friends we have to promote the 
cause or else we must stay here forever

of all americas wonders nothing has 
impressed wuer kaixi like the yellow school bus 
its great said the 21yearold student one of the 
springs protest leaders in tiananmen square when it puts on its 
lights every other vehicle must stop it shows that in america 
the most important thing is the person 
in china no one respects people 
wuer who was put on chinas mostwanted list after the army 
shot its way into beijing in june and ended the prodemocracy 
protests is trying to continue the fight from half a world away 
it hasnt been easy 
at 130 am one bitterly cold december night he sat slumped in 
a chair in his shabby suburban boston office painfully practicing 
a speech in english 
we must remember our brothers and sisters who died during the 
fight for democracy in tiananmen square he read coached by a 
chinese student with better command of english 
his more difficult struggle however is mastering the 
subtleties of leadership something that seemed simple enough amid 
the marching masses in the square 
there crowds rallied to the personal magnetism of wuer a 
uygur minority student at the beijing teachers university 
classmates hailed him on campus as lingxiu leader and 
foreign journalists flocked to his tiny illlit dormitory room 
jammed with the bunks of eight students 
impulsive dramatic boastful and impassioned wuer was the 
student most often the focus of foreign television cameras in the 
seven weeks of marches and hunger strikes he seemed to recognize 
no authority at a meeting of student leaders with premier li peng 
he even accused the premier of being rude 
the cameras followed him in exile to paris where he fled via 
hong kong during the long summer of arrests in china and to 
somerville here he heads the american office of the front for a 
democratic china the main group formed by chinese dissidents to 
continue their movement 
american reporters grant him celebrity status but some fellow 
chinese resent the attention and accuse wuer of unchinese vanity 
many young chinese abroad look to him for leadership older 
exiles traditionally paternalistic lecture him in public for 
immaturity 
the chineselanguage press in the united states financed from 
taiwan and mindful of financial scandal in past exile groups has 
tried to find evidence of money mishandling by wuer and his aides 
the strain shows in the fronts office wuer looked harried as 
he fielded telephone requests for speeches three equally young 
volunteers dashed back and forth asking him about the draft agenda 
for a front conference 
its harder than in beijing he said in beijing they 
tell you everything what you can do and cant do here for 
everything you have more than 100 choices 
wuer is taking courses in english and chinese literature as a 
nondegree student at harvard its too hard to me sometimes 
he said in english learned almost entirely since june and still 
far short of his needs i understand about 30 to 50 percent of my 
classes 
wuers health has suffered he has collapsed several times in 
public most recently after a harvard rally marking six months 
since the june crackdown 
his closest aide pierre fournier a french student who met 
wuer in paris said doctors found nothing seriously ailing wuer 
but did note a rapid heartbeat 
its nothing said wuer peering into a mirror at his pale 
face and darkshadowed eyes he grimaced and then grinned ive 
lost weight im happy 
an article in the chineselanguage world journal last month 
first broached the possibility of improper use of donations to the 
student movement the paper said wuer who receives no formal 
salary accepted some donations for personal use instead of giving 
everything to the front it accused him of staying at expensive 
hotels and furnishing the somerville office lavishly other reports 
said he should donate speech fees reportedly as high as 10000 
to the front 
wuer doesnt really pay attention to details he should have 
been more careful said harvard student activist luo zhexi he 
and other students said wuer was innocent of legal or moral blame 
and was merely inexperienced he is now accounting for all money 
they said 
his office looked far from luxurious the donated secondhand 
desks were deeply scratched and volunteers wore thick sweaters in 
the poorly heated rooms 
wuer has tried to ease the tension by retreating a bit 
i dont want to be a media star he said thats not what 
we wanted in tiananmen

in addition to its annual poll on the years top 
news stories the ap this year surveyed news professionals on the 
top stories of the decade of the 1980s here is a report on the 
results 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mikhail s gorbachev and the thawing of the cold war were voted 
the story of the 1980s by editors and news directors of member 
newspapers and broadcast stations of the associated press 
other stories in the decades top 10 were in descending order 
the aids epidemic ronald reagans taxcutting presidency the us 
drug plague explosion of the space shuttle challenger the iran 
hostage crisis and other terrorist acts the nuclear meltdown at 
chernobyl chinas suppression of its democracy movement the 
irancontra affair and continuing strife in central america 
the 306 us editors responding to the poll gave 2593 points to 
gorbachev and his relaxation of the soviet unions iron grip in 
eastern europe the aids story received 1830 points for second 
place and the reagan presidency 1138 for third a firstplace 
vote earned a story 10 points and a 10thplace listing one point 
the stories by ranking 
1 gorbachev assumed leadership in the soviet union in 1985 with 
a policy of reform of a faltering communist system in a series of 
stunning developments in 1989 he withdrew soviet troops from 
afghanistan and then stood aside as mass popular movements undercut 
communist power in poland hungary bulgaria czechoslovakia and 
east germany gorbachev even gave tacit approval in november as the 
incarnation of the cold war the berlin wall crumbled amid joyous 
celebrations by east and west germans 
2 aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome first made its 
deadly appearnce in the united states in male homosexual 
communities it spread relentlessly among heterosexuals and drug 
addicts through sexual contact and shared hypodermic needles in an 
age of miracle drugs science could not find an antidote to the 
plague of aids lingering death 
3 republican reagan was elected in 1980 vowing to trim the 
federal government he cut taxes sharply and shrank social programs 
in a fundamental reversal of government trends huge defense 
outlays during his two terms however created enormous deficits 
and more than doubled the national debt the former film star 
brought hollywood techniques to campaigning and the white house 
sent troops to the tiny caribbean island of grenada named the 
first woman to the supreme court softened his view of the soviet 
evil empire survived an assassins bullet and left office as

4 drug addiction and the crime that comes with it rotted the 
core of americas inner cities and spread across the landscape 
efforts to halt the flow of cocaine from the andean valleys of 
south america were only marginally successful and some responsible

spacecraft the shuttle but the explosion of the shuttle 
challenger just after launch from cape canaveral on jan 28 1986 
shut down the us manned space program for two years all seven 
aboard challenger including schoolteacher christa mcauliffe were

doctors arent the only ones issuing 
prescriptions for cancer patients at presbyterian hospital the 
patients themselves can order up a dose of dangerfield or a marx 
brothers booster from the laugh mobile 
its a real pickmeup said wanda mooers whos been 
battling cancer of the lymph nodes for more than 14 months you 
can pick out things even playdoh and crayons to take your mind 
off your problems 
every monday and friday volunteers wheel the 5foottall 
yellow cart around presbyterians seventhfloor cancer unit it 
holds about 35 videotapes ranging from national lampoons animal 
house to the three stooges to tv sitcoms and comedians like 
rodney dangerfield as well as humorous books and audio tape and 
games even slinky toys 
i look forward to it said mooers the mother of two young 
sons when youre going through chemotherapy and radiation you 
need to put yourself in a good state of mind which is sometimes 
difficult to do 
it gives them some diversion while theyre in the hospital 
said sherry bargoil cancer control program coordinator 
medically speaking we know there is some mindbody connection 
in his book anatomy of an illness norman cousins wrote 
even if we find that laughter produces no specific biochemical 
changes it does accomplish one very essential purpose it tends to 
help a person cope with apprehension and even panic that all too 
frequently accompany serious illness 
hospital officials got the idea after talking with patients ms 
bargoil said some of our younger leukemia patients who were 
staying with us for long periods began bringing in their own vcrs 
and renting tapes we began to think why cant we do something 
like this 
they consulted ruth hamilton executive director of the carolina 
health and humor association who started the first laugh mobile at 
duke university three years ago and the hospital auxiliary 
provided 5000 to pay for it 
in january a second laugh mobile will begin making the rounds 
at the childrens cancer unit at prebyerian and officials are 
toying with the idea of working out a deal with a national video 
chain to offer new movies 
mooers said the program means a lot to her especially when 
shes feeling lonely and depressed i honestly feel more people 
should pay attention to the people in the cancer ward they should 
stop by and see how theyre doing

merrell scott was afraid to leave her house 
when you have a panic attack you feel like youre going to 
die your hands and feet get tingly you feel nauseated the room 
spins you have hot and cold flashes its awful said mrs 
scott 35 who suffers from agoraphobia the fear of open spaces 
for me outside pressures or just anything can start it and once 
it starts it just starts rolling and takes off 
but she and other anxietyprone worriers are finding help 
worrying isnt necessarily bad but ruminating over and over 
about what awful thing can happen is useless said psychologist 
rowland folensbee it distracts you and you become too 
preoccupied with what ifs 
its usually what if rather than what can i do about it 
 
folensbee operator of the worry clinic specializes in treating 
anxiety disorders he is one of only about 10 such specialists in 
the country 
for some worry is a way of being on guard if im always 
thinking of things that happen im always vigilant he said 
for others its an avoidance technique ive spent a lot of 
time worrying about it so i dont have to go and tell my boss i 
need a raise ive done my part ive worried about it for some 
people worrying about it gives them a sense of control if i 
worry about it it wont happen if i fail to worry about it it 
will happen 
folensbee recommends that people learn to identify when they 
begin to worry and then to refocus their attention one technique 
is to set aside a time to worry each day allowing nothing else 
during that time and allowing no worrying at any other time of the 
day we approach worry as being a process rather than whatever 
the worry is about he said 
its not that worriers dont have legitimate problems its that 
they become obsessed and often depressed and stymied he said 
it appears to me that people who are worriers have some things to 
worry about but no more than the average person we all have the 
concern about how our kids are going to do in school but we dont 
spend the greater parts of the day worrying about it 
folensbee met with mrs scott and then had her join a support 
group of 10 to 30 clients who suffer anxieties and meet weekly at 
charter hospital 
weve become like a family to each other she said its 
like my husband says he can sympathize with me but he cant 
empathize with the group you know there are other people around 
who have this and you are not alone 
some of the people in there seemed to be worse off than me 
joked charles higginbottom 36 a telephone lineman who joined 
after he had become so stressed he no longer could function at work 
many of those who suffer crippling anxieties are people 
pleasers who do anything and everything for someone else 
overextending themselves and leaving themselves short in personal 
time folensbee said in the group clients with different fears of 
anxieties share common feelings and physical complaints 
they suffer with something similar to me higginbottom said 
some people have a fear of flying or a fear of driving i didnt 
have a particular fear but the things we talk about are problems 
for me too 
higginbottom who was so worried about being called on yet 
another string of emergency repair jobs that he had to leave his 
job for two months said that thanks to the group i just went 
from dark to daylight 
mrs scott too has found strength from folensbee and the group 
it was hard and i found out i had to go by myself to get out 
there before i would either rely on my husband or friends or 
neighbors but i started out small going to the grocery store for 
five minutes and building up 
i had to face the fear be in crowds sit and have to live 
through the panic attack i can remember he sent me to a macys 
oneday sale and he made me stand in line for 20 minutes and i 
cried the whole time 
last week i went to macys oneday sale and i stayed four 
hours and didnt even think about it

efforts to find defective genes that help 
trigger psychiatric disorders have produced only disappointments 
this year but genehunting researchers say they remain optimistic 
a highly publicized 1987 paper for example reported evidence 
that a gene for manicdepressive disorder in three generations of a 
large amish family lay within a portion of the chromosome numbered 
11 but this year most of the coauthors joined other scientists 
to report that new data greatly weakened the evidence for the 
genes existence 
the evidence has not completely disappeared said coauthor 
ken kidd of yale university but now its not a strong bit of 
evidence 
scientists seeking possibly defective genes within the 23 pairs 
of chromosomes everyone carries study large families with seemingly 
inherited tendencies toward diseases this lets them look for 
genetic differences showing up in the sick people when compared 
with family members without the disease 
other studies involving manicdepressive disorder which has 
nearly 2 million americans alternating between depression and 
excessive euphoria have suggested that a gene resides on the 
chromosome designated x 
miron baron of the columbia university college of physicians and 
surgeons considers evidence he and others presented in a 1987 paper 
to be strong though not compelling hugh gurling of the university 
of london citing other research with similar findings considers 
the link to the x chromosome confirmed 
but kidd said the 1987 study which follows a somewhat 
checkered history of similar research has met with skepticism 
among his colleagues a lot of people just dont know how to 
interpret it it is not broadly accepted in the scientific 
community as a definitive study 
and elliot gershon of the national institute of mental health 
said a study not yet published has found no evidence of a 
manicdepression gene in the location barons paper proposed 
we dont know what the story is on chromosome x and 
manicdepressive illness said gershon chief of the clinical 
neurogenetics branch of the institutes intramural research program 
scientists want to find and analyze the genes because it might 
lead to advances in diagnosis and treatment when they fail to 
confirm a reported genetic link it can mean one of three things 
the first report was incorrect the one that failed to confirm the 
link overlooked the gene or both were right the gene exists in 
family members studied for the first paper but not in people 
studied for the second 
such uncertainty surrounds gurlings 1988 study that found 
evidence of a gene for schizophrenia on chromosome 5 it included 
seven families from iceland and britain no evidence for such a 
gene appeared in another study published at the same time of a 
large swedish family 
this year separate studies on families from scotland and north 
america also found no evidence of the proposed gene 
gurling who plans confirmatory studies of his own in icelandic 
families within the next couple months considers some attempts to 
test his results poorly designed beyond that he believes the gene 
is not a predominant cause of schizophrenia outside iceland so if 
it is related to only a fraction of cases elsewhere many people 
will be needed to detect its presence 
we simply have not tested enough families so far and it may 
take another 20 to 100 families to give gurlings findings a fair 
chance of being confirmed said researcher william byerly of the 
university of utah medical center in salt lake city the gurling 
data looks to me still promising but its likely to be a rare 
cause of the disease 
kidd said he doubts gurlings proposed gene exists but he and 
other researchers are hopeful about future chances for finding 
genes for psychiatric disorders theres a very healthy 
realization that this is not going to be easy said kidd i 
dont think its impossible 
im optimistic said baron but i think we have to be 
prepared for hard work and perseverence and a high frustration 
tolerance

a mixture of common cooking oil and 
methanol will be tested as a fuel in a regional district bus 
diesels run very well on it said thomas reed a colorado 
school of mines chemist thirty percent added to diesel fuel will 
reduce tailpipe smoke or we can use it as a substitute well 
try it transportation 
both ways 
reed uses a process called transesterification to combine 
cooking oil and methanol to produce a fuel that is 10 percent 
oxygen it is cleaner than diesel fuel and produces 95 percent of 
the energy and he has even been able to make the product using 
waste drippings from such things as frenchfry machines 
i went down to the local fastfood restaurant and bought a 
gallon of waste oil he said we added the methanol and cooked 
it all the nastyivision we have shown 
that exposure to uv light causes a marked depletion and change in 
the skins antioxidant defense mechanism and now we are seeking to 
learn how to prevent compromise of this important protective 
system 
work by packer and colleagues at lbl and the university of 
california berkeley has been reported in recent issues of the 
journal of investigative dermatology and in photochemistry and 
photobiology 
they tested the skin sensitivity of hairless mice to a and b 
ultraviolet light the most plentiful and damaging uv components of 
sunlight both caused significant loss in the skin of antioxidants 
which prevent initial dna damage and also may guard against later 
stages of tumor development packer said 
the idea is that topically applied antioxidants may confer 
protection by being destroyed first before dna and other 
important molecules he said 
but products of uv damage can slip into deeper layers of the 
skin and unexposed tissues particularly after chronic uv exposure 
the damage products can enter the blood affecting other parts of 
the body later he added 
the researchers want to conduct more studies on whether 
antioxidant therapy through diet could be more effective than 
treatment with a cream of some type packer said each of the 
stages in the development of skin cancer may be affected by uv 
exposure and may involve production of destructive oxygen species 
that can be counteracted by antioxidants 
our work should therefore suggest valuable and new approaches 
both to prevention of skin cancer and to protection against an 
adverse outcome once cancerous changes have begun

in the last few years americans have tried all 
sorts of new foods many of them in an effort to improve our 
health as a new decade arrives some cooks think americans eating 
habits will only get better 
ive never been more optimistic about the progress american 
food has made in the last decade said ellen brown a cookbook 
author and food consultant 
i think there will be a geometric growth in the 90s in the 
quality and the excitement of what were eating and im not just 
talking about the upper echelon of restaurants and homes but a 
general awakening of the american palate she said in a recent 
interview 
julee rosso former owner with sheila lukens of the silver 
palate gourmet shop said the wide range of ingredients now 
available in this country have led to a shift away from french 
foods and toward italian peasant cooking 
and experts who warn that nutrition and health are strongly 
linked are finally getting through rosso said 
because of all the really frightening news about what eating 
habits can do to our health certainly thats influenced all of 
us she said adding that knowledge influenced the new 
basics rossos and lukens new book which they intended as a 
book for the 1990s 
rosso noted that it includes almost 200 vegetable recipes and 
more fish recipes than in their first two books i think thats 
just a big commentary i think of my protein more as a side dish i 
really emphasize my vegetables starches and grains 
one of the premises of this book is that you can cook again in 
your own home instead of that stopstart cooking only on the 
weekends she said 
the availability of fresh fish and ingredients for ethnic dishes 
in most places in the country is remarkable brown said this 
really is a national concern about quality and i see it as going 
noplace but forward once the palate has progressed it never will 
regress 
cooking light magazine has issued a list of items it expects to 
be popular in the coming decade reflecting a shift in eating 
habits garlic grains sorbets salsas fresh fruit pies 
potatoes turkey iced coffee drinks breakfast bagels and lean 
red meat 
brown noted that even fastfood restaurants are changing adding 
salads to their menus and changing recipes for old items 
of course people still will seek treats 
moments of indulgence need to be spaced rosso said and i 
think people are learning that if you have something thats very 
good and very tasty you tend to eat less of it because you are 
more esasily satisfied 
when im in a restaurant im going to splurge but when im 
at home i want my food to be as healthy and flavorful as 
possible brown said

ina carlson still laughs at life despite two heart attacks and 
quadruple bypass surgery why not she says with a chuckle 
thats what keeps me going wouldnt it be awful if i sat back 
and cried 
no wonder shes the poster patient and spokespatient for one of 
a growing number of hospitals putting humor into health care amid 
new evidence suggesting that laughter may benefit the ill as well 
as the healthy 
laughter indeed may be like a good medicine says dr lee 
berk of the school of medicine at loma linda university in 
california 
those patients that had the will to live had a sense of humor 
and were able to use their humor in fighting their illness says 
kathy knight a nurse at university hospital in albuquerque nm 
who founded humor and hospitals are healthy allies 
hahaha the program mrs carlson represents 
i forget about myself when i can laugh with somebody or at 
somebody says mrs carlson an 80yearold widow adding that a 
good joke makes me feel better i forget that im just living on 
pills 
mrs carlson who has been in and out of university hospital in 
albuquerque nm was having a serious picture taken with three 
doctors for a medical school recruitment brochure when ms knight 
decided to have some fun she put minnie mouse ears on mrs carlson 
and goofy moose and chicken hats on the doctors today cheer 
someone up her poster says 
you cant help but look at that picture and laugh says ms 
knight 
programs like university hospitals are spreading bringing 
humor to patients on their walls and on wheels special carts 
loaded with everything from balloons to bubbles from comic books 
to comedy videos 
research findings are beginning to accumulate that suggest 
laughter might be therapeutic and could be used to reduce disease 
symptoms says lars ljungdahl of the lyckorna primary health 
care center in motala sweden 
preliminary findings in a study of six women suffering painful 
muscle and bone disorders suggested that humor therapy can increase 
quality of life and relieve some chronic symptoms says ljungdahl 
whose findings were reported in a january letter to the journal of 
the american medical association he noted that clinical evaluation 
still is lacking and further studies are needed 
a new study of 10 people who watched a humor video for two hours 
and had blood samples taken every 10 minutes found decreases in the 
hormones cortisol and epinephrine or adrenalin which are released 
during stress berk says the overall effect was a healthy drop in 
blood pressure heart rate and stress 
those hormones also can weaken the immune system and counter the 
good hormone endorphin a painkiller and mood elevator berk 
says by reducing the flow of cortisol and adrenalin laughter 
counters the weakening of the immune system and allows endorphins 
to work on pain unopposed 
joseph k neumann a psychologist with the veterans 
administrataion in johnson city tenn says more controlled 
studies are needed a lot of people who have published in this 
area have reported on case studies or studies with groups of people 
who havent had an experimental control group 
while agreeing that humor is therapeutic neumann says it may 
not be more effective than anything else that would induce a 
pleasant experience such as relaxing music he studied two groups 
of patients who underwent surgery under a local anesthetic while 
awake one group listened to a tape of an old jack benny radio show 
and the other group listened to relaxing ocean sounds basically 
there werent any consistent or significant differences 
humor is serious business to people like joyce anismansaltman 
assistant professor of special education at southern connecticut 
state university in new haven and joel goodman head of the humor 
project in saratoga springs ny 
their message on why its healthy to laugh and how to bring more 
humor into work and life is taken so seriously that theyre in big 
demand by organizations ranging from ibm to the massachusetts turf 
growers association 
major corporations are putting humor in training programs 
believing it sparks creativity when the world is closing in 
youve got to do something to change your mood so you can function 
creatively by looking at a favorite cartoon remembering some silly 
line trying to find something silly going on in daily life says 
monsanato co researcher robert z greenley in st louis 
mrs anismansaltman who gives five to 10 lectures a week 
across the country tells audiences to avoid energy suckers 
people who grab you in the hall and only have terrible things to 
tell you about that drag you down surround yourself with positive 
people 
problems can be handled when theyre in perspective she says 
a sense of humor helps you take a step back from the problem that 
looks really terrible up close when you have a little distance 
from it it looks less terrible 
i think people are really coming to their senses of humor 
says goodman who has a network of 100 people across the country 
working with the humor project people are realizing humor is not 
just kid stuff people are realizing humor can do many good things 
for us 
mrs anismansaltman a funny teacher and briefly a standup 
comic got on the lecture circuit six years ago when the local 
library in her hometown of cheshire conn was running a series on 
healing and invited her to speak 
but stark reality nudged goodman into a life of humor in 1977 
his father was stricken with a lifethreatening aneurism and facing 
surgery in houston a funny thing happened to him on his way to the 
hospital to visit his father the driver of the hotel van a man 
named alvin made him laugh easing the stress 
a couple of months later when dad was successfully recovering 
i got to thinking what a wonderful gift alvin had given us i began 
to wonder do we have to wait for the alvins of the world to cross 
our paths just when we need them by luck or should we be more 
intentional about this thing called humor 
i began to think it was too good to leave to chance so in 1977 
i started the humor project which was not designed to analyze 
humor to death but to answer my own curiousity about whether there 
ware practical ways of bringing humor to life 
in the last dozen years more than a quartermillion people have 
attended humor project programs goodman says in the past three 
years the project also has given grants to 36 hospitals and groups 
to help develop their own programs 
goodman the author of eight books tells audiences to look for 
humor in reality and in very serious places like newspapers and 
church bulletins that is where humor is most absent at first 
glance and where its most needed 
he has found a gem or two a newspaper reported vandals made 
off with all the toilet seats at the police station police have 
nothing to go on a church bulletin advised parishioners there 
will be meetings in the north and south ends of the church 
children will be baptized on both ends

paper companies intend to use more recycled 
material but they say they need the help of the collecting public 
to make sure they get a highquality supply 
state and municipal efforts to increase paper recycling are 
sometimes coming up short when they cant get rid of the waste 
paper they collect because the scrap doesnt meet standards 
officials of the american paper institute said wednesday 
group officials urged businesses and governments to make sure 
they had a purchaser lined up before beginning an extensive 
collection program and to separate grades of paper so the scrap is 
usable 
quality recycled paper will always find a market red 
cavaney president of the new yorkbased institute said in an 
interview 
the appeal came as the institute issued its 32nd annual capacity 
survey 
confirmed expansion plans should add 863 million tons of annual 
production capacity in paper and paperboard through 1992 the 
institute said 
that increase should maintain the us industrys share of world 
capacity at the 30 percent it now holds according to the survey 
the paper industry continues to make strong profits because of 
the nations continued economic expansion overseas demand and the 
increase in international trade which brings about increased need 
for packaging 
annual profits of the 27 public paper companies that the 
institute tracks are running about even with last years record 8 
billion and amount to about 7 percent of sales a historic high 
paper institute officials said 
demand for paper products closely follows the economy and 
institute officials said paper companies were braced for the 
possibility of an economic slowdown in 1990 
the institute also said waste paper is growing in importance 
both for export and domestic use in 1992 waste paper is expected 
to account for 272 percent of the materials for paper and 
paperboard production up from 254 percent this year 
the problem of inferior scrap paper is not so bad with 
newsprint where recent advances in technology have made it easier 
to produce highquality newspapers with 100 percent recycled 
fibers officials said 
the biggest limit on producing new newspapers from old ones is 
the delay in building deinking facilities and mills that can take 
advantage of the technological advances said james hutchison vice 
president of the paper group 
some newsprint collected in new mandatory recycling programs has 
had to be buried because it was unusable but cavaney said most 
of the good stuff can find a home 
besides new newspapers scrap can be made into tissue or boxes 
exported shredded for animal bedding or mulched for laying grass 
seed along the sides of highways 
a bigger problem is in recycling printing and writing paper 
because the quality of the recycled product has to be high and the 
amount of contamination is great 
contaminants include windows in envelopes the sticky material 
on the back of postable notes and paper that is printed with laser 
printers cavaney said he said the ink from laser printers cannot 
be removed with current technology so it spoils whole batches of 
recycled paper 
one of the great challenges to the industry is to help people 
understand the challenges of recycling cavaney said 
in its forecast the institute predicted 
total paper and paperboard capacity by 1992 will be 911 
million tons a year 
use of waste paper will rise to 25 million tons in 1992 if the 
industry operates at capacity that year consumption this year is 
estimated at 209 million tons 
wood pulp capacity should rise at an annual rate of 28 percent 
in the threeyear period of 199092 
capacity to produce paper and paperboard will rise at a 
slightly faster 34 percent annual rate 
paper production capacity should grow 33 percent a year during 
the threeyear period while newsprint capacity growth should 
average 51 percent annually and printing and writing paper 
capacity should grow 36 percent annually

integrated resources inc said it lost 1 
billion in the second quarter as it struggled to sell off assets 
retain its insurance brokerage sales force and avoid a bankruptcy 
court filing 
the financial services firm said wednesday the loss exceeded a 
previously anticipated 600 million decline mainly because of 
substantially lowerthanexpected proceeds from the sale of its 
core businesses 
obviously what happened to them in a major way is just 
shocking said tom fendrich a managing director for standard amp 
poors corp everybody knew that integrated was a deteriorating 
situation but nobody expected it to be an exploding one 
integrateds battered stock closed unchanged at 37 cents 
wednesday in new york stock exchange trading before announcing the 
default integrated traded at around 15 a share 
integrated on wednesday reported a loss of 104 billion or 
14115 a share on revenue of 7059 million in the apriljune 
quarter that compared with earnings of 1278 million or 68 cents 
a share in the same period a year earlier 
the once highflying real estate concern stumbled trying to 
expand into financial services integrated attributed the delay in 
reporting its secondquarter results to drastic changes since it 
defaulted on nearly 1 billion in debt in june 
integrated is seeking to restructure its debt and raise capital 
to meet payments on a total of 175 billion in debt to and avoid 
seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors 
the bulk of the secondquarter losses was pinned on writedowns 
in the value of businesses and assets integrated has sold 
discontinued or plans to sell because of its financial troubles 
a major contributor to the loss was the muchreduced sale price 
for its central financial services businesses 
integrated in november reached agreement to sell the businesses 
to broad inc a los angeles financial services concern for a 
maximum of 225 million it had hoped to receive 450 million 
that deal which is pending where two of the subsidiaries are 
based is subject to price adjustments at the time of closing that 
are expected to lower its value 
these losses reflect the serious impact of our liquidity 
problems integrated said in a statement we are attempting to 
address these problems by working with our creditors to restructure 
the debt 
for the first six months of 1989 integrated reported a loss of 
104 billion or 14193 a share on revenue of 1808 million 
compared with profits of 1986 million or 59 cents a share on 
2138 million in revenue a year earlier 
the writedowns affect the financial services subsidiaries being 
sold to broad integrated life insurance co of des moines iowa 
capitol life insurance co of denver integrated resources asset 
management corp an investment adviser integrated resources 
equity corp its main brokerdealer subsidiary and resources 
trust co 
a broad spokeswoman said the deal has been approved by iowas 
insurance commissioner but regulatory approval was pending in 
california and colorado 
integrated said 110 million of the loss resulted from 
restructuring expenses 
the firm also cited poor industry conditions for the sale of 
limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts an absence 
of revenue because of the termination or restructuring of some 
investment programs and higher interest payments because of 
increased borrowing

the head of a major aircraft builder has 
proposed that companies from the united states europe and japan 
join together to produce the next supersonic jets 
jean pierson chief executive officer of europes airbus 
industrie raised the idea for the first time wednesday in a speech 
to an airline industry group airbus based in toulouse france is 
a consortium of four aircraft companies from france britain 
west germany and spain that competes with boeing co and 
mcdonnell douglas corp of the united states 
boeing the largest commercial aircraft maker was caught by 
surprise by piersons remarks 
boeing and other companies have been studying the viability of 
highspeed transport but its too early to tell what kind of 
airplane may emerge from those studies or how it might be 
produced said richard schleh a boeing spokesman in seattle 
certainly international cooperation is one option that merits 
continued study 
officials of mcdonnell douglas werent immediately available for 
comment 
that there will be a son of concorde is beyond doubt 
pierson said referring to the supersonic passenger jets jointly 
built by france and britain when and how is another question 
because of the enormous investment required by such a project 
and the relatively small market for the aircraft the jets should 
be produced in one worldwide program pierson told the wings club 
the most brilliant engineers the superminds from the usa 
europe and japan working together as a team to produce a world 
plane a plane that will shrink our planet further is not a 
utopian dream he said 
he proposed an international consortium based in the united 
states that would bring together us european and far eastern 
companies to produce and market new highspeed jets 
however he warned such a consortium only would succeed as a 
true partnership of equals as in airbus 
if instead one of the participants were to seek supremacy 
over others or were to attempt to divide the others to rule then 
there is no doubt that europe through airbus industrie would have 
no recourse but to go its own way 
there would inevitably then be two supersonic transport 
programs competing fiercely for a limited market 
in response to a question pierson said he hasnt yet discussed 
the sst consortium idea with potential partners however he added 
i intend to be active on the subject 
airbus which has had increasing success in selling jets to big 
airlines around the world now holds an estimated 30 percent of the 
market for commercial aircraft 
the partners in airbus are aerospatiale of france british 
aerospace plc messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh of west germany and 
casa of spain

when an american airlines jumbo jet touches down today at 
spanking new fort worth alliance airport it will signal a major 
step in a unique project conceived by the son of billionaire h 
ross perot 
the project is touted as the nations first industrial airport 
and an example of how to rebuild america 
the whole point of what we have done and achieved is that 
working with the government you can build a lot of infrastructure 
programs rather quickly said h ross perot jr 
this is a great example of teamwork he said indeed the 
name comes from the alliance of perot and local state and 
federal agencies 
a lot of experts say the 90s will be the decade of rebuilding 
america and this is one way these publicprivate partnerships 
he said 
the vipfilled plane will land 18 months 19 days 23 hours 
and 25 minutes after the airports groundbreaking something of a 
record in cutting through a federal bureaucracy airport 
certification averages three to five years 
federal employees were even at work thanksgiving day installing 
equipment said jack sasser deputy regional administrator for the 
federal aviation administration 
much work still needs to be done including building a permanent 
tower to replace temporary facilities in a trailer although 
american airlines already has begun construction on its 400 
million maintenance base the plum perot landed last summer that 
gave the 250 million project credibility 
the federal drug enforcement administration plans to base a 
fleet of 90 planes at the airport sante fe railway has completed a 
car distribution facility for honda and is beginning work on a 
similar facility for ford 
although the project is ahead of schedule before the whole 
thing is really no kidding ready itll probably be two years 
perot said 
the airport on land donated by perot and owned by the city of 
fort worth was first proposed by the faa as a relief valve for 
busy dallasfort worth international airport 15 miles away 
the faa approached the perot group with the idea in 1987 because 
perot had spent millions of his fathers dollars amassing 17000 
acres to become the largest landowner in rural tarrant and denton 
counties 
the money came from the 27 billion perot received when he sold 
electronic data systems inc to general motors corp and then was 
bought out of his additional stock and kicked off the board in a 
bitter dispute with gm chairman roger smith 
instead of creating an adjunct to dfw perot jr thought bigger 
dreaming up alliance centre although the faa at first was 
reluctant to increase the scale it eventually went along 
especially after thenhouse speaker jim wright of fort worth pushed 
through a bill telling the agency the airport was a high priority 
the airport which will be managed by a perot company consists 
of a 9600foot runway and two taxiways that can handle planes up 
to the mammoth c5a cargo jet and 747s it is the largest us 
airport constructed since dfw opened 15 years ago 
alliance will be an airport surrounded by business and 
industry perot says it will allow aircraft to carry raw 
materials directly to manufacturing facilities around the airport 
these materials can be quickly integrated with onsite 
manufacturing processes before loading onto aircraft for transport 
around the world 
in addition alliance lies on a major northsouth rail line and 
perot has gotten state agreement to improve roads around the 
development to better connect with nearby interstate highways 
perot even donated 500000 to a local school district to allay 
its fears over lost tax revenue because of concessions granted 
american to lure its maintenance base 
perot admits success of the concept cant be measured for 20 to 
25 years but if it works it will be profitable 
in the meantime perot is focusing on bringing traditional 
aviationrelated clients to alliance selling them perotowned land 
by the runway or on the same 3800acre plot as the airport 
employees can live in a perotowned development nearby 150 
houses already have been built and shop at a planned shopping 
mall a development company recently purchased land to build the 
complex 
one estimate put possible revenue from land sales at 1 billion 
estimates on the cost of the property range from 100 million to 
500 million 
faa officials are now suggesting similar concepts to help 
relieve other congested airports although they admit the scale 
will be hard to duplicate because there are few areas with access 
to a perotlike war chest and willingness to wait for a payoff

advertising and marketing services giant wpp 
group plc which has taken a place among the worlds largest ad 
holding companies through recordsetting acquisitions over the past 
few years is through with major purchases for the next few years 
chief executive martin sorrell said 
but sorrell who has guided wpps transformation into one of the 
worlds largest ad conglomerates told securities analysts 
wednesday that the japanese and others may be interested in 
pursuing major advertising deals 
londonbased wpp whose sole business was once making wire 
shopping baskets has the distinction of making the two biggest 
acquisitions in advertising history plus numerous smaller buyouts 
in the past three years 
in 1987 it acquired the parent of the j walter thompson 
advertising company and the hill amp knowlton public relations firm 
for what was then an industry record 566 million 
wpp shattered the ad buyout record last sumer with an 864 
million purchase of ogilvy group parent of the ad agency ogilvy amp 
mather worldwide 
the acquisitions lifted wpps billings to about 135 billion 
placing it in a contest with saatchi amp saatchi co plc for the 
rankings of the worlds biggest advertising holding companies 
sorrell told analysts at the 17th annual painewebber media 
outlook conference that new business billings have risen by another 
12 billion in the past year that includes new assignments of 40 
million from goodyear tire amp rubber co for j walter thompson and 
40 million from olivetti for ogilvy amp mather 
asked if he had any plans for additional large acquisitions 
sorrell replied it was unlikely we will do anything of 
significant size for two or three years 
wpp has indicated in the past that it may be interested in 
making smaller acquisitions in areas such as health care database 
management and market research 
the company also recently indicated it is considering buying a 
minority stake in a television franchise in the united kingdom as a 
way of generating a profit and gaining experience in another area 
of the media business 
sorrell told the analysts he is intent on improving profit 
margins at j walter thompson where the company already is well 
ahead of the goals wpp set for it when it was acquired and at 
ogilvy 
in addition sorrell said he hoped to improve margins at hill amp 
knowlton and mrb group the market research unit 
he said that while wpp will be sitting the megadeal market out 
for the next few years there still may be largescale buyout 
activity 
sorrell noted japanese agencies may find it necessary to expand 
overseas along with their big clients who find it more difficult 
to achieve their objectives in the japanese market

scotland yard has warned banks hospitals 
universities and other institutions to be on guard against mailed 
computer disks which sabotage computers 
scotland yard said in a statement wednesday that electronic 
codes on the floppy disks labeled aids information introductory 
diskette have destroyed information in at least 10 computers 
but the london newspaper the independent today reported that 
rumors in the computer world put the figure much higher 
scotland yards fraud squad has launched an investigation after 
receiving reports of the disks from around britain 
among those reported to have received the disks are the london 
stock exchange british telecommunications plc which runs most of 
the nations telephone network the midland bank lloyds bank the 
australia and new zealand bank in london universities hospitals 
and public health laboratories 
the london newspaper the guardian reported today that the disks 
contain a trojan horse computer virus which attacks 
international business machines personal computers ibm is one of 
the worlds biggest makers of computers 
the paper said the stock exchange alone has around 2000 
personal computers of which 700 are linked into a network 
the independent said computer systems in hospitals are among 
those damaged it said the disks had also turned up in california 
belgium and zimbabwe but gave no details where 
the british domestic news agency press association quoted an 
unnamed health education authority spokesman as saying a contact in 
norway also received one 
police say a letter with the disks asks for a license fee of 
either 189 or 378 depending on the type of license to be sent 
to an address in panama 
but they say many of the disks were mailed in londons south 
kensington district 
the letter warns that if the money is not paid the sender will 
use program mechanisms to stop a computer functioning normally 
computer companies said they believed addresses for receiving 
the disks were obtained from pc business world a british weekly 
trade paper on computing 
joe hirst former technical editor of virus bulletin and a 
consultant on computer software told the associated press 
wednesday there are two programs on the disk the first is an 
installation program and the second is a questionnaire on the risk 
of aids which will not run unless it is installed on a hard disk 
it then prints off an invoice for a company in panama but the 
damage has already been done by the installation 
the alarm was first raised tuesday by dr alan solomon chairman 
of the ibm personal computer user group who said he received one 
of the disks on monday 
at the stock exchange an official speaking anonymously said 
you must be off your head if you get an unsolicited disk and put 
it in your machine 
police said pc business world sold its 700name mailing list in 
good faith to someone claiming he wanted to publicize the export of 
computers to nigeria 
the independent said the list was bought for a reported 800 
pounds or 1280 by a kenyan businessman e ketema 
the paper reported mr ketema had taken out a shortterm 
subscription with the business center in new bond street london 
to receive mail and telephone messages on his behalf while he was 
in the country from oct 31 to nov 30 he described himself as an 
accountant but the center does not know his first name nor does 
it have a forwarding address 
the paper said some computers where the disk is used could crash 
immediately while in others the damage is delayed 
the guardian said the letter with the disks says the money 
demanded should be sent to pc cyborg corporation at a box 
number in panama but the paper quoted police as saying neither the 
corporation nor the box number 871744 exists 
the paper said an american computer software company cyborg 
systems and its british subsidiary sent warnings to customers 
wednesday that it was not involved 
the guardian said ibms british office has sent one of the disks 
to its computer virus research group in the united states

the tokyo stock exchanges key index whose climb 
has been almost without pause in the last three weeks closed at 
another record high today while the dollar edged up against the 
japanese yen

points or 031 percent closing at 3818070 it closed above 
38000 for the first time on wednesday when it climbed 25889 
points to 3806242

selling shares out of concern over the speed of recent rises 
dealers said 
it took only 16 trading days for the index to gain more than 
2000 points it first climbed above 36000 on nov 21 
market players were gradually becoming cautious and reluctant 
to buy further and the number of issues purchased has declined 
said kazuhiro nomura a dealer with new japan securities co 
masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura securities co 
attributed the indexs gains to investors expectations that 
reforms in eastern europe will bring japan bigger business 
opportunities 
recent market movements have little to do with economic 
fundamentals but optimism over economic liberalization in eastern 
europe he said 
an estimated 800 million shares unchanged from the previous 
day changed hands on the first section among gainers were steel 
petroleum and railway issues 
the dollar closed at 14407 yen up 037 yen from wednesdays 
14370yen close it opened at 14413 yen and ranged between 14405 
yen and 14423 yen 
overnight gains on overseas markets led to the higher opening 
but the dollar moved narrowly after that as the market awaited the 
announcement of several us economic indicators including october 
trade figures due friday traders said 
mitsui bank trader yoshitsugu hanada said the west german mark 
which soared against other major currencies on wednesday slumped 
today as market players sold it for profittaking and position 
adjustments 
the mark weakened against the yen also as investors who had 
been selling the yen to buy the mark bought back the yen he said 
the dollaryen dealings remained inactive with only small 
position adjustments hanada said 
spot trading amounted to 346 billion down sharply from 
wednesdays 842 billion

domestic automakers may be testing market 
strength as they hold off boosting incentive packages although 
their sales continue to fall analysts say 
the eight major us automakers reported wednesday their dealers 
sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 22589 during the 
dec 110 period this year down 237 percent from a rate of 29610 
a day during the same time last year 
car sales were off 279 percent and truck sales were down 166 
percent 
a year ago we had some pretty aggressive incentives said 
analyst doug laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york no one 
is going to confirm this but i believe the industry is trying to 
gauge the actual level of demand without incentives to see what 
they can do without throwing out money needlessly 
cash rebates and lowerthanbankloan interest rates have become 
part of car buying but automakers pay for the incentives out of 
their profits which were severely dented in 1989 
chrysler corps earlydecember car sales fell by 331 percent 
ford motor cos dropped 302 percent and general motors corps 
car sales during the period were off 284 percent 
these are pretty close to what weve been getting in the last 
two selling periods laughlin said 
with just 2 weeks of selling left in 1989 the industry 
appeared to be heading for the seventhbest year on record selling 
somewhere around 148 million cars and trucks 
last years sales of 158 million was the secondbest in 
history behind the 163 million vehicles sold in 1986 sales 
totaled 155 million in 1987 
so far this year car and truck sales are running 32 percent 
behind last years pace car sales are down 43 percent and truck 
sales are off 12 percent 
chrysler said its earlydecember truck sales were down 164 
percent combining with car sales for a 251 percent decline in 
vehicle sales through dec 10 of this year chryslers cars and 
light trucks were selling at a pace 67 percent below last year 
ford said its 302 percent decline in earlydecember car sales 
and a 16 percent drop in light truck sales combined for a vehicle 
sales rate 244 percent lower than during the same period last year 
so far this year fords cars and trucks are selling at a rate 3 
percent below last years pace 
gm said its combined car and truck sales in early december were 
239 percent lower than they were during the same time last year 
as its decline in car sales combined with a 149 percent drop in 
light truck sales 
for the entire year through dec 10 gms vehicle sales are 
down 58 percent

prosecutors notched another victory in their 
assault on wall street crime when a jury convicted gaf corp and a 
top executive of stock manipulation in the governments third 
attempt after two mistrials 
the guilty verdict wednesday in manhattan federal court where 
a judge one day earlier sentenced hotel queen leona helmsley to 
four years in prison for tax evasion again demonstrated public 
opposition to whitecollar wrongdoing 
some lawyers were surprised by the verdict because of 
controversial and sometimes contradictory testimony by admitted 
felon boyd l jefferies and evidence introduced at the trials 
close undermining central portions of the governments case 
the pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that if 
there is some smoke there circumstantial evidence then juries 
tend to find there is some fire columbia university securities 
law professor john c coffee jr said 
i do think the jury particularly in wall street cases has a 
good deal of skepticism of the motives of people he said this 
is a case where there was some evidence but it was a onewitness 
case 
gaf and vice chairman james t sherwin were found guilty on all 
eight counts of stock manipulation securities fraud wire fraud 
and conspiracy two gaf subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges 
sherwin 56 of princeton nj faces up to 40 years in prison 
and 2 million in fines when sentenced march 9 by judge mary 
johnson lowe gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building 
materials manufacturer could be fined a total of up to 4 million 
justice is finally done assistant us attorney carl h 
loewenson jr said 
after the verdict an ashenfaced sherwin embraced his wife and 
daughters im terribly disappointed and im innocent of these 
charges he said to reporters 
gaf and sherwins attorney stephen kaufman said they would 
appeal the conviction the subsidiaries found innocent were jay amp 
company inc and gaf chemicals corp 
a july 1988 grand jury indictment alleged a scheme to boost the 
stock price of union carbide corp in 1986 shortly before gaf sold 
a large block of carbide shares amassed during a failed takeover 
when the case first opened a year ago it attracted wide 
attention as the first criminal trial stemming from the insider 
trading scandals of the mid1980s 
it lost some luster amid a series of glitzier cases in which 
the government won convictions in all but one case where a jury 
returned a split verdict 
among those convicted six defendants in the princetonnewport 
partners racketeering trial takeover specialist paul a bilzerian 
and drexel burnham lambert inc bond trading assistant lisa jones 
in addition the government has obtained guilty pleas from 
figures such as former investment banker martin a siegel 
arbitrager robert freeman and stock speculator salim b lewis 
its another part of the message that the us attorneys 
office has been sending to the financially fortunate of our 
country that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failure 
to pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with said attorney 
gerald walpin a former prosecutor 
the gaf jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours of 
testimony the second mistrial in march was declared after 12 
days and 93 hours of deliberations the first mistrial occurred 
because the government unintentionally withheld a key document 
maybe all the media concentration on fraud on wall street has 
pressured the public that all the fraud on wall street was more 
severe than it thought initially said alan bromberg a 
securities law professor at southern methodist university 
i think were developing a pretty healthy distrust of our 
financial institutions he said 
in the trials final days gaf lawyer arthur liman introduced 
telephone records indicating that no calls were placed on 
longdistance wats lines from the jefferies amp co brokerage to gaf 
or sherwin during times in october 1986 when the government alleged 
the manipulation was discussed 
it seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but the 
jury didnt think so said one defense lawyer in a major case who 
asked not to be named 
jefferies testified that sherwin asked him to boost union 
carbides price to 22 a share and agreed to pay 40000 to cover 
losses in the deal

workers used to getting yearend bonuses are 
increasingly hearing that unless theyve earned it the traditional 
lump sum will be replaced by the proverbial lump of coal 
compensation experts say performancebased incentives are 
replacing christmas bonuses which while technically 
discretionary are frequently perceived by employees and employers 
alike as gifts 
the christmas bonus is disappearing said compensation 
consultant paul muller because it no longer is in concert with 
business needs and practices 
bosses who substitute incentive programs for traditional holiday 
bonuses may risk being labled scrooges 
but the trend actually reflects the santa claus principle of 
rewarding good meaning productive behavior said muller 
director of midwest compensation consulting for ernst amp young a 
new yorkbased consulting firm 
in effect management now is saying to the extent that you 
help us be successful well help you be successful muller said 
wednesday 
he had no statistics to support his contention that yearend 
bonuses are disappearing but other experts agreed that a trend 
toward incentivebased compensation was apparent 
bob kurisu of strategic compensation associates in los angeles 
said christmas bonuses are kind of an anachronism and are 
rarely found in large corporations 
but at companies where yearend bonuses have been traditional 
workers often expect them and management may feel obliged to hand 
them out even if the company has not had a particularly good year 
said frank belmonte a compensation consultant with hewitt 
associates in lincolnshire ill 
when you consider eliminating it its not an easy thing to 
do he said its a very emotional issue 
therefore he said employers planning to replace the annual 
giveaway with an incentivebased program should give employees 
plenty of advance notice and spell out clearly the performance 
goals they will have to meet to qualify for incentive pay 
dont eliminate it and say nothing belmonte said 
eliminate it and do a lot of communication and explanation 
compensation experts said traditional yearend bonuses in the 
united states typically represent 5 percent to 6 percent of annual 
pay for hourly workers and 10 percent to 15 percent for middle 
managers and executives 
the move away from holiday bonuses coincides with a trend toward 
fewer employee and retiree benefits especially in the 
healthinsurance area and lower corporate profits 
but muller said the elimination of yearend bonuses is motivated 
not by costcutting but by managements desire to increase worker 
productivity 
while us employers are becoming less generous with bonuses 
their japanese counterparts are growing more so japanese companies 
ordinarily pay bonuses twice a year in summer and before the new 
year 
employees at 291 japanese companies got winter bonuses this 
month averaging 4870 up 73 percent from last year and the 
biggest increase in nine years the japanese federation of 
employers association said wednesday 
an association official in tokyo attributed the increase to 
business prosperity in japan

moodys also said chryslers share of the light truck market 
which includes the companys popular minivans and jeep vehicles

technologies corp which includes gulfstream aerospace inc will 
provide some cash verschell said but the timing of the sale and 
the amount of the proceeds were uncertain 
at fitch auto analyst mary anne sudol said her companys 
ratings for a variety of chrysler securities were either the same 
or slightly higher than moodys new ratings all chrysler ratings 
are under review she said 
there will be some action but i dont know when it will 
come sudol said 
nancy stroker of standard amp poors said her company affirmed the 
bbb rating of chrysler securities roughly the same level as 
moodys we dont expect to have any kind of rating change she 
said 
verschell said moodys wasnt reviewing the ratings of general 
motors corp or ford motor co securities 
moodys announcement of lower chryslers ratings came before the 
company reported that sales of its north americanmade cars and

ual corp plans to meet with an investment group 
which is threatening to seize control of the airline companys 
board to explore alternatives for maximizing values for all 
shareholders 
at its wednesday meeting the ual board also authorized a 
controversial 32 million to lawyers and investment bankers to 
cover incurred by a failed pilotmanagement buyout proposal of the 
parent of united airlines 
the company already had paid pilots and management 27 million 
as reimbursement for buyout expenses the payments were questioned 
last month in a hearing of the senate judiciary subcommittee on 
antitrust monopolies and business rights 
the ual board is under pressure from the investor group coniston 
partners which owns 118 percent of uals stock to sell or 
restructure the company to boost share prices 
coniston has threatened to launch a shareholder drive to dump 
most of uals directors 
after its regularly scheduled meeting at uals chicagoarea 
headquarters the board issued a statement indicating the company 
would consider takeover proposals from third parties as well as an 
employeemanagement group 
while no proposal has been received by the board continuing 
discussions are occurring with certain employee groups with respect 
to the basis and the terms of a possible buyout proposal the 
statement said 
the outside directors will consider acquisition proposals from 
the managementemployee group or any other third party when such 
proposals are made 
ual chairman stephen wolf has been under pressure to come up 
with a firm proposal for raising the companys stock price and 
staving off disgruntled investors 
ual stock closed at 16875 a share on the new york stock 
exchange down 8 from tuesday 
analysts said the drop indicated that investors did not believe 
any takeover agreement is near completion 
the conclusion from observers is that there is no deal close 
to being consummated to take the company private recapitalize or 
anything like that said stephen dexter an analyst with kemper 
financial services inc in chicago 
ual management in meetings with employee groups has circulated 
a new employee buyout plan that would value the company at 240 a 
share or 543 billion the chicago tribune reported tuesday 
quoting unidentified sources 
leaders of the flight attendants and pilots unions have said 
they would carefully review the proposal but the powerful 
machinists union which represents about 25000 of uals 70000 
workers already has criticized the plan 
opposition from the machinists helped scuttle a 675 billion 
pilotmanagement bid supported by british airways plc for united 
the nations secondlargest airline in october

the european community on thursday 
fined west german chemical producer bayer ag 590000 for violating 
competition rules in the marketing of an animal feedstuff additive 
the fine stems from bayers insistence that its west german 
customers buy the additive which boosts growth in animals only 
for themselves and use it only in the factory where the product was 
delivered the commission said in a statement 
the west german patent for the additive expired in 1985 opening 
it up to competition and lower prices the community said 
bayers requirement that its german clients buy only for 
themselves was designed to keep clients from reselling the additive 
to neighboring nations where patent protection still existed and 
where prices were higher the commission said 
its fine is worth 500000 european currency units

a twomonth 320 million drop in 
columbia savings amp loans huge junk bond portfolio has prompted 
federal authorities to restrict the thrifts highrisk deals and 
halt dividend payments 
columbia officials said the company would not oppose the 
restrictions imposed by the federal office of thrift supervision 
the company disclosed the new limits in a regulatory filing made 
public wednesday 
the restrictions on certain types of loans and socalled 
highrisk transactions such as funding leveraged buyouts 
parallel corporate adjustments underway at columbia to comply with 
recent legislation signed by president bush to end the nations 
thrift crisis 
in a nov 20 letter to columbia regulators said the thrifts 
capital is substantially inadequate to cover its junk bond 
holdings the company disclosed in the regulatory filing 
at 38 billion columbias junk bond holdings are the largest 
by far among the nations savings and loans they account for 40 
percent of the thrifts assets 
junk bonds are highyield highrisk securities prices paid for 
junk bonds have plunged in recent months amid fears of a recession 
and concerns about bonds that have been issued by troubled 
institutions 
the value of columbias junk bond portfolio declined by 220 
million in october and another 100 million in late november 
under the new federal capitalstandards restrictions signed by 
bush in august columbia and other thrifts must divest junk bond 
portfolios by july 1 1994 
on monday columbia announced that thomas spiegel would resign 
as chairman and chief executive to set up a separate entity 
expected to hold and manage the junk bonds 
columbia also agreed to seek permission from regulators before 
paying any new dividends to shareholders the thrift last paid a 
dividend on nov 28 at 7 cents a share 
columbia also needs to seek federal approval before funding any 
nonreal estate commercial loans and risky transactions including 
leveraged buyouts in which a company is bought and the debt paid 
off through cash from the sale of assets or operations 
the restrictions will remain in effect until regulators approve 
a new plan to be submitted by columbia on how it will meet the new 
federal capital guidelines

the federated and allied chains owners of 
bloomingdales and other big retailers could seek bankruptcycourt 
refuge early next year if lenders wont reschedule their 7 billion 
debt their parent company said 
in the next 30 to 60 days theres going to be a restructuring 
one way or the other one way is a voluntary restructuring the 
other would be under bankruptcy protection an official at 
campeau corps headquarters in toronto said wednesday on the 
condition on anonymity 
federated and allied both based in cincinnati said in filings 
with the securities and exchange commission that the companies 
expect to run out of cash by march possibly as early as next 
month unless creditors ease repayment terms 
federated must pay creditors 115 billion by the end of april 
allied says it faces debts of 6337 million due by the end of 
march 
federated and allied took on 8 billion in debt much of it in 
high interest junk bonds as part of their takeover by canadian 
real estate magnate robert campeau campeau bought federated in may 
1988 and allied in december 1986 
olympia and york developments ltd of canada the huge real 
estate company that owns a chunk of campeau corp promised campeau 
in september to try to secure an 800 million bridge loan to keep 
the retailers solvent 
the campeau official said that if olympia and york cant arrange 
the loan and the companies cant sell off assets fast enough to 
stay solvent bankruptcy is spelled out as a possibility given 
certain circumstances possibly as early as january 
what effect bankruptcy protection would have on shoppers is 
unclear 
in cincinnati campeau spokeswoman carol sanger said that if 
federated and allied sought chapter 11 federal bankruptcy 
protection their stores would remain open chapter 11 allows 
companies to continue operating while trying to repay creditors 
ms sanger said the debt burden is becoming increasingly 
difficult for the companies to manage 
difficulty in meeting earlier debt payments prompted the 
september restructuring that ousted robert campeau as board 
chairman when olympia and york bailed out the company 
campeau put bloomingdales its leading retailer up for sale 
after announcing the restructuring federated is negotiating with 
six bidders to sell bloomingdales to repay a 105 billion

mesa limited partnership the energy company run 
by takeover strategist t boone pickens announced today it would 
stop paying unitholders a cash distribution next year because of 
low prices for natural gas which account for 80 percent of its 
holdings 
mesa said it would pay its 375 cents distribution for the 
fourth quarter but discontinue cash distribution to the common 
units until industry conditions and cash flow improve 
the news sent mesa units tumbling in active trading on the new 
york stock exchange where prices fell 112 to 787 
the drop in natural gas prices has clearly been a problem for 
mesa as it has been for the entire industry pickens said in a 
letter to unitholders 
he said in 1985 the partnerships average gas price was 268 
per thousand cubic feet and has declined each year to an average of 
about 165 per thousand cubic feet in 1989 if prices had held at 
268 he said the partnerships cash flow would have been 400 
million greater 
pickens said the distribution policy will be reviewed quarterly 
the cut does not affect preference unitholders who will continue 
to receive 375 cents for six additional quarters 
the announcement is the second time this year mesa has cut its 
distribution in march the partnership cut its payout from 50 
cents per unit to maintain that high distribution mesa had used 
stock profits and asset sales to cover any gaps 
in an effort to reduce debt mesa also announced today the 
creation of a hugoton royalty trust made up of mesas holdings in 
the hugoton field in kansas the nations largest natural gas 
field mesa said the interest will be sold in a public offering 
next year and is expected to bring in 300 million 
i remain a believer in natural gas wrote pickens who said 
90 percent of his net worth is tied up in mesa never has more 
been written and spoken about the environmental superiority of gas 
and the competitive advantages of gas over oil 
about 80 percent of mesas reserves are natural gas we have 
placed our bet he said

teenage mutant ninja turtles eat only pizza but 
burger king corp is hoping the swashbuckling terrapins and other 
preadolescent idols will come to the rescue of the nations no 2 
fastfood chain 
with sales sluggish and market share dipping miamibased burger 
king will court youngsters with an ambitious advertising and 
promotional campaign scheduled to begin next month 
the kids club with toy giveaways and a gang of contemporary 
cartoon characters aims directly at the gradeschool market long 
dominated by rival mcdonalds corp and its orangehaired 
ambassador ronald analysts say 
the kids are a link to our future business and they heavily 
influence where a family might go to eat says burger king 
spokeswoman cori zywotow 
the first sign of kids club will appear at burger kings 5400 
us restaurants on jan 1 with special meals that include toy cars 
shaped like french fries and other fastfood mainstays future 
prizes include teenage mutant ninja turtle badges and figures from 
the beetlejuice cartoon series 
applications also will be available for kids club membership 
which includes stickers other goodies and a subscription to a 
newsletter published five times a year 
but the centerpiece of the 18monthold project is the seven 
kids club characters a sortof ultrahip our gang with an 
absentminded computer genius a voracious food expert and 
spankys leading role taken over by kid zid who moves between the 
real world and a hightechnology realm of video and electronics 
other characters include a girl obsessed with photography a 
cheerful lad in a turbocharged wheelchair and a tomboy who speaks 
in sports cliches their mascot a stray dog 
most kids will be able to identify with at least one of the 
kids club members said ms zywotow kids today are 
sophisticated beyond our imagines you need to speak their 
language 
right now burger king executives are speaking about widespread 
changes following a 3 percent rise in sales since londonbased 
grand metropolitan plc acquired the company and its parent 
pillsbury co in january 
plans include revamping and expanding burger kings menu and 
upgrading service and conditions at franchiseowned outlets which 
comprise about 85 percent of the 5900 burger kings worldwide 
problems in food quality and restaurant atmosphere have been 
cited as contributing to burger kings slide from 175 percent of 
the 61 billion fast food market in 1987 to 168 percent last year 
burger kings 54 billion in sales last year compares with more 
than 17 billion at oak brook illbased mcdonalds which 
operates about 10500 restaurants no 3 hardees posted sales of 
about 3 billion in 1988 
burger king has average store sales of about 1 million 
mcdonalds outlets average about 16 million and hardees 
restaurants sell about 920000 apiece annually 
the kids club will debut just 12 weeks after burger king 
unveiled a nationwide advertising campaign focusing on adults and 
teens the kids club commercials mostly will air saturday morning 
where the line between entertainment and advertising often is hazy 
children control an incredible amount of money by influencing 
where adults shop and eat and this is particularly true with 
fastfood restaurants said peggy charren president of action 
for childrens television in cambridge mass 
for burger king to move back to this type of approach sends 
the message that influencing children through advertising must work 
quite well said ms charren sponsor of a senate bill to limit 
commercial time on saturday morning childrens programs 
but its uncertain how successful burger king will be against 
mcdonalds which has ruled the childrens fastfood market through 
saturday morning commercials and tieins between its happy meals 
and such popular movies as walt disney cos the little mermaid 
mcdonalds has been very successful at the childrens 
market said laurie lively an analyst at oppenheimer amp co inc 
in new york theyve been doing it well for a long time 
daniel lee an analyst at drexel burnham lambert in new york 
said some studies indicate ronald mcdonald is the second most 
recognizable figure for preschool children behind santa claus 
try putting a couple of kids in a car and driving past a 
mcdonalds said lee its hard thats something mcdonalds 
has been working on for years and years and years

troubled defense contractor northrop corp 
maker of the b2 stealth bomber plans to sell its tony 
headquarters complex in century city to raise cash company 
officials say 
in order to reduce our debt were actively looking at the 
sale of our nonoperating assets spokesman tony cantafio was 
quoted as telling copley los angeles newspapers in a story 
published today 
northrop is not the first aerospace company to try to cash in on 
real estate recently as prospects for defense work have dimmed 
last month f14 maker grumman corp said it would redevelop nearly 
half its 500acre long island headquarters with a hotel shopping 
center and offices 
northrop sent information packages to 10 prospective buyers on 
its two century park east buildings about a month ago asking 
2475 million for them said mike desantis a vice president of 
the cushman amp wakefield real estate brokerage 
de santis said that price represents the same cost per square 
foot that was paid last year for the nearby fox plaza where former 
president ronald reagan billionaire investor marvin davis and 
20th century fox have their offices 
potential buyers were not disclosed 
northrops stock has traded as high as 3575 during the past 
year but closed wednesday at less than half that level 1750 per 
share 
it was up 1 in early trading today on a los angeles times 
report that defense secretary dick cheney had decided to build all 
132 of the b2 stealth bombers a program that accounts for half 
northrops sales 
at 1850 per share northrops 47 million shares of common 
stock would be worth about 870 million far less than the 
companys 12 billion debt 
the 870 million is also less than than the value of the 
companys real estate holdings according to aerospace analyst 
lawrence harris at the bateman eichler hill richards brokerage in 
los angeles 
northrop chairman thomas jones told shareholders at the annual 
meeting in may the company might sell properties no longer useful 
in our plans 
northrop owns manufacturing plants in southern california 
illinois massachusetts and oklahoma but those properties are not 
for sale

the united states has increased protection to some 
domestic industries and added import restraints while pressing for 
eased barriers abroad the group that sponsors world trade talks 
said thursday 
a report by the secretariat of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade said even though the united states has low tariffs and 
trade impediments in most sectors large trade and current account 
deficits had increased pressure for more restrictions against 
imports 
the report reflected the concerns of many countries over the 
apparent us trend towards bypassing internationally agreed gatt 
procedures and resorting to arbitrary measures to promote its trade 
interests 
the gatt secretariat report formed part of the first evaluation 
of us policy to be carried out under a new trade policy review 
mechanism agreed by ministers in montreal last december 
in a separate report submitted to the gatt council in geneva as 
part of the same evaluation the us government said its trade 
policy was aimed at reducing trade distortions and barriers both 
in the united states and abroad to allow market forces to operate 
and boost trade expansion 
we are totally committed to an open and fair trade 
policy rufus yerxa us ambassador to gatt told the council 
meeting 
those who believe the united states can solve its trade or 
economic problems by erecting high trade barriers are living in 
the age of the dinosaur he said 
yerxa said he regarded the gatt secretariat report as 
generally fair commenting that such an evaluation of trade 
policy was bound to be critical in parts 
a text of his speech was made available to journalists 
a trade source who attended the closed council session said the 
meeting was balanced between criticism and praise for us trade 
policy 
some delegates told the meeting they recognized the us economy 
was open and that it was the largest market for exports from many 
areas including developing countries the source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
other participants commended the few import restrictions and 
subsidies outside agriculture he added 
the gatt report said that the high us trade deficits had 
increased popular domestic pressure for increased protection 
it welcomed attempts by washington to resist calls for greater 
import restrictions citing the refusal of the reagan 
administration in 1984 to grant import relief to the copper 
industry and a similar refusal a year later to the footwear 
industry 
however the number of sectors receiving protection and the 
number of restrictive agreements had increased over the years the 
report said listing examples including machine tools and 
semiconductors 
other sectors of the economy such as dairy sugar textiles and 
clothing historically have received relatively high levels of 
protection the secretariat said and little has been done to 
reduce the restraints 
the 97 members of gatt account for more than four fifths of 
world trade

low natural gas prices have forced mesa limited 
partnership to scrap cash distributions and sell assets to reduce 
debt the energy company run by takeover strategist t boone 
pickens announced thursday 
pickens said stopping the cash distribution akin to a dividend 
payment to shareholders in a corporation was necessary to maintain 
mesas financial integrity while gas prices remain low 
besides cutting out its 375cent per unit quarterly 
distribution mesa said it will package its holdings in the hugoton 
natural gas field into a separate royalty trust and sell shares to 
raise 300 million to pay down its 15 billion in longterm debt 
much of it left over from last years 715 million purchase of 
natural gas properties from tenneco inc 
the news sent mesa units tumbling in active trading on the new 
york stock exchange where prices had fallen 137 to 762 by 
midafternoon 
until earlier this year mesa had paid out 2 a year to each 
unitholder even though revenue from its holdings fell far short of 
justifying the payout the difference had been made up from 
pickens stock plays involving such companies as gulf oil corp 
phillips petroleum co and unocal 
pickens defended the practice thursday calling it a way of 
prepaying unitholders profits from high gas prices in the 
future 
mesa still has about 400 million worth of cash and marketable 
securities said bill ballew a mesa financial official 
in march mesa announced a cut in third and fourth quarter 
payments to 375 cents and analysts had been expecting a further 
reduction although some were surprised the distribution was 
eliminated 
charles strain an analyst with lovett underwood newhouse and 
webb inc in houston said mesa could only justify a payout of 30 
cents a year based on current gas prices so this makes sense 
the drop in natural gas prices has clearly been a problem for 
mesa as it has been for the entire industry pickens said in a 
letter to unitholders 
in 1985 our average gas price was 268 per thousand cubic 
feet it has declined each year to an average of about 165 
thousand cubic feet in 1989 if prices had held at 268 per 
thousand cubic feet during the four years 19861089 our cash flow 
would have been 400 million greater 
the current december price is about 185 it is expected to 
rise above 2 in january 
the price should rise to about 250 per thousand cubic feet if 
oil remains in the 20abarrel range strain said 
at that level he said mesa would be profitable 
we didnt make any money this year but there is a good 
possibility that were going to make money in the mid to late 
90s ballew said 
most observers expect the price of natural gas to continue 
rising as demand catches up to supply the fuel frequently is 
touted as a domestically available safe clean replacement for 
gasoline 
mesa said the 375 cent distribution would be paid for the 
fourth quarter giving unitholders 175 per unit this year but it 
will discontinue cash distribution to the common units until 
industry conditions and cash flow improve 
pickens who owns 43 million common units said the 
distribution policy will be reviewed quarterly the cut does not 
affect preference unitholders who will continue to receive 375 
cents for six additional quarters 
to immediately raise money mesa said it would create the 
hugoton royalty trust from its holdings in the hugoton field in 
kansas the nations largest natural gas field mesa said shares in 
the trust will be sold in a public offering next year and are 
expected to bring in 300 million 
twice in the past mesa has packaged holdings into trusts 
shares of which were distributed to unitholders this time 
however we needed the money ballew said 
pickens said the company would remain a limited partnership 
because under that structure it doesnt pay pay federal income 
taxes 
i remain a believer in natural gas wrote pickens about 
80 percent of mesas reserves are natural gas we have placed our 
bet

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade paced by modest 
gains in the soybean market amid concerns about newcrop supplies 
the newcrop soybean contracts those for delivery next fall 
gained the most as they have for most of this week 
traders are speculating that us farmers will plant fewer 
soybeans in 1990 than this year and devote more acreage to corn 
wheat and cotton to take advantage of governmentguaranteed prices 
for those crops in the last year of the current farm bill said ann 
frick senior soybean analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
new crop soybeans also were supported by increasing fears of a 
drought in the prime soybeangrowing region of brazil 
buying of corn wheat and oldcrop soybean futures was linked in 
part to ideas that bitter cold in the eastern united states would 
lead to increased domestic livestock feeding 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 416 a bushel corn 
futures were cent lower to 1 cents higher with december at 235 
a bushel oats were unchanged to cent higher with december at 
143 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 4 cents higher with 
january at 582 a bushel

since march 1976 was the result of imports growing much faster than 
exports as the highflying canadian dollar makes canadian goods 
more expensive on foreign markets 
in recent weeks the canadian dollar has risen to nineyear 
highs of more than 86 us cents as the bank of canada keeps 
interest rates higher than rates in the united states to fight 
inflation 
john crow governor of the bank of canada is expected to stick 
with his policy of using high interest rates to slow the economy 
and keep a lid on consumer prices and wage demands

the dollar finished mixed thursday in dull 
trading on world currency markets 
gold prices slipped overseas but appeared to stabilize in us 
dealings after wednesdays steep plunge 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 40830 a troy ounce up 20 cents from late 
wednesday republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for 
gold at 40830 an ounce up 30 cents 
traders said the market was extremely quiet everybody is on 
the sidelines said stephen flanagan a vice president at 
manufacturers hanover trust co 
dealers and investors are awaiting fridays release of key us 
economic data the government is scheduled to report merchandise 
trade figures for october and producer prices and industrial 
production data for november 
the figures will offer a lot to react to said marc 
chandler an analyst with chicagobased money market services 
international but he noted that we dont have full liquidity in 
the market its sort of the holiday thinness 
dealers have been expecting octobers trade deficit to register 
somewhere between 9 billion and 10 billion but the canadian 
governments report thursday showing the nations first monthly 
trade deficit in 13 years was cause for some speculation that the 
us deficit may have benefitted 
canada imported 421 million canadian dollars more goods than it 
sold abroad in october compared with a revised surplus of 134 
million in september statistics canada reported 
a lot of people track the two against each other since canada 
is our largest trading partner flanagan said 
but others suggested canadas weak showing may reflect a 
slowdown in the us economy chandler said that since canadas 
major exports to the united states are autos and auto parts a 
decline in us auto buying may have contributed to canadas 
shortfall

going to a shopping mall to buy a robot 
may sound like a futuristic fantasy but jean du teau is gambling 
in the present on science fiction becoming fact 
du teau owns robot world a retail robot store tucked into a 
rochester shopping center next to a maternity boutique and an 
opticians shop 
visitors are greeted at the door by rb5x a small gray figure 
with a shiny domed head who chirps hello stranger 
du teau franceborn president of rochester robotics inc 
opened robot world in june to meet what he sees as a need for 
robots for the general public 
while rochester robotics makes robots for nuclear power plant 
inspection and modifies service robots for business use robot 
world sells mostly educational and hobby models to schools and 
computer enthusiasts but du teau says it wont be long before most 
of his sales are to people buying personal robots for their homes 
robots are today where computers were 10 years ago he said 
most people perceive that the robotic age is going to happen in 
the year 2000 the robotic age is here 
the stores products range from roboduck a 29 beginners robot 
for children to rb5x which costs 2700 and is robot worlds 
biggest seller to schools 
cost is the main thing standing between most americans and their 
own personal robots du teau said he expects prices to begin 
dropping as the number of new products grows that he said is 
happening already 
not everyone in the robot business is quite as optimistic 
household robots are coming other experts say but they dont all 
agree on when 
were still quite a ways from a robot in every house said 
jeff burnstein managing director of national service robot 
association an industry group based in ann arbor mich 
burnstein said robot technology is still developing there just 
arent many home robots ready to be marketed that can do anything 
useful he said 
people think that theres a market out there for home robots 
but there just arent products 
dozens maybe hundreds of researchers are working on robots 
burnstein said he believes the main obstacle to getting them on 
the market is the lack of a major backer for robot products 
burnstein thinks the robot revolution will happen sometime in 
the next decade 
i dont think were talking about 30 to 50 years away he 
said its just a matter of when theres going to be a big 
breakthrough 
dana ballard a computer science professor and robotics 
researcher at the university of rochester sees the breakthrough as 
still further off perhaps 20 to 50 years away 
recent advances in technology have sped up robotics research 
ballard said many problems need to be solved before home robots 
can be made viable 
i dont think these things are going to be translated into 
marketable items in the near future he said putting the whole 
thing together is going to take a while 
like du teau and burnstein however ballard believes that there 
will someday be a robot in every house 
i think therell be a whole spectrum of machines that have 
various sorts of motor capabilities he said its hard to 
envision the form of these things because they havent been thought 
of yet 
home robots are unlikely to be allpurpose humanlike creatures 
such as the lovable r2d2 character in star wars a simple for 
humans task like getting a drink out of the refrigerator involves 
a whole series of extremely complicated procedures for a robot du 
teau said 
to have a robot that does everything were a long way from 
that he said if we had a robot that would clean house we 
could retire by now 
more likely are robots that perform specific functions such as 
dishwashing pool cleaning or security 
security robots that roam the house detect any usual movement 
or sounds and call the police will be among the first home robots 
on the market in the next few months du teau said 
other robots that du teau says will be in the store by january 
include the lawn rangera computerized selfpropelled lawn 
mower and newton a robot that can do multiple duty as a security 
guard answering machine alarm clock and language teacher for 
children 
its somewhat of a gimmick but its a nice gimmick because it 
has purpose du teau said 
purpose is what separates the new breed of robots from the smart 
but generally useless robots that made a brief foray onto the 
market in the early 1980s burnstein said 
at least six home robot products that will be on the market in 
the next few months with more to follow next summer du teau said 
and while other entrepreneurs scramble to get in on the boom hes 
sure is coming du teau is already there and already planning 
more branches 
to me the most important thing is were the first he said 
we are pioneers

japanese automakers who built us assembly 
plants at near breakneck speed in the mid and late1980s are 
realizing the benefits of assembling cars on the other side of the 
pacific 
since late 1985 only the japanese and ford motor co have 
increased their shares of the us car market 
general motors corp chrysler corp and european automakers 
lost a share of the market which itself decreased by 101 percent 
to about 92 million cars on nov 30 
i think their market share will continue to erode over the 
next decade said auto analyst mary oneill of duff amp phelps inc 
in chicago nonus producers have about 30 percent market share 
it could go up to 40 percent in the next five years in 
addition the japanese imports havent fallen as much as people 
have expected 
at the end of november 1985 gm commanded 427 percent of the 
us car market a level that fell to 35 percent at the end of last 
month chrysler had 113 percent back then and 104 percent at the 
end of last month 
ford boosted its share to 223 percent from 189 percent and 
vehicles built by japanese companies cornered 258 percent of the 
market last month compared with 213 percent four years earlier 
the socalled transplants lifted the japanese automakers 
shares without them market share for the japanese companies fell 
to 181 percent last month from 197 percent in 1985 
the japanese transplants rise to 77 percent of the market last 
month from 17 percent four years ago prompted united auto workers 
union president owen bieber to renew a call for export restraints 
from the government in tokyo 
in a letter this week to trade minister hikaru matsunaga the 
leader of the 1millionmember uaw urged the japanese government to 
slash vehicle exports to 15 million units in 1990 from the current 
23 million 
bieber said such a reduction would demonstrate the government 
of japans commitment to reducing the bilateral trade imbalance and 
to replacing high levels of auto imports into the us with 
vehicles produced here 
the current export levels under the japanese voluntary restraint 
agreement come up for annual review next march 
spokesmen for toyota nissan honda and mazda each of whom have 
assembly plants in the united states said thursday it was too 
early to tell for sure if they would meet restraint levels this 
year 
however officials for toyota nissan and mazda said it was 
unlikely that the quotas would be met 
the main reason for that is production at their us plants 
back in 1985 the only japanese companies with us factories 
were honda with a plant in marysville ohio and nissan with a 
plant in smyrna tenn since then honda has added a plant in east 
liberty ohio and nissan announced an expansion of the smyrna 
plant that will boost production to about 440000 vehicles a year 
by 1992 
meantime toyota set up its own plant in georgetown ky mazda 
established a plant in flat rock mich toyota and gm are in a 
joint venture in fremont calif mitsubishi and chrysler are 
making cars in normal ill and two japanese automakers subaru 
and isuzu are making vehicles in lafayette ind

prices for nearterm deliveries of hogs surged more than a penny 
per pound thursday on the chicago mercantile exchange as frigid 
weather in the midwest slowed marketings and reduced slaughter 
rates 
the cold spell which is expected to continue through the 
weekend also contributed to gains in the cattle and grain futures 
markets 
on other commodity markets oil futures retreated and precious 
metals were mostly higher 
hog futures settled 08 cents to 105 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december up 105 cents at 5275 cents a 
pound 
live cattle futures were 15 cent to 60 cent higher with 
december at 7740 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 43 
cent higher with january at 8372 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 110 cents to 160 cent lower with february at 5032 
cents a pound 
the gains in hog futures extended a threemonth advance from 
prices near 40 cents a pound in midseptember 
cold weather typically supports the hog market for two reasons 
animals tend to burn energy rapidly in cold weather causing weight 
loss when they are moved around and farmers like everyone else 
tend to stay indoors in cold weather 
people dont want to go out and sort their pens its too cold 
to go out period said dale durchholz a livestock analyst with 
agrivisor services inc a market advisory service in bloomington 
ill 
before the cold snap set in this week hog prices were boosted 
by a seasonal surge in wholesale demand for hams pork bellies 
provided support before that amid speculation that eastern europe 
would become a major market for us pork bellies 
a series of shortterm factors continue to come along and push 
it durchholz said but if we see the weather moderate on us 
well probably see a pretty sharp break in the hog market 
pork bellies fell sharply on profittaking giving up nearly all 
of wednesdays gains 
most grain and soybean futures rose on the chicago board of 
trade paced by modest gains in the soybean market amid concerns 
about newcrop supplies 
buying of corn wheat and oldcrop soybean futures was linked in 
part to ideas that bitter cold in the eastern united states would 
lead to increased domestic livestock feeding 
the newcrop soybean contracts those for delivery next fall 
posted the strongest gains as they have for most of this week 
traders are speculating that us farmers will plant fewer 
soybeans in 1990 than this year and devote more acreage to corn 
wheat and cotton to take advantage of governmentguaranteed prices 
for those crops 
wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with december at 
416 a bushel corn futures were cent lower to 2 cents higher 
with december at 235 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent 
higher with december at 143 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 
3 cents higher with january at 582 a bushel 
heating oil futures fell on the new york mercantile exchange 
ending an 11day upswing 
the selloff largely reflected profittaking and analysts said 
the bullish factors cold weather and shipping problems in europe 
remained in place 
i think any setbacks are temporary said william hinton a 
broker with stotler amp co in new york 
heating oil futures settled 45 cent to 84 cent lower with 
january at 6728 cents a gallon west texas intermediate crude oil 
was 5 cents to 12 cents lower with january at 2065 a barrel 
unleaded gasoline was 11 cent to 35 cent lower with january at 
5161 cents a gallon 
gold futures were little changed while silver advanced slightly 
on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 10 cents lower to 20 cents higher with december at 
40830 a troy ounce silver was 04 cent to 13 cents higher with 
december at 5557 a troy ounce 
platinum settled 640 to 660 higher on the new york merc with 
january at 51130 a troy ounce analysts attributed the rally to 
technical market factors

the central bank on thursday 
ordered banks and foreign exchange houses closed friday in an 
emergency holiday evidently aimed at slowing an alarming loss of 
confidence in the austral currency 
the central bank gave no reason for the second bank holiday this 
week except to say it was ordered by the economy ministry the 
move was disclosed in a twoparagraph story on the state news 
agency telam late thursday night 
but the holiday follows the plunge of the austral against the 
us dollar since a 345 percent devaluation last sunday as part of 
an austerity program that included massive hikes in public service 
rates export taxes and the suspension of repayment of some 
government debts banks and foreign exchange houses were ordered 
closed thispast monday because of the devaluation 
monthly interest rates soared thursday to 43 percent for large 
depositors up from about 30 percent the day before and 17 percent 
last week 
i know i have lost some credibility but i will remain in the 
economy ministry until the president decides otherwise said 
embattled economy minister nestor rapanelli 
earlier in the day president carlos menem acknowledged there 
may be a political price to pay for the economic disorder and the 
unpopular austerity measures he implemented this week 
there is flinching and protests when you put in the scalpel to 
draw out puss from a wound and it hurts menem said in an 
interview with radio argentina there is no other way out of this 
situation without some political cost 
a recent survey by radio de plata indicated menems popularity 
has waned since he took office last july unions are threatening to 
strike for wage hikes and businesses have ignored government pleas 
to hold down prices 
newspapers in the capital have speculated for days that 
rapanelli will be forced out menem however insisted that his 
economics minister enjoys his absolute confidence 
menem also said the controversial program of privatizations and 
deregulation will proceed and the 345 percent devaluation and 60 
percent and higher hikes in public service rates were unavoidable 
argentines who wanted to buy dollars paid 1560 australs apiece 
at the close of the business day or 147 percent more than on 
wednesday and 56 percent more than the official rate set last 
sunday of 10001 
there is a lack of confidence in the economic plan said 
ramiro taboada a manager at the bank of buen ayre 
also banks and other large investors were buying dollars and 
forcing down the austral as a a kind of vengeance against the 
government for suspending for two years the repayment of principal 
on dollardenominated internal bonds toboada said 
alfredo piano head of the large foreign exchange company that 
bears his name said small investors were simply trying to protect 
their money against inflation people are fleeing the austral and 
taking refuge in something they consider more solid he said

pinnacle west capital corp ended weeks of 
speculation thursday by announcing it had turned down an 
opportunistic attempt by an oregonbased holding company to buy 
arizonas largest corporation 
pacificorp on dec 1 proposed swapping stock to acquire pinnacle 
west in a deal valued at about 187 billion the bid which was 
conditioned upon pinnacle wests disposing of ailing subsidiary 
merabank was an expansion of a nov 8 bid by pacificorp to buy 
arizona public service co for 17 billion aps is a whollyowned 
subsidiary of pinnacle west and is arizonas largest utility 
the board unanimously determined that pacificorps proposal is 
inadequate and not in the best interests of pinnacle west and its 
shareholders pinnacle west chairman keith turley said in a 
letter to pacificorp president am gleason 
turleys letter continued in reaching these conclusions the 
board has carefully considered the business financial condition 
and future prospects of pinnacle west and its subsidiaries 
including arizona public service co and merabank 
mike nelson director of financial planning and investor 
services for pacificorp said in portland ore that pacificorp 
executives were disappointed by the rejection 
i think theyre just reacting to the increase in their stock 
price this week and last week and at this point theyre not 
willing to sit down and talk to us he said of pinnacle west 
pinnacle wests stock nearly doubled dec 7 jumping 4 to 10 
after the company announced a settlement with federal thrift 
regulators concerning merabank the settlement required pinnacle 
west to infuse merabank with 450 million 
nelson said turleys letter was the first reaction pacificorp 
had received to either of its offers 
in contrast to the silence with which hed met the much 
publicized offer turley commented thursday on the portlandbased 
holding companys bid calling it an opportunistic attempt by 
pacificorp to enhance value for its shareholders at the expense of 
our shareholders 
he said pinnacle wests board of directors firmly believes 
that the best course for pinnacle west and its shareholders is to 
continue our program to resolve the merabank issues and build value 
for shareholders as an independent company 
the pinnacle west board acted on the opinion of advisers first 
boston corp and salomon brothers inc that the proposal was 
inadequate from a financial point of view turley said 
pinnacle west had hired the two investment banking companies to 
study the bid 
turley concluded the letter by informing gleason that no 
purpose would be served by future talks between the two companies 
pacificorps nelson declined to speculate whether pinnacle west 
was implying pacificorp should sweeten its proposal 
i dont know if theres anything between the lines in his 
letter in terms of other messages he said 
as for pacificorps next move he said were evaluating that 
right now we dont have any comments on what our plans are as of 
yet 
the rejection was not unexpected because at this point the 
offer isnt good enough given pinnacle wests stock price said 
marcia weeks a member of the arizona corporation commission which 
regulates aps 
the commission has scheduled a monday hearing on the aps 
dividend matter 
a high priority at that hearing will be pinnacle wests deal 
with federal thrift regulators to infuse merabank with 300 million 
in cash within four months pinnacle west also has promised a note 
for 150 million spread out over the next 12 years pinnacle west 
borrowed the cash from four new york firms using aps stock as 
collateral

fluorocarbon co wrongly maligned as an 
environmental menace has picked a new name that doesnt sound like 
chlorofluorocarbons the atmospherezapping gases 
the company which makes plastic seals gaskets bearings and 
the like for everything from washing machines to planes will be 
reborn jan 1 as furon co chairman peter churm said thursday 
churm launched a namechange contest that captured national 
attention last summer because people mistakenly thought his 
products wrecked the ozone layer which screens cancercausing rays 
lynette squeaky fromme the charles manson follower who tried 
to kill president ford had churm on a hit list brokers had 
problems selling the stock of the laguna niguelbased company 
more than 10000 healthysounding entries poured in including 
not chlorofluorocarbon inc fiberfab seals r us fluoraluralura 
the churminators inc laguna buna notox proozone inc and oat 
bran co 
but a committee headed by churm finally decided on furon a 
name of their own devising 
what we didnt realize until we got into it were the number of 
names we could not use churm said in a telephone interview 
wed get down to three finalists submit them to patent 
attorneys and find out they were already taken 
for example we got about 250 entries for fluorotech spelled 
different ways just to see what would happen we had it checked 
and found out there were already seven companies using variations 
on it 
a favorite name among the fluorocarbon brass was fluoron which 
was submitted by eight people including one shareholder and one 
employee churm said 
but it was pretty close to fluorine gas which might be pretty 
bad and there were already two people using fluoron he said 
then we decided that furon sounded close 
the more they considered furon the more they liked it 
theres something different about it and it sort of rolls off 
your tongue churm said the acid test was how it sounds with 
the telephone operator and it turns out it sounds good 
each of the eight winners will get 100 shares of fluorocarbon 
make that furon stock which was trading at 1312 per share 
thursday 
churm was asked if furon didnt sound as though the company was 
well angry 
nah he said im never furious about anything 
the winners of the contest are charles alexandre of bristol
