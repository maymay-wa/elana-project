jurors were starstruck when they awarded 
comedian rodney dangerfield 500000 in damages for an eye injury 
he suffered at caesars palace attorneys for the las vegas resort 
contend 
the hotel filed a motion in federal court thursday asking for a 
new trial saying dangerfield was awarded excessive compensation 
for a minor injury 
the jury was obviously too taken with their proximity to fame 
to be rational to analyze the evidence the motion said the 
jury utterly disregarded the fact that there was no objective 
evidence of any continuing injury no medical expenses past or 
present no sign of any permanent injury 
in awarding dangerfield 500000 last month the jury found that 
the hotel was responsible for a march 1988 steam bath accident that 
the comedian said burned his eyes

democrats are unsure whether they can force 
president bush to accept higher tax rates on the richest americans 
but gasoline levies seem certain to rise as lawmakers fashion a 
compromise budget 
for democrats the start of housesenate bargaining friday over 
the final shape of a 250 billion deficitreduction bill meant a 
chance to foist more of its burden onto the wealthy for 
republicans the goal was to prevent higher incometax rates and 
ensure cuts in spending 
bush has threatened repeatedly to veto democratic attempts to 
boost the 28 percent tax rate the richest americans pay to 33 
percent he visited capitol hill friday and urged congressional 
leaders to send him a compromise quickly 
i dont know why we have to go through a process of producing 
a bill that will not be signed said sen pete domenici of new 
mexico ranking republican on the budget committee 
democrats said it was only fair to spread the pain of 
deficitreduction according to taxpayers ability to pay but they 
seemed willing to compromise 
i hope its possible to assemble a revenue package that gives 
a just share of that burden to the wealthiest among us but does so 
without violating the presidents principles said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
the approach of election day barely two weeks off was 
clearly raising pressure on the lawmakers to come up with a 
compromise 
but another source of strain was eased when bush signed an 
emergency bill keeping the government in business through 
wednesday the president had earlier threatened to shut the 
government down this morning when its financing would have 
expired unless congress budget work was finished 
with that distraction aside lawmakers began seeking middle 
ground between the senates moderate budget and the more liberal 
version the house adopted earlier last week 
this is going to have to be carefully drawn said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan 
their daunting job was symbolized by the legislation itself a 
halffoot stack of paper weighing 13 pounds 
republicans rallied around the senate plan which doubles the 
9centpergallon gasoline tax limits deductions for people 
earning more than 100000 annually and boosts outofpocket costs 
for medicare recipients 
this is a balanced bill said domenici it is 
progressive 
but house speaker thomas foley said democrats wanted the senate 
to moderate its gasoline tax increase and its steeper increases in 
outofpocket medicare costs for beneficiaries 
he also noted that democrats remain behind the house bills 
higher taxes on the rich besides the higher incometax rate for 
wealthy americans it puts a 10 percent surtax on people earning 1 
million annually 
obviously compromises are required foley a washington 
democrat told reporters the insistence of the president on 
having no income tax changes affecting the rich seems to be 
inexplicable and inflexible 
republicans strongly oppose a house provision that would in 
effect cause slight incometax increases on most americans it 
would delay for one year the inflation adjustment made in tax 
brackets and the personal exemption 
democrats have said that provision is likely to be altered or 
eliminated 
both the house and senate bills would increase taxes on tobacco 
alcohol airline tickets and luxury items such as private planes 
both would enlarge tax credits for lowincome people 
the legislation is the keystone of a plan aimed at cutting the 
deficit by 500 billion over the next five years the rest of the 
savings would arise by slashing the pentagon budget and from 
lowerthananticipated interest payments on the national debt

the consumer organization public citizen says 
it made an error in placing the itt hartford insurance group on a 
list of companies it said were in danger of insolvency in a 
recession 
the hartford should not have been included among the companies 
most financially vulnerable in a severe economic downturn public 
citizen president joan claybrook said friday 
we regret this error and will take steps to correct it she 
said in a letter to hartford chairman donald r frahm 
public citizen did say it remains convinced that property and 
casualty insurance companies need to improve their business 
practices 
public ciizen said in a report issued monday the hartford and 
four other companies failed four of six tests measuring how 
vulnerable their were to insolvency 
the original report said the hartfords surplus funds declined 
33 percent from 1972 to 1988 the surplus actually grew 6 percent 
she said 
the error was discovered by itt hartford and confirmed by its 
independent auditors arthur andersen amp co 
in preparing its report public citizen relied on financial data 
in an industry publication 
jim westervelt vice president and group comptroller for the 
hartford said the 1972 figure appearing in the publication 
represented the surpluses of all of the hartford companies 
the 1988 figure represented only the consolidated surpluses of 
hartford fire insurance company and its property and casualty 
subsidiaries he said 
in baltimore another company that appeared on the list united 
states fidelity amp guaranty issued a statement calling public 
citizens report misdirected and shallow 
the company said the report misapplied critical financial data 
relating to usfampg and overlooked other financial information 
usfampgs own analysis contradicts public citizens conclusions 
and establishes that usfampg falls safely within the group of other 
financially strong insurers analyzed in the report who were not 
singled out it said

from the arkansas national guard and used it to mail 10000 
letters 
the guard has launched an inquiry into the matter which 
involves a colonel 
maj gen james a ryan the guards adjutant general said the 
release violated federal privacy laws 
nelson said the guard inquiry was motivated by politics his 
opponent gov bill clinton appointed ryan nelson also has 
questioned the credibility of the inquiry because the guard never 
called him or his office about the labels 
let me say on the record this was not leaked this was not a 
devious act nelson spokesman john hudgens said friday we 
assumed if the guy had the list anybody could get it all you had 
to do was ask for it 
shefields mailing sought support of arkansas guardsmen the 
envelopes were addressed with computergenerated labels that 
included the names addresses and unit identification codes of

quiet about his past drug use

regarding rohrabachers alleged drug use which purportedly 
occurred during a time when he backed the legalization of drugs and 
espoused anarchy

a senate ethics committee member is accusing 
others on the panel of unfairly prolonging an investigation into 
the relationship of five senators with former sampl executive charles 
h keating jr 
if i were any one of the five i would be going ballistic 
its just not fair sen trent lott rmiss said friday 
his remarks were a break with the usual reticence of committee 
members to comment on a case 
lott spoke after the committee failed for the second straight 
day to make crucial decisions in the probe 
the committee is weighing its special counsels proposal to 
proceed with its investigation of sens alan cranston dcalif 
dennis deconcini dariz and donald w riegle jr dmich the 
counsel proposed to drop the probe of sens john mccain rariz 
and john glenn dohio 
lott said he could not remain silent because i feel like ive 
been an accomplice to a crime he added hes extremely 
pessimistic that the committee will be able to make a decision 
when it meets next week 
the panel is trying to determine if there was a connection 
between the 13 million in political contributions keating and 
associates gave the senators campaigns and causes and their 
intervention with banking regulators on his behalf 
many of the contacts came when keatings lincoln savings and 
loan was headed toward collapse it was seized by the government in 
april 1989 and taxpayers could have to pay more than 2 billion to 
make up for the losses 
one source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
disagreement is expected over riegles fate with at least one 
senator inclined to drop him from the investigation along with 
glenn and mccain 
whats important is whether he intervened after an april 9 
1987 meeting with banking regulators when the five senators were 
told there may have been criminal violations at lincoln the source 
said 
deconcini and cranston kept up their contacts with regulators 
after that date riegle mccain and glenn did not 
glenn asked about the rate of progress said ive been 
frustrated for a year 
mccain said friday im deeply disappointed they havent been 
able to act they owe the american people an explanation of why 
they havent 
the decision on mccain is especially important because if he is 
dropped from the investigation before the nov 6 election only 
democrats would be subjects of the inquiry that could give 
republicans a campaign issue to counter democratic charges that the 
gop is responsible for the savings and loan crisis 
lott said he has no evidence that partisan motives are delaying 
the process saying i dont know what the motives are i cant 
believe that partisanship is involved here

defense secretary dick cheney upset with deep 
cuts in strategic weapons is inclined to recommend a presidential 
veto of a 288 billion military spending package lawmakers say 
a defense department official confirmed friday that the pentagon 
has told lawmakers cheney is leaning toward recommending a veto of 
the 1991 military spending bill 
cheney has not reached a final decision however and still 
hopes changes will be made before the house and senate take up the 
bill possibly as early as sunday the official said 
cheney was visiting france today on the final leg of a 10day 
trip that included britain and the soviet union aides are keeping 
him posted on details of the bill for the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 
rep jon l kyl rariz said he heard from people who ought 
to know that cheney will recommend a veto kyl is one of 15 
republicans who were involved in negotiations on the bill but 
refused to sign the final package 
the bill sets military spending at 288 billion for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 and represents a 19 billion reduction from 
president bushs request last january 
sen john warner rva said he spoke with bush while the 
president was visiting capitol hill on friday and urged him to sign 
the bill 
afterward i had a chance to consult with senior staff and in 
the brief exchange they reinforced my conviction that he will sign 
the legislation the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said 
the pentagon has criticized several provisions including cuts 
in troop levels and the budget request for the strategic defense 
initiative 
the bill provides 29 billion for sdi nearly 2 billion less 
than bush requested and 900 million below the level congress 
provided last year for the proposed antimissile shield commonly 
known as star wars 
the measure also cuts 100000 troops from the 21 million now in 
uniform worldwide cheney had urged congress to hold the cuts to 
80000 
meanwhile 22 house republicans wrote to the democratic chairman 
of the house armed services committee criticizing the exclusion of 
the panels ranking republican from the final days of negotiations 
rep bill dickinson rala was not included in a latenight 
session tuesday involving nunn warner and aspin in which the final 
defense package was produced 
in an interview aspin said dickinson was excluded from a 
session that dealt with minor issues because he had indicated he 
would oppose the bill aspin said he did not want dickinson over 
here throwing rocks 
elsewhere the house by voice vote adopted the bill that 
provides 84 billion for military construction and family housing 
in the fiscal year that began oct 1 the package is 764 million 
less than what bush sought 
in a step certain to rile the president the bill bars spending 
any federal funds from the nato infrastructure fund for building a 
base in crotone italy for the air forces 401st tactical wing 
the bill slashes the administrations request for the nato 
infrastructure fund from 420 million to 193 million 
spain has said the wing of 72 f16 jet fighters must be moved 
from torrejon de ardoz and italy agreed two years ago to provide a 
new home under nato auspices 
lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a base in 
europe when cheney plans to close others overseas and at home

facing myriad problems in their industry 
and a slumping economy the nations bankers are gathering for five 
days of brainstorming and imagepolishing starting today 
one indication of the industrys woes some of the countrys top 
banks are saving money by not sending representatives to the 
american bankers association convention projected attendance is 
4500 down about 18 percent from last years meeting 
strategies for steering through the current crises are high on 
the agenda bankers will hear from their colleagues wall street 
analysts and government officials including alan greenspan the 
federal reserve chairman and william l seidman chairman of the 
federal deposit insurance corp 
among those skipping the convention is north carolinabased ncnb 
corp the southeasts largest bank 
its an important gathering but were having to make some 
hard choices said spokesman john kleghorn ncnb this week 
reported third quarter net income down 60 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
association president kelly holthus said bankers are concerned 
about maintaining public confidence in the face of a barrage of 
headlines detailing the industrys troubles the convention usually 
attracts wide media coverage 
a lot of bankers are interested in getting the word out about 
the credibility of our industry said holthus 
holtus believes banks problems have been exaggerated 
as far as im concerned there are some isolated areas having 
problems with the economy and banks always are a mirror of the 
economy said holthus president and chief executive officer of 
the first national bank of york neb 
the meeting comes amid a flurry of worrisome third quarter 
earnings reports reduced dividends layoffs and a drop in the 
governments deposit insurance fund and many economists believe 
the economy is in a recession a decline in the real estate market and 
a spate of bad loans 
have plagued us banks in recent months some of the largest banks 
have reported quarterly losses and many others have seen profit 
levels shrink as they divert funds into reserves set aside to cover 
future loan losses 
the bush administration meanwhile predicted earlier this month 
that bank failures would reduce the fdics commercial bank fund by 
61 billion during the next three years 
those attending the orlando meeting are likely to fret over the 
possibility of increased government regulation said katherine 
bissette an analyst at interstate johnson lane in atlanta 
all in all what has happened is the industry and the 
marketplace has been reminded that banking is a regulated 
industry ms bissette said in the 80s theyd obviously 
forgotten it but now youre being hit over the head with it 
a tighter regulatory environment could be devastating to banks 
already struggling she said 
the good banks are not going to have to worry about it but 
the weaker banks how are they going to do ms bissette asked 
the pressure is on them at a time when they can least take it

opposition leader kim daejung ended a 
13day hunger strike today after the governing party agreed to 
accept one of his key demands early local government elections 
kim and 69 other opposition lawmakers said however they will 
continue to boycott the national assembly until the governing 
democratic liberal party has fully accepted other demands for wider 
democratic reform 
my struggle has paid off i am ending the fast on 
recommendation by our national assemblymen kim said at seouls 
severance hospital 
the 66yearold opposition leader who began the hunger strike 
oct 8 was admitted to the hospital monday in deteriorating 
health he continued the hunger strike under 24hour medical 
observation doctors said kim has lost about 13 pounds 
kim leader of the party for peace and democracy said the 
government had bowed to his demand for democratic reform and agreed 
to hold local government elections before the next presidential 
election expected in late 1992 
all local governments now are under the control of the central 
government and there is no local autonomy 
the ruling party also agreed to his demand not to change the 
form of government from presidential to parliamentary as long as 
people and the opposition oppose it he said 
dozens of opposition lawmakers joined kims hunger strike early 
this week they gave up their fast after kim ended his hunger 
strike 
earlier today kim youngsam chairman of the governing party 
publicly accepted some of the key opposition demands including 
local elections 
when i visited him kim daejung at his hospital bed i also 
assured him that there would be no forceful attempt to change the 
constitution to change the form of government kim youngsam said 
in the southern port city of pusan 
the decision defused political tension that has been rising 
since all 78 opposition lawmakers tendered their resignations in 
protest of what they called the governments railroading of several 
controversial bills in july 
the opposition charged that one bill was aimed at tightening 
government control over the nations broadcasting industry before 
the next presidential elections 
opposition members said they will continue to boycott the 
assembly until those controversial laws were rescinded they also 
demanded the reorganization of the powerful military intelligence 
group the military security command which allegedly has spied on 
civilians 
kim daejung and other opposition members believe that they 
would stand a better chance of winning power if local governments 
become autonomous through elections kim is expected to run again 
for president in 1992

the soviet union is looking to the west for 
economic ideas and an american media mogul says it should look to 
the deep south for inspiration to carry out changes 
the spirit of scarlett ohara is what the russian people need 
right now ted turner said friday night before introducing the 
film gone with the wind to a soviet audience 
because theyre going through a huge transition they have to 
do like she did and say with god as my witness ill never be 
hungry again and go to work to rebuild their country with a new 
economic system you cant sit around moaning and groaning 
about the days that are gone 
the soviet debut of the 1939 epic had all the glitz of a 
hollywood opening popping flashbulbs furs and limousines 
movie fans lined up for at least two hours for the chance to pay 
15 rubles 25 at the official exchange rate the average monthly 
paycheck is 250 rubles 
after the box office sold out a couple dozen soviets began 
offering to scalp their seats for 25 rubles each 
the film began an indefinite engagement in moscow under the 
sponsorship of a britishsoviet venture and turner whose cable 
news network and goodwill games are already known to the soviets 
a red army band played outside the 2500seat oktyabr theater 
and moviegoers were treated to a yellow champagnelookalike before 
the opening the vips got the real stuff with caviar behind a 
guarded door 
hundreds of people jammed the sidewalk in front of the theater 
on one of moscows main thoroughfares for a chance to view what 
turner called the american equivalent of tolstoys war and 
peace another tale of lives torn asunder by a great war 
the film retained the original soundtrack with russianlanguage 
subtitles 
gone with the wind is set during the civil war the same 
years in which serfdom was abolished in czarist russia 
in its review of the film the soviet news agency tass said it 
will turn the attention of our contemporaries to the beauty of 
noble feelings 
soviets seem to crave anything foreign particularly american 
whether noble or banal the lines outside gone with the wind 
were similar to those at the mcdonalds and pizza hut restaurants 
that opened this year in moscow 
formal blacktie attire was optional for this premiere the 
movies organizers guessed that in a country where a sale of tennis 
shoes can cause a near riot most people had never even seen a 
dinner jacket up close 
but many soviet guests dressed snazzily for the occasion some 
wore italian suits and formal gowns others were draped in furs and 
silk of the sort unseen in ordinary soviet stores 
once inside the soviets could buy an englishlanguage biography 
of vivien leigh who played the inimitable scarlett in the film or 
a small 60ruble bottle of french perfume packaged for the 
premiere and called scarlett 
proceeds were to go to an antiaids benefit sponsored by the 
liberal weekly magazine ogonyok 
the sovietbritish creative association the jointventure that 
organized the showing says the film will travel to other soviet 
cities after moscow 
turner whose mgm film library owns the rights to the film came 
to moscow with actress jane fonda fonda a fitness fanatic on 
thursday led about 700 soviet women in a jog around the kremlin

defense secretary dick cheney upset with deep 
cuts in strategic weapons is inclined to recommend a presidential 
veto of a 288 billion military spending package lawmakers say 
a defense department official confirmed friday that the pentagon 
has told lawmakers cheney is leaning toward recommending a veto of 
the 1991 military spending bill 
cheney has not reached a final decision however and still 
hopes changes will be made before the house and senate take up the 
bill possibly as early as sunday the official said 
cheney was visiting france today on the final leg of a 10day 
trip that included britain and the soviet union aides are keeping 
him posted on details of the bill for the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 
rep jon l kyl rariz said he heard from people who ought 
to know that cheney will recommend a veo kyl is one of 15 
republicans who were involved in negotiations on the bill but 
refused to sign the final package 
the bill sets military spending at 288 billion for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 and represents a 19 billion reduction from 
president bushs request last january 
sen john warner rva said he spoke with bush while the 
president was visiting capitol hill on friday and urged him to sign 
the bill 
afterward i had a chance to consult with senior staff and in 
the brief exchange they reinforced my conviction that he will sign 
the legislation the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said 
the pentagon has criticized several provisions including cuts 
in troop levels and the budget request for the strategic defense 
initiative 
the bill provides 29 billion for sdi nearly 2 billion less 
than bush requested and 900 million below the level congress 
provided last year for the proposed antimissile shield commonly 
known as star wars 
the measure also cuts 100000 troops from the 21 million now in 
uniform worldwide cheney had urged congress to hold the cuts to 
80000 
meanwhile 22 house republicans wrote rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee criticizing the 
exclusion of the panels ranking republican from the final days of 
negotiations 
rep bill dickinson rala was not included in a latenight 
session attended tuesday by aspin warner and sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee in which the final 
defense package was produced 
in an interview aspin said dickinson was excluded from a 
session that dealt with minor issues because he had indicated he 
would oppose the bill aspin said he did not want dickinson over 
here throwing rocks 
elsewhere the house by voice vote adopted the bill that 
provides 84 billion for military construction and family housing 
in the fiscal year that began oct 1 the package is 764 million 
less than what bush sought 
in a step certain to rile the president the bill bars spending 
any federal funds from the nato infrastructure fund for building a 
base in crotone italy for the air forces 401st tactical wing 
the bill slashes the administrations request for the nato 
infrastructure fund from 420 million to 193 million 
spain has said the wing of 72 f16 jet fighters must be moved 
from torrejon de ardoz and italy agreed two years ago to provide a 
new home under nato auspices 
lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a base in 
europe when cheney plans to close others overseas and at home

gen michel aouns family late friday 
flew to exile in france as a dispute between the french government 
and lebanese intensified over the fate of the defeated rebel 
general 
a small french government jet landed in france before dawn 
saturday carrying aouns wife nadia and their three daughters 
mireille 22 claudine 19 and chantal 
aoun has been holed up in the french embassy since last 
saturday when his 11month mutiny was crushed by syrianled forces 
in a blitz that left at least 350 people dead 
the lebanese government has refused to allow aoun and his aides 
to leave and is insisting the general face justice for crimes 
including the theft of at least 75 million from the state 
treasury 
also aboard the jet were the wives of two senior aides to aoun 
brig gen isam abu jamra and col adel sassine they were 
accompanied by abu jamras four children and sassines two boys 
beirut airport officials said 
the french news agency agence francepresse quoting an informed 
source said the mystere20 jet landed at a military airport in 
france but that the location was not disclosed for security 
reasons 
the planes departure from beirut was delayed more than five 
hours after lebanese customs officials confiscated 200000 cash 
from the bags of the three women the officials said 
an earlier defense ministry communique said mrs abu jamra alone 
was stripped of 150000 
the ministry communique said policemen combed the luggage 
ignoring the protests of french ambassador rene ala who 
accompanied the women and children from the french embassy to the 
airport 
the 12 dependents emerged from the french embassy friday night 
in a 10vehicle convoy they drove from the eastern suburb of 
hazmiyeh to the airport at full speed passing through several 
lebanese and syrian army checkpoints that made no attempt to stop 
them 
aoun abu jamra sassine and a third officer maj gen edgar 
maalouf stayed at the embassy where they sought refuge on saturday 
after their rebellion was crushed in a crackdown by lebanese and 
syrian troops 
france has granted the officers and their families asylum 
also friday the lebanese government angrily denied french 
reports that scores of aouns followers were massacred after they 
surrendered 
prime minister salim hoss described the reports as allegations 
based on biased rumors and the defense ministry said in a 
communique that the account was absolutely baseless 
witnesses said aouns wife and three daughters left the french 
embassy in a convoy of embassy cars escorted by lebanese military 
police two air france jets had arrived in beirut earlier 
in paris the french foreign ministry said it was trying to 
obtain independent confirmation of reports that up to 100 of aouns 
troops were executed but said it also wanted united nations 
action 
in a statement the ministry called on un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to intervene saying the reported 
atrocities aroused extreme emotion in france 
roman catholic leaders in france pleaded with the government 
friday to aid lebanons christians cardinal albert decourtnay 
president of the national conference of catholic bishops said 
lebanon is experiencing the most tragic hours of its history 
the lebanese defense ministry communique said aouns slain 
troops fell in the military operation and there was no 
postsurrender massacre 
when police examined the bodies at the baabda government 
hospitals morgue we found no solid evidence that the soldiers 
were liquidated a police spokesman said thursday 
none of the corpses we examined had hands tied behind the back 
and very few of the dead soldiers were hit in the skulls with 
bullets said the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
president elias hrawi accused aoun of ordering his troops to 
continue fighting on saturday even after he broadcast a message of 
surrender 
the eighthour air and ground assault by syrian and lebanese 
troops left 350 people dead and 1200 wounded by police count 
according to police the fatalities included at least 100 syrian 
soldiers 
hrawi claimed that aoun told his forces in a radio message 
im in the french embassy the outcome of the battle will be 
favorable to us go on go on fighting 
these were the orders aoun radioed to his forces even after 
his message of surrender was broadcast the presidential press 
office quoted hrawi as saying 
military sources described ferocious handtohand fighting 
on the eastern edge of the area aoun had controlled one source 
said that after aouns surrender one of his commanders told the 
syrians his troops were giving up then opened fire when the 
syrians came forward 
syrian infantrymen came out of their trenches to open terrain 
and were advancing slowly toward aouns lines to take over without 
shooting the source said 
aouns troops remained behind their barricades and opened up 
at the exposed forces with howitzers mortars and machine guns 
killing most of them if not all the source added 
the syrians then overran the position the source said 
hrawi plans to form a government of reconciliation to unify 
divided beirut and implement a peace accord to end the 15yearold 
civil war and give moslems and christians equal power 
aoun rejected the peace accord largely because it did not set a 
timetable for withdrawing syrian forces 
syria the main powerbroker in lebanon has had troops in the 
country since 1976 the syrians are considered an army of 
occupation by many christians

shore leave for us sailors in the gulf 
has taken on a wholesome connotation that is a world away from the 
fleshpots of earlier military deployments 
bangkok it isnt said a sailor downing a beer at an 
oktoberfest party hosted for about 500 men and women recently in 
bahrain but its better than nothing 
crewcut americans are a common sight now jogging along the 
streets in manama or buying up presents at the local gold market 
armed service personnel stationed in bahrain do not face the 
same timeoff restrictions as their counterparts do in saudi 
arabia where at least 200000 us military are dug in against 
iraqi troops who invaded kuwait aug2 
bahrain offers alcohol discos and beaches recreation under the 
rigid moral code of saudi arabia is more in the nature of tame 
videos and board games 
bahrains ministry of information prepared a short videotape for 
military circulation on the islands culture and society sailors 
are given briefings on acceptable behavior before their liberty 
leaves in manama 
arab women for the most part are offlimits but drinking 
isnt and neither is shopping in the souk the local bazaar 
we were told not to stare at local women who are covered with 
face veils but i found them more often staring at me they look 
scary said seaman brian zaisa 20 of burlington iowa 
zaisa was standing night watch atop the bridge of the uss blue 
ridge flagship of the 7th fleet he spends his days off bicycling 
throughout the small gulf islandnation 
the american support unit has operated for years as part of the 
commercial facilities that bahrain extends to us navy warships in 
the region since the gulf crisis started the unit has held some 
parties for naval personnel 
it doesnt take much to make americans happy an air force 
officer said on condition of anonymity often its just music a 
dance floor and beer 
the us military command in saudi arabia has been eyeing 
bahrain and the bustling gulf port of dubai as potential leave 
locations 
but as a s air force officer recently said in bahrain we 
wouldnt want to flood this little island with an excess of 
military personnel on r and r it wouldnt be fair to the 
country 
bahrain is smaller than new york city and has a population of 
about half a million 
dubai another tiny gulf republic has also announced plans to 
expand its facilities for visitors including building a new golf 
course 
there havent been any reports of disorderly conduct or crime by 
american soliders in bahrain a us military source said 
if anything we have had small scraps between sailors off 
different ships and marines or army more than between the 
military and locals said mark neuhart commander of the blue 
ridge 
asked whether the us military presence will affect bahrains 
arab culture neuhart said i believe this society will more 
likely have an effect on the men 
many sailors already have bought the traditional white robes or 
thobes and headgear or gutras that arab males wear 
theyre popular because theyre different and authentic 
theyll probably wear them for halloween neuhart said

rep frank annunzio dill wrote to a top 
federal regulator on behalf of three new york investors and later 
accepted campaign contributions from two of them government 
documents show 
annunzio wrote letters in late 1984 to edwin gray then chairman 
of the federal home loan bank board about the investors request 
to establish first city federal savings bank in new york 
the request by first city principals richard greenberg 
frederick greenberg and dan quigley was approved by the bank board 
in january 1985 
the two greenbergs who are brothers each contributed 1000 to 
the chicago congressmans campaign fund in september 1985 
according to federal election commission records frederick 
greenberg gave annunzio another 1000 in november 1987 
annunzio did not return three telephone calls to his office on 
friday a spokesman tom seppy said the congressman was not 
available 
the 75yearold annunzio a member of the house banking finance 
and urban affairs committee has been under attack for his other 
sampl dealings in the first vigorous reelection challenge he has 
faced in years 
the national journal reported recently that officials of 
standard federal savings bank a maryland sampl threatened with 
federal regulatory problems contributed 12000 to annunzio who 
later championed their cause in opposing the rule 
in his sept 20 1984 letter to gray annunzio said the three 
first city investors were most anxious to secure a charter as 
promptly as possible consistent with the regulations 
consequently i would be deeply grateful if you would lookinto this 
matter and furnish me a report on the current status of 
the application as well as advise me when you anticipate final 
action will be taken he said 
annunzio followed up with a second letter to gray on nov 15 
asking him to look into this matter once again and furnish me a 
current status report 
the phone number listed for first city was disconnected and the 
principals also did not return calls gray was not immediately 
available for comment a secretary in his office said 
annunzio has accepted more than 50000 in campaign 
contributions tied to sampls over the last decade but has denied any 
conflicts of interest 
annunzio also has come under fire for reports that two of his 
sonsinlaw once worked for the thrift industrys chief lobbying 
group the us league of savings institutions he does acknowledge 
he once tried to get one of them a position with the federal home 
loan bank board in chicago but maintains there was nothing improper 
about the request

the senate its members weary of a decade of 
rangling over us policy toward el salvador is endorsing a sharp 
drop in military aid to the country marking a defeat for president 
bush 
senators voted late friday to cut el salvadors 85 million in 
annual military aid in half and set conditions on the remaining 
aid designed to encourage both the government and the countrys 
leftist rebels to reach a negotiated peace 
but at the same time bush was able to salvage a victory in the 
155 billion foreign aid bill when senators voted 5542 to forgive 
67 billion in military debts egypt owes the united states 
administration officials had portrayed the debt forgiveness as a 
reward to egypt that is crucial to preserving an arab consensus in 
support of the us troop deployment in the persian gulf 
the senate adjourned for the weekend without finishing work on 
the foreign aid measure after it hit a snag over whether to reverse 
a fiveyear ban on us aid to international population agencies 
that advocate abortion 
on the el salvador issue the senate first voted 7425 for an 
amendment by sens patrick leahy dvt and christopher dodd 
dconn calling for an immediate 50 percent withholding of el 
salvadors fiscal 1991 military aid 
under the amendment if the countrys leftist fmln rebels walk 
away from unsponsored peace talks the aid could be restored but 
if the government abandons peace efforts whats left of the 
military aid could be cut as well 
people are just fed up with this thing dodd said referring 
to the millions of dollars in us aid sent to el salvador over the 
past decade other senators also expressed a weariness over the 
issue 
the conditions in the senate foreign aid bill are similar to 
those contained in a housepassed version the two bills still have 
to be reconciled by a housesenate conference committee but the el 
salvador provisions are expected to be in the final version sent to 
president bush 
top administration officials and even salvadoran president 
alfredo cristiani had been calling senators asking them to vote for 
the aide package and the size of the defeat took administration 
backers by surprise 
it was like a wave said one administration official adding 
that the tide seemed to turn after sen david boren dokla who 
had been a supporter voted the other way 
united nationssponsored talks aimed at a ceasefire between 
rebel and government troops have been stalled over the question of 
military reform the rebels of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front claim the government has been intransigent about 
dismissing officers linked to human rights violations 
under the caracas agreement such political agreements must be 
worked out before a ceasefire takes effect 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed in the salvadoran 
civil war many of the deaths have been blamed on rightwing death 
squads operating in cooperation with the military several military 
officials have been charged in the murders last year of six jesuit 
priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
the overall foreign aid bill provides economic and military 
support for us friends and allies around the world in the coming 
year 
as usual israel gets the lions share of the money 18 
billion in military aid and 12 billion in economic aid along 
with an assortment of provisions providing other economic benefits

stone crab fans waited for the seasons first 
catches of the gulf of mexicos top crustacean like wine lovers 
yearning for the years first beaujolais nouveau or new englanders 
watching for leaves to turn color 
its sweet its delicious its flaky its a legal 
narcotic said ron goldstein executive vice president of the 
east coast fisheries market and restaurant holding up the rich 
meat from one of the first crab claws available during the oct 
15tomay 15 season thats why people get all excited 
maine has its lobster and maryland its blueclaw crabs but 
people here swear stone crabs taste better 
dick mcdaniel who runs seafood operations at joes stone crab 
in miami beach said diet makes the difference 
blue crabs eat garbage meat the rottener it is the 
better mcdaniel explained but stone crabs are very 
persnickety they must eat the rollsroyce of baits fresh fish 
heads 
joes has been serving up the tasty critters since 1913 and now 
serves up a ton of cold claws each night 400000 pounds a year 
at 2495 for little more than a pound of meat 
in the early days at joes when miami beach was little more 
than a sandbar with a bathhouse writer damon runyon once observed 
that a man could dip his foot in biscayne bay and come up with a 
crab hanging from each toe 
now stone crabs roam mostly along floridas gulf coast about 
300 professional crabbers work the waters from the keys to panama 
city taking more than 25 million pounds of crab claws each 
season according to the state department of natural resources 
the crabs arent killed though crabbers hauling in hundreds 
of traps each day remove a claw at a time from the crabs before 
tossing them back into the sea where they regenerate their lost 
limbs in the offseason 
were taking something off a live animal without killing or 
destroying him were doing something right with the harvesting 
mcdaniel said 
the claws are quickly hauled off the boats and boiled before 
being iced down 
so eager was montys stone crab restaurant in miami to start 
serving the claws this year that it hired a helicopter to fly them 
in from the gulf on monday night their competition used trucks to 
cross the everglades and couldnt serve fresh claws until the next 
day 
tourism officials see the start of each season as a sign that 
the summer doldrums are ending 
were already getting phone calls we can start to feel the 
quickening pace at just about the same time stone crabs debut 
said mary louise english spokeswoman for the greater miami 
convention and visitors bureau 
not all people see the start of stone crab season as a glorious 
event however 
for sheri ashcraft an admissions adviser at barry university 
and a native floridian its a sign that miamis clogged roads are 
about to get even harder to navigate 
its like attack of the rental cars you see their tags and 
theyre always right in front of you going 10 mph she joked 
the restaurants are more full people suddenly appear in 
snowwhite skin with the wild shorts and zinc oxide on their 
noses

death penalty opponents believe the states 
electric chair malfunctioned in the execution of convicted murderer 
wilbert lee evans they said witnesses saw the man bleed profusely 
the moment he was electrocuted 
but the states corrections director edward w murray on 
friday rejected calls for an investigation of wednesday nights 
electrocution 
the man just simply had a nosebleed its as plain as that 
murray said 
the virginia coalition on jails and prisons the virginia 
association to abolish the death penalty and the american civil 
liberties union of virginia urged an investigation in a letter 
friday to murray 
according to witnesses there is a strong possibility that 
the electric chair malfunctioned and that mr evans suffered the 
letter said 
one witness the rev russell a ford said he saw corrections 
officers and state officials cringe then heard evans make a 
sizzling sound when the electric chair was turned on 
something unusual happened the night of the execution i can 
assure you said ford who has witnessed six executions 
everyone was aware of that who was present 
but murray said the witnesses dont have their facts 
straight 
corrections officials said the bleeding may have been caused by 
high blood pressure or evans nose jerking against his death mask 
evans body showed no evidence of trauma according to the state 
medical examiners autopsy report and deputy corrections director 
edward c morris witnessing his sixth execution said he did 
not make a noise 
evans 44 was put to death at the state penitentiary for 
shooting an alexandria sheriffs deputy with his own revolver 
during a 1981 escape attempt

officials at an agency in charge of protecting 
wildlife in china have been trapping black bears and selling them 
to restaurants that use them to entertain guests a chinese 
newspaper reported today 
some restaurants also kill the bears and use them to make bears 
paw soup a chinese reporter in canton said 
the story dubbed the case of the black bear began sept 6 
when one of the animals escaped into a park on the outskirts of 
canton southern chinas biggest city the independent ming pao 
newspaper said 
the bear was fleeing the swanky white cloud restaurant which is 
near the park and is a favorite watering hole of chinese officials 
the restaurant had handcuffed the beast since august and used it to 
entertain guests 
a posse of 300 armed officers used police dogs to search the 
park but the bear eluded them a chinese reporter contacted in 
canton said the incident was not reported in the citys press 
which remains under tight control by the communist party 
the 110pound bear appeared twice in a residential area near the 
park ming pao said on sept 18 it killed and ate a chicken and 
eight eggs on the balcony of one mans house authorities fired on 
the beast but it escaped a week later the bear resurfaced 
authorities shot at it again but missed 
authorities then set a trap for the animal and at 5 am last 
saturday the bear fell into it 
even though the bear was caught the case of the black bear 
incident set people thinking ming pao said 
an investigation disclosed that officials at the canton wildlife 
protection society smuggled the bear and eight others from a nearby 
town to canton on aug 24 the newspaper said 
initially it said the corrupt officials kept the bears at a 
medical center run by the society the beasts were farmed out to 
highclass restaurants which used the animals to lure customers 
the newspaper said 
chinas economy in the south has grown tremendously since 
beijing opened to the west in the early 1980s corruption and 
conspicuous consumption now run rife in canton decadent practices 
like dancing bears and exotic dishes like bears paw soup or 
snake and cat stir fry are commonplace 
after authorities caught the escaped bear the guangdong 
province wildlife protection agency stepped in seized the other 
bears and housed them in the guangzhou zoo many of the bears could 
not walk or stand because they had been in chains since august 
an official at the wildlife agency said smuggling bears was 
illegal under chinese law and that the investigation was 
continuing ming pao reported 
the chinese reporter speaking on condition of anonymity said 
other bears had been smuggled to guangzhou over the past year and 
had been killed by restaurateurs 
they were used for soup he said however he said most of 
the smuggled bears were used for entertainment because bears paw 
soup is a northern delicacy and not generally favored by southern 
chinese

forces of cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government have intensified attacks on 
guerrilla positions nationwide the communist khmer rouge guerrilla 
group says 
the report over khmer rouge radio on friday also claimed that 
vietnam dispatched three divisions into the country 
the report came with peace talks still deadlocked by a quarrel 
over leadership of a national reconciliation body that the 
government and a coalition of three guerrilla groups formed in 
september 
often during the nearly 12yearold civil war each side has 
stepped up fighting to force political concessions 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge is the largest group in the 
guerrilla coalition it also includes the ussupported forces of 
prince norodom sihanouk and the khmer peoples national liberation 
front 
the guerrilla broadcast monitored in bangkok said that since 
september government forces have successively launched military 
activities on every battlefield throughout the country 
it said they were concentrating on the northwestern province of 
battambang on the eastern province of kompong cham and on the 
central province of kompong thom 
vietnam sent two divisions to battambang to defend the railroad 
major roads and to retake pailin a rich gemmining town the 
guerrilla report said the khmer rouge seized the town in september 
1989 shortly after vietnam said it had pulled the last of it troops 
out of cambodia 
the broadcast said members of the other vietnamese division were 
spread out in various battlefields 
the guerrillas maintain their major bases along the thai border 
but have made significant inroads in cambodias central and 
northern regions this past year 
claims by both the guerrillas and the government are treated 
carefully by western analysts since many are exaggerated 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when its 
fanatical communist leaders ruled cambodia by terror and famine in 
the 1970s the group was ousted from phnom penh by the vietnamese 
invasion of late 1978

the un chief says that if israel proves 
intransigent he may have no recourse but to report to the security 
council only on ways to protect palestinians from israeli buses 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said friday he 
will not send envoys to investigate the oct 8 police killing of at 
least 19 palestinians in jerusalem unless israel decides to 
cooperate 
the only thing on which i can report if my mission does not go 
to the area is on the protection and the safety of the 
palestinians he said 
however perez de cuellar gave the united states and other 
nations more time to try to persuade israel to go along israel 
contends that letting in the un investigation team would infringe 
on israels sovereignty in jerusalem 
he said he is not pursuing further efforts to win israeli 
cooperation but noted he believes some countries would like to 
exert some influence on the israelis so that they end up by 
accepting the mission 
the security councils president british ambassador sir david 
hannay said the council will take up a statement or resolution 
monday urging israel to cooperate 
palestinian protesters threw rocks on jews praying at the 
western wall or wailing wall security forces fired tear gas 
rubber bullets and then live ammunition killing at least 19 
palestinians and wounding 140 about 30 israeli police and

on oct 12 the security council unanimously condemned israels 
security forces over the incident the resolution one of the few 
antiisrael measures backed by the united states expressed regret 
that worshipers were injured in its only reference critical of the

the council requested the secretarygeneral to send a team to 
investigate the killings and report back by the end of october 
israel has said un officials could enter as tourists but the 
secretarygeneral has rejected travel on anything less than an 
official level

10yearold daughter molly must continue receiving counseling 
mrs patrick told judge martin o parks she had been afraid to 
notify authorities about the slayings of dennis and cheryl avery 
and their three daughters on april 17 1989 because cult leader 
jeffrey lundgren told her he would kill her daughter if she did not 
cooperate 
investigators had said lundgren who admitted to shooting the 
averys at one time also had intended to kill the patricks 
the patricks said they still feared lundgren who was sentenced

voters in remote areas of borneo 
were the first to cast their ballots in a twoday election that 
began today with boats and helicopters transporting many people to 
the polls 
about 200000 voters were eligible in outlying areas of sabah 
and sarawak states across the south china sea from peninsular 
malaysia they got a head start because of the great distances and 
difficult travel involved 
polls open sunday for the remaining 77 million eligible voters 
elsewhere in the country first results are expected sunday and 
full tallies early monday 
at stake are 180 seats in the federal parliament and control of 
11 of the 13 state legislatures sabah and sarawak voted only for 
federal candidates 
prime minister mahathir mohamads powerful national front 
coalition was generally favored to win another term it controls 
major portions of the media and dispenses much patronage 
some polling places deep in the borneo jungle were accessible 
only by helicopter or boat officials in sarawak said 16 
helicopters and more than 1000 river craft were at the service of 
voters the state is half the size of france and 70 percent of it 
is jungle 
the smallest polling station in sarawak had six names on its 
register traditional longhouses home to headhunters generations 
ago were among the buildings used for voting 
security was tight paramilitary members of the police field 
force were on patrol in combat uniforms 
no outdoor rallies or political processions have been permitted 
in malaysia since race riots after the 1969 elections left hundreds 
dead in the streets of kuala lumpur 
mahathir 64 has been prime minister since 1981 the 10 largely 
ethnically based parties in his coalition and its predecessor have 
held power since independence in 1957 
components of the national front held 133 of the 177 seats in 
the recently dissolved parliament mahathir says he expects to win 
the twothirds majority necessary to amend the constitution 
an opposition alliance led by former trade and industry minister 
tengku razaleigh hamzah is the first serious challenge to the 
governing coalition in eight elections since independence 
razaleigh 53 narrowly missed in an attempt to topple mahathir 
from leadership of the key united malays national organization in 
1987 as the keystone of the national front coalition the group is 
the political voice of the malay majority in this nation of 178 
million people there are sizeable chinese and indian minorities 
no major national issues are being tested in what is largely a 
battle of personalities between two bitter rivals 
the results from sabah and sarawak are awaited with great 
interest the two states together control 47 seats and their 
politicians sometimes express disaffection with the leadership in 
kuala lumpur 
the sabah united party which is led by christians in a nation 
with islam as the official religion pulled out of the national 
front on monday such defections are not unusual in malaysian 
politics but mahathir denounced it as a stab in the back

manuel noriegas defense team must be ready to 
bring his drugtrafficking case to trial soon or the ousted 
panamanian leader could be looking for new lawyers a federal judge 
said 
im going to have to set a date and say youre in or youre 
out us district judge william hoeveler warned lead defense 
attorney frank rubino on friday 
noriegas trial is scheduled to begin jan 28 but wrangling 
over legal fees the threat of a new indictment a pending civil 
lawsuit and the fate of noriegas 15 codefendants have bogged it 
down hoeveler acknowledged he may have to delay the proceedings 
meanwhile the new york newspaper newsday reported friday that 
noriega has made coded telephone calls through rubinos office to 
contacts in panama attempting to organize the overthrow of 
president guillermo endara 
quoting sources it did not identify newsday said us 
investigators have broken the code used in the phone calls and 
turned the transcripts over to panamanian authorities 
but panamanian vice president ricardo arias calderon said he was 
unaware that the calls were encoded to hide a plot for 
insurrection 
i have no information at all about that arias calderon who 
oversees panamanian security forces told the miami herald in a 
story published today i was told about the calls but it is the 
first time i hear that they were coded no one briefed us on 
that 
rubino said he does not know the content of noriegas telephone 
conversations which are monitored by the government as are the 
calls of other prisoners 
the lawyer said lack of money has kept him from beginning the 
investigative phase of noriegas defense he said all of the former 
leaders foreign bank accounts remain frozen despite a june 
agreement with the united states to release about 6 million 
he told hoeveler he fears a civil lawsuit the government of 
panama is expected to file against noriega in miami next week could 
continue to tie up the money 
the lawsuit is expected to accuse noriega of looting his 
homeland and torturing and killing panamanian citizens 
sam burstyn attorney for former noriega codefendant luis del 
cid accused the government of deliberately delaying the trial to 
try to force noriega into a plea bargain 
i dont think the government ever intends to prosecute 
noriega and my client is being held hostage he said 
in a motion demanding del cid be released on bond burstyn said 
all sides are waiting for a new indictment against noriega 
diane cossin spokeswoman for us attorney dexter lehtinen 
denied the government was stalling she said prosecutors would be 
ready to go to trial jan 28 
she refused to confirm a new indictment is in the works in 
august prosecutors told a magistrate in the case of codefendant 
roberto steiner that the charges were expected to be broadened 
burstyn estimated a new indictment could delay the trial up to 
10 months noriega and the 15 others were indicted here in february 
1988 for allegedly allowing colombias medellin cocaine cartel to 
ship drugs through panama a tampa indictment also accuses the 
panamanian leader of marijuana smuggling and moneylaundering 
noriega surrendered to american authorities after us troops 
invaded panama to capture him in december 1989 he is being held in 
the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami he faces up 
to 145 years in prison if convicted on all counts

czechoslovak security forces 
helped suppress the 1956 anticommunist revolution in hungary and 
unrest the same year in poland a former interior minister is 
quoted as saying 
rudolf barak who served as interior minister from 1953 to 1961 
was quoted friday by the military weekly obrana lidu as saying 
czechoslovakia supplied men and weapons to help put down eastern 
europes bloodiest revolution 
baraks remarks were the latest in a series of admissions by 
former officials in warsaw pact countries since the anticommunist 
revolution swept eastern europe last year the exofficials 
acknowledge that their forces helped suppress popular uprisings in 
other nations in the soviet bloc 
the soviet union and the four other warsaw pact countries that 
invaded czechoslovakia during its 1968 attempts to create 
socialism with a human face condemned their actions last year 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said sending tanks to crush 
the prague spring was a mistake 
soviet troops marched into hungary in november 1956 to put down 
an anticommunist uprising many of the revolts leaders were 
subsequently executed they have been posthumously rehabilitated in 
hungarys democratization process of the past two years 
we provided immediate help to the hungarian and polish 
securities barak said adding that about 30 men went to each 
country we were also organizing supplies of machine guns and 
other weapons 
excerpts of the interview were carried by czechoslovakias 
official news agency ctk 
in poland in 1956 workers in poznan were suppressed during 
demonstrations against oneparty rule and soviet domination a 
period of liberalization followed after antistalinist communists 
staged a bloodless coup 
barak was a member of the communist partys ruling politburo 
and in 196062 he worked as the countrys deputy premier 
in 1962 he was sentenced to 15 years in jail for abusing the 
powers of public office and embezzlement he was released in 1968 
barak said he was actually imprisoned because he had gotten hold 
of documents that showed thenpresident antonin novotny baraks 
main rival in the party had been a paid agent of the nazi secret 
police germany invaded czechoslovakia and ruled the country during 
world war ii 
novotny was general secretary of the communist party from 1953 
to 1968 and president from 1957 to 1968

the defense minister denied that 
christian soldiers loyal to rebel gen michel aoun were executed 
after surrendering during a crushing attack by syrian and lebanese 
forces a newspaper reported today 
defense minister alfred mansour also said 200 more syrian 
soldiers were killed than earlier reported according to the 
leftist newspaper assafir 
in the first official version on the fighting between syrian 
troops and aouns followers mansour said there was a 
doublemassacre after aoun ordered his troops to continue 
fighting even though he had broadcast his surrender 
syrian and lebanese forces ended the generals 11month mutiny 
last saturday when they overran his former enclave 
he remained in the french embassy where he sought asylum but 
his wife and children flew into exile in france today 
the government of president elias hrawi has refused to allow 
aoun and his aides to leave accusing the general of looting the 
treasury of 75 million 
aouns wife and three daughters arrived in france today aboard a 
french government jet accompanied by the wives of brig gen isam 
abu jamra and col adel sassine two of aouns top aides officials 
said 
abu jamra and sassine are in the french embassy with aoun 
aouns troops were not executed assafir quoted mansour as 
saying what happened is that after aouns surrender statement 
was broadcast we ordered the advancing troops to stop shooting 
but fighting continued 
we knew later that aoun had given orders to his forces to 
continue fighting for three hours hoping for foreign pressures in 
his favor mansour said the syrian forces unaware of aouns 
keepfighting orders were taken by surprise and lost 200 dead 
when the rest of the force reached aouns positions the 
second massacre took place he said the bodies at the 
government hospital in baabda are aouns troops who were killed in 
the confrontation 
mansours disclosure that 200 more syrian soldiers were killed 
raised the overall toll from the eighthour airandground assault 
to 550 dead including 300 syrian soldiers and 1200 wounded 
french and british press reports said about 100 aouns troops were 
executed after surrendering 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
deployed in most of the wartorn nation it supports the government 
of president elias hrawi 
hrawi traveled to syria today for summit talks with president 
hafez assad and other syrian officials hrawi told syrian 
television wednesday night that we thank the syrian army for each 
drop of blood it shed in lebanon 
france on thursday asked un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to order an investigation into the alleged execution of 
aouns troops after they surrendered to the attacking forces 
the french stand was criticized by prime minister salim hoss a 
sunni moslem who said it hurts lebanon noting that reports of 
the alleged executions were based on biased rumors 
lebanon and france have been locked in a diplomatic quarrel over 
aoun france has granted aoun and his family asylum along with a 
number of his military aides and their dependents 
but hrawis government said aoun and his military aides will not 
be allowed to leave and should face a court of law for a variety of 
crimes 
the government has not officially charged aoun with stealing 
money from the treasury but officials say aoun and his aides were 
collecting taxes fees for public services and customs dues in his 
area of influence and depositing the money in local and foreign 
banks instead of in the central bank in moslem west beirut 
after crushing aouns mutiny hrawis government moved to 
dismantle beiruts green line which has been dividing the capital 
into moslem and christian sectors for more than 15 years 
after reopening roads linking the citys two sectors the 
government hopes to create a militiafree greater beirut to 
include the capital and its immediate suburbs 
the main obstacles that face implementation of the greater 
beirut plan is the deployment of christian shiite moslem and druse 
militias in parts of it 
the greater beirut plan is in line with the governments plan to 
implement an arab leaguebrokered peace accord to end the nations 
15yearold civil war which has killed more than 150000 people 
the peace accord ratified by parliament in august distributes 
power equally between moslems and christians 
aoun had rejected the peace accord and refused to recognize 
hrawi also a christian as head of state

advancing government troops have 
killed more than 100 tamil rebels in the northern jaffna peninsula 
according to a military report published saturday 
but a rebel leader said 15 militants and 50 soldiers died in 
fighting tuesday through friday 
the military report claimed only 14 soldiers were killed and 145 
were wounded in the operations to clear the perimeters around 
military camps 
the military plans to continue the offensive but did not 
elaborate on plans 
both sides regularly make conflicting claims about death tolls 
which cannot be independently confirmed because of disruption in 
communcations with jaffna about 185 miles north of colombo 
the communique said troops recaptured five areas that were under 
rule of the tamil separatists who have fought since 1983 for a 
separate homeland in northern and the eastern areas on the island 
nation they claim discrimination from the sinhalese majority 
the military communique said most of the casualties were 
inflicted by air force helicopter gunships and aircraft that 
straffed guerrilla vehicles 
during the operations the security forces recovered a large 
stock of antipersonnel mines warlike equipment medical items 
food stocks stretchers and a few automatic rifles it said 
jaffna peninsula the northernmost part of the island is a 
rebel stronghold where most of the fighting has centered the 
hostilities were only interrupted during a 13month ceasefire that 
ended last august 
more than 14000 people have been killed in fighting 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
while sinhalese make up about 75 percent and control the government 
and the military

iraqs nearly 2monthold effort to starve diplomats out of 
kuwait has claimed another embassy leaving only the us british 
and french compounds as the last western holdouts besieged by iraqi 
troops 
canada on friday pulled out the remaining personnel from its 
embassy in kuwait city where diplomats have resorted to burning 
furniture for cooking stockpiled food and boiling swimming pool 
water for drinking 
as the diplomats suffered on in kuwait the first signs of 
protest against the troop buildup in the persian gulf were emerging 
in the united states 
despite polls showing americans overwhelmingly support the us 
deployment of more than 200000 soldiers in the gulf region 
opponents of the buildup planned protests today in at least 15 
major us cities 
although britain has been one of the staunchest supporters of 
the usled effort to drive iraq out of kuwait a former british 
prime minister edward heath traveled to baghdad today on a 
personal mission to negotiate the release of 70 elderly and ailing 
britons held hostage by iraqi authorities 
heath 74 left amman jordan on a scheduled iraqi airways 
commercial flight for baghdad and refused to discuss his mission 
with reporters 
despite the fact that little has changed in the standoff since 
iraq invaded kuwit on aug 2 oil prices on friday slid to less 
than 34 a barrel down 3 
the skittish market reacted in part to hints that iraqi 
president saddam hussein may be willing to negotiate an end to the 
12weekold occupation of kuwait prices have topped 40 double 
since the crisis began posing inflationary and recessionary 
pressures on the us and other economies 
iraqs deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan said on 
thursday in amman that peace talks could be in the offing but in 
washington president bush said he saw no chance for compromise in 
the persian gulf crisis which began when iraq seized kuwait in a 
dispute over oil land and money 
bush met with a soviet envoy yevgeny primakov who said he 
agreed that the world should not relax its insistence on an 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait about 430000 iraqi 
troops are deployed in kuwait and southern iraq 
a un embargo has forced iraq to ration food and baghdad says 
it will begin rationing gasoline tuesday to save on imported 
chemicals that are needed to refine oil and that are now in short 
supply 
three canadian diplomats and two wives arrived in baghdad on 
friday night tired but well 10 hours after leaving kuwait 
external affairs minister joe clark said in ottawa the five led 
by charge daffaires william bowden planned to stay with staff 
from the embassy in baghdad 
clark said the embassy is not officially closed and that this 
did not mean canada recognized iraqs claim to kuwait 
the canadian action occurred the same day a report was published 
in iraqi newspapers saying all foreigners in kuwait must register 
with local authorities before nov 5 or face a fine and punishment 
since aug 24 iraqi forces have cut off electricity and water to 
foreign compounds in kuwait which saddam claims as iraqs 19th 
province 
the belgian and german embassies in kuwait closed oct 12 and 
the dutch italian and polish embassies withdrew their last 
diplomats from kuwait city the week before that 
although the british french and us embassies are believed to 
be the only western compounds remaining open most nations still 
recognize kuwait as a separate nation an unspecified number of 
nonwestern embassies remain open 
the us embassy maintains about 10 diplomats led by ambassador 
w nathaniel howell an unknown number of american private citizens 
also have taken refuge there 
the american diplomats have been surviving mainly on canned food 
and the occasional loaf of bread carried in by local staff 
about 600 americans are stuck in kuwait some in hiding and 
several are reported to be desperately ill 
iraq has placed scores of westerners at military installations 
as human shields to deter any attacks 
in other developments 
a british fighter jet crashed in northwestern saudi arabia 
injuring the navigator a british military spokesman said the plane 
hit something while coming in for a landing at an air base in tabuk 
late friday 
us military officials in saudi arabia said there had been 
2500 interceptions 240 boardings and 11 diversions of 
commercial ships since the embargo against baghdad was imposed 
the pentagon also said friday that it is shipping several 
hundred of its best tanks the m1a1 from europe to saudi 
arabia the announcement did not give a specific number but it 
appeared the total was 300 to 400 and would bring total us tank 
strength to nearly 1000 that compares with the 3500 iraqi tanks 
the pentagon says are deployed in kuwait and southern iraq 
a defense department satellite to be carried into orbit next 
month on the space shuttle atlantis will provide strategic and 
tactical reconnaissance information from the gulf region says a 
report to be published monday in aviation week and space technology

independence of angola or unita which has been fighting the 
sovietbacked government since angola gained independence from 
portugal in 1975 
cuban troops supporting the government have protected foreign 
oil installations from attack 
under a 1988 peace agreement about 12000 cuban troops 
remaining in angola are due to withdraw by mid1991 
on wednesday the house voted to preserve covert us military 
support for unita

to 550 dead including 300 syrian soldiers and 1200 wounded 
french and british press reports said about 100 aouns troops were 
executed after surrendering 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
deployed in most of the wartorn nation it supports the government 
of president elias hrawi 
hrawi traveled to syria today for summit talks with president 
hafez assad and other syrian officials hrawi told syrian 
television wednesday night that we thank the syrian army for each 
drop of blood it shed in lebanon 
france on thursday asked un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to order an investigation into the alleged execution of 
aouns troops after they surrendered to the attacking forces 
the french stand was criticized by prime minister salim hoss a 
sunni moslem who said it hurts lebanon noting that reports of 
the alleged executions were based on biased rumors 
lebanon and france have been locked in a diplomatic quarrel over 
aoun france has granted aoun and his family asylum along with a 
number of his military aides and their dependents 
but hrawis government said aoun and his military aides will not 
be allowed to leave and should face a court of law for a variety of 
crimes 
the government has not officially charged aoun with stealing 
money from the treasury but officials say aoun and his aides were 
collecting taxes fees for public services and customs dues in his 
area of influence and depositing the money in local and foreign 
banks instead of in the central bank in moslem west beirut 
after crushing aouns mutiny hrawis government moved to 
dismantle beiruts green line which has been dividing the capital 
into moslem and christian sectors for more than 15 years 
after reopening roads linking the citys two sectors the 
government hopes to create a militiafree greater beirut to 
include the capital and its immediate suburbs 
the main obstacles that face implementation of the greater 
beirut plan is the deployment of christian shiite moslem and druse 
militias in parts of it 
the greater beirut plan is in line with the governments plan to 
implement an arab leaguebrokered peace accord to end the nations 
15yearold civil war which has killed more than 150000 people 
the peace accord ratified by parliament in august distributes 
power equally between moslems and christians 
aoun had rejected the peace accord and refused to recognize 
hrawi also a christian as head of state

reports that the last confederate widow died 
last week surprised an alabama woman who has evidence that her late 
husband also fought for the south in the civil war 
im still here said 83yearold alberta martin who married 
confederate veteran william jasper martin in december 1927 
news reports including those of the associated press after the 
oct 13 death of daisy wilson cave described the sumter sc 
woman as the last surviving confederate widow 
but mrs martin said friday she was 21 and working in a cotton 
mill when she and martin were married at the covington county 
courthouse in south alabama she said her husband was about 80 when 
he died about five years later martin was with the 4th alabama 
infantry in 1864 and 1865 according to the records of his stepson 
harold farrow of north little rock ark 
mildred cook president general of the united daughters of the 
confederacy said mrs martin is the lone surviving confederate 
widow affiliated with her 25000member organization she said 
there may be other confederate widows although she is not aware of 
any 
farrows wife marilyn said her motherinlaw may have been 
overlooked as a surviving civil war widow because she does not draw 
a confederate pension after martin died mrs martin married his 
grandson charlie martin which apparently made her ineligible for 
the pension 
mrs martin said she can barely remember her husband talking 
about his wartime experiences 
i remember him talking about moving up through the field 
picking up potatoes she said he said theyd come across a 
patch of potatoes anything they could come across to eat 
farrow recalled attending his stepfathers funeral when he was 7 
and how he and his half brother william had to relinquish medals 
the elder martin had given them so they could be pinned on his 
burial clothes 
we had cherished them very much farrow said i remember 
crying at the time

soldiers cordoned off buddhist monasteries 
in burmas second largest city today after the military government 
threatened to disband buddhist organizations whose members are 
refusing to minister to soldiers 
the government threat carried on state radio also said the 
offending buddhists will be expelled from their orders because they 
have violated the rules of their religion by becoming politically 
involved 
thousands of buddhist monks in burma have stopped ministering to 
the soldiers to protest government crackdowns on prodemocracy 
protests 
the action by the monks who have been at the forefront of 
antigovernment protests in burma is the equivalent to 
excommunicating the soldiers in this predominantly buddhist 
country a western observer in rangoon said today 
the government announcement on rangoon radio said such 
illegal organizations will be dissolved from midnight 
tonight and members of such illegal organizations are not eligible 
to be members of the sangha the sangha is the main religious 
governing body in predominately buddhist burma 
the government said such organizations ave jeopardized the 
peace and stability of the country and threatened the breakup of 
the central sangha organization by various means including 
threats blackmail and boycott the announcement was repeated 
throughout the day interspersed with martial music 
the western observer said any move against members of the sangha 
is bound to cause some kind of popular reaction he spoke by 
telephone and like other observers and sources who commented on 
the situation requested anonymity 
the groups singled out by the radio included the young monks 
organization in the central city of mandalay on sept 6 the 
organization announced a boycott of religious ceremonies for 
soldiers and their families after troops broke up an 
antigovernment protest there on aug 8 
during the demonstration troops killed four people including 
two monks according to western diplomats in rangoon 
burmese sources in mandalay said today that soldiers began 
cordoning off monasteries there this morning the sources said the 
soldiers were expected to search the monasteries after midnight 
from mandalay the monks protest involving ministering to the 
nations soldiers spread west to the district of monya and to some 
monasteries in the capital rangoon 350 miles south of mandalay 
a second western source said about 160 monasteries in the 
capital had taken up the protest and that it now involved 15000 
monks or about onequarter of the total in the city however it 
appeared the boycott was most widespread in mandalay where there 
were some 20000 monks he said 
mandalay was a major center of unrest during the 1988 
prodemocracy uprising monks led the protests and took over the 
administration of the city for several weeks that year leader saw 
maungs troops crushed the revolt in september 1988 and soldiers 
killed thousands of protesters 
the military government held a national election may 27 that was 
easily won by the national league for democracy the nations main 
opposition group but the government refused to hand over power and 
arrested opposition leaders 
the western source doubted the government could single out those 
monks behind the current boycott because it has become so 
widespread it will be like trying to catch quicksilver he 
said 
about 85 percent of burmas 40 million people are buddhist and 
some 300000 monks live in monasteries around the country in 
buddhist societies monks play an important role in popular 
celebrations and rites 
in a meeting with 19 senior monks thursday the prime minister 
gen saw maung said the boycott must end by today 
i have tolerated as much as i can he said 
the situation is very dangerous both in terms of religion as 
well as in terms of the country and of the people normal measures 
are no longer sufficient to ensure the perpetuity of the 
religion

an angry and unpredictable electorate is 
leaving politicians wary of election day surprises seven senate 
races and 14 contests for governor are too close to call 
the strongest democratic prospects are in races for governor 
according to a statebystate analysis by the associated press 
republicans recruited strong senate candidates and began this 
midterm election campaign with high hopes of trimming the 
democratic majority gop gains now look less likely 
senior senators in both parties are in danger of losing they 
are republicans jesse helms of north carolina and mark hatfield of 
oregon and democrat claiborne pell of rhode island 
the democrats best chances are in governors races in part 
because gop governors in several key states are not seeking 
reelection that boosted democratic chances of electing governors 
in california texas illinois and oklahoma 
in addition six republican governors face tough challenges 
including embattled gov bob martinez of florida 
the stakes are particularly high in governors races because of 
the role the winners will play next year when congressional and 
state legislative district lines are redrawn to conform to the 1990 
census results california texas and florida are expected to gain 
a total of 14 new us house seats 
despite the volatility of the electorate the house once again 
looks like a secure political haven with only a handful of members 
facing serious challenges 
the big question this year is whether an antiincumbent mood 
will surprise officeholders on election day 
the mood is bad and getting worse said democratic pollster 
geoff garin he cited the budget fiasco which he said 
confirms every worst suspicion people have about the political 
system 
he predicted that some incumbents whove become complacent 
because of their easy elections in the 80s are going to end up out 
of work 
there is no question people are very very angry out there 
said michele davis executive director of the republican governors 
association she cited the budget stalemate and said the public 
hears nothing but bad news somethings broken and the people we 
paid to fix it are too busy fingerpointing to do the job 
voter anger struck in massachusetts where primary election 
voters rejected establishment politicians and nominated democrat 
john silber and republican william weld for governor silber on 
leave as president of boston university made no secret of the fact 
he voted for george bush over home state favorite michael dukakis 
in the 1988 presidential election 
in new jersey voters are furious over democratic gov james 
florios proposal to raise taxes 28 billion some of that anger 
is spilling over to hurt democratic sen bill bradley 
still considered a safe bet to win a third term against a 
challenge by republican christine todd whitman bradley saw his 
approval ratings drop 8 points in a recent poll the senator still 
led whitman 56 percent to 26 percent 
it appears the decline in support for bradley is a result of 
voter frustration over taxes said janice ballou director of the 
poll conducted by the eagleton institute for the newark 
starledger 
for months politicians were unable to compete with the persian 
gulf crisis for public attention when people finally began to pay 
more attention to domestic politics the issue that stood out above 
all others was the budget an issue that entangled congress for 
weeks with an outcome certain to result in higher taxes for 
everyone 
democrats control the senate by a margin of 55 to 45 
twentynine of the nations governors are democrats and 21 are 
republicans

here is a look at the closest races starting with senate 
contests 
north carolina harvey gantt the black former mayor of 
charlotte is giving sen jesse helms the toughest race of his 
career independent polls say the race is a dead heat gantt and 
helms differ on just about every issue the conservative republican 
senator depicts his challenger as an extremist who supports 
lateterm abortions and those for sexselection gantt depicts 
helms as an ideologue who votes against the interests of his state 
particularly on education and the environment 
iowa democratic sen tom harkin is battling rep tom tauke as 
well as an iowa tradition of not reelecting democratic senators 
polls show harkin consistently in the lead but his edge is often 
well within the margin of error abortion is a major issue with 
harkin prochoice and tauke firmly opposed to abortion iowa bucked 
a national trend in the 1980s and became one of the strongest 
growth areas for the democrats a factor that could help harkin in 
a close race 
oregon republican sen mark hatfield bidding for a fifth 
term may be the best example of a complacent incumbent democratic 
businessman harry lonsdale hammered away at hatfield for months and 
the senator ignored the challenge until a recent poll showed 
lonsdale had climbed to within 6 points of the incumbent another 
race in which abortion is an issue hatfield is opposed while 
lonsdale is a supporter 
hawaii generally regarded as the best chance for the 
republicans to pick up a democratic seat democrat daniel akaka was 
appointed to the senate last summer after spark matsunaga died a 
lackluster campaigner who held a safe house seat for seven terms 
akaka is opposed by republican rep pat saiki even hawaii 
democrats conceded that saiki is a dynamic campaigner and has a 
strong chance to win in this heavily democratic state 
massachusetts sen john kerry was considered a shooin for 
reelection in this heavily democratic state until the voters 
expressed their rage in the sept 18 primary suddenly independent 
polls said the race between kerry and his republican challenger 
jim rappaport was a dead heat a wealthy businessman prepared to 
spend millions on the race rappaport is concentrating on linking 
kerry to the highly unpopular outgoing governor dukakis 
rhode island democrat claiborne pell was elected to the senate 
in 1960 the year john f kennedy was elected president his six 
terms have given him the seniority to become chairman of the 
foreign relations committee but have also made him vulnerable to a 
challenge from 43yearold rep claudine schneider politely but 
firmly schneider suggests it is time for a younger person to take 
pells seat however recent polls give pell 71 an 18point lead 
new hampshire gop rep bob smith was heavily favored to 
capture the senate seat being vacated by fellow conservative gordon 
humphrey but former sen john durkin has made a race of it and a 
recent poll said smiths 4point lead was within the margin of 
error 
in other states a large number of senate contests looked 
tempting to challengers but didnt seem to pan out they include 
illinois where democratic sen paul simon looks far ahead of 
republican rep lynn martin michigan where democratic sen carl 
levin is outdistancing rep bill schuette nebraska where 
democratic sen james exon leads former rep hal daub kentucky 
where republican sen mitch mcconnell leads harvey sloane and 
montana where democratic sen max baucus is well ahead of lt gov 
allen kolstad 
among the races for governor these are getting the most 
attention 
california the battle between former san francisco mayor 
dianne feinstein the democratic nominee and gop sen pete wilson 
is generally regarded as the most important contest in the nation 
california is likely to pick up seven new house seats in 1992 and 
if feinstein wins her party will have total control of how the 
lines are drawn in the nations most populous state a victory for 
wilson gives the gop an important role although the legislature 
will remain democratic wilson and feinstein agree on more issues 
than they disagree wilsons lead in the polls is well within the 
margin of error 
texas republican millionaire clayton williams seemed well on 
his way to victory over democrat ann richards but last week a new 
poll said richards had moved to within 5 points of williams whose 
repeated verbal gaffes may be cutting into his support 
florida martinez got into trouble over taxes early in his 
first term and then found his hardline antiabortion stand had 
moved out of favor with voters former sen lawton chiles got into 
the race and led in most polls recently the margin has narrowed 
and martinez has a big edge in money 
florida is one of the six states where gop governors are 
threatened the others are alabama where gov guy hunt is leading 
teachers union official paul hubbert nebraska where gov kay orr 
is trailing businessman ben nelson kansas where gov mike hayden 
and state treasurer joan finney were in a dead heat maine where 
former democratic gov joseph brennan held a narrow lead over gov 
john r mckernan and rhode island where gov edward diprete was 
running far behind businessman bruce sundlun 
the best bets for republican pickups were in vermont alaska 
massachusetts oregon and ohio democratic governors are not 
running in each of those states 
in oklahoma gop gov henry bellmon is not running and democrats 
hope for another gain

authorities have arrested five 
students police said saturday in an apparent effort to stem 
antigovernment protests that included a suicide that shocked the 
nation 
the arrests were made after tanawot klingchue 21 set himself 
ablaze outside ramkhamhaeng university oct 13 after making a 
speech at a rally demanding that the government resign for alleged 
corruption 
tanawot died in a hospital on thursday 
his action highly unusual in thailand stunned the public and 
renewed popular discontent with prime minister chatichai 
choonhavans coalition government a photograph of the student his 
body covered with flames from his neck to his feet was widely 
distributed in the united states 
police officer vissanu tuengsook said authorities on thursday 
and friday arrested the five ramkhamhaeng university students who 
had been out on bail since being arrested at a protest rally 
earlier this year 
they were taken into custody again on the same charge inciting 
public unrest 
a sixth person nikom kesorn a member of the revolutionary 
council also was arrested the littleknown revolutionary council 
first surfaced in 1987 to call for peaceful revolution 
vissanu said the six were not suspected of involvement in the 
most recent protests they apparently were arrested to dampen the 
protest mood 
chatichais 2yearold administration has been widely criticized 
for alleged corruption and ineptitude and for internal bickering

in army jargon its a flameless ration 
heater to the soldier in the saudi desert its an easy way to 
turn lukewarm food in a plastic pouch into a hot meal using cold 
water 
the heaters werent supposed to hit the production line for two 
years but 5 million are being sent to saudi arabia in time for 
winter theyre among dozens of innovations developed by army 
researchers that are being rushed from the drawing board into 
prdduction because of the deployment of american troops to the 
middle east 
the new products include better boots revamped desert 
camouflage to replace the nowfamiliar chocolate chip fabric 
the troops are wearing and water recycling kits designed to cut by 
40 percent the use of scarce water at the armys huge field 
laundries 
some of the products now ready for operation desert shield 
werent even on the drawing board when president bush sent us 
troops to the region on aug 8 as the troops and weapons arrived 
a military outfitted for a european war against the soviets 
realized it lacked gear essential to surviving the harsh desert 
climate 
so it called on the army research labs here where the designers 
of the equipment used by american troops stationed in alaska and 
other coldweather climates have been working overtime on products 
for the scorching desert they are cutting months and in some cases 
years off routine schedules for product development in the process 
providing lucrative work for defense contractors who stand to gain 
millions 
in peacetime we have a lot of testing and checks and 
balances said frank kostka who heads the division of the labs 
that designs tents and other outdoor protective gear in a 
situation like this the system has to be extremely flexible you 
get smart quickly when you have to 
kostkas crews at the research labs also have developed new 
solar covers that attach to the camouflage nets carried by tanks 
and other heavy equipment the screens not only block out 80 
percent of the sunlight but can resist chemical attack 
the first covers are stacked in a huge production room at the 
natick labs waiting to be shipped to saudi arabia later this 
month the pentagon is spending 600000 to have hundreds more 
produced commercially from the labs design and another 1 million 
on lighter sun covers designed to protect storage and maintenance 
areas far back from the front 
in a softball field on the sprawling complex is another recent 
invention a huge but lightweight tent to be used as a portable 
maintenance garage in the desert the tent is big enough to house 
an m1 tank and light enough to be moved by four men 
kostka briefed military planners last week on another new 
product doublelayered tents designed to serve as hospitals or 
command posts in chemicalcontaminated environments because of the 
design troops inside would be able to work in shirt sleeves 
instead of hot bulky protective suits 
in another office at the labs vasant k devarakonda is waiting 
like a salesman to show off the latest in desert footwear a suede 
and nylon boot that matches the desert uniforms a steelplate in 
the soles of the vietnamera boot designed to protect soldiers 
from pongee sticks is removed from the new version because it 
would heat up the inside 
not that the boots wont get warm 
eventually at 120 degrees everything is going to get hot 
devarakonda said with a shrug 
researchers also hope to begin testing another invention a 
personal airconditioning unit carried on a backpack one early 
prototype used an engine from a weed whacker to power a tiny blower 
unit that pumps cool air into a specially designed vest 
that awkwardlooking device weighed 22 pounds the researchers 
believe a smaller specially designed engine might bring the weight 
down to 15 pounds 
television footage of a soldier guzzling water from a plastic 
water bottle was the impetus for another invention an insulated 
camouflage pouch that carries and cools bottled water 
if the pentagon agrees to pay about 4 apiece to produce them 
the carriers would replace the current insulator of choice in the 
desert a wet sock 
philip brandler may have the toughest job at the labs hes in 
charge of the food 
it was brandlers office that rushed into development the ration 
heaters which uses a pad treated with iron magnesium and salt to 
heat a meal to 180 degrees 
theres also a new hot dog meal pancake and waffle breakfasts 
and a turkey dinner that will be available to the troops on 
thanksgiving stuffing and cranberry sauce included 
still in the works are a new chili dish and dehydrated soda 
tablets 
in developing those which require only water to produce 
carbonated drinks the researchers also discovered how to make a 
dehydrated drink that would be coveted in the saudi desert beer 
even though its nonalcoholic the inventors dont think the 
pentagon will order any 
but brandler is promising to provide another treat 
the pentagon is negotiating with several companies including 
hershey which is licensed to market a swisspatented chocolate 
that wont melt until the mercury passes 140 degrees 
mars has its own version and has agreed to use it in mampms it 
currently provides for field rations 
we think that will have a tremendous morale impact brandler 
said they wont melt in your hand and they wont melt in the 
sand

the federal centers for disease control 
misspent 66 million while conducting a disputed study of the 
effects of agent orange according to a congressional study 
released saturday 
the general accounting office said the money was spent on work 
by outside contractors that was not needed or could not be carried 
out because cdc did not have a methodology ready to begin the work 
agent orange was a herbicide sprayed by us troops during the 
vietnam war to remove jungle cover many veterans contend it is 
responsible for cancers birth defects in their offspring and other 
ailments 
the report fueled renewed criticism from congressional critics 
of the cdcs handling of the agent orange study ordered by 
congress 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the house human resources 
and intergovernmental relations subcommittee called the report 
direct evidence that the political manipulation of the agent 
orange study resulted in the waste of millions of taxpayer 
dollars 
gaos investigation was conducted at the request of weiss 
subcommittee which has jurisdiction over cdc the panel charged in 
august that the reagan white house covered up scientific evidence 
about agent orange 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house government 
operations committee said the suppression of this information 
combined with the millions of taxpayers dollars wasted in the 
process makes this coverup by the white house and cdc a 
disgrace 
the 66 million amounted to nearly 10 percent of the 704 
million congress appropriated for the study and 20 percent of the 
money spent for work by outside contractors 
congress in 1983 directed cdc to conduct a series of studies of 
the effects of vietnam veterans exposure to agent orange and its 
primary component dioxin 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said cdc awarded two 
major contracts for interviews and examinations of veterans before 
it had developed approved methods to accurately identify agent 
orange exposure using military personnel records 
as a result cdc was unable to have the contractors start work 
on the agent orange study and paid the contractors 66 million 
for down time it caused the contractors and for work that was not 
needed to do the studies the gao report said 
cdc completed portions of its study but canceled a major one 
aimed at determining if there was a statistically significant 
relationship between exposure and veterans health it said it 
could not use military records to accurately determine exposure 
the money was part of larger contracts cdc awarded to research 
triangle institute in north carolina and lovelace medical center in 
new mexico the contracts were to interview veterans conduct 
psychological reviews and do medical exams 
a spokeswoman for the cdc in atlanta gail lloyd said the 
agency had not seen the report and had no comment beyond what was 
included in it the gao report said cdc officials who were not 
identified defended the contracts and said they were not awarded 
prematurely they said that at the outset in 1983 cdc stated that 
many of the proposed methods were untested pilot study assessments 
were required and a recommendation not to proceed might be 
necessary 
the gao responded that the cdc contracts should have included 
options to halt the work

threats and enticements to defect 
tarnished a cambodian dance troupes fiveweek us tour 
organizers said saturday 
the company is scheduled to return to cambodia on monday without 
five of its 36 members four performers defected and star dancer 
yim devi has a visa to remain in the united states until december 
he reportedly hopes to stay in the country to study 
the united states does not recognize cambodias 
vietnamesecontrolled government although us relations with 
phnom penh and vietnam have improved recently 
the troupe the first cambodian artists invited to the united 
states since 1971 performed 1000yearold classical dances in los 
angeles seattle washington dc new york and other cities 
the performances earned good reviews but organizers at a news 
conference in bangkok saturday said the tour was marred by 
attempts to politicize an artistic event 
ouk socheath a dean at phnom penhs university of fine arts 
said the group was continually harassed by a few members of the 
cambodianamerican community many of whom strongly support 
noncommunist rebels seeking to overthrow the government 
the two main rebel groups are joined by the communist khmer 
rouge which brutalized the country during its rule from 197578 
and all but wiped out traditional arts such as classical dance 
characterized by sensual fluid movements of the body and hands 
john mcauliff and eileen blumenthal us organizers of part of 
the tour said a small number of cambodianamericans followed the 
troupe around the country as part of a defection campaign 
one cambodian allegedly tried to kidnap devi in new york and 
others of the troupe received threats ms blumenthal said 
she said there also was an unusual number of loveatfirstsight 
marriage proposals apparent efforts to lure dancers to defect one 
member of the company claimed that three women fell into his arms 
declaring love 
the american organizers were accused by some of blocking access 
to the dancers to prevent defections the us group lawyers 
committee for human rights said it had expressed concern and urged 
state department interviews of each dancer 
all members of the company were interviewed by the state 
department and immigration and naturalization service to determine 
whether any wished to remain in the united states 
mcauliff and blumenthal said it was necessary to restrict some 
access to the beleagured company near the end of its tour 
earlier this year three members left the troupe while it was 
touring europe 
proeung chhieng director of the universitys dance division 
said the defections would present some small difficulties but 
said the company expected to continue to travel abroad including a 
scheduled december visit to india 
he said the defections had taken a toll on the small company 
which began to revive classical dance after vietnamese troops drove 
out the khmer rouge in 1979 
the organizers said more than 15000 people attended peformances 
during the us tour

on windless days western washingtons 
majestic mount rainier sometimes is obscured by smog from the 
jammed traffic and smokestacks below 
and in many places across the state housing tracts and shopping 
malls seem to be marching across forest and meadow 
that angers a lot of people and many blame the states rapid 
growth residents will decide how to deal with their concern nov 6 
when they vote on a citizen initiative that would sharply restrict 
development throughout washington 
initiatives aimed at correcting perceived environmental ills are 
on the ballots of several states as a result of petition drives 
among them 
california has four measures that would control emissions 
pesticides offshore oildrilling and logging 
oregon voters will decide whether to require recyclable 
packaging and whether to shut down a nuclear power plant 
south dakota has initiatives to curb mining and regulate large 
garbage dumps 
missouri voters are considering whether to control development 
along 52 waterways 
arizona has an initiative to spend 20 million a year on 
wildlife habitat and open space protection 
minnesota voters will decide whether to dedicate 40 percent of 
proceeds of the state lottery to protecting the states natural 
resources 
new york which doesnt have citizen initiatives has on the 
ballot a 1975 billion bond issue to acquire land for preservation 
and to help close aging landfills promote recycling and otherwise 
improve the environment 
in washington gov booth gardner and other political leaders 
contend the development initiative is too rigid and could crimp the 
economy in a myriad of ways they want voters to give the 
legislature a chance to complete growth control legislation begun 
ths year 
supporters of initiative 547 say government is too slow and 
its up to citizens to protect the environment 
we came here 20 years ago for the clean air the open spaces 
the breathtaking view of mount rainier but its disappearing fast 
i get real frustrated at the lack of action by our leaders said 
marcia baird an olympia homemaker who intends to vote for the 
measure 
the initiative would force local governments to curtail 
development of farm forest and wetlands and impose other land use 
limits it also would require developers to pay impact fees to 
governments for the cost of providing services to their projects 
such as new streets road widening freeway ramps and schools 
opponents argue the state can ill afford the proposals 20 
millionayear administration cost in a rapidly cooling economy 
but supporters say inaction carries a heavier price to the 
environment 
opponents also assert the measure was written hastily and would 
be subject to numerous court challenges 
no poll results have been reported on how the public feels about 
the initiative and campaigning for and against is only just 
getting under way supporters have raised 162000 so far while 
opponents have raised 12 million mostly from developers and 
large businesses 
many politicians and government regulators say citizens are too 
quick to use initiatives to seek simple and often illusory fixes 
to complex problems they argue the public wrongly labels careful 
legislative deliberation as procrastination 
we dont feel you can regulate on feelings we believe you 
have to regulate on some sort of science said james wells a 
pestmanagement official with the california department of 
agriculture 
among controls in californias sweeping big green initiative 
would be a ban on pesticides suspected of causing cancer 
agricultural interests contend the move would severely damage the 
states economy which relies heavily on agriculture 
james p lester a colorado state university political scientist 
who has written extensively on environmental policy at the state 
level said there is a growing perception out there that 
representative democracy is failing when it comes to the 
environment and i think direct citizen action through initiatives 
is just beginning 
twentysix states the majority in the west permit citizen 
initiatives the national conference of state legislatures says 
when it comes to environmental issues at the ballot box 
voters will vote first and think about costs later said brett 
bader a washington state economics and political consultant who is 
leading the campaign against the slowgrowth initiative 
but the indications are that voters do recognize there are costs 
and are willing to pay them said larry morandi an official with 
the conference of state legislatures 
from the polls weve seen people are willing to pay more 
there is that awareness that environmental protections arent 
free he said

drug traffic in the pacific basin is growing like a 
threatening typhoon us attorney general dick thornburgh 
warned recently to view statistics in japan its more like a 
drizzle 
on friday the justice ministry announced its cocaine haul for 
1989 302 pounds thats 64 times the total taken the year before 
208 grams or about a half pound 
this year a record has already been set with the seizure of 
522 pounds of cocaine in a yokohama warehouse in february 
about 180250 pounds of cocaine were seized in the united states 
last year according to government figures 
japan has been very good about keeping hard drugs from the 
west out in the past it has been able to do that fairly 
successfully because borders were closed and there wasnt any 
internal market for them said patricia steinhoff a university 
of hawaii sociologist 
since the problem is so new and substance abuse of any kind is 
such a private matter in japan neither japanese police nor the 
us drug enforcement administration can accurately say how many 
people use cocaine 
last year 88 people were arrested for cocainerelated offenses 
according to the justice ministrys annual report on crime for 
crimes involving other drugs 340 people were arrested 
we dont have one clue how many addicts are out there stan 
furce who operates the deas oneman bureau in tokyo told the 
japan times recently 
thats a real dilemma for those trying to get people 
interested in the problem because you cant go out and get real 
facts and real figures to say the problem exists 
also familiar us techniques such as undercover sting 
operations seizing assets of suspected drug traffickers and plea 
bargaining are not practiced in japan laws against laundering 
money dont exist in japans secretive banking system 
while the justice ministrys report emphasized growing cocaine 
use in japan other drugs have been reported on the rise as well 
seizures of heroin last year for example totaled 61 pounds up 60 
percent 
methamphetamine or speed is booming in japan known as 
shabu it flows freely in a nation where stimulantloaded 
energy drinks are regularly advertised on television 
manufactured in bootleg labs in taiwan and korea shabu is 
mostly sold by japans yakuza or organized crime groups more 
than 16600 people were arrested last year for using shabu 
japan is likely to be viewed as a golden opportunity for drug 
traffickers its rich it has a history of use of stimulants 
said a us official who toured asia with thornburgh in september

the early word in ohio was that cincinnati 
mayor charles luken was a sure bet to succeed his father in the 
us house and keep the seat in democratic hands 
that was before the republicans came up with a dream candidate 
j kenneth blackwell a conservative black who himself once was 
cincinnati mayor 
now blackwell and luken are locked in a tight race for the seat 
that seventerm democrat thomas luken hoped to pass on to his son 
each candidate claims his internal polls show him leading 
blackwell is among three black congressional candidates hoping 
to become the first black republicans in the house in 56 years his 
party is sparing no expense to help him out 
appearing on his behalf have been george bush barbara bush dan 
quayle oliver north and jack kemp until recently blackwells boss 
at the department of housing and urban development 
people in this district are offended that these 
insidethebeltway celebrities are telling working people who to 
vote for says luken 
luken is whining about the fact that the republican party has 
targeted this race as a very very important race counters 
blackwell 
the race is about whos running to be part of washington and 
whos running to change it says luken who wants to get up 
there and shake up things 
blackwell says his opponent would be part of the problem in 
washington he would get along by going along 
what you really have here are two establishment candidates 
says ohio state university political scince professor herb asher 
blackwell and luken were allies when they served together on the 
cincinnati city council they agree on issues such as cutting the 
capital gains tax giving presidents lineitem veto power and gun 
control both oppose abortion but blackwell won the endorsement of 
the right to life organization 
blackwell also snagged the endorsement of cincinnatis dominant 
daily newspaper the enquirer which said he would be a national 
figure from the day of his election 
the tone of the campaign has been harsh and each candidate has 
blamed the other for the turn it has taken 
blackwell accused luken of politicking on taxpayers time by 
making longdistance calls from the mayors office to washington 
luken anticipated the allegation and reimbursed the city months 
before blackwell made the charge 
luken said blackwell leveled the allegation because he thinks 
ive got him on a possible federal election commission violation 
the ohio republican party is paying for slick directmail 
literature and the national republican congressional committee is 
supplementing blackwells staff luken has asked the fec to rule on 
whether republicans exceeded the partys legal limits 
blackwell has been criticized by local black leaders for 
opposing the 1990 civil rights act to pick up political support 
frank allison president of the cincinnati chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people said 
blackwell sold his soul for a mess of votes 
blackwell accused allison of insulting my parentage and 
integrity saying the bill would impose an unfair quota system 
blackwell said he agrees with the bills goals but not with its 
way of achieving them and luken largely shares that view 
my position is more in line with the presidents that there 
is a better civil rights bill out there luken said 
retiring rep thomas luken has been an electoral exception in 
the republicandominated congressional district that includes part 
of cincinnati and suburban hamilton county 
he held the seat while voters were choosing republicans for 
county offices the countys other congressional seat and the 
presidency 
theres nothing easy about winning for democrats in this 
county said democratic county cochair don driehaus 
twothirds of the districts voters live in the suburbs small 
towns and rural delivery routes between cincinnati and the indiana 
border 
middleclass whites of german descent and transplants from 
appalachia are the largest voter blocs black voters are about 14 
percent and in a very very close race thats a significant 
number said blackwell 
hes confident he can pry away some of the votes that used to go 
to thomas luken 
but charles luken thinks hell pull more than half of the black 
vote 
race is not a central issue of the campaign but it will be a 
factor said asher the political science professor 
blackwell is not the candidate of the poor and the underclass 
and the rainbow coalition hes the republican candidate who 
happens to be black asher said

the desegregation of swimming 
pools toilets and other facilities once reserved for whites has 
changed little for millions of blacks who still face prejudice 
poverty and hopelessness 
repeal of the separate amenities act on oct 15 was another step 
toward president fw de klerks promised end to apartheid 
whites only signs were one of its most potent symbols 
black leaders applaud the end of segregated facilities but they 
say prejudice is not disappearing and blacks still are excluded 
from many aspects of life few whites appear willing to live with 
blacks and there are few signs that racial attitudes are changing 
they say 
the sowetan south africas leading black newspaper reported 
disillusionment among blacks because their lot has failed to 
improve with the scrapping of apartheid laws 
the change they thought was upon them is now evaporating 
the paper said 
we do not doubt de klerks sincerity in wanting a new 
dispensation for this country we however wonder if this country 
has the capacity to achieve this for the government and white 
society at all levels are still riddled with racism 
sy makaringe a black journalist who used what had been a 
restricted swimming pool on the day the law was repealed said 
white attitudes had not changed 
it was clear that for local whites my presence was a hard 
pill to swallow he said two white men who were in the pool 
left immediately after seeing me 
zach de beer leader of the white antiapartheid democratic 
party agreed that ending apartheid laws was not enough he said 
blacks and whites must live together and share every aspect of 
life 
positive steps must be taken to bring people together in 
sport recreation and society he said 
many leaders both black and white admit privately they dont 
how to get the races together 
antiapartheid leaders say that despite the repeal of apartheid 
laws most blacks still live in terrible poverty confined to black 
townships with little or no hope of improving their lives 
black leaders say winning the right to use a public toilet is 
meaningless if you remain a secondclass citizen in a world of 
white privilege they contend that economic inequality will 
preserve de facto apartheid 
whites control the economy and some whites are certain to use 
their wealth to preserve segregation 
local councils controlled by the proapartheid conservative 
party intend to exclude most blacks from public facilities by 
imposing membership or user fees blacks cannot afford some 
observers say whites will retreat into expensive private clubs and 
other restricted facilites 
the conservative party holds that blacks and whites cannot live 
together in peace party leaders demand a white homeland and accuse 
de klerk of trying to destroy whites 
fw de klerk is acting like a despot and an unscrupulous 
dictator conservative official andries du toit said 
government leaders and others say any attempts to preserve 
unofficial apartheid will lead to confrontation and threaten 
efforts toward a political solution to racial problems the 
government has said it will oppose local councils that try to 
preserve racial segregation 
the strategem of erecting financial barriers to keep blacks 
out will be seen for what it is racism in a different guise 
said the star a leading antiapartheid newspaper black people 
will hammer at the doors if they are not opened graciously they 
will batter them down if they not opened to all black leaders 
criticize the government for not ending all restrictions 
immediately some major apartheid laws remain in effect including 
the group areas act which segregates living areas and population 
registration act which classifies south africans by color 
de klerks government is wary of moving against the group areas 
act for fear of offending whites who are apprehensive about changes 
already made 
plans to open white schools to blacks have made little progress 
and officials say lack of funds is delaying hospital integration 
de klerk has said registration by race will end only when black 
and white leaders agree on a new constitution

abortion rights advocates say a massachusetts 
judges dismissal of drug charges against a woman whose son was 
born with cocaine in his system will help their fight 
until last week a pregnant woman in massachusetts who abused 
drugs or alcohol faced the possibility of criminal charges if her 
abuse harmed her fetus 
but in a 19page decision a superior court judge outlined 
constitutional privacy rights for pregnant women in a ruling that 
could influence other judges in massachusetts and elsewhere she 
said the state could not pursue charges against pregnant women that 
it did not bring against other people 
no court has ever reached this constitutional issue before 
said lynn paltrow an american civil liberties union lawyer in new 
york 
the aclu and several womens groups promised to cite the 
massachusetts decision in at least six other cases pending in 
states including texas illinois and florida 
this will appear in every brief in every prosecution 
nationwide said nancy gertner a lawyer who represented 20 
different groups interested in the massachusetts case 
the prosecutors in the cases say their goal is to discourage 
pregnant women from drug abuse and similar ills that would cause 
her and her fetus harm 
but plymouth county superior court judge suzanne delvecchio 
cited alternatives to prosecution of women whose habits hurt their 
fetuses such as education and free medical care 
by imposing criminal sanctions a woman may turn away from 
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered she wrote 
in throwing out the case against 24yearold josephine 
pellegrini a mother of three delvecchio also said that government 
should not interfere with the intimate and fundamental bond 
between a woman and the fetus she bears 
this court will not permit the destruction of this 
relationship by the prosecution she said 
pellegrini of brockton had been indicted by a plymouth county 
grand jury in september 1989 on charges of distributing cocaine to 
a minor and cocaine possession a drug screening by doctors found 
cocaine in the urine of her son nathan born july 2 1989 
a leading opponent of abortion said delvecchios decision 
highlights the need to overturn the landmark supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion 
im sure nobody in the country ever expected roe vs wade 
meant to protect a womans right to inflict illegal drugs on an 
unborn child said ruth pakaluk president of the massachusetts 
citizens for life 
one of the reasons this whole area of law makes no sense is 
if it is legal to kill an unborn child how on earth can it be 
illegal to inflict a little harm she continued as long as 
abortion on demand is the law all the rest of this is 
schizophrenic 
pakaluk and her colleagues argue a fetus is a human being and 
should enjoy the freedoms and protections of everyone else 
the protections of a fetus shouldnt be superior or hostile to 
the interests of a pregnant woman countered joyce cunha 
associate director of the abortion rights group masschoice 
womens advocates say the fetal rights cases are critical 
because once a pregnant woman is held liable for some damage to her 
fetus the door will be wide open for regulating her every move 
aclus paltrow said states might try to dictate what she eats 
where she works and whether she can change the cat litter cat 
feces sometimes carry a disease organism that can be harmful to 
fetuses 
abortion rights advocates acknowledge delvecchios ruling does 
not carry beyond her county jurisdiction but with no other written 
guidance on the subject it carries unusual weight 
the absence of any decision like this meant every prosecutor 
nationwide could decide how to reinterpret common law gertner 
said it was anarchy every politically ambitious prosecutor 
could decide this would be his contribution to the drug war 
in greenville sc this month a woman who gave birth to a 
cocaineaddicted baby was sentenced to 10 years in prison after 
authorities said she repeatedly failed to complete drug programs 
designed to help her overcome her problems 
on the same day that mother pleaded guilty to charges of child 
neglect a spartanburg county magistrate ruled the states child 
neglect law can be applied to an unborn fetus in the case of a 
woman whose baby boy was born with symptoms of heroin addiction

a prosecutor urged jurors today to 
use their common sense and deliver an obscenity conviction against 
three members of 2 live crew for a nightclub performance of their 
bawdy rap music 
this was a plain simple nasty act assistant state 
attorney pedro dijols said in closing arguments thats all it 
was its unbelievable they can come in here with a straight face 
and tell you something different 
he urged jurors to review two tapes of the performance even 
though prosecution witnesses had difficulty deciphering their own 
recordings 
after quoting some of the miami groups profane lyrics dijols 
asked how can you say its not offensive 
defense attorneys for the three defendants also were delivering 
closing arguments today and the sixmember jury was expected to 
receive the case this afternoon 
jurors must balance the defense testimony of a professor who 
said 2 live crew performs with artistic integrity and a sense of 
history against a detectives report that the group promoted 
indecent behavior at the club 
group leader luther campbell and members chris fresh kid ice 
wongwon and mark brother marquis ross were arrested on 
misdemeanor obscenity charges after an adultsonly concert june 10 
in nearby hollywood the three face up to a year in prison and 
1000 in fines if convicted 
broward county sheriffs detective debbie werder spent four 
hours on the witness stand friday attempting to translate a 
scratchy often inaudible tape she made of the groups show 
jurors burst into laughter when werder described the type of 
dancing she saw at the concert as humping three jurors laughed 
so hard that they cried and the prosecution asked for a short 
recess after the break werder testified a lot of couples were 
dancing like they were having intercourse 
the jury also heard henry louis gates jr a professor of 
english literature at duke university and literary critic of black 
art and culture describe 2 live crews lyrics as an art form 
called signifying 
signifying is a form of rhythmic teasing and cajoling often 
peppered with lewd or offcolor remarks that can be meant as insult 
or compliment said gates whose book the signifying monkey won 
last years american book award 
it was the way the black people could fight against the 
oppression of their slave masters said gates who is black and 
rapping is a contemporary form of signifying 
theres no call to violence here what you hear is great 
humor great joy and great boisterousness he said its a 
joke its a parody and parody is one of the most venerated forms 
of art

the young secretarys family first thought something 
was amiss when she didnt return home for dinner later her body 
was found with 29 stab wounds 
so began the mystery of via poma which has capitivated 
italians for more than two months with its lurid twists and host of 
suspects and possible motives 
in a country where people have become hardened to daily mafia 
killings the murder of 21yearold simonetta cesaroni seems to 
have struck a nerve by exposing the vulnerability of ordinary 
italians 
you have a nice pretty girl from the suburbs going to work in 
the middle of the summer while dreaming of going to the seashore 
said sociologist franco ferrarotti of the university of rome 
instead she ends up in the cemetery the victim of a brutal 
killing shes seen as a sacrificial lamb 
nearly every day newspapers report some new development or plot 
in the via poma case named for the small street in romes 
bustling prati neighborhood where the murder took place 
most murder cases in italy receive standard coverage on crime 
pages of local newspapers and quickly fade away but this one has 
ingredients to set it apart the shock value of its savage 
brutality the hint of sex disappearing evidence mysterious blood 
stains and a range of suspects 
ms cesaroni was found murdered the night of aug 7 in the 
offices of a youth hostel association where she worked 
it was to have been her last day of work before joining the rest 
of her friends and family and most of the rest of italy for the 
traditional august holidays 
when she didnt come home for dinner her family sensed 
something was wrong and her sister and others went to the office 
they found ms cesaronis naked body lying in a pool of blood she 
had been stabbed 29 times with a paper cutter 
there was no sign of sexual abuse investigators said ms 
cesaroni apparently knew her assailant or assailants 
three days after the murder police announced the arrest of 
pietro vanacore the 58yearold doorman and janitor at the 
building this might have closed the case but after 20 days in 
jail vanacore was released a court ruled there was insufficient 
evidence to hold him 
newspapers immediately focused on another suspect ms 
cesaronis employer but he had an alibi 
the case apparently rests now on blood stains found on the door 
of the office investigators said the blood is apparently that of 
the assassin nineteen people including the doorman and his wife 
have been ordered to submit to dna tests to see if their blood type 
matches the stains 
police still have not figured out the motive was it sex drugs 
a love affair 
if the police magistrates judges and press had conspired to 
make an interesting case they couldnt have done any better than 
this one ferrarotti said this is a fantastic story you need 
an agatha christie to figure it out 
but the newsmagazine lespresso suggested the murder was a sign 
of a a new terrible sickness in our society that could lead 
any of the most ordinary people to commit such an act 
could it be lespresso asked that the crime was committed by 
the nextdoor neighbor the friend the colleague or the 
acquaintance one meets regularly in the elevator

the united states is shifting 
several hundred of its best tanks from europe to saudi arabia to 
counter iraqs battleseasoned armored units 
the us tanks are better able to withstand chemical and nuclear 
attacks but their guns still may not have the range of those on 
iraqs best tank 
the advanced m1a1 main battle tanks equipped with a more 
powerful 120mm gun will be in saudi arabia by the end of the year 
replacing older m1s that were brought from the united states a 
spokesman said 
the disclosure came as the first british challenger tanks 
intended for use by britains 7th armored brigade the desert 
rats rolled off a ship at an eastern saudi port the challengers 
also fire a 120mm gun and are protected by what british officers 
call the worlds best tank armor 
a statement by the us command in saudi arabia said the m1a1s 
were being drawn from storage areas in europe despite the 
transfer it said they would continue to be counted as part of the 
us strength level permitted under the pending treaty on 
conventional forces in europe 
the treaty to be signed by the end of this year calls for 
military cutbacks by both nato and warsaw pact forces 
we are proposing to our nato allies that these tanks continue 
to be counted under the cfe treaty thus leaving natos tank 
destruction a requirement under the treaty unchanged the 
statement said 
the soviets already had withdrawn some of their armored units 
from the european theater in keeping with president mikhail s 
gorbachevs 1988 promise of unilateral reductions 
us officials in saudi arabia said the transfer would cost 
about 48 million no personnel will be moved with the tanks they 
said 
the m1a1s will provide improved capabilities over the m1 
abrams tanks brought to saudi arabia with four us army units 
already deployed under operation desert shield 
a military spokesman maj doug bidle said he did not know 
which unit would receive the new tanks or what would be done with 
the m1s already in saudi arabia the m1s are used by the 1st 
cavalry and 2nd armored divisions and the 24th mechanized infantry 
division and 197th mechanized infantry brigade 
the latter two units already have an advanced version of the 
abrams tank fitted with improved firing systems for the standard 
105mm cannon 
the 3rd armored cavalry brigade currently on its way to saudi 
arabia is bringing its own m1a1 tanks bidle said 
the m1a1 has improved crew protection against nuclear 
biological and chemical attack and its 120mm cannon is more of a 
match for the iraqis best tank the sovietmade t72 
even so the us tanks could still be outgunned by the t72s 
which have a 125mm gun believed capable of hitting targets at up to 
3000 yards compared to the 2400yard range reported for the 
germandesigned gun carried by the m1a1 
both tanks as well as the challenger are protected by advanced 
armor first developed by the british and adopted by several 
countries 
the t72s are said to be more heavily armored in front where a 
headon shot would be likely to hit the iraqis according to some 
reports also are upgrading their older soviet tanks with better 
armor and other equipment

saudi arabia is buying millions of 
surplus gas masks from eastern europe for areas considered in range 
of an iraqi chemical weapons attack officials said saturday 
the masks arriving aboard soviet anatov124 cargo planes are 
part of new civil defense plans that include air raid sirens and 
evacuation routes in the event of war 
officials were reluctant to discuss the full extent of the 
plans fearing jitters among the civilian population 
the sirens for example were installed two weeks ago but were 
not tested because they dont want to panic people said one 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
its basically a psychological measure you have to give the 
people something to make them feel better another official said 
officials said the kingdom started shopping for up to 4 million 
gas masks for both saudi citizens and foreign residents after 
saddam husseins forces invaded kuwait on aug 2 
manufacturers in britain and western europe did not have enough 
but the armies of the soviet union and east bloc nations were eager 
to sell they said it was not known how many gas masks will be 
available from eastern europe and the soviet union 
soviet troops being pulled out of eastern europe dont need 
chemical weapons masks said one official 
col saoud alzuneifer a civil defense official told the 
newspaper alriyadh this week that the masks will be available for 
about 90 each 
but for those who cannot afford the price the gas masks will be 
handed out free 
you cant expect a goatherd or a taxi driver to be able to 
afford to buy a gas mask said one official 
the bulk of the masks will be available near the border with 
kuwait and iraq but cities such as riyadh and dammam in the 
eastern province will also get them 
western and southern provinces in the kingdom of 12 million have 
been deemed out of range of any artillery or airplanes that iraq 
might use to try to deliver chemical weapons 
in the chemical attack on the iraqi kurdish village of halabja 
in march 1988 baghdad used airplanes flying in cropdusting style 
and barrels dropped from transport planes 
but military officials say iraqi planes would have trouble 
penetrating saudi radar and antiaircraft defenses 
short range artillery could drop shells near the border but 
they could be knocked out with patriot missile batteries officials 
say 
even if a plane or missile did get through gas would likely 
dissipate quickly in the hot dry climate they say 
saudi arabia is not the only nation gearing up to protect itself 
against a possible chemical weapons attack israel has begun 
nationwide distribution of gas masks

like many other firsttime drug offenders to 
go before a federal judge for sentencing mayor marion barry faces 
the prospect this week of being ordered behind bars for possessing 
crack cocaine 
even though he was convicted of only a misdemeanor figures 
compiled by the us sentencing commission show that the mayor has 
a good chance of being ordered to serve time 
the study showed that 395 percent of 370 defendants convicted 
in federal courts for the first time of simple drug possession 
between nov 1 1987 and march 1 1989 were imprisoned 
another 38 percent were ordered to serve weekends in local 
jails while undergoing drug treatment judges placed 522 percent 
on probation and the rest were not sanctioned at all 
federal prosecutors who obtained the misdemeanor drug possession 
conviction against barry last summer have not yet submitted their 
sentencing request to us district judge thomas penfield jackson 
but comments that barrys defense lawyer r kenneth mundy made 
friday at a hearing indicates that the probation officer who filed 
a presentence report in the case recommended a sentence ranging 
between two months and eight months in prison 
the mayor was convicted in august of simple possession by a jury 
that acquitted him of another misdemeanor count and deadlocked on 
another dozen charges including lying to a grand jury by denying 
under oath that he had used drugs 
under the law barry faces up to a year in prison when he goes 
before jackson on friday 
jackson is required to apply federal sentencing guidelines 
which establish ranges of prison time that depend upon the severity 
of the crime and other circumstances such as the degree of the 
defendants participation 
probation officer arthur carrington was assigned to conduct the 
presentence investigation and submit a report to jackson with a 
calculation of what prison term if any the guidelines call for 
the judge could disagree with carringtons calculation of the 
sentencing range 
mundy objected to language stating that the mayor had failed to 
accept responsibility for his criminal behavior stating that it 
would have been very perilous for the mayor to admit drug 
possession when prosecutors still are continuing their 
investigation of the mayor 
acceptance of responsibility would give the defendant a 
twopoint reduction from the offense score that is calculated under 
the guidelines 
mundys comments indicate that the probation office found that 
barry should not receive such credit thereby setting the offense 
score at six the base figure for possession of crack cocaine 
such a score would set the sentence range at zero to six months 
but mundy raised yet another objection this one to findings in 
the report that the mayor had obstructed justice 
the guideline formula calls for raising the offense score two 
points for defendants who intimidated witnesses suborned perjury 
destroyed evidence or otherwise obstructed justice 
a twopoint addition in barrys case would raise the offense 
score to eight thereby setting the sentence range at two months to 
eight months 
under the guidelines jackson would have to make a special 
finding to justify any sentence less than two months 
mundys comments did not indicate what evidence of obstruction 
of justice was cited by the probation office 
but one possibility is the trial testimony of convicted drug 
dealer charles lewis who told jurors he used crack cocaine in a 
downtown hotel with the mayor and during a vacation at the virgin 
islands 
lewis also testified that barry acquiesced when lewis told the 
mayor he would deny to a grand jury that he used drugs with the 
mayor 
the probation offices finding could be seized upon by 
prosecutors to support an argument that the mayor should be 
imprisoned us attorney jay b stephens has indicated he would 
make such a request

president bush is holding off on vetoing a 
sweeping civil rights bill while sending compromise language to 
congress in hopes of getting a measure he could sign 
administration officials said today 
white house officials today were sending congress a package of 
changes that addressed some of the principal objections of civil 
rights advocates whose legislation bush opposes 
in the meantime bush will hold off on his promised veto of the 
civil rights bill that arrived at the white house today from 
capitol hill officials said 
instead he is sending congress proposed amendments to the bill 
in hopes of getting a joint resolution to supplant the original 
bill 
assuming that we continue on this course it represents an 
effort by the president to try and make a currently unacceptable 
bill acceptable said bushs legislative liaison fred mcclure 
congressional opponents of an earlier white house proposal 
contended the administrations language would have focused on 
employer intentions rather than keying on whether certain 
employment practices themselves were discriminatory 
one of the key changes being offered according to an official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity was elimination of the word 
intended from what the white house had proposed earlier 
the bill that cleared congress on wednesday is the civil rights 
movements top legislative priority and would overturn six job 
discrimination decisions that raised a furor when the supreme court 
handed them down last year 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme cases of job 
discrimination 
the major conflict however has come over features that would 
make it easier to take employers to court over their employment 
practices 
bush has been saying these provisions are so harsh they would 
force companies to adopt hiring quotas something sponsors 
dispute 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was unclear if congress 
would approve changes now that it had rejected over the last nine 
months 
one sponsor sen james jeffords rvt said after speaking 
with bush on friday it was possible that followup legislation 
could ease white house concerns and be signed as a companion to the 
original bill 
there has been movement on both sides jeffords said 
meanwhile benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp said 
bush told him thursday by telephone that he was exploring ways to 
avoid a veto including passage of followup legislation 
civil rights demonstrators have paraded in front of the white 
house in hopes of pressuring bush to relent and sign the bill 
fitzwater said that the president certainly wants a strong 
civil rights bill he is committed to it lets erase this legal 
question and make it a true civil rights bill 
theres been nothing to change our belief that its a quota 
bill the only issue is is there any way to get it changed at this 
late date in a way that will be satisfactory the spokesman 
added

a judges upcoming ruling in an 
unprecedented custody struggle between a surrogate mother and the 
genetic parents of a baby boy may end only the first chapter of the 
bitter dispute attorneys said 
the decision by orange county superior court judge richard 
parslow is expected to be issued monday but both sides say it 
likely will be appealed leaving the future of the 4weekold child 
again hanging in the balance 
i know we wont win here but we will win in the appeals 
court surrogate anna johnson 29 said outside court last week 
echoing her attorneys pessimism about how parslow might rule 
although the appellate court would be asked to take the case up 
quickly there could be a delay of several months said diane 
marlowe one of ms johnsons lawyers 
ms johnson is seeking parental rights and a say in the boys 
upbringing although she is genetically unrelated to him genetic 
parents crispina and mark calvert insist they should be recognized 
as the sole parents 
the calverts who agreed to pay ms johnson 10000 to carry 
their testtube embryo have temporary custody of the boy they 
call him christopher but he remains without a legal name until 
custody is decided 
parslow has noted several times that this case differs from the 
famed baby m case of new jersey because the surrogate mother 
seeking custody in that case was also the babys genetic parent 
attorneys have said the calvertjohnson dispute could break new 
legal ground because a genetically unrelated surrogate never has 
sought custody 
in the sixday hearing that concluded last week ms johnsons 
attorneys tried to show she developed an unexpected but deep 
emotional attachment to the baby during the pregnancy that must not 
be severed 
the calverts offered evidence about the importance of the 
genetic link they also attempted to cast doubt on ms johnsons 
motives claiming she was motivated by a thirst for publicity and 
money not love of the child 
ms marlowe and partner richard gilbert have said they believe 
parslow will rule against their client on emotion rather than 
existing state law which they said recognizes the birth mother as 
the legal mother of a child 
we feel if the judge ruled on the law weve won the case we 
dont think the court has been able to do that and will try to 
create new law ms marlowe said friday 
i dont believe the case is being decided on emotion 
countered christian van deusen the calverts attorney the case 
is being decided on facts and what little law we have as 
guideposts 
parslow has conducted the case in a quiet and lowkey manner 
generally allowing attorneys leeway in questioning of witnesses and 
setting aside some court formalities 
van deusen noted that both he and harold laflamme the 
courtappointed attorney for the child have urged the judge to 
find that the evidence concerning genetics is the controlling 
evidence 
van deusen said friday he will probably appeal if the judges 
ruling fails to recognize certain major points 
most importantly we are asking him to find that as a matter 
of public policy genetic parents of a child have to be the legal 
parents of that child van deusen said 
the judge also should rule that someone cannot use false 
pretenses to obtain a unique genetic individual that a husband and 
wife have created 
ms johnson a single mother of a toddler and mrs calvert 36 
met while working as nurses at a santa ana hospital a hysterectomy 
prevented mrs calvert from carrying a child although she could 
produce ova

mikhail s gorbachev began last week by winning 
the nobel peace prize and closed it by persuading the legislature 
to approve his latest economic reform plan but tuesday through 
thursday werent so hot 
although the prize added luster to gorbachevs already shining 
global image it gave him little protection from domestic critics 
they accuse him of doing too little too late to appease the 15 
soviet republics and prevent them from leaving the soviet union 
the two largest republics russia and the ukraine stepped 
closer to breaking with the national government during the week 
the continuing disintegration of central authority may prompt 
gorbachev to rely more heavily on the sweeping executive powers 
entrusted to him last month by the national legislature 
but a bold assertion of emergency power could kill soviet 
democracy as it is being born and doom gorbachev to the fate of 
centuries of russian reformers who began their reigns with good 
deeds but ended them as tyrants 
gorbachev was jovial friday night after the supreme soviet 
legislature approved his moderate reform plan the plan would 
partially reverse decades of central planning allow the market 
rather than the government to set most prices and encourage 
private enterprise 
the preceding three days gave him plenty of reasons to growl 
however 
on tuesday boris n yeltsin the president of the russian 
federation criticized gorbachevs reforms as halfbaked and 
doomed to fail and steered his repoblic toward far more 
radical measures 
on wednesday grigory yavlinsky an architect of yeltsins 
reform package threatened to quit his job as deputy prime minister 
of russia because he said gorbachevs plan would trigger disastrous 
price hikes 
on thursday prime minister vitaly masol of the ukraine was 
forced to resign after widespread student protests that signaled a 
growing separatist movement in the second largest and potentially 
most troublesome soviet republic 
previously the ukraine had been relatively quiet compared to 
the baltic or caucasus republics 
on friday gennady filshin another russian deputy prime 
minister accused gorbachev of massive attacks on the 
republics right to control its economy and politics 
gorbachev might have expected better receiving the nobel prize 
he had commented monday was an appreciation of the cause we are 
all working for 
but the democratic forces gorbachev helped release are now 
working far faster than he is to decentralize economic and 
political power 
since yeltsin was elected russian president in may and his 
legislature declared sovereignty russia has set the tone for 
relations between the central government and the republics nearly 
all of them have declared some form of independence or sovereignty 
now yeltsin and gorbachev are at loggerheads when cooperation is 
crucial the 66page economic reform document approved friday 
leaves it to the republics to enact laws to enforce the plans 
russia and the other republics however show little sign of 
cooperating 
on the other hand gorbachev has a fallback position he has 
broad executive powers that the legislature granted him last month 
to carry out the economic reforms 
on oct 4 in his first decree under the powers gorbachev 
authorized stiff fines for businesses that do not meet delivery 
quotas under the central planning system the very system he says 
he wants to do away with 
but its an open question whether gorbachev has either the 
authority or the means to enforce that decree or any others he may 
promulgate 
in the current political situation the economy is not going 
anywhere you can issue decrees but no one will pay attention 
said ed hewett a soviet economic expert at the brookings 
institution in washington 
even if you produced a very detailed plan that was very 
radical but gave it to a government that has a reputation of doing 
nothing little could happen hewett said 
an agency will be created to monitor compliance with delivery 
quotas according to two top gorbachev economic aides nikolai 
petrakov and leonid abalkin but the president might rely on the 
kgb security police or armed forces to enforce the decree and that 
could kill the democratic reforms 
using the police to bolster central planning does not seem a 
likely way to foster a decentralized market system 
gorbachev is not the first kremlin leader to face the dilemma of 
reform versus authority according to the emigre russian historian 
alexander yanov whose articles have been published this year in 
the soviet press 
czar ivan iv began his rule in 1533 by fostering democracy and 
convening a parliament called the zemski sobor things fell 
apart though and he resorted to terror becoming known to history 
as ivan the terrible 
peter the great opened russias window on the west in the 
early 18th century and reformed nearly all aspects of the 
government but to do so he employed extreme personal power and 
some historians call him a despot 
alexander ii the czar liberator freed russian serfs in the 
1860s but his tough measures against dissent helped lead to his 
assassination in 1881 
gorbachev may have had a tough week but it looks like the 
coming winter could bring more cause for sorrow 
 
editors note bryan brumley the associated press bureau chief 
in moscow has covered soviet affairs since 1981

california financier a bruce rozet allowed 
numerous problems to run amok in the huge portfolio of 
subsidized apartments he managed said a judge who has upheld his 
suspension from federal housing programs 
administrative judge jean s cooper accused rozets company 
housing resources management inc of negligence and arrogance 
tenants security deposits were misused and the department of 
housing and urban development was improperly billed for rent 
subsidies when apartments were vacant the judge concluded 
thursday 
rozet is chairman of the firm and deane earl ross is chief 
executive telephone listings for rozet and his company could not 
be found in the los angeles area saturday but rozet a prominent 
democratic fundraiser earlier contended he was the victim of a 
partisan vendetta by the republican administration 
too many problems serious and still unresolved were created 
exacerbated and allowed to run amok the improper conduct of the 
corporation must be imputed to the top officials said cooper 
who also faulted huds oversight of the company 
hud general counsel frank keating told the associated press on 
saturday were thrilled about the ruling this is the first of 
many actions that hud secretary jack kemp insists be taken to 
turn around the quality of living in lowincome housing 
coopers ruling came on an appeal from rozet and included an 
order that the suspension remain in effect until an ongoing 
government investigation of rozets business and any ensuing 
disciplinary proceedings are completed 
rozet and his affiliates were suspended from hud in january 
after nearly onethird of the 350 subsidized housing projects he 
held were found to have financial or physical problems federal 
officials had inspected property rozet managed in oklahoma and in 
the district of columbia rozet handles tens of thousands of 
subsidized apartments

parliament voted saturday to end 15 
years of leftist oneparty rule permitting competing political 
parties and secret balloting the state news agency reported 
the move could help break a stalemate in the 13yearold civil 
war that has killed some 600000 people 
proposals for a multiparty system previously were adopted by the 
ruling frelimo partys policymaking central committee approval by 
the peoples assembly mozambiques parliament had been expected 
the aim news agency said the changes adopted saturday cleared 
the way for new laws on the formation and registration of political 
parties 
under the changes the news agency said mozambiques 
constitution now calls for full national elections conducted by 
secret ballot previously elections were conducted by open voting 
the constitution now also says political parties must represent 
national groups which would forbid the forming of regional or 
secessionist parties aim said 
it says all parties would be expected to have a democratic 
internal structure to defend national interests and contribute 
toward peace and stability according to the news agency 
president joachim chissano said july 31 he wanted a multiparty 
system in time for parliamentary and presidential elections 
scheduled for next year he previously had opposed a multiparty 
system saying it would encourage tribalism and waste the countrys 
scarce resources 
chissano also has promised to end the civil war with the 
mozambique national resistance 
the government and the rebels have held a series of peace talks 
this year a multiparty system and new election laws are two key 
rebel demands 
frelimo has been the sole legal political party in the southeast 
african nation since mozambique gained independence from portugal 
in 1975 
the party was marxist but has undergone reforms in recent years 
and officially dropped its marxist label last year 
the partys central committee approved resolutions in august 
that suggested any new laws should prohibit parties set up on 
racial ethnic regional or religious lines 
the resolutions also suggested a new party require proven 
support from at least 100 people of voting age from each of the 
countrys 11 provinces

people have been jumpy around 
here ever since the big american bullfrogs arrived

its gracious homes and the venerable empress hotel was a genteel

loud outsiders that can even eat birds arrived 
and now things are getting worse the capital regional 
districts parks committee has been advised to brace for an 
american bullfrog population explosion this year 
its never been clearly established how the frogs got to

the opening congress of the democratic russia 
movement designed to rival the communist party got off to a rocky 
start saturday as one of the key players said he could not support 
a proposed founding charter 
the opening of the twoday congress in downtown moscow was 
attended by about 2000 delegates including legislators in the 
national and russian federation parliaments and members of the 
leningrad and moscow city councils 
nikolai travkin the founder of the democratic party which 
supports candidates who oppose the communist party said he did 
not support the formation of a yet another party travkin said he 
would prefer to see a loosely organized mass movement instead 
we will form an organizing structure to support candidates 
and print and disseminate newspapers travkin said in an opening 
speech at the congress 
he said he did not endorse a charter drafted by the two other 
groups that helped organize the congress the social democratic 
party and the christian democratic party 
travkin appeared to be hesitating at the last minute to subsume 
his own tightly disciplined organization into a larger party 
one delegate said that many of those attending the congress had 
formed their own small groups and were reluctant to give up their 
newfound independence after 73 years of communist rule 
people have a fear of parties said vyacheslav shostakovsky 
one of the leaders of the exodus from the communist party during 
the summer 
we are fighting against this antiparty sentiment he said 
predicting that the democratic russia movement would end up at 
least in the short term as just that a movement rather than a 
formal party 
lev ponomarev deputy chairman of the organizing committee said 
in the first speech at the congress that the democratic russia 
movement considers itself as an alternative to the soviet 
communist party 
ponomarev said the movement does not see itself as a new 
political party but rather a grouping of democratic forces opposed 
to mainstream communism 
he said a de facto twoparty system had emerged in russia the 
largest of the 15 soviet republics following elections in march 
1989 
neither the movement nor the groups that make it up comes close 
to the soviet communist partys membership rolls of 18 million 
on the one side is the conservative wing of the communist 
party on the other side are the democratic alliances he said 
noticeably absent from the meeting were the three most important 
politicians who quit the communist party during the summer russian 
federation president boris n yeltsin moscow mayor gavriil popov 
and leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak 
a close aide to yeltsin oleg rumyantsev said that yeltsin was 
ill and could not attend the congress but that he supported the 
movement 
popov delegated one of his deputies mikhail schneider to read 
a speech strongly endorsing the democratic russia movement 
the delegates included representatives of grassroots movements 
and new political parties including the interregional deputies 
group consisting of radical reformers in the national legislature 
and the christian democratic movement 
the soviet state news agency tass said the movement had the 
potential of becoming the second largest political force in the 
country after the communist party

a year after 11yearold jacob 
wetterling was seized by a masked gunman volunteers touched by the 
disappearance of the kidnapped boy are planning a candlelight vigil 
and authorities are seeking to play down reports of a new suspect 
stearns county sheriff charlie grafft said the background of the 
newest suspect a man seen in st joseph about three weeks ago is 
being checked 
the st cloud times in a story published saturday quoted him 
as saying the suspect looks pretty promising this may be the man 
were looking for but he said saturday that he wasnt sure he 
had made such optimistic comments and added its just another 
lead 
fbi spokesman byron gigler in minneapolis said the man is among 
a handful of suspects the fbi still is investigating in all he 
said about 2000 people have been interviewed about jacobs 
disappearance 
jacobs mother patty wetterling also had a cautious outlook 
saturday saying i just have to look at it as just one more 
lead but about the sheriffs reported comments she said his 
spirits were up for sure it caught me off guard too 
grafft would give few details of the suspect other than that he 
had a car with outofstate plates and had been seen in this 
central minnesota community of 2200 
jacob disappeared a year ago monday snatched by a masked man 
with a gun who stopped him his brother trevor and a friend as 
they rode bikes home that evening along a deserted stretch of road 
the other boys say the man asked them their ages then told them to 
run into the woods or he would shoot 
as they fled the boys ooked back and saw the man grab jacobs 
arm 
thousands of fliers distributed nationwide and searches by 
hundreds of volunteers national guardsmen and federal state and 
local law enforcement officers failed to turn up a trace 
to mark the abductions anniversary the volunteers who 
organized the jacob wetterling foundation planned simultaneous 
candlelight prayer services sunday night here and in a minneapolis 
suburb 
in an interview last week mrs wetterling said she and her 
husband jerry became reluctant celebrities in the hopes the 
national publicity might help bring jacob back 
i think the thing thats hard for me right now is that jacob 
has become symbolic of all missing children and we have become this 
goofy false celebrity mrs wetterling said 
the bottom line is he is my son she said pounding her 
kitchen table with her fist as she blinked back tears and it 
hurts hes not a symbol hes jacob hes my son 
since the abduction children in st joseph stopped wanting to 
go out after dark 
not only had the abductor taken jacob physically but he stole 
something from us said gary degeberg chief financial officer of 
the jacob wetterling foundation an innocence we once had no 
longer exists 
the passage of time has weighed heavily on mrs wetterling 40 
her husband 42 and their children 
trevor now 11 missed 43 days of school last year he still 
spends nights in his parents bedroom on a foldout bed unable to 
sleep in the bedroom he once shared with his brother jacobs 
sisters amy 14 and carmen 9 also struggle for some normalcy 
the family has endured what authorities say are unfounded rumors 
that wettering had his son abducted a theory that mrs wetterling 
blames on suspicion of her husbands bahai religion combined with 
peoples need for a reasonable explanation 
passing the spot where jacob was kidnapped has been a daily 
hurdle 
we have to drive by that stupid spot anytime we want to go 
anywhere mrs wetterling said our choices are to stay in here 
for the rest of our lives or to get over it you get over it and 
you move on 
jacob wetterling foundation has volunteers coordinating a 
nationwide distribution of posters bearing jacobs picture and is 
offering a 200000 reward for his safe return at least 3000 
people nationwide have contributed to the reward fund degeberg 
said 
joseph lewis a high school counselor in rancho cucamonga 
calif is one volunteer who puts up posters speaks to church and 
civic groups and wears a button with the boys picture and the 
words jacobs hope 
lewis said he had researched the issue of child abuse but was 
overcome when he saw a tv talk show about jacobs case 
i could not eat that night i couldnt sleep that night the 
next morning i was getting ready for work and standing in the 
shower and sobbing he said i decided enough of the research 
i needed to do something i adopted jacob to work for 
the anniversarys approach brought a harsh prediction from john 
walsh who has become a spokesman for the parents of missing 
children since his 6yearold son was abducted and murdered in 
1981 
mrs wetterling said walsh told her pretty soon after this 
one year thing that everybody wants to call an anniversary hes 
going to be just another missing child 
i said no hes not she said he will never be just 
another missing child

americas cities should pattern neighborhood 
high schools after roman catholic schools and magnet public schools 
that have clear missions and aggressively shape student values 
says a study released saturday 
by reputation religious and specialpurpose public schools 
experience much greater success with lowincome students than o 
comprehensive zoned public schools we found the reputation 
justified concluded the study published by the rand corp a 
private nonprofit research organization in santa monica calif 
by contrast the typical high school here and in other cities 
has lost its support said the report high schools with 
character alternatives to bureaucracy 
they are so encrusted with rules and procedures that no one in 
them can work to his or her full potential it said 
catholic and specialty schools which the study collectively 
dubs focus schools unhesitatingly place burdens on their 
lowachieving students 
meanwhile adults at typical neighborhood schools agree not to 
demand too much in return for the students agreement not to cause 
trouble the study contended 
the result markedly higher scholastic aptitude test scores and 
graduation rates at the catholic and specialty schools studied 
compared with the two regular city high schools 
only onethird of students at the regular schools examined by 
rand took the sat a college entrance examination and their 
average score combined score was 642 on a scale of 4001600 just 
55 percent of students graduated 
by contract more than half of the students at the specialty 
public schools took the examination and averaged 715 sixtysix 
percent graduated at the catholic schools studied 85 percent took 
the sat and averaged 815 and 95 percent graduated 
the report urged new york and other cities to replace existing 
neighborhood schools with focus schools incorporating the virtues 
of catholic and specialty or magnet public schools 
such schools have clear missions control their own fate push 
low achieving students to their academic limits and dont hesitate 
to teach values like responsibility and reliability the report 
found 
the rand study contended that school choice and deregulation 
two pet reform ideas from the bush administration may help in 
clearing away external impediments to better education but 
catholic and specialty schools hold a key element missing in such 
schemes developing a coherent school mission and the individual 
character that appeals to students and teachers 
the 97page study examined 13 schools 10 in new york city and 
three in washington dc eight of those all in new york were 
studied indepth three were catholic high schools two were 
standard public schools two were specialty public schools focused 
on vocational or academic programs and one was a special school 
designed as a last chance for students who had failed in 
regular education 
it was written by researchers paul t hill gail e foster and 
tamar gendler 
we are not claiming that catholic or specialpurpose public 
schools would do as well with a random group of disadvantaged 
students as they do with those they now serve said hill 
but he said most regular school students would likely do better 
if they had the kind of strong direction and high standards that 
focus schools would provide 
robert terte a spokesman for the new york city board of 
education said friday that schools chancellor joseph fernandez had 
not had a chance to review the report and had no immediate comment 
the authors interviewed students teachers guidance counselors 
and other school personnel examined student records and conducted 
a questionnaire of 50 students per school 
as is usual with educational research the schools studied were 
not identified 
students in regular public schools were found lacking in 
motivation to follow rules or achieve academically because such 
schools fail to provide clear principles and goals according to 
the eeport 
the report rejected the widely held belief that public schools 
cant provide all its students the kind of topflight education 
available at the best private schools or public specialty schools

claude montanas summer readytowear show saturday 
showed minimum length and maximum clout 
montana who suffered grief for his first couture show for 
lanvin last january and then redeemed himself last july again made 
a big hit for his own house 
montana stayed with a striking short look with just a few long 
pants thrown in but his creative mastery shone with short white 
dresses suits shorts or bloomers and coats spangled with silver 
and mirror sequins 
the authority of a clothing sculptor was evident in strong 
silhouettes emphasizing full skirts or important toppers 
softer summer lines included the hooded silverbead embroidered 
wrap top over white faille bloomers or the baremidriff shorts 
outfit topped by a taffetawrap blouse 
montana directed the leggy look as a symphony of subtle 
simplicity placing fitted or swingy tops over full or narrow short 
skirts it all looked very wearable though some people might opt 
for slightly longer lengths 
zipper fronts and pockets standup decollete or military 
collars deep v decolletes often laced up gave the clothes 
terrific cachet 
montana did many closely fitted jackets just caressing the 
body but sometimes broke out into looser boleros 
some of his tiny trapeze dresses had a 1960s kennedyera appeal 
sleeveless with armholes cut deeply and squared in back they came 
in hot acidic silks of orange yellow or green with some peachy 
pink for good measure 
the models often topped these striking minimal dresses with 
little stiffened triangular scarves 
leather a favorite montana medium was softened up in 
sandyshaded buttersoft suede miniskirts but even the short 
black leather jackets looked more feminine than tough 
the collection literally shimmered with gold and silver touches 
like high gloves sparkling with sequins buglebeaded tunics or 
silvery lines on skirts 
jeanpaul gaultier took his audience to an evening garden of 
eden show introduced by a male adamfigure in long hair and little 
else his eve wore a butchy brushcut and snakes on her bra 
it was a rollicking jolly show friday for an audience that 
included diana ross and madonna who sports many of gaultiers 
costumes in her shows 
as usual the young iconoclast featured plenty of gags and gamey 
styles models included couples a pregnant woman and a 
whitehaired 70yearold who took a bow with gaultier 
a kind of stayloose crossdressing atmosphere prevailed 
fashion writer corinne labaume remarked 
gaultier offered plenty of unisex with pinstriped suits for 
women or men a male model wore bunchy shiny underpants with his 
neat pinstripe 
laughter broke out with an announcement to the adamandeve 
sinners by a background tree of knowledge youre condemned to 
wear gaultier forever 
trends included colorful print hooped minisuits with bright 
tights and rubber boots fancy embroidered vinyl matador boleros 
for men or women and multicolored bustier toppers or motorcycle 
jackets for men 
ideas there were but what will make it to the streets where 
gaultier gets a lot of his ideas and then mixes them up remains a 
qusstion mark

the house on saturday rejected a bill that 
would have permitted taxpayerfinanced abortions in the district of 
columbia 
though the bill applied only to washingtons city government 
the vote was a setback for abortionrights forces who had hoped to 
provoke a presidential veto on abortion just days before the fall 
elections 
they already had given up on sending president bush another bill 
to broaden the conditions under which any state could use federal 
medicaid money to finance abortion 
i cannot explain it other than that it was an antiabortion 
vote said rep henry hyde rill a leader of abortion 
opponents in congress there was a realization that it would be 
vetoed 
bush had threatened to veto the appropriations bill for the 
district of columbia government over its abortion provisions bush 
last year repeatedly vetoed spending bills for the entire 
governments health labor and education agencies as well as the 
dc government because they would have permitted taxpayer money 
to be used for abortions for poor women who were victims of rape or 
incest 
the vote was 211185 to reject a housesenate conference report 
on the dc appropriations which includes 460 million in federal 
aid in a total city budget of 4 billion only 22 republicans 
supported the measure 
the rejected dc bill would have permitted washingtons city 
government to use locally raised taxes for abortions in any cases 
it saw fit restrictions on use of federal money for abortions 
would have been eased to permit their funding in cases of rape or 
incest in addition to the current provision for cases where the 
womans life is in danger 
rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the dc appropriations 
committee attributed the loss to a combination of factors 
including abortion an unusual saturday session and anger at 
washingtons troubled city government 
dixon said abortionrights advocacy groups had not mobilized 
support on the bill and cited the absence of 38 house members who 
skipped saturdays session 
the measure was sent back to the house and senate conferees who 
could change the abortion provisions or send it back to the house 
unchanged dixon said he would talk with democrats and 
abortionrights republicans who voted against the bill before 
deciding his next step 
abortionrights forces meanwhile conceded defeat in their 
efforts to add broader abortion language to the big spending bill 
for the departments of health and human services labor and 
education and related agencies 
they had hoped to send the bill to bush with provisions 
expanding the exceptions under which medicaid money can be used to 
pay for abortions which currently permit abortions only when the 
mothers life is in danger they won passage of such provisions a 
year ago and while unable to override bushs veto they used it to 
draw attention to the issue 
but their plans were confounded when the senate approved an 
amendment to that section that would require a parent to be 
notified before a teenage girl obtained an abortion at any

the manager of the rocky flats nuclear 
weapons plant has been replaced amid revelations about management 
failures and employees charges that managers are risking unsafe 
conditions in a rush to restart the plant 
a consulting firm cermak fletcher associates inc of 
gaithersburg md has done a study for egampg inc the plant 
contractor in which it cites serious management problems at the 
plant in the last five months the associated press has learned 
rocky flats workers told the ap that things are even worse than 
the report indicates 
moreover documents obtained by the ap indicate visits by 
employees to the plant psychologist were up 660 percent since 
march 
in the past three years change at the plant has been 
prolonged arduous and capricious the report said 
consequently employee morale has suffered because individuals no 
longer know what is expected of them why the changes are 
occurring and are unable to have the time to recuperate before 
another crisis confronts them 
this eventually causes employees to simply wear out and go 
into a survival mode by adopting an indifferent attitude 
on friday egampg replaced plant manager phil warner who has 
headed the plant since the company took over its operation a year 
ago james o zane an egampg vice president took over as the 
plants acting general manager 
egampg gave no reason for replacing warner nor did the company 
say whether he would be reassigned 
plant officials turned down requests from the ap to interview 
warner and attempts to reach him by phone after the announcement 
were unsuccessful he did not return messages left on his answering 
machine 
egampg operates rocky flats for the federal energy department the 
plant 16 miles northwest of denver makes plutonium detonating 
devices for nuclear weapons 
plutonium production has been shut down since november 1989 
because of safety and environmental concerns a federal grand jury 
was convened in august 1989 to determine whether any laws were 
broken but it has issued no indictments 
wd reinhart whos in charge of independent quality assurance 
engineers at the plant cited serious management problems in a 
sept 20 memo to plant officials and he warned that failure to 
address the problems could lead to a derailment of restarting 
the plant 
experience supports a conclusion that comprehensive management 
controls were lacking in many areas of the resumption program he 
wrote even with the new resumption management approach under 
way the mindset has not changed for many of those responsible for 
implementation 
francis allhoff egampgs assistant general manager for 
administration and planning said in an interview various 
critiques have indicated that problems are continuing to exist but 
were taking action to correct them 
plant workers who asked that they not be identified for fear of 
retaliation told the ap that many of the improvements ordered have 
been downgraded from red line items or items of critical 
importance to concerns not requiring immediate attention 
in one case a worker filed a report saying radioactive 
contamination was leaking from one zone into another through 
improper ventilation systems and urged repairs that would take six 
months to two years 
the zones are pressurized areas separated by airlocks designed 
to reduce the chances of radiation escaping the plant 
the worker warned that the problem could cause about 30 workers 
to be contaminated with plutonium in the next 30 years but he said 
he was told the plant would restart without the repairs because the 
repairs would take too long 
in another instance a ventilation shaft was connected from an 
airlock to a supervisors office piping contamination into the 
room the error will not be fixed before the plant resumes 
operations early next year workers said 
allhoff expressed concern over the reports and urged employees 
with safety complaints to come forward so the problems can be 
fixed 
but the workers said they have been told they could lose their 
jobs if the plant is not allowed to resume plutonium reprocessing 
the workers also cite the case of jim stone a rocky flats 
employee dismissed several years ago after blowing the whistle on 
problems 
allhoff said no action would be taken against any worker he 
said he has not received any complaints from workers saying work 
records were falsified at the plant 
however he confirmed there have been disagreements between 
independent quality inspection teams and egampg employees over when 
the plant will be safe to resume operations 
i have been advised there have been disagreements i think 
most if not all have been resolved by our structured process he 
said but i cant tell you there are not some residual 
differences i think thats healthy 
quality inspection engineers said the system is not working 
because they previously were allowed to write deficiency reports at 
the plant which require action they report they were ordered to 
stop writing the reports when they found too many problems 
allhoff said workers are trying to adjust to new working 
conditions at the plant and problems were expected 
we have increased their staff budget and facilities 
allhoff said this is not at all uncommon in a situation like 
this 
allhoff said rocky flats has submitted a plan to resume 
plutonium reprocessing at the plant but declined to release the 
dates until it is approved by the energy department

guerrillas have called off a planned 
attack on the afghan capital suggesting that the two most bitter 
rivals in the resistance may have set aside their blood feud 
sources said saturday 
fundamentalist guerrillas stepped up rocket attacks on kabul 
early this month and were preparing a major offensive against the 
city of 15 million guerrilla and diplomatic sources said 
the more orthodox guerrillas however opposed the attack and 
planned to block it because they have nothing to neutralize the 
wellequipped afghan air force that protects the heavilyfortified 
city 
the offensive has been called off because of pressure from all 
sides said one western diplomatic source insisting on 
anonymity its not going to happen 
the attack was to be led by gulbuddin hekmatyar the most 
radical of the seven resistance leaders who is known for his 
ruthlessness and antiwest rhetoric 
sources say the change in plans indicates hekmatyar may have 
agreed to work more closely with the guerrilla commanders 
including rival ahmed shah masood to put pressure on president 
najibullah and his soviet backers to reach a settlement to the 
12yearold war 
when the last soviet soldiers pulled out of afghanistan in 
february 1989 the resistance predicted najibullahs government 
would fall within months and formed a governmentinexile to take 
its place 
but the afghan armed forces bolstered by an estimated 500 
million monthly in soviet weapons and supplies held their ground 
the governmentinexile became bitterly divided by feuds and 
murderous infighting and now is dismissed as moribund by its 
backers 
washington and moscow are reportedly closer than ever to an 
agreement that would extricate the superpowers from the conflict 
the pressure is increasing for the mujahedeen do something 
anything before next month when secretary of state james a baker 
iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze are scheduled 
to meet said one guerrilla source also speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
with the cold winter approaching the guerrilla commanders who 
control the weapons and territory inside afghanistan decided to 
take the matter in their own hands 
they know this is likely to be their very last chance said 
another western diplomat also insisting on anonymity the 
experts think they can wrap things up before the bakershevardnadze 
meeting and if that happens its all over 
at a meeting last week on the pakistanafghanistan border 40 
prominent field commanders agreed to plot strategy for a 
coordinated offensive against the provincial capitals rather than 
kabul 
afterward masood traveled to islamabad for the first time in a 
decade to meet with leaders of the governmentinexile and senior 
pakistani officials reportedly to try to patch up differences with 
hekmatyar details about the weeklong talks and masoods whereabout 
have been kept secret 
most guerrillas and diplomats question whether any rapproachment 
between masood and hekmatyar will last masood has repeatedly 
accused hekmatyars fighters of killing more of his fighters than 
government troops in the past 18 months 
others insist even a temporary truce could put increased 
pressure on the communist government to reach a negotiated 
settlement 
since the soviet pullout washington and moscow have intensified 
discussions on how to end the afghan war they have agreed that 
elections should be held to decide the countrys political future 
but still disagree on what role najibullah would play in an interm 
government 
washington insists that najibullah relinquish control over the 
military and intelligence agencies a demand that moscow and 
najibullah both reject

a presbyterian minister jailed for 
making an illegal trip to north korea was freed saturday in a 
possible gesture for better relations on the divided peninsula 
officials in communist north korea have stressed the release of 
jailed south korean dissidents as a key precondition for improved 
ties 
the rev moon ikhwan 72 was set free from a hospital in the 
southern city of chonju where he was admitted last week for 
treatment of high blood pressure and a heart ailment he was 
sentenced last year to seven years in prison 
he is old and is suffering a heart ailment which makes it 
difficult for him to continue prison life said moon jongsoo 
head of the chonju prosecutors office 
moon a bitter critic of the government of president roh 
taewoo was arrested early last year upon his return from a 
nineday trip to north korea the peninsula was divided in 1945 and 
the north has refused to give diplomatic recognition to its 
southern neighbor 
moon told the court he went to the north to promote unification 
prosecutors charged that he met with north koreans to stir up 
political unrest in south korea 
south koreans are banned from traveling to north korea without 
government approval 
the arrests of moon and several other south korean dissidents 
who visited north korea have created tension in domestic politics 
and also strained seouls relations with north korea moons 
release was viewed by some as a conciliatory gesture 
but a senior official at justice ministry who asked not to be 
identified said moon could be sent back to jail if he recovers 
from his illness 
moons release was purely out of humanitarian considerations 
and has nothing to do with the norths demand said the official 
the government has no plan to release other jailed dissidents 
including radical student leader im sukyung who attended a world 
youth festival in north korea in 1989 he said 
the release came a day after south korean premier kang 
younghoon returned from four days of talks with north korean 
officials in their capital of pyongyang 
despite a lack of definite agreements officials of both nations 
said the talks laid down a foundation for future talks while in 
pyongyang the south korean premier met with north korean ruler kim 
il sung

nearly 250 people have fled from a 
4squaremile area because of poisonous carbon monoxide that has 
been seeping from an underground coal mine fire 
the mathies coal co mine near finleyville southwest of 
pittsburgh has been on fire since wednesday evacuations began 
shortly after the blaze was discovered and were stepped up friday 
night and early saturday officials said 
stagnant air caused more of the odorless gas to linger near the 
mine said washington county emergency services spokesman phil 
garrow 
id compare it to standing right behind a bus in downtown 
pittsburgh garrow said when it was nice and blowing earlier 
it was great it carried the stuff away that has ceased 
about 25 people were evacuated late friday when air quality 
declined dramatically and 165 more were moved overnight another 
50 residents of the washington county community had left their 
homes since the underground fire broke out 
carbon monoxide levels jumped from 3 to 6 parts per million 
friday afternoon to 177 parts per million later in the evening 
garrow said 
earlier friday crews began sealing entrances to the mine in an 
effort to extinguish the underground fire national steel decided 
to give up on pumping water into the ground 
were going to try to cut off all the air national steel 
spokesman robert toothman said the decision was made that the 
best way to try to put out the fire and for the safety of everybody 
involved was to seal the mine 
toothman said sealing the mine would take several days and would 
involve closing three portal entrances four air shafts and 
numerous bore holes that have been drilled to gauge the extent of 
the fire 
evacuees will be able to return to their homes after the mine is 
sealed he said 
the fire which began burning more than 300 feet below ground 
sent plumes of smoke billowing from the mine entrances 
toothman said the fire could continue to burn for as long as six 
or nine months before it is completely smothered the 
45squaremile mine spreads under the hills west of the monongahela 
river toward interstate 79 south of pittsburgh

a federal judge rejected arguments that 
exxon corp shouldnt be put on trial for the exxon vadez spill and 
has ordered the oil giant to stand trial in april 
us district judge h russel holland refused the companys 
request to dismiss a fivecount criminal indictment stemming from 
the wreck of the tanker in march 1989 
the ship skippered by former exxon capt joseph hazelwood was 
sailing through icy waters of prince william sound when it struck a 
charted reef and dumped more than 11 million gallons of crude oil 
into alaska waters 
thousands of birds and marine mammals died commercial fishing 
seasons were disrupted and miles of shoreline were oiled it was 
the worst spill in us history 
at fridays hearing defense lawyers said federal pollution laws 
werent intended to be used to prosecute shipowners for the acts of 
a vessels captain and crew 
exxon lawyer patrick lynch also argued that because the tanker 
was owned and operated by exxon shipping it was wrong to name the 
parent company in the indictment along with the subsidiary 
its a case of mistaken identity lynch said 
both exxon corp and the shipping subsidiary are charged with 
criminal violations of the federal clean water act the refuse act 
the migratory bird treaty act the ports and waterways act and the 
dangerous cargo act 
lynch said exxon shipping is a separate company controlled by an 
independent board of directors drawing the parent company into the 
criminal case would needlessly complicate things he said 
it will turn this trial from a straightforward trial on 
maritime issues into a business school seminar on how 
corporations are managed 
but federal prosecutors say exxon dominates its subsidiary and 
makes all the important decisions for exxon shipping which the 
government called a corporate puppet on a carefully calibrated 
string 
holland denied the motions to dismiss as well as a series of 
other technical arguments by the companies including exxon 
shippings claims that crude oil is not a pollutant under the 
federal clean water act 
exxon shipping attorney edward bruce said the clean water act 
lists only waste products as pollutants the crude oil on board 
the exxon valdez was not a waste he said it was a 
commodity 
according to evidence from hazelwoods state trial the captain 
had ordered a change of course that put the exxon valdez in line 
with the reef then went below to his cabin after leaving an 
uncertified third mate in charge 
hazelwood has a history of treatment for alcoholism and 
drunkendriving arrests federal prosecutors have said exxon was 
aware of the captains prior treatment and the skippers alleged 
reputation for breaking company rules that ban alcohol aboard 
tankers 
hazelwood was acquitted in anchorage superior court of charges 
of operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol and 
felony criminal mischief he has appealed his misdemeanor 
conviction of negligent discharge of oil

a week of turmoil unlike any other in 
minnesota politics featured allegations that the gop candidate swam 
naked with teenage girls and countercharges that the democratic 
incumbent was behind the charges 
calling gov rudy perpich the supreme liar republican 
candidate jon grunseth took a liedetector test and prmmised to 
stay in the race 
perpich seeking to become the first minnesota governor to serve 
four terms maintained that he had no connection to grunseths 
accusers he also defended his earlier attacks on grunseth for 
withholding some payments to his former wife and for several 
property tax delinquencies 
the campaign one resident complained in a letter to the editor 
in the star tribune has become a choice between an accused 
attempted child abuser who is rich but has neglected to pay child 
support for his own children and a whining backstabbing 
pompous incumbent who is an accused blackmailer 
republican us sen rudy boschwitz complained of a style of 
politics that is unbecoming to minnesota 
we shouldnt seek to emulate texas or louisiana he said 
grunseth in rochester as part of a campaign swing around the 
state saturday warned that the current mudslinging could keep 
others from running for office 
had i known this was going to happen to me i would not have 
run for governor because of the ordeal his family is going 
through he said 
the allegations that threw the race into upheaval stem from a 
july 4 pool party nine years ago at grunseths home 
two women who attended the party when they were 13 and 14 years 
old respectively alleged in sworn statements that an apparently 
drunken grunseth encouraged them his 13yearold daughter nina 
and a 16yearold girl to join him for a nude swim 
one of the women said grunseth tried to pull down the strap of 
her swim suit and to touch her breast she also alleged grunseth 
offered her beer 
grunseth said one of his accusers had offered not to publicize 
the allegations if grunseth dropped out of the race the woman 
denied it 
as evidence perpich was behind the allegations grunseth pointed 
out that one of his accusers parents are democrats and their 
lawyer is a perpich supporter and former democratic state senator 
rudy perpich and his campaign have orchestrated this every 
step of the way grunseth charged these are lies rudy perpich 
knows they are lies but rudy perpich is himself the supreme liar 
and he will do anything to stay in office 
perpich has referred grunseths accusations to his lawyer for 
possible legal action and grunseth has asked the us attorney to 
determine whether there was a conspiracy to commit blackmail or 
extortion 
grunseths accusers while admitting their intent was to derail 
grunseths campaign said their effort was not orchestrated by 
perpich or his campaign 
when i learned he grunseth was running for governor the 
anger came back and i dont feel i could live with myself if i 
didnt say anything said elizabeth mulay 22 of san jose 
calif i dont care if hes a democrat or a republican hes a 
sexual abuser 
liane nelson 23 mulays cousin and now a sexual abuse 
counselor in boston said grunseths political success prompted her 
to come forward with her account of the incident 
nina grunseth now 23 denied the allegations and grunseths 
former wife called them bogus grunseth also obtained nearly 20 
affidavits from friends and business associates who said they saw 
no nudity when they were at the 1981 party 
on friday grunseth produced positive results of a liedetector 
test declared himself exonerated and returned to the campaign 
trail 
how many witnesses how many denials how many inconsistencies 
are enough in this court of public opinion grunseth asked

iraqis waited in long lines at gas stations 
saturday to stock up before gasoline rationing begins a diplomat 
described the rationing as the first bite of the unsponsored 
sanctions 
lines of 20 to 30 cars snaked outside gas stations throughout 
the iraqi capital a day after oil minister issam abdulrahim 
chalabi announced the rationing to conserve imported chemicals used 
in refining oil 
the rationing begins tuesday 
although iraq is a major oil producer it can no longer import 
the chemical additives it needs to make gasoline 
it is not known how long iraqs stores of the additives will 
last and more importantly how long those reserves can keep the 
motorized army functioning european diplomats said 
the government opened 57 centers in baghdad to distribute 
coupons allowing taxis 26 gallons of gasoline a week and private 
cars 13 gallons 
the sanctions have given their first bite to the iraqis 
said an asian diplomat based here 
the united nations imposed a trade embargo on iraq following its 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
diplomats said the gas rationing would have an immediate effect 
on prices of other consumer goods which already are spiraling 
prices of such commodities as cigarettes biscuits and canned goods 
rose 5 percent saturday from just the day before 
consumers complained that the rationing falls far short of 
needs 
three days of work a week and im finished said a taxi 
driver he said taxi drivers usually use 26 gallons in as little as 
two days 
the government is trying to discourage taxi travel between 
cities and large buses are being put into extra service 
some iraqis expressed bewilderment at the rationing 
during our war with iran there was a lot of talk about 
rationing but actually there was hardly any said another 
baghdad resident for the first time i had to take coupons for 
petrol in my country which is supposed to be sitting on top of 
petrol

regular hormone injections for men are more 
effective contraception than birth control pills iuds or condoms 
according to a oneyear study the drawback is being poked with a 
needle once a week 
a study published saturday found that the weekly injections of 
the hormone testosterone were a safe stable effective and 
reversible contraceptive the world health organizations study 
of 271 men in seven countries said there were minimum side effects 
the study reported in the lancet medical journal found the 
injections had an overall success rate of 992 percent more 
effective than the birth control pill 97 percent the intrauterine 
device 94 percent and substantially better at blocking pregnancy 
than condoms 88 percent 
although testosterone is the male hormone disruption of hormone 
levels reduces sperm production 
the men had to be injected for an average of four months before 
enough hormone built up in their bodies to work as an effective 
contraceptive after discontinuing the injections the estimated 
mean time to recover sperm concentration was 67 months it said 
the study was conducted among healthy men between 21 and 45 
years old in stable relationships with women no older than 35 years 
old 
the report said 152 men left the study before its completion 
most of them because of failure to become infertile within six 
months and dislike of the injection schedule 
among those who withdrew two cited weight gain nine cited 
increased acne and three said they experienced increased 
aggressiveness and libido 
two men stopped receiving injections because the couple planned 
another pregnancy both women became pregnant 
the men were injected with 200 milligrams of testosterone 
enanthate weekly the low rates of discontinuation due to 
sideeffects of the hormone and incidental medical conditions in 
this study confirms the safety and acceptability of the 
injections the report said 
it noted longterm theoretical problems might include risks of 
prostate and cardiovascular disease but the real hazards remain 
uncertain

we also have made clear that given the request by the 
government of kuwait under article 51 of the un charter about 
selfdefense that we do not need any additional authority said 
cheney 
he said iraqs announcement friday that it will begin gasoline 
rationing means the sanctions are beginning to take hold although 
iraq is a major oil producer additives needed to make gasoline are 
said to be in short supply 
we believe it is beginning to have an effect and that it will 
have an effect not only on the iraqi economy but on this massive 
military machine he iraqi president saddam hussein has in 
kuwait cheney said 
he and chevenement spoke briefly with reporters after their 
talks 
while the two met about 15000 people were marching through 
central paris to protest the western military deployment in the 
gulf the demonstration the first of significant size since the 
crisis began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait was organized 
by the french communist party and leftwing labor unions

moscow where he praised soviet cooperation in the effort to 
contain saddam but he gave no indication he had sought or secured 
soviet promises to help in any military action against iraq

president elias hrawi arrived in syria on 
saturday after thanking that countrys armed forces for helping to 
crush the 11month rebellion of christian gen michel aoun 
lebanese officials denied french accusations that syrian and 
lebanese troops executed aouns soliders following their surrender 
about 300 syrian soldiers were among the 550 casualties during 
the eighthour seige oct 13 on an area northeast of beirut held by 
aoun the christian militia leader had formed a breakaway 
government that opposed an arab leaguebrokered peace plan because 
it did not guarantee the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
we thank the syrian army for every drop of blood it shed in 
lebanon hrawi said friday 
hrawi elected in 1989 to implement the peace plan was met on 
the outskirts of damascus by syrian president hafez assad they 
drove in a motorcade to the tishrin guest palace for talks 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon and has 40000 troops 
deployed around the nation where various christian and moslem 
faction have waged war for 15 years syrian troops first arrived in 
1976 under an arab league mandate to halt the fighting which has 
claimed at least 150000 lives 
aoun a former army commander rebelled in late 1988 saying he 
did not recognize hrawis government aoun opposed the peace plan 
because it did not force syria to leave and gave moslems more power 
in the government than they held before 
france foreign minister roland dumas sent united nations 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar a letter friday urging 
him to take action to stop retaliation against aouns followers in 
beirut 
according to the information that has reached us the letter 
was quoted as saying the defeat of general aoun has been 
followed by a settling of scores massacres and extortion 
hrawi denied the claim in an interview on syrian television 
friday we denounce the charges by suspicious and tendencious 
people who want to harm lebanon in any way they can he said 
lebanese defense minister albert mansour said saturday that no 
executions took place after the syrian invasion but he said a 
double massacre occurred when aoun ordered troops to keep 
shooting after he broadcast a surrender 
what happened is that after aouns surrender statement was 
broadcast we ordered the advancing troops to stop shooting but 
fighting continued especially in dahr alwahsh and souk 
elgharb mansour said in a statement published by the leftist 
newspaper assafir 
dahr alwahsh and souk elgharb are on edges of the 
80squaremile area formerly controlled by aouns forces 
the syrian forces believed that aoun had ceased fire after 
moving into exposed positions they were taken by surprise and lost 
200 dead mansour said when the syrians finally reached aouns 
positions the second massacre took place he said 
he gave no details but sources have said the syrians wiped out 
what remained of aouns forces after those battles 
mansours statement on casualties raised the overall toll in the 
assault to 550 dead and 1200 wounded 
lebanon and france have been locked in a diplomatic quarrel over 
aoun who hastaken refugee in the french embassy in beirut twelve 
members of his family and those of his top military aides were 
flown to paris on friday 
hrawis government has refused to allow aoun to leave the 
embassy insisting he face a variety of crimes and the alleged 
theft of about 75 million from the ailing state treasury 
no charges have been brought but officials say aoun was 
collecting taxes and other fees in his enclave and depositing them 
in private accounts instead of the central bank 
the bank has ordered local banks to freeze the accounts of aoun 
maj gen edgar maalouf and brig gen isam abu jamra maalouf 
served as minister of economy health and commerce in aouns 
breakaway government and abu jamra was the generals minister of 
water and electricity 
after toppling aoun hrawis government moved to dismantle the 
socalled green line that has separated christian east beirut from 
the moslem western sections since 1975 the government has proposed 
a militiafree area in beirut and suburbs 
but christian shiite moslem and druse militias remain in place 
in some areas 
druse commander walid jumblatt said saturday he would dissolve 
his 5000strong progressive socialist party force only if 
president assad personally guarantees the future of the druse 
community

demonstrators threw firebombs cans and bottles at 
police saturday during a march against the controversial poll tax 
police said 11 people were injured and 120 arrested 
the clashes began after 2500 demonstrators left a peaceful 
antitax rally at brockwell park in south london and marched to 
nearby brixton prison where they started pelting police with 
debris scotland yard said 
helmeted riot police carrying shields moved in to break up the 
crowd and scuffled with demonstrators outside the prison and in 
brixtons main shopping district 
six policemen and five civilians were injured police said 
busloads of extra police were on duty to prevent a repetition of 
the antitax riot in trafalgar square on march 31 one of the worst 
in central london this century 
that riot left 331 police and 86 civilians injured caused 
hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage and led to 341 arrests 
the protesters marched to brixton prison to show support for 
four prisoners jailed there after the trafalgar square riot 
late saturday home secretary david waddington demanded a report 
from policeon how demonstrators were able to run amok in the 
capital for the second time this year 
the widely unpopular community charge informally known as the 
poll tax is part of prime minister margaret thatchers crusade to 
bury british socialism by hitting at its last bastion local 
government 
since the law went into effect earlier this year every adult 
pays a fixed charge instead of only property owners everyone in a 
district pays the same amount 
the rally saturday at brockwell park was organized by the london 
antipoll tax federation and attended by an estimated 4000 people 
one of the speakers opposition labor party lawmaker tony benn 
told the crowd that the campaign against the new tax was getting 
more and more support 
there are millions of people who cannot afford to pay the poll 
tax and they deserve our support he said 
dave morris of the trafalgar square defendants campaign which 
organized the prison rally said police were itching to attack 
people who marched there and provoked the violence by hemming in 
the demonstrators and seizing a megaphone 
scotland yard denied the allegation saying police persistently 
requested that demonstrators disperse 
police broke up the protest outside brixton prison in about 45 
minutes but smaller groups moved into the brixton shopping 
district and continued scuffling with officers and pelting them 
with bottles cans stones and other objects for several hours 
demonstrators broke shop windows along electric avenue lit 
small fires and overturned stalls in brixton market using them as 
barricades several police vans were damaged and a police 
motorcycle was damaged by a gasoline bomb 
one policeman was knocked to the ground and carried away by 
colleagues scotland yard said three of the six injured policemen 
suffered head injuries none were seriously hurt 
the poll tax is aimed at bringing home to voters what mrs 
thatcher sees as the extravagance of the labor partys social 
welfare programs and the inefficiency of the local councils it 
controls 
critics say the tax is unfair britains richest man the duke 
of westminster pays the same amount under the poll tax as his 
gardener

defense secretary dick cheney pointing to iraqs rationing of 
gasoline said saturday that the unimposed sanctions were 
squeezing saddam hussein and could eventually throw a wrench into 
his war machine 
iraqi drivers waited in lines up to 30 cars long at baghdad gas 
stations trying to fill up before the restrictions go into effect 
tuesday saddam ordered the rationing because iraq a major oil 
producer must import a chemical needed to refine petroleum 
imports were shut down by the sanctions imposed after iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
cheney said economic pressure was the united states weapon of 
choice in the persian gulf but made it clear that military action 
against iraq was a possibility 
in the united states thousands of protesters turned out 
saturday to oppose us military involvement in the gulf 
demonstrations were held in cities including new york atlanta 
boston san francisco and cleveland 
some of the protests were reminiscent of those during the 
vietnam era with a new twist in new york city demonstrators 
chanted hell no we wont go we wont fight for texaco 
about 15000 people led by the french communist party staged a 
peace march in central paris as cheney was meeting with his french 
counterpart jeanpierre chevenement 
speaking to reporters after the threehour talks cheney said he 
was confident the sanctions were hitting the mark 
we believe it is beginning to have an effect and that it will 
have an effect not only on the iraqi economy but on this massive 
military machine he has in kuwait said cheney 
if sanctions dont work other means are at the ready cheney 
warned more than 200000 us troops plus a formidable naval 
flotilla and a fleet of warplanes are deployed in the gulf region 
along with smaller contingents from other nations 
we are very hopeful we will be able to achieve our objectives 
peacefully he said at the same time weve made it clear we 
will look at other options 
cheney was to meet with french president francois mitterrand on 
monday before returning to washington 
although iraq now controls nearly onefifth of the worlds oil 
supply it was not known how long its stockpile of the necessary 
gasoline additives would last 
under the rationing announced by oil minister issam abdulrahim 
chalabi on friday taxis will be allowed 26 gallons of gasoline a 
week and private cars 13 gallons a week the baghdad governments 
big concern was expected to be maintaining gasoline supplies for 
its army 
diplomats said the gas rationing would have an immediate effect 
on prices of other consumer goods which already are soaring some 
foodstuffs including staples like tea and sugar are already 
rationed 
in other gulfrelated developments 
saudi officials said they were buying millions of surplus gas 
masks from eastern europe for areas considered in range of an iraqi 
chemical weapons attack saddam has used chemical weapons in the 
past against iraqs own kurdish minority and against iran during 
the two nations 19801988 war 
it was disclosed that the united states is shifting several 
hundred of its best tanks from europe to saudi arabia the advanced 
m1a1 main battle tanks equipped with a more powerful 120mm gun 
will be in saudi arabia by the end of the year replacing older m1s 
that were brought from the united states a military spokesman in 
saudi arabia said 
former british prime minister edward heath met with foreign 
minister tariq aziz saturday to try to negotiate the release of 
elderly and ailing britons who are among the thousands of 
westerners held hostage by iraqi authorities the official iraqi 
news agency said only that heath and aziz had exchanged views on 
the situation in the gulf 
six german men freed by iraqi officials arrived in jordan on 
saturday and another two germans were to be allowed to leave on 
sunday the german embassy in amman said the iraqis had freed them 
for humanitarian reasons 
a british military spokesman said a british tornado fighter jet 
crashed in northwestern saudi arabia injuring the navigator the 
spokesman said the accident occurred at an air base in tabuk late 
friday the pilot and navigator bailed out

the government responding to 
journalists complaints it was attempting to control the press 
said saturday it would stop subsidizing romanias staterun 
television 
a government statement said it respects the right of the press 
to air divergent opinions but added that freedom of expression 
does not require irreverence toward the government 
in a statement carried by the official news agency rompres the 
government announced it would release no funds to cover the state 
televisions debt estimated at 28 million it said the money 
would go to welfare programs instead 
following the announcement the television appealed to viewers 
to support a doubling or tripling of the viewing license fee 
currently about 2 cents a day 
the government in a statement carried by the official rompres 
news agency also said the ministry for mass media would be 
dissolved and replaced by a public information department in the 
reform ministry 
it said the new information department would try to demonstrate 
that the government wants to inform the public about its policies 
correctly and without manipulating the media 
the government moves followed criticism this week by the 
television and the opposition daily tineretul liber of a plan to 
incorporate the newspaper and about 30 other publications into the 
stateowned national publishing house 
the journalists union on friday accused the government of 
trying to get ownership of the press in order to muzzle it 
under former communist dictator nicolae ceausescu the media 
were strictly censored and adhered to the party line but 
television played a key role in last decembers revolution that 
toppled ceausescu 
since then the opposition has frequently accused the governing 
national salvation front which includes many former communists of 
trying to control the media 
last month the government bowed to pressure and withdrew a 
proposed media law forbidding publication of information that 
seriously threatens or disturbs the public order

selling his vote for cash painted a sordid picture of a 
moneygrubbing state legislature in testimony saturday at a former 
colleagues federal bribery trial 
former state rep robert kohn told jurors that he and suspended 
rep luther taylor were on the same program in recruiting 
lawmakers in a voteselling scheme 
taylor 40 a columbia democrat is on trial before us 
district judge falcon hawkins for allegedly taking 4300 in the 
course of five transactions from lobbyist ron cobb he has pleaded 
innocent 
taylor is one of nine lawmakers indicted in august and september 
on charges of taking bribes in exchange for their support of a bill 
legalizing betting on horses and greyhounds 
prosecutors rested their case saturday and the defense is 
expected to begin its arguments monday 
kohn became a government informant in may when the fbi 
confronted him with evidence of his part in statehouse corruption 
kohn 46 a charleston republican testified that he and taylor 
sought legislators who would take money for pushing the parimutuel 
betting bill 
kohn said most legislators profit from their 74 a day in 
expense allowances also many lawmakers regularly try to find 
excuses to take trips paid for by taxpayers or special interest 
groups he said 
the legislature is a sixmonth job paying 10400 
youre making money on the expense allowance because you 
get it for three days and you only have two nights in a hotel 
kohn said of the allowance 
if you play your cards right you can get people to pick up 
your meals your liquor even the guy who does it by the book is 
going to make money kohn said 
cobb a former state representative was working as a lobbyist 
in 1989 when he was caught in a cocaine deal to avoid prosecution 
he became a witness for federal investigators 
working under cover for the fbi cobb lobbied lawmakers on 
behalf of a fictitious georgia company actually an fbi front that 
backed legalized betting on horses and greyhounds the parimutuel 
bill was scheduled this year but never came up for house or senate 
votes 
kohn testified that cobb gave him 6500 in cash for his efforts 
on the parimutuel legislation 
kohn has only been indicted for conspiracy to violate the hobbs 
act a federal anticorruption law banning government officials 
from accepting money or gifts in exchange for votes or other 
favors 
the single count of conspiracy named taylor and kohn as 
participants in a scheme to accept money for supporting the 
parimutuel legislation and for recruiting colleagues to back the 
bill 
kohn pleaded guilty to the charge last month and has yet to be 
sentenced the maximum penalty is 20 years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
in court kohn admitted to taking part in several scams as 
he called them 
kohn said he and another lawmaker planned to introduce 
legislation this year that would hurt the oil industry hoping they 
could make money from oil lobbyists 
kohn also said he was involved in a scheme that reportedly paid 
400 to a black man to run in the june primary against us rep 
arthur ravenel rsc who is white ravenel easily won the 
primary over that challenger benjamin hunt 
kohn said another man he did not name wanted to increase the 
white turnout in the republican primary to help another white 
candidate in another race 
he acknowledged he was offered a 20000 bribe from an amusement 
company representative to defeat legislation aimed at curtailing 
video poker kohn said he recruited another lawmaker who could 
perform miracles to help kill the bills the company never paid

answer stand on an old apple crate and ring 
a buzzer question how do you play jeopardy 
deborah reinhardt was a livingroom veteran of jeopardy 
when she went to los angeles to play the television game show in 
person the show she appears in is due for broadcast monday 
though she was barred from disclosing how she performed 
reinhardt came home to report that its a lot harder than it looks 
you watch on tv and think wow i can really play this game 
but theres a lot that goes on in the actual playing that you dont 
know about at home said reinhardt who teaches music education 
at ball state university 
for instance things like standing on a box if youre short 
all three contestants must appear to be the same height because 
the camera pans only side to side not up and down reinhardt said 
if youre not tall enough the jeopardy staff will make you 
taller by furnishing an apple crate to stand on 
reinhardt avoided the crate but she couldnt escape another 
problem studio players encounter the ringin system 
while players at home answer questions by shouting at the tv 
screen studio players have to ring in ahead of their opponents if 
they push the button too soon the system locks them out she said 
reinhardt also learned why jeopardy players seem to have 
such illegible handwriting 
id see this awful handwriting on tv and now i know why 
youre writing on a curved tv screen with a light pen and the 
letters appear above the place where youre writing its very 
disconcerting she said

three members of the rap music 
group 2 live crew were acquitted saturday of violating obscenity 
laws in an adultsonly concert four days after a federal judge 
ruled one of their albums was obscene 
a jury deliberated a little more than two hours after a twoweek 
trial based largely on a mostly unintelligible recording of the 
concert 
band leader luther campbell jumped to his feet raised his right 
arm and smiled at supporters in the courtroom as the verdicts were 
read three of four band members faced one misdemeanor count each 
many in the courtroom erupted into cheers and applause 
in closing arguments saturday attorneys for both sides agreed 
that 2 live crews lyrics are nasty but they disputed whether the 
rap bands songs are obscene 
campbell mark brother marquis ross and chris fresh kid 
ice wongwon each faced up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine if 
they were found guilty 
the charges stemmed from a performance at a nightclub in nearby 
hollywood on june 10 four days earlier a federal judge in broward 
county ruled the groups album as nasty as they wanna be was 
obscene 
the album includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual 
violence against women 
cant tell what people are thinking or whats on peoples 
mind campbell said after the verdict we just had a lot of 
hope 
definitely we are going to play again in broward county he 
added 
assistant state attorney pedro dijols said he could not say 
whether a similar case would be prosecuted in the future but he 
said the verdict showed broward authorities needed to do a better 
job of gathering evidence 
i think the case was an education for everyone involved 
dijols said 
the state ought to spend its money on real criminals 
commented campbells attorney bruce rogow 
the jury foreman david garsow said the states key piece of 
evidence was flawed i think it was the tape recordings they 
just werent clear enough for us to decide what happened garsow 
said 
but he added that jurors didnt consider the bands album 
obscene 
as the crosssection of the community that we are it was just 
not obscene garsow said 
2 live crews lyrics have been criticized for their frequent 
references to sex 
of all the things in this world sex is the one that all of us 
do rogow said during closing arguments but if you dont say 
it quite the right way you can get in big trouble with the 
state 
allan jacobi rosss lawyer said because of the sexually 
explicit content of 2 live crews music the state would have you 
believe it was beyond the protection of the first amendment this 
is not so 
in his rebuttal dijols said this was a plain simple nasty 
act thats all it was its unbelievable they can come in here 
with a straight face and tell you something different 
rogow responded if thats all it is its not against the 
law the first amendment does protect speech even nasty speech 
ever fourletter words the purpose of the constitution is to keep 
the state from not liking something and putting people in jail 
broward county circuit judge june johnson told the jurors that 
they would have to acquit the band members if the panel found any 
artistic value in the groups show even if it appealed to prurient 
interests 
obscenity cases usually rely on a us supreme court test that 
says material is obscene if the average person applying community 
standards finds it is designed to stir sexual arousal if it 
depicts sex in a patently offensive way and if it lacks literary 
artistic political or scientific value 
 
the prosecution was coming off a victory winning an obscenity 
conviction against a fort lauderdale record store owner for selling 
the same record after hearing similar defense testimony last 
month the jury in the case of charles freeman rejected artistic 
merit as a defense 
each side called two witnesses two undercover officers who 
used microcassette recorders to tape the nightclub show for the 
prosecution and a music critic and english literature professor 
for the defense 
the prosecution presented brief segments of the tapes that were 
largely unintelligible and the detectives offered their version of 
lyrics on the tape repeatedly prompting jurors to laugh and shake 
their heads 
duke university professor henry louis gates defended the 
performances artistic value by tracing the role of black heritage 
in rap 
gesturing toward the defendants dijols said he actually 
compared these men to ralph ellison and james baldwin i dont 
think until yesterday they knew they were geniuses 
rogow countered its not a matter of taste if you dont like 
it you dont have to go to their concerts but to deny those 
people who want to do it is to deny their freedom of speech thats 
not what this country is about 
freemans attorney milt hirsch said the record store owners 
trial was different because the prosecution had to prove only that 
the recording he sold was obscene in the bands case the state 
lacked a videotape or other conclusive evidence to support the 
charges he said 
the two cases really have no relationship hirsch said 
the state had no case at all

politicians from two governmentcreated 
parties began stumping saturday for municipal elections aimed at 
beginning a return to civilian rule it was the first political 
campaigning allowed in five years 
in lagos the capital more than 60000 people attended a rally 
by the leftofcenter social democratic party its national 
chairman babagana kingibe rode to the rally on his partys 
symbol a white horse and gave away five white horses away to 
people in the crowd 
the conservative national republic convention kicked off its 
campaign in kaduna in the heart of the moslemdominated north 
party officials said they planned to include the military in their 
government in a bid to prevent military coups 
gen ibrahim babangida seized power in a coup on aug 27 1985 
becoming the sixth military man to take over since nigerias 
independence from britain in 1960 
candidates are contesting dec 8 council elections that will 
employ a system of voters publicly lining up behind the candidate 
of their choice or his party symbol critics say the open voting 
will breed vendettas 
opposition has been particularly strong in northern nigeria 
where moslem leaders say it would be improper for men and women to 
line up together 
babangidas government says it hopes to to produce the first 
successful civilian government for nigeria a nation of 100 million 
people beset by corruption and tribalism 
a year ago the general banned 13 independent groups that sought 
to contest general elections promised in 1992 
babangida said the groups were divided along tribal and 
religious lines so he created two new parties and ordered a 
commission to write their political platforms 
critics say the new parties however are also divided along 
ethnic lines the republicans have attracted mainly moslem 
northerners and the social democrats followers are primarily 
christians from the oilrich south

fewer priests are leaving the priesthood 
but there is still a shortage of candidates in north america and 
europe a cardinal told a meeting of bishops saturday 
cardinal pio laghi formerly the vaticans envoy to the united 
states said the overall number of priests is falling because 
deaths outnumber ordinations 
but overall the trend is positive laghi told the monthlong 
synod of bishops meeting at the vatican to discuss problems 
affecting priests 
laghi now leads the vatican congregation for catholic education 
which includes seminaries 
the numbers of those seeking to join the priesthood are in 
constant increase in cases where the church is in the minority 
laghi said citing south korea and india 
but in developed regions the rate of candidacies has been 
very slow the cardinal said overwhelmingly catholic poland 
has accounted for most of the new priests in europe in recent 
years he said 
figures from the last 10 years indicated that decreases in the 
number of the priests worldwide were slackening over the decade 
the number of priests declined by 16505 but the last year of the 
counting from 1988 to 1989 saw a net drop of only 313

when broadcasters report lifeanddeath 
crises as they happen they must consider the effect on people 
still in danger journalists police and the survivor of a deadly 
hostage siege agreed saturday 
we have to treat these situations as if a member of our own 
family is involved said al goldstein news director of krontv 
in san francisco 
he was among eight participants in a spirited discussion of live 
coverage of a standoff sept 27 when a gunman took 33 people 
hostage in berkeley one hostage was slain before the gunman was 
killed by police and six other hostages and a police officer were 
wounded by gunfire 
the forum included journalists police a media critic and a 
hostage john ager who wrote to a television station saying the 
live reports which were seen by the gunman endangered captives 
lives agers letter to kpixtv a cbs affiliate prompted the 
forum 
it was a good exchange i think the letter was supposed to 
create a dialogue and we did have a dialogue said former cbs 
president fred friendly who led the discussion i think 
everybody in the room did some thinking 
the discussion was taped for public television as a production 
of columbia university seminars on media amp society it is to be 
broadcast monday 
in covering the siege local tv stations showed police swat 
teams moving in on the durant hotel bar where gunman mehrdad dashti 
held the hostages they also broadcast live reports that a hostage 
who was shot had died 
fresh threats and violence and death ensued knowing that 
a swat team was on the way the gunman became more eager to 
demonstrate his seriousness calling for volunteers to die ager 
22 a rhetoric and social sciences major at the university of 
california at berkeley wrote in his letter to kpixtv 
the coverage fueled dashtis fears that he wasnt being taken 
seriously ager told the panelists we were in fear for our 
lives 
berkeley police complained that dashtis awareness of their 
actions complicated efforts to get him to surrender 
officers couldnt cut power to the building to turn off dashtis 
tv because they needed the light in the bar to see what he was 
doing 
the event has taught lessons and brought changes 
kron an nbc affiliate has since changed its policy on covering 
hostage crises kpix is taking a similar step 
goldstein and henry fuller news director of kpix both said 
they would not in future report the death of a hostage while a 
siege was still under way they also said they would omit from live 
reports accounts of police movements the gunmans supposed mental 
state or other information that could jeopardize hostages until the 
crisis ends 
live coverage would be a shot of the scene a brief statement of 
what was going on and its effect on the surrounding area they 
said more detailed reports would be aired when the captives were 
out of danger 
i cant really think of any other detail the public needs to 
know then goldstein said i may wind up losing the 6 oclock 
news but when you stick it up against the lives of hostages it 
doesnt make any difference 
ager who said he spoke for other former hostages said he was 
pleased by the discussion and the stations response

joel mccrea the tall rugged actor who was 
equally adept in comedy and drama but who was best known for his 
westerns died saturday he was 84 
mccrea died in the motion picture and television fund hospital 
early saturday of pulmonary complications said supervisor 
eileen singerbrown the hospital declined to give further details 
on the cause of death at the request of his family 
mccreas wife actress frances dee and son peter were with 
him sons jody and david were out of state because his death was 
unexpected peter mccrea said mccrea entered the hospital several 
weeks ago 
a veteran of 87 films mccreas last public appearance was this 
month at a dinner for first lady barbara bush in los angeles 
mccrea was a wellrounded actor early on he appeared in dramas 
such as dead end and foreign correspondent as well as 
comedies such as primrose path and the more the merrier 
just last week another mccrea comedy sullivans travels 
was listed by the library of congress as one of 25 outstanding 
films worthy of historic preservation in the 1941 film written 
and directed by preston sturges mccrea plays a hollywood director 
who sets off to find out what real life is like 
however mccrea went almost exclusively into westerns in the 
late 1940s in such features as the virginian buffalo bill 
four faces west and cattle drive 
his most memorable role in later years was as costar to another 
western immortal randolph scott in sam peckinpahs ride the 
high country in 1962 he performed in only a few films after 
that 
although the western was pretty much a passe form in recent 
decades mccreas films had a second life on television 
ive made a sneakup comeback he told a reporter in 1969 
mccrea was born nov 5 1905 in south pasadena calif he was 
the son of a utility company executive who soon moved the family to 
hollywood 
he attended hollywood high school and studied drama at pomona 
college in 1922 he became a film extra intending to raise money 
for a cattle ranch his first job earned him 5 for riding a horse 
in a mob scene 
he moved into television with wichita town in 1959 playing 
the sheriff in the lawless kansas territory 
in april 1969 mccrea was inducted into the hall of fame of 
great western actors in oklahoma city 
like many an older actor he deplored what he considered to be 
the decline of the cinematic art 
i think the picture business has become too tied up with sex 
pornography and violence he said in 1975 not that im prudish 
about it i just feel that such things have gotten movies too far 
away from their primary purpose to entertain 
mccreas western roots ran deep his maternal grandfather came 
west with the 49ers in a covered wagon and his paternal grandfather 
fought apache indians and drove stagecoaches 
at 13 he began working summers at the king cattle company ranch 
in the tehachapi mountains of california 
he always loved ranching and horses from the time he was 9 
years old so he always wanted to own a ranch peter mccrea said 
he got into the show business to make enough money to buy a 
ranch and ended up loving both 
in the 1930s mccrea and his wife bought a ranch in ventura 
county northwest of los angeles adding holdings until it 
eventually totaled well over 2000 acres for years mccrea grew 
hay and barley and raised cattle and horses but later sold off 
parcels to developers until he had about 300 acres 
for a time he also owned a cattle ranch in eastern nevadas 
ruby valley he disposed of the property in 1966 
there will be no funeral service mccrea wanted his ashes 
scattered at sea 
the family asked that contributions be made to agencies that 
help the homeless and organizations that provide scholarships for 
american indians

brazil said saturday that amnesty 
international had acknowledged it erred in commissioning an 
advertisement linking the government to killings of brazilian 
street children 
a letter to president fernando collor de mello from ian martin 
head of the londonbased human rights group was made public by 
foreign minister francisco rezek 
martins letter was in response to complaints by the brazilian 
government about the ad that appeared two weeks ago in the british 
newspaper the independent 
the ad was titled brazil resolves the problem of abandoned 
children it kills them 
the text said thousands of street children were killed each year 
by police and death squads in the cities of recife sao paulo and 
rio de janeiro 
in an earlier letter to martin the government called the 
charges crude and brutal reflecting a lack of information 
and arrogant posure 
rezek said the present government which took office in march 
wanted to be open about human rights matters but had not able to 
immediately resolve all of its problems 
the minister said the new administration had been trying to 
distance itself from abuses by past governments and that the ad 
hurt its efforts to repair brazils image abroad 
in his letter dated oct 18 martin replied that amnesty 
officials were unfortunately not informed of some of the 
brazilian governments recent public statements when the ad went 
to press 
martin acknowledged that the ad did not reflect the important 
developments in the dialogue between the brazilian government and 
this organization according to the letter 
brazil returned to civilian government in 1985 after 21 years of 
military rule collor de mello is the first popularly elected 
president in 29 years

it could have been a heartwarming new york 
story bystanders leap to the assistance of a subway pickpocket 
victim and nab the crooks 
it wasnt to be a group of jeering youths interfered with the 
rescue and helped the muggers get away but not before one of them 
hit the victim in the face and knocked her to the platform 
while this subway drama friday morning lacked a perfect ending 
for victim lisa polk it reinforced her faith in new yorkers and 
disproved the notion that people here dont get involved 
it says a lot for people said polk a city administrator 
there have been so many real tragedies that started from small 
crimes like this one i was amazed that people were willing to get 
involved with that type of a threat 
walletsnatchings and lesser crimes are daily events in new 
york but they are overshadowed by more sensational and violent 
incidents a rash of child shootings the central park jogger rape 
the bensonhurst racial slaying 
the city has pledged to hire thousands more police and mayor 
david dinkins has asked citizens to help fight crime 
polk who got her wallet back said what bothered her most about 
her ordeal was that the man and woman who attempted to rob her were 
not caught 
that upset me more than being hit in the face she said 
the incident started as polk 35 boarded a broadway local train 
at 103rd street on manhattans upper west side 
a woman entering the train in front of polk jostled her and 
tried to block her way polk who grew suspicious reached into her 
bag and discovered her wallet was gone 
she yelled for the conductor but the doors were closing 
at that point a man apparently working with the woman who 
jostled polk dropped the wallet another passenger picked it up and 
returned it to polk 
the train rolled along to the next stop and the man and woman 
acted as though nothing had happened he read his newspaper and she 
looked at advertisements posted on the walls 
the next stop was 96th street polk got out and yelled for 
police 
the thought crossed my mind that i could just not do 
anything polk said but i decided to yell because i thought 
they did it to me and they could just continue their day doing the 
same to other people 
passengers waiting for the express train across the platform 
grabbed the suspects as they tried to run away other passengers 
asked the conductor to call police 
everybody was very supportive asking me if i was hurt 
offering to help and just saying generally comforting things she 
said 
but before help arrived a group of youths entered the station 
and began heckling the people holding the suspects they said the 
incident was racial because the victim polk was white and the 
suspects were black 
a scuffle broke out between the youths and the passengers 
in the ensuing struggle the two suspects fled but not before 
the man hit polk in the face 
polk reported the incident to police no arrests have been made 
im not sorry i tried to stop them i would do the same thing 
all over again she said if im going to live here im going 
to stand up and say its just as much my town as anyone elses

president bush announced saturday he will 
carry out his pledge to veto major civil rights legislation 
designed to combat job discrimination saying the bill would prompt 
employers to use hiring quotas 
the measure remains a quota bill because inescapably it will 
have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and 
promotion bush said as the administration unveiled its 
alternative version 
bush urged lawmakers to accept the alternative but it came under 
immediate attack from bill supporters civil rights advocate ralph 
neas said the alternative guts the civil rights act of 1990 
house speaker thomas foley dwash was dubious about chances 
of enacting an alternative while sen edward m kennedy dmass 
said bushed seemed to be moving even father away from the strong 
measures that are needed 
the bill approved wednesday by congress arrived at the white 
house on saturday while the president was spending the weekend at 
his camp david md retreat he said he would veto it on monday 
the bill represented the civil rights movements top priority 
over the last six months it would overturn six supreme court 
decisions in job discrimination cases last year 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme discrimination 
cases 
the most controversy however has focused on language that 
would make it easier to take employers to court in job 
discrimination cases bush calls the provisions so stringent that 
employers would turn to quotas to have a readymade defense 
something sponsors dispute 
bush said his alternative includes those specific changes to 
the civil rights act of 1990 that will make it acceptable 
with those changes he said together we can produce 
legislation that will strike a blow against racial bias without 
institutionalizing quotas 
he said his changes were reasonable compromises which some 
aides characterized as significant concessions designed to 
accommodate the concerns of sponsors 
neas director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
said saturday night however that the administrations process 
has been a shameful charade it is clear that the bush 
administration has never wanted a strong and effective civil rights 
act 
kennedy the chief sponsor said through a spokesman he was 
concerned that with this proposal the president is bowing to his 
anticivil rights advisers and is moving even farther away from the 
strong measures that are needed to prevent discrimination in the 
work place 
white house legal counsel c boyden gray said bushs alternative 
would 
cap at 150000 total damages an employee could win in a job 
discrimination suit as passed the bill would allow unlimited 
compensatory damages in some cases and cap punitive damages at 
150000 or the total of compensatory damages plus back pay 
whichever is greater 
allow those filing suit to press their cases if employers 
could not explain their hiring methods in legal terms but it would 
not immediately allow those claiming to be discrimination victims 
to win merely because the employer could provide no records or 
rationale for his hiring methods 
place on employers the burden of proving that hiring practices 
with a disparate impact on women and minorities were required by 
business necessity under a supreme court decision last year those 
filing suit must show that such practices are not forced by 
business necessity 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
saturday 
we think that once congress sees that our bill is very close 
and achieves the objectives of the other civil rights bill and 
makes only those changes that deal with the quota problem and when 
they see we can sustain a veto they will accept it 
foley said earlier saturday that bush should either sign or veto 
the bill and that congress had gone to great lengths to accommodate 
him 
i doubt very much that were going to go back and open up the 
bill all over again but i still hope that some way can be found 
for the president to conclude that he can sign the bill foley 
said 
he said bushs proposed changes were just a recycling of 
previous complaints and for the most part have already been 
considered and rejected at some point during the discussion of the 
legislation 
sen james jeffords rvt a sponsor said bushs proposed 
changes represented significant movement toward resolution of the 
problems 
but he said other remaining differences would still block 
acceptance of the amendments unless they were resolved in 
negotiations 
bush believes there was room to work out the differences aides 
said 
its not take it or leave it said one administration 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but it was unclear whether enough time remained before congress 
anticipated recess this week to work out those differences 
its a doable thing as long as youve got people who are 
willing to sit down and work it out said jeffords

leftist guerrillas on saturday 
commended the us senate for cutting military aid to the 
salvadoran government saying the move would improve prospects for 
a negotiated peace settlement 
salvadoran defense minister rene emilio ponce meanwhile said 
friday night the cut in aid would limit the armed forces capacity 
to act against the guerrillas but he did not go into details 
in an official statement saturday the government repeated its 
longstanding call for the farabundo marti national liberation front 
to lay down their weapons and said it would fight them as long as 
they refused to do so 
while aggressions by the fmln continues our armed forces will 
continue carrying out professionally its constitutional 
responsibility to defend the lives integrity and property of the 
population a government statement said referring to the front 
by its spanish initials 
the statement was in response to senate approval friday of an 
amendment that would cut in half the 85 million in military aid to 
el salvador the us has been providing annually 
the measure which applies to the 1991 fiscal year is aimed at 
forcing the cristiani administration to negotiate an end to the 
decadeold war which has claimed more than 73000 lives 
the conditions in the senate foreign aid bill are similar to 
those contained in a housepassed version the two bills still have 
to be reconciled by a housesenate conference committee but the el 
salvador provisions are expected to be in the final version sent to 
president bush 
one provision would restore the aid if the rebels pull out of 
the united nationssponsored negotiations or if they launch a 
major offensive another provision would eliminate military aid 
altogether if the government breaks off the talks 
so far all the negotiating sessions since cristiani took office 
in june 1989 have ended in deadlock 
this legislation is without precedent and a defeat of the 
salvadoran presidents position of attempting to block the peace 
talks rebel spokesman salvador sanabria said in washington 
in saturdays statement the government urged the rebels to 
desist from their destructive terrorist actions against the 
country and stop their irrational attitude of causing more 
violence destruction and suffering in the salvadoran family 
the rebels have repeatedly rejected proposals for a ceasefire 
without first reaching political agreement on a number of reforms 
including prosecution of officers responsible for atrocities 
juan jose martell a leader of the leftist popular social 
christian movement said the amendment definitely contributes to 
achieving a negotiated solution to the conflict 
the senate in a pragmatic attitude is revising its policies on 
central america and el salvador martell told reporters

if you read between the lines of west 
virginias new government telephone directory the message is 
clear when in doubt call state supreme court justice wt 
brotherton jr 
brothertons office number is listed at least 171 times in the 
official state phone book and that figure was reached by counting 
alphabetically only through the letter k 
county circuit judge john hey failed in his 1988 bid to win 
election to the high court but if you dial the number opposite his 
name in the new directory you get brotherton 
its the same thing for other judges probation officers and 
members of the judiciary 
more than 5000 of the directories have been printed and 2700 
have been distributed 
the mixup was blamed on incomplete corrections made on a list 
of numbers given to the court when brotherton was acting as chief 
justice his number was listed temporarily for those whose real 
numbers were in question but only a fraction were corrected 
state officials said an addendum correcting the mistakes will be 
printed

senior congressional negotiators saturday 
weighed a hefty surtax on people with incomes over 300000 a year 
which aides said almost certainly will be part of any 
deficitreduction tax bill 
top taxwriters from the house and senate met with white house 
budget director richard g darman and presidential chief of staff 
john sununu but indicated no agreement was likely before sunday 
night 
i hope theyll be able to reach a conclusion by the end of the 
weekend house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters 
ive generally heard that theyve been doing well 
i think were making progress sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the finance committee said after top democrats broke 
off into their own meeting and the talks ended for the day i 
think we have a reasonable chance to finish this up sunday night 
but we still have some major sticking points 
they seem to have a fairly good idea where they want to go and 
at this point we dont see any major obstacle to early 
agreement said one source close to the closeddoor talks 
but he and others acknowledged that it will be far more 
difficult to sell any agreement to rankandfile members of 
congress just two weeks before election day 
the house already has rejected one compromise negotiated between 
the white house and congressional leaders mainly over provisions 
that would have raised gasoline taxes and increased medicare costs 
those same two issues are the central points of controversy in the 
new bills 
the separate tax bills passed last week by the house and senate 
created dozens of issues for negotiators to settle however the 
bills have several provisions that are identical or nearly so 
for example they both would raise taxes on liquor beer wine 
tobacco and airline tickets and impose a 10 percent tax on part of 
the cost of highpriced cars planes boats furs and jewelry they 
would raise to as much as 100000 the amount of annual wages now 
51300 to which the 145 percent medicare tax applies 
the compromise also is likely to require retirees to pay 
slightly more for medicare part b insurance for doctors bills 
they may be required to pay more than the current 75ayear limit 
on outofpocket expenses before medicare starts paying for 
doctors services 
negotiators must decide whether to raise gasoline taxes the 
senate voted a 9cent increase the house none another hot issue 
in the house bill is whether the income taxes of all lower and 
middleincome people should be increased by eliminating next years 
scheduled inflation adjustment 
also under discussion was the idea of making a uniform top 
income tax rate of 31 percent eliminating the socalled 
bubble by lowering the 33 percent top rate on 
uppermiddleincome taxpayers and raising the 28 percent rate for 
the highestincome americans 
that would cut taxes for an estimated 5 million people and raise 
them for about 700000 people while generating about 7 billion in 
revenue 
darman insisted last week that bush would oppose an increase in 
tax rates to 33 percent but did not reject the possibility of 
changing the top rates perhaps along the lines of the proposal 
for a single 31 percent rate for all taxpayers with income above a 
certain level 
a senior republican negotiator has said such an elimination of 
the bubble might be coupled with some modest reduction of capital 
gains taxes 
a surtax on highincome taxpayers is one option that has 
considerable support among members of both parties the house bill 
would impose a 10 percent surtax on people with taxable incomes 
over 1 million a year 
however there are not enough such people fewer than 65000 
the internal revenue service estimates to produce the kind of 
revenue needed the house provision would raise 76 billion over 
five years 
some democrats are pushing for a 20 percent surtax and an 
increase in the number of people to which it would apply they 
would drop the threshold to as low as 200000 and hope to persuade 
republicans to accept 300000 
a 20 percent surtax at the 200000 level would affect 400000 
or so couples and individuals whose taxable incomes after 
deductions and exemptions totaled in the 300 billion range on 
returns filed last year 
a sizable surtax would allow negotiators to moderate some 
provisions of the taxreduction plans that members find especially 
onerous such as medicare patients costs and the gasoline tax 
another hittherich proposal with bipartisan support would 
limit the itemized deductions of people with incomes over 100000 
a year the senate bill would permit people in that income class to 
write off only 95 percent of otherwise allowable deductions against 
any part of income that exceeds 100000 the limit would not 
affect deductions for medical expenses investment interest or 
casualty losses 
that limitation which would raise 295 billion over five 
years is supported by some senate republicans who flatly reject an 
increase in tax rates however democratic leaders are wary of 
including it in the final bill for fear of losing votes from 
populous states especially california and new york 
anything the federal government does to reduce the benefits of 
writing off state and local taxes makes it more difficult for 
states to raise taxes to pay for services 
the house bill also would raise from 21 percent to 25 percent 
the alternative minimum tax which is designed to ensure that 
higherincome people pay some tax regardless of how many legitimate 
deductions they claim

mouth ants crawled out 
the childs mouth and throat were too swollen to let air 
through bailey said so the officer covered the boys mouth and 
nose with his own mouth and breathed for him 
bailey said the ambulance he summoned before running into the 
tourist shelter took 25 minutes to arrive the officer breathed 
for the boy until paramedics showed up

about 300 daredevil jumpers bounded 
flipped and somersaulted off the new river gorge bridge on 
saturday falling 876 feet to the river below one bridegroom also 
took the leap 
three parachutists suffered leg injuries and a fourth hit his 
head off a rock on the riverbank when his parachute snagged on a 
tree branch officials said three of them were treated at a 
hospital and later released and the fourth did not go to a 
hospital 
high water levels in the new river caused national park 
officials to limit jumpers to one leap at a time at least one 
minute apart from the second tallest bridge in north america 
the annual bridge day event routinely attracts up to 300 
parachutists many of whom belong to the us base association 
base stands for building antenna span and earth it takes about 
eight seconds to fall from the bridge to the new river below and 
jumpers can reach speeds of 60 mph before landing 
saturdays highlight however was the unrehearsed marriage of 
tom king and vivian taylor a memphis tenn couple followed by 
the grooms leap from the bridge 
the two in traditional wedding dress were married on top of a 
small portable staircase that was used by jumpers as an approach 
ramp to the side of the bridge about 75 invited guests and 
thousands of bridge day spectators watched screaming and clapping 
throughout the 15minute ceremony 
shortly after the ceremony two wedding guests two groomsmen 
and king still wearing his tuxedo leaped from the bridge 
king and one of his groomsmen andy calistrat jumped at the 
same time an exception to the days rule of one jumper at a time 
king trailed behind him a blue banner with yellow streamers that 
read just married tom and vivian bridge day 1990 
king who had to wait for an hour after the ceremony to jump 
said i just want it to be over 
skydivers said the bridge leap is more thrilling and frightening 
than parachuting from an airplane 
skydiving can get a bit vanilla after a while and this can 
put more pizazz into it said rob stanley a 26yearold 
carpenter from toronto canada 
those who came solely for the privilege of jumping were not 
disappointed even though national park service ranger jodi 
schrader said the water was 10 feet higher than the normal level 
last year parachutists were prohibited from taking the plunge 
because the river was running 11 feet above normal following heavy 
rains about three dozen jumpers went off the bridge anyway and a 
few were arrested 
illegal jumps carry a penalty of up to six months in prison and 
a 5000 fine 
three people have been killed in leaps from the bridge two 
during bridge day festivities the last death was in 1987 when 
skydiver steven gyrsting of paoli pa was killed

sanctions against iraq are beginning to work and eventually will 
hamper iraqi forces occupying kuwait 
in new york city protesters said they had 15000 people at 
their rally police estimated the crowd size at 5000 
marching from columbus circle down broadway to times square the 
throng took up the chant hell no we wont go we wont fight 
for texaco 
in washington hundreds of tourists stopped to watch as 
demonstrators dumped sand red paint and oil in a line in front of 
themselves to symbolize what they called the line in the sand 
that the united states should not cross 
federal and local police blocked off the street to traffic and 
filled the road in front of the white house with about three dozen 
police vehicles before moving in longtime antiwar activist daniel 
ellsberg was among the protesters but it was not immediately clear 
if he was among those arrested 
the protesters carried a huge banner reading no us troops 
in middle east no blood they sang we shall not be moved 
and chanted end the occupation with self determination 
a handful of counterdemonstrators plaintively sang america 
the beautiful on the nearby sidewalk and carried signs reading 
nuke iraq

imperialism and read my lips no war for oil 
those sentiments were echoed in cleveland where more than 200 
people rallied outside the headquarters of clevelandbased british 
petroleum america to condemn american involvement in the gulf 
standoff 
there is no reason for this country to be involved in that 
war said jerry gordon a protest organizer there 
its for big oil and profits and control of the oil interests 
in kuwait and to restore the emir a dictator to his throne in 
kuwait gordon said we say let the people of that region 
determine their own destiny 
in atlanta antiwar demonstrators labeled president bush the 
son of reaganstein in calling for us withdrawal from the gulf

said he was haunted by memories of the reception that greeted those 
who returned from the vietnam war 
we came home from vietnam to utter chaos in the streets 
truelove said they were burning flags in the streets draft 
cards in the streets 
he doesnt want his son marine sgt rick truelove 30 now in 
saudi arabia to face that kind of hostile homecoming he said 
the rallies capped a week of smaller protests and the debut of a 
televised peace message starring ron kovic the soldier crippled in 
the vietnam war who became a staunch antiwar activist and wrote 
his story in born on the fourth of july 
organizers hope the protests will speed up what polls show is a 
decline in public support for the us military buildup 
the latest washington postabc news poll shows a sharp drop in 
support for us involvement in the persian gulf where more than 
200000 americans are on duty 
the survey said 60 percent of people questioned believe the 
united states should keep troops in the region until iraq withdraws 
from kuwait which it invaded aug 2 five weeks ago the figure 
had been 75 percent

church bookkeeper and making her pregnant was caught with his pants 
down during a child molestation in his previous parish another

incident the rev daniel scheel chancellor of the catholic 
diocese of galvestonhouston testified friday

a man who lost a battle in the us 
supreme court fighting police use of helicopters to spot marijuana 
has pleaded guilty to growing and owning the drug 
michael riley 35 closed a sixyearold precedentsetting case 
thursday when he pleaded guilty in pasco circuit court to marijuana 
cultivation and possession he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 
four years probation 
the case began in 1984 when pasco county sheriffs deputies flew 
a helicopter low over rileys rural home peered through a gap from 
a missing roof panel and saw marijuana growing in his greenhouse 
with that information they obtained a search warrant and 
arrested him 
rileys defense attorneys argued the helicopter flight violated 
his fourth amendment protection against illegal search and seizure 
the trial judge agreed and ruled the seized plants could not be 
used as evidence the florida supreme court upheld the ruling in 
1987 
prosecutors appealed the case to the us supreme court which 
in a 54 decision in 1989 sided with them 
the court majority concluded deputies didnt need a search 
warrant because the helicopter was operating within federal 
aviation administration regulations the decision was viewed as a 
victory for police use of helicopters to battle marijuana growers

there werent enough caps and gowns to 
go around but the berkeley class of 1970 finally held its 
graduation ceremony saturday 20 years after commencement was 
canceled because of antivietnam war unrest 
im here to celebrate my roots linda kuhli of san mateo 
said after picking up her graduation certificate i have a lot of 
very strong memories 
about 260 members of the 1970 university of california berkeley 
graduating class of 3300 turned out for belated commencement so 
many that the fortysomething graduates had to share caps and gowns 
this is the kind of class that would share said carol 
orsborn who suggested last year that the ceremony be held 
orsborn owner of a san francisco public relations agency once 
gave up her phi beta kappa key to protest violence aainst students 
on the berkeley campus she got it back and has said she hopes the 
commencement will help recover some of her former activism as well 
somehow i think that this graduation ceremony will give us 
back some of that feeling she said 
in may 1970 tensions were high at berkeley as students 
increased protests of the vietnam war after president nixon sent 
troops into cambodia earlier that month four students were killed 
at kent state in ohio by national guardsmen who were called to 
several campuses including berkeley to break up demonstrations 
thencalifornia gov ronald reagan ordered the berkeley campus 
shut down for two days because of the kent state tragedy then 
students and teachers began to talk of demonstrating at the 
commencement which was just weeks away 
as a result former chancellor roger heyns canceled the mass 
commencement at berkeleys memorial stadium instead he authorized 
individual departments to hold small ceremonies a tradition that 
continues today 
commencement speaker and berkeley history professor leon litwack 
told the graduates they should be proud that the campus was a key 
site of antiwar protests and free speech movements during the 
1960s and 1970s 
berkeley has become synonymous around the world with the 
rights of free expression litwack said but those rights did 
not come easily they had to be fought for and much of the credit 
goes to a generation frequently denigrated for its excesses
