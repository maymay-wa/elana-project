some unused military facilities may be turned 
into drug treatment centers under an administration program that 
would call on the resources of the governments two largest 
departments 
officials acknowledged at a news conference friday that the 
memorandum of understanding signed by the departments of defense 
and health and human services is essentially a starting point rather 
than a fleshed out program 
it calls for the health department to identify areas where the 
need for expanded drug treatment capacity is greatest and the 
defense department then to see if it has any spare space in those 
areas that could be used as is or renovated 
the actual centers would be operated along the same lines as 
existing public drug treatment facilities typically run by state and 
local health officials 
the new program is an initiative of the national drug policy 
board a cabinetlevel group headed by attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
joining thornburgh and hhs secretary otis r bowen at a ceremony 
where the agreement was signed was william howard taft iv deputy 
secretary of defense 
they had no estimate how many military bases eventually might be 
used or when 
however bowen who has pushed within the administration for 
more emphasis on drug treatment said it would be unrealistic to 
expect that any new slots would be in operation by the time 
president reagan leaves office in january 
bowen said there are now only 250000 drug treatment slots 
nationwide to deal with an estimated 65 million addicts 
the new program carries no price tag in part because the 
eventual scope has yet to be determined and in part because the idea 
is to use existing funds including millions in the huge drug bill 
just passed by congress that often are not spent because of the 
difficulty in finding locations for drug treatment centers 
many people resist having such facilities in their neighborhoods 
and turning to military bases for space should lessen that problem 
said bowen 
bowen said treatment may be the only answer for millions of 
americans already hooked on drugs but that it is not an easy 
answer because many relapse and require longterm treatment 
this gets to the heart of the matter said bowen because 
there are no easy solutions the administration and congress face 
enormous difficulties in sustaining fiscal and political support for 
treatment 
obviously it would be better if americans were persuaded to 
ignore the temptation of drugs or deterred from illicit drug use 
he said but treatment is the only answer for the millions of 
americans who for one reason or another want to say no but 
cant

a manufacturing partnership has won an army 
contract to develop an engine for the services next generation of 
helicopters and american telephone amp telegraph co won a spirited 
competition to supply the pentagon with new computers 
the army selected a partnership formed by divisions of general 
motors corp and allied signal aerospace co to develop the engine 
for its new light attack and observation helicopter for use beyond 
the end of this century 
the new craft is to replace aging fleets of vietnamera ah1 
cobra oh6 cayuse and oh58 kiowa choppers 
the winning team called light helicopter turbine co is 
composed of the gms allison gas turbine division and allied 
signals garrett engine division the group previously had received 
a contract worth 1324 million and the deal announced friday was 
for another 754 million to continue the work 
the two partners are expected eventually to compete for 
production awards the engine work ultimately is expected to be 
worth more than 15 billion to the two companies 
first deliveries are scheduled for 1995 
the army also gave the goahead to two other groups to compete 
for the job of designing the rest of the chopper one of the groups 
is a joint venture of boeing helicopters and united technologys 
sikorsky aircraft the other is a partnership that includes units of 
mcdonnell douglas corp and bell helicopter textron inc each team 
received 158 million to pursue their design work 
the army hopes to purchase 2096 of the new helicopters at a cost 
of roughly 40 billion 
the computer contract awarded to atampt for 9291 million 
establishes the companys position in the industry for years to come 
with what has been described as the computer contract of the century 
the air force which acted as the executive agent for the other 
services in overseeing the bidding said an atampt subsidiary atampt 
technologies inc had been selected over five competitors and would 
be expected to deliver about 20000 minicomputers over the next five 
years 
atampt said the award was the largest computer contract ever 
awarded by the federal government company officials said the value 
could exceed 1 billion depending on the options exercised 
the air force is buying the computers for its own use as well as 
that of the army navy coast guard defense communications agency 
and defense logistics agency

the control tower at chicagos ohare 
international airport should be back to full strength by may ending 
a staff shortage that led to a record number of flighthandling 
errors at the nations busiest airport sen paul simon said 
the federal aviation administration has set may 1 the starting 
date for a planned salary incentive program as its target date for 
doubling the number of experienced air traffic controllers at 
ohare simon dill said friday 
increasing the number of journeyman controllers at ohare is the 
top priority in a detailed faa plan to improve operations at the 
airport the senator said 
in a report submitted friday to simon and other lawmakers the 
agency outlined 100 such improvements and set a timetable for 
accomplishing each 
this action plan we now have really means the beginning of the 
end of a significant threat to air safety at ohare simon said 
ohare controllers have had 30 flighthandling errors so far this

secretary of state george p shultz says the 
shadow of a third world war has faded but that the growing 
availability of two types of nonnuclear weaponry is heightening the 
potential for devastation in global trouble spots 
in a speech friday night shultz said the spread of sophisticated 
missile technology and the use of chemical weapons have become major 
sources of concern just as offensive nuclear weapons are being cut 
back and there is less danger of new countries being added to the 
nuclear club 
the worst nightmare of all shultz said would be the 
eventual combination of ballistics missiles and chemical weapons in 
the hands of governments with terrorist histories 
shultz spoke to the commonwealth club of san francisco copies of 
his remarks were made available by the state department 
these weapons shultz said increase the potential for 
devastation in unstable regions of the third world and the 
conflicts themselves may be far more difficult to contain or 
isolate 
shultz said that both belligerents in the iraniraq war used 
soviet scud missiles and that saudi arabia is acquiring chinese 
css2 missiles with a potential range exceeding 1500 miles 
these missiles which may be thought of as obsolete by the 
superpowers are nothing of the sort when it comes to regional 
conflicts shultz said 
and beyond the arms market more and more nations will be able 
to build their own ballistics missiles weaponry of enormous 
destructive potential can reach the hands of parties with little 
regard for traditional inhibiting controls 
he said another new danger is the reappearance of chemical 
warfare perhaps the most odious and despicable development of 
our day 
only a handful of the hundreds of conflicts since world war ii 
had witnessed the use of chemical weapons but now the scourge is 
spreading he said 
shultz did not single out any nation in the speech but he 
strongly criticized iraq two months ago for its alleged use of 
chemical weapons against its kurdish minority 
the administration earlier had criticized both iran and iraq for 
resorting to chemical weapons in their conflict it had said that 
iraqi use of such weaponry was far more extensive 
shultz said that at a january conference in paris on 
strengthening an international agreement that prohibits chemical 
warfare the us goal will be to reverse the erosion of respect 
for the norms which have held the line against the use of such 
hideous weapons

of a us drug agent and his pilot 
raul lopez alvarez 29 was convicted along with two other 
mexican men in the 1985 torturemurder of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala 
avelar 
us district court judge edward rafeedie sentenced lopez to five 
terms of 60 years each to run concurrently with a life term in 
addition he sentenced him to 10 years for aiding and abetting on a 
charge of being an accessory after the fact but ordered that that 
run concurrently with the 240 years 
he also ordered that lopez not be eligible for parole until he 
has served a minimum of 60 years in prison 
lopez who went to school in los angeles but returned to his 
mexican homeland and became a member of the state judicial police of 
guadalajara was found guilty of two counts of committing violent 
acts in support of racketeering as well as conspiracy to kidnapping 
felony murder and accessory after the fact 
his sentence was alomost identical to one imposed wednesday on a 
codefendant rene verdugo urquidez 36 whose attorneys also argued 
he had been unjustly convicted of a crime he did not commit 
the judge also had imposed a 10year sentence on jesus felix 
gutierrez 38 a former los angeles seafood store owner convicted of 
aiding mexican drug lord rafael caro quintero in his escape from 
mexico to costa rica after the murders 
camarena was abducted feb 7 1985 in guadalajara his body and 
zavalas were found buried at a remote ranch weeks later they were 
severly beaten and camarenas skull was crushed 
the case stirred bitter feelings between mexican and american 
officials when mexican police were linked to the killing and to 
caros escape 
lopez was convicted on the basis of his own words he was 
videotaped boasting to an undercover agent about the camarena 
murder saying that it was a mistake 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney jimmy gurule called 
lopez a coldblooded killer and said he had openly boasted of 
participating in grotesque torture techniques and murders not only 
in this case but in others 
these crimes are inhuman and barbaric and justify no mercy on 
the part of this court he said adding that he wished the death 
penalty was available for lopez

the federal aviation administration says the 
discovery of cracks in three dc9 airplanes may warrant an indepth 
inspection of the entire fleet of passenger jets 
the agency announced friday it had uncovered a series of small 
cracks in three dc9 aircraft flown by northwest airlines and 
usair group inc 
as a result of this finding faa plans to order shortly an 
indepth inspection of the dc9 fleet said agency spokesman bob 
buckhorn 
buckhorn said the faa would wait until inspections already under 
way were completed before the agency ordered the inspection of all 
dc9s 
the cracks the longest of which was approximately one inch 
are located in the uppermost area of the fuselage over the wing 
he added 
the announcement came a day after the faa said it would speed up 
inspection and replacement of 7200 rivets on almost 300 of the 
oldest boeing 737s the roof of one of those planes flown by aloha 
airlines tore off during flight april 28 killing one person and 
injuring 61 the rivets are believed to cause cracks in the fuselage 
skin of older boeing 737s 
the agency said the cracks in the dc9s manufactured by douglas 
aircraft co a division of mcdonnell douglas corp were in no 
manner comparable to the recent cracks discovered in boeing 737 
aircraft fuselage joints 
the agency noted that corrosion was not a factor in the 
development of the dc9 cracks and emphasized that the cracks do not 
mean the passenger jets are unsafe 
i am confident that these cracks could not become a threat to 
the structural integrity of the aircraft faa administrator t 
allan mcartor said in a statement 
were talking about very small cracks were not talking about 
the kind of thing we found in the boeings said buckhorn 
the early discovery of the dc9 cracks validates the 
effectiveness of the faa structural inspection program instituted 
in the early 1980s to provide early detection of structural fatigue 
in older planes mcartor added 
the fuselage cracks were found on older aircraft which had 
between 65000 and 70000 landings and the agencys more extensive 
inspection could involve up to 200 of the oldest planes 
elayne bendel a spokeswoman for douglas aircraft also praised 
the faa inspection program saying it was intended to find small 
problems and get them fixed 
in a telephone interview from her office in long beach calif 
where the planes are built bendel said operators had been informed 
the cracks were found and the company would be issuing an alert 
service bulletin that would provide for some inspection procedure 
and a recommended time in which this service should be done 
a usair official said the company was inspecting its fleet of 74 
dc9s and had found several cracks in the aircraft 
we have found several cracks in the stringers a joining piece 
of metal said spokesman david shipley these cracks seem to be 
located in the section over the forward emergency exit window and 
back about eight rows but we have found nothing of a serious 
nature these are not cracks of major structural systems 
the company said only 37 of its aircraft which had made 60000 or 
more landings would be included in the inspection 
officials at northwest were unavailable friday night for comment 
on the faas proposed action 
the agency said it also would recommend dc9 aircraft outside the 
united states be inspected

special israeli army undercover 
units are operating in the occupied territories to identify 
palestinian activists in the arab uprising 
existence of the units and reports that palestinians have been 
killed by israelis dressed in civilian clothes have triggered 
widespread rumors that undercover military squads had been formed to 
assassinate activists on the west bank and gaza strip 
both palestinian human rights investigators and army officials 
have agreed there was no evidence to suggest the army sanctioned 
assassination squads or the systematic killing of palestinians 
arabs have claimed that israelis dressed in civilian clothes and 
driving unmarked vehicles have being involved in at least four 
incidents in which palestinians were shot three palestinians were 
killed and three wounded in the shootings the arabs claim 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said on israel radio there 
is no army unit that is above the law that has the right to kill or 
eliminate someone 
field worker khalid batrawi said law in the service of man an 
organization affilated with the genevabased international 
commission of jurists has investigated incidents in which 
palestinians were killed or wounded by israelis wearing civilian or 
arab clothes and operating with army backup 
there isnt one case where we can claim the army came to kill a 
particular person he said but there are many cases where there 
was no reason for the army to shoot 
security sources and israeli soldiers who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that undercover military units 
operate in the west bank and gaza strip according to foreign 
published reports two units use the code names cherry and 
samson 
reports have said their mission was to identify arab ringleaders 
and demonstration organizers 
the army units are distinct from the shin bet security forces 
which have operated in the west bank and gaza strip since israel 
seized the territory in the 1967 middle east war 
an israeli source familiar with the army units said they did not 
have orders to shoot and any use of violence was an exception to 
standing orders 
unit members carry weapons and usually wear tshirts over 
armyissue khakicolored pants they sometimes masquerade as arabs 
donning traditional keffiyeh headdresses and driving vehicles with 
distinctive license plates reserved for arabowned cars blue in 
the west bank and white in the gaza strip 
although there was no indication the units had a license to kill 
questions have been raised about their tactics 
dedi zucker a member of the israeli parliament said that in 
response to his inquiry defense minister yitzhak rabin had 
confirmed the army uses confiscated arab cars rabin claimed this 
is legal and done officially he said 
the correspondent for the financial times of london and two 
reuters journalists had their press credentials suspended by the 
government and are being investigated by police for reporting on the 
undercover units without submitting their stories to censorship 
villagers in yatta told the ap that on oct 9 two palestinians 
were gunned down by a group of about eight israelis who jumped out 
of a creamcolored ford transit van bearing west bank license plates 
the gunmen wore tshirts and khaki armystyle pants and carried 
pistols and automatic weapons according to a witness moussa al 
sari an uncle of one of the slain men 
al sari said fadel ibrahim shehadeh al najar 25 and kamal 
mahmoud al sari 24 were walking down yattas main road when the 
van pulled up alongside them 
the israelis got a good look at them and then they opened fire 
they knew who they were after claimed the elder al sari adding 
that the men were sprayed with submachine gun fire from a distance 
of about three yards 
family members said both men were wanted by the authorities for 
antiisraeli activism and had been in hiding to elude troops who 
frequently searched their houses they said about 60 youths had 
thrown stones at the van an hour earlier 
an army spokesman said the men were shot by soldiers who opened 
fire after their lives were threatened by a stonethrowing mob he 
said one of the men was wanted by security forces 
col renaan gissin the deputy army spokesman said the military 
police had launched a routine investigation into the incident to 
insure the firing was called for that it was a life endangering 
situation 
three signed affidavits collected by law in the service of man 
describe incidents similar to the yatta shooting elsewhere in the 
west bank 
sultan abu hassan 21 said he was hit with 11 bullets fired by 
israelis who wore tshirts khaki pants and arab headdresses 
another man mohammed abu salah 38 was killed in the attack 
in the sworn statement abu hassan said the israelis were driving 
a white ford cortina with arab plates when they stopped at a 
roadblock he was manning at the entrance to the village of silat al 
harithyya north of nablus 
abu sultan said the driver told him in arabic he wanted to enter 
the village then four men emerged from the car and opened fire

human remains unearthed by a construction 
crew this week belong to praying indians from about 1700 the 
state archaeologist says 
skeletal and dental features helped researchers determine that 
the bodies found in burial grounds dating to the late 1600s or early 
1700s were indians brona g simon the archaeologist said friday 
they were known as praying indians which was the common term 
used for indians associated with christian churches set up to 
missionize the indians simon said 
she said the fact that they were buried in coffins showed they 
were indians who had converted to christianity simon believes there 
are at least six indians buried at the site in this boston suburb 
this site is very unique in that its a praying indians site 
there were only 16 praying indian communities found in 
massachusetts she said most sites have been built upon 
the exact number of bodies at the site will not be determined 
until after the boundaries of the burial ground are determined 
we havent really exposed many of the skeletons to see whats 
inside the coffins the whole point of this is to preserve the 
site simon said 
the burial ground will be left intact and the developer of the 
subdivision whose crew unearthed the cemetery has agreed to 
rearrange his development to accommodate preservationists 
it looks like there are many opportunities for the developer to 
go ahead and the burial ground to be preserved simon said

the soviet union postponed for four hours the 
unmanned maiden launch of its space shuttle buran from a pad in 
soviet central asia early saturday but there was no immediate word 
on what caused the delay 
according to reports from the baikonur cosmodrome the launch 
of the soviet reusable space craft buran has been postponed 
official radio moscow said in a broadcast 
the official soviet news agency tass said there had been a 
fourhour delay in the prestart preparations but did not say why 
technicians had worked around the clock friday on a floodlit 
launch pad preparing for the brief flight of the shuttle billed as 
safer more flexible and more powerful than the us orbiter it 
resembles 
the launch of the blackandwhite winged buran or snowstorm 
shuttle attached to the energiya booster the worlds most powerful 
rocket had been scheduled for 623 am moscow time saturday 
1123 pm edt friday at the pad in the republic of kazakhstan 
the shuttle will orbit earth twice and then obeying its 
electronic brain and the radio commands from earth will land on a 
paved runway 12 kilometers eight miles from the launch complex 
tass said no landing time was given 
in a report on launch preparations late friday staterun 
television provided the first confirmation that the military is 
involved in the shuttle program 
as always in our country military specialists participate in 
crucial dangerous tests a correspondent said reporting from 
baikonur 
the report said the military official overseeing shuttle 
operations is alexander a maksimov chief specialist of the 
defense ministry on multipleuse space transport systems and the 
prospect of their development 
military involvement could be one reason soviet officials have 
withheld details of their shuttle program officials have said 
throughout the year that a launch was imminent but gave a date for 
it only on wednesday 
soviet officials and media repeatedly have criticized military 
uses of the american space shuttle 
the us defense department in its 1988 publication soviet 
military power says the soviets might use their shuttle to deploy 
antisatellite and ballistic missile defense weapons and other 
spacebased components of the soviet strategic defense program 
the tv showed maksimov speaking to baikonur workers at an outdoor 
ceremony 
truly this is a historic task he said todays launch we 
can compare to the launch of the first artificial satellite 
the soviet union began the space age in 1957 with the launch of 
sputnik 
the evening news also showed the chairman of the government 
commission on shuttle construction and launch vitaly v doguzhiev 
speaking to baikonur workers 
qualified and responsible people are gathered here but the 
main thing nonetheless has always been and remains quality in the 
name of the government commission i ask you very much i beg you 
quality and only quality doguzhiev said nervously 
news reports indicated the mission would be entirely devoted to 
checking out the crafts onboard systems and the shuttle would not 
deploy satellites or conduct any other tasks 
soviet newspapers said the shuttle has room for a maximum of 10 
people up to four cosmonauts and six passengers they said 
energiya and buran cost about the same as the us shuttle about 
10 billion 
communications with the craft will be controlled via four ships 
in the atlantic and pacific oceans four satellite systems and 
ground stations 
on thursday foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskykh said the 
launch would be televised live in the soviet union but on friday he 
said he could no longer ensure a live broadcast foreign reporters 
were not allowed to travel to baikonur 
technicians worked around the clock by the light of 670 
spotlights filling the four firststage rockets with kerosene and 
oxygen and the second stage with liquid oxygen and hydrogen 
soviet officials once criticized the us space shuttle which 
made its first flight in 1981 as wasteful and unreliable but have 
been developing their own lookalike for years 
the shuttle like the american version is attached to smaller 
firststage rockets and one large booster but the newspaper 
socialist industry told its readers to ignore the similarities 
the automatic system that allows the buran to be completely 
guided from the ground not only makes the initial flight safer but 
in the future will give teh crew more flexibility it said 
it gives it the possibility of engaging first of all in 
experiments in space and increases the reliability of all systems 
the newspaper said adding that cosmonauts can take control of it at 
any time 
soviet officials have said the flight is unmanned to avoid 
risking the lives of its crew they cite the jan 28 1986 
explosion of the us shuttle challenger in which seven crew 
members died as an example of the dangers 
the labor newspaper trud said the energiyaburans four 
liquidfuel first stage rockets allow it to continue flying even if 
one fails unlike the us shuttles two solidfuel rockets 
the buran has a capacity of 66000 pounds compared with the us 
shuttles 55000 pounds energiya can lift more than 100 tons 
energiya has been used only once before in may 1987 its payload 
failed to reach orbit but soviet space officials have said the 
problem was with the guidance system of the payload not with 
energiya

jews in the united states are growing increasingly 
worried about antisemitism in part because of concerns about the 
rev jesse jackson according to a survey released by the american 
jewish committee 
jacksons attitude toward jews first became a political issue 
while he was seeking the democratic nomination in the 1984 
presidential race he called new york hymietown embraced yasser 
arafat the chairman of the palestinian liberation organization and 
appeared publicly with black muslim leader louis farrakhan 
the national survey of more than 1200 jews found that 75 percent 
were worried that antisemitism was becoming a major problem in 
america in 1983 the first time the organization asked that 
question 45 percent of the respondents said they were worried 
one has to understand that jews even in a free society have a 
residual memory of danger ira silverman director of the new 
yorkbased organization said friday 
theres hardly been a society where jews have felt perfectly 
safe it is possible that the openness of black antisemitism 
within the last year or more has exacerbated the worry of jews if 
they see antisemitism spoken openly and not being decried by 
others that becomes very worrisome silverman said 
one survey question was is jesse jackson antisemitic 
fiftynine percent said yes 10 percent said no and 31 percent said 
not sure on another question 32 percent said they believed 
many blacks are antisemites 
a jackson spokesman at his rainbow coalition headquarters in 
chicago said jackson stands with jews not against them 
they have no basis for such an accusation of antisemitism 
said jacksons press secretary frank watkins black people are 
not the enemy of jewish people 
surveys of nonjews have found antijewish bigotry apparently 
waning which silverman called a perception gap attitudes towards 
jews are improving which should be encouraging but many jews dont 
believe it he said 
the findings were contained in a study of political and social 
attitudes by sociologist steven cohen of queens college in new york 
cohen based his findings on twin surveys by market facts inc of 
1252 jews and 1217 nonjews in april and may 
the surveys used a representative sample of jews and nonjews 
around the country they did not include a margin of error 
findings included 
87 percent of jews favored keeping abortion legal as did 45 
percent of white nonjews and 41 percent of blacks 
85 percent of jews supported equal rights for homosexuals as 
did 70 percent of blacks and 57 percent of nonjewish whites 
among jews democrats outnumbered republicans 61 percent to 14 
percent a ratio of more than 41 among white nonjews the 
proportion was about even 
liberals outnumbered conservatives among the jews surveyed 33 
percent to 21 percent among white nonjews surveyed twice as many 
described themselves as conservative as opposed to liberal 36 
percent to 17 percent 
25 percent of the jews surveyed said they felt virtually all 
positions of influence in america are open to jews 
founded in 1906 the 50000member american jewish committee 
works at building bridges between jews and other groups as well as 
defending the interests of israel and soviet jewry

american television until the cbs film dadah is death which she 
said gave her the opportunity to play a strong middleaged woman 
fighting to the end for something 
i thought it was a wonderful part and they dont come along 
that often she said of the fourhour miniseries the film which 
marks the oscarwinning actress debut on american television will 
be shown in two parts sunday and wednesday 
directed by jerry london dadah is death is based on the 
story of australians kevin barlow and geoffrey chambers who were 
hanged in malaysia in 1986 after being convicted of trafficking in 
heroin 
they were the first westerners executed under malaysian drug 
laws the word dadah is malay slang for drugs 
ms christie plays barlows mother barbara who campaigned 
furiously but unsuccessfully to save her 26yearold son victor 
banerjee who played dr aziz in the movie a passage to india 
costars as karpal singh barlows lawyer 
born in india into an english teaplanting family ms christie 
won an academy award in 1965 for darling which was about the 
spirit of london in the 1960s 
she played lara in dr zhivago and received further acclaim 
for her performances in mccabe and mrs miller shampoo 
heaven can wait dont look now and the gobetween 
she left the glamour of hollywood 11 years ago for a stone 
farmhouse in wales at 48 her choice of roles involves lowbudget 
provocative films such as james ivorys heat and dust and miss 
mary by argentine filmmaker maria luisa bemberg 
in an interview at a friends apartment in london she was asked 
about her role as barbara barlow 
i usually find american miniseries extremely sentimental 
i didnt think this was she said 
its dealing with a tricky subject i mean i was horrified 
about the fact that in australia there was a tv public opinion 
poll if you can imagine anything so indecent asking viewers to 
send in their verdict whether the boys should be hanged 
sixty percent rang in saying they should be barbara had to 
bear the impact of this kind of expression of hatred 
ms christie said the film did not pass judgment but showed the 
convicted men caught up within wheels within wheels within 
wheels 
theres a lot of ambiguity in this she said the boys 
should be presented as villains in the popular sense of people who 
go around with drugs at the moment and in fact they are presented 
as what they are human beings 
dadah is death focuses on individuals not on politics but 
ms christie has become increasinly involved in political issues 
earlier this year she narrated a film for oxfam the british 
relief organization about cambodia and she has taken stands on 
vivisection homelessness and nuclear arms 
when president reagan gave a speech in london last may she was 
outside the hall with a placard denouncing us policy in latin 
america 
if youre personally hurt by something i think its terribly 
frustrating not to try and do something about it she said 
thousands and thousands of people are disturbed by what is 
happening all over the world but cant be heard we can be heard 
people with a name can be heard 
ms christie was asked about her years in los angeles where she 
was the frequent companion of actor warren beatty 
she said she disliked the materialism the acceptance of 
affluence without questioning how any of it arrived 
what kept me there were my relationships with various fellas 
she added without elaborating she has never married 
ms christie said she occasionally visits london on business and 
to see new movies and that the long periods between acting roles do 
not bother her 
something always turns up she said meanwhile theres 
always plenty to do plenty to see plenty to learn

aztec songs a choral symphony 
premiering at the great pyramids of teotihuacan had to be written 
in a 500yearold indian language but composer lalo schifrin cant 
quite say why 
its magic said schiffren before an orchestra rehearsal at

nahuatl tribe who died in 1472 
the songs will be performed in nahuatl a native mexican tongue 
that gave the world the word for chocolate 
i cant really explain directly why i wrote the piece in 
nahuatl said schifrin i found it to be a very sweet musical 
language one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting 
melodies 
but the real answer is that theres something magic about it 
that it inspired me he said theres something magic in the art 
of music anyway 
about 10000 people were expected at the spectacle today about 25

the reagan administration has rejected a rice 
industry request for a federal investigation of japanese barriers to 
rice imports averting a political storm in japan and threatening 
one in the united states 
the decision announced friday was something of a surprise and was 
the first important test of the new tougher 1988 omnibus trade act 
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of american 
goods on foreign markets 
disappointed us rice industry officials condemned the decision 
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take 
office in january will be more concerned about promoting us 
interests than pleasing foreign governments 
clayton yeutter the special trade representative said in 
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and 
millers that japans virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible 
and intolerable he said it would be vigorously challenged but not 
in the bilateral fashion demanded by us rice farmers 
yeutter said the administration believed it would be more 
effective to pursue the complaint through the 97nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade which currently is holding a 
fullscale set of negotiations on global trade liberalization 
agricultural trade is a central focus of the gatt negotiations 
the gatt participants are scheduled to hold a review session in 
december in montreal to assess progress since the talks began in 
1986 and to consider the way ahead 
yeutter told reporters he expects support from japan at montreal 
on broad us goals for liberalizing agricultural trade including a 
us proposal to eliminate farm subsidies by the year 2000 
if on the other hand representatives of the government of 
japan are not helpful and supportive in the agricultural discussions 
in montreal and if it becomes apparent that they are not committed 
to solving the rice issue i am prepared to reconsider this 
decision yeutter said 
in that event yeutter said he would invite the us rice 
industry to refile its petition and he would make a decision on 
the petition before the conclusion of the reagan administration 
jan 20 
in the background of yeutters decision were warnings from the 
japanese a japanese cabinet official regarded as a spokesman for 
prime minister noboru takeshita on economic issues said here last 
week that turning the rice issue into an unfair trade case could 
trigger political reaction at home violent enough to jeopardize 
promised japanese support of further farm trade liberalization 
michihiko kunihiro deputy foreign minister for economic affairs 
said in washington oct 21 he advised us officials the reaction 
would be very violent to an unfair trade case on rice in a sort 
of prosecution by the united states 
all positive thinking of agricultural people back in japan 
would stop and we will have very great difficulty in pushing 
forward to liberalization in the uruguay round he said 
rural interests have major influence in takeshitas 
liberaldemocratic party which has ruled japan for more than three 
decades in september all parties in the lower house of parliament 
joined to adopt a nonbinding resolution against imports of rice 
which has nearmystical significance for the populace but the 
staple costs the japanese six to 10 times the world price of rice 
because of lessefficient domestic production on small plots in the 
mountainous country 
backers of the sept 14 petition of the us rice millers 
association and the rice council for market development had hoped 
the pressure of presidential politics would force acceptance two of 
the richest states in electoral votes california and texas are 
major rice growers 
both the republican presidential nominee vice president george 
bush and democratic candidate michael dukakis had voiced support 
for the rice industrys position 
reagans administration rejected a similar petition in 1986 
because it wanted to give tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban 
on rice imports 
we are shocked and dismayed that ambassador yeutter once again 
would reject the us rice industrys request said j stephen 
gabbert president of the rice millers group 
rep vic fazio dcalif whose district includes some of the 
biggest rice farms in the nation said the decision proved reagan 
administration officials are patsies when it comes to doing battle 
against even blatantly illegal trade barriers 
both californias senators democrat alan cranston and republican 
pete wilson expressed dismay this refusal by the us to take 
direct action under our new tougher trade law could well serve to 
reaffirm the practice of protectionism by the japanese and resound 
negatively throughout the us economy said wilson

the two whales that captured the worlds attention 
off alaska should have been eaten instead of freed from the ice an 
eskimo activist says 
in my mind theres something wrong to save these two whales 
while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the 
north aqqaluk lynge of the greenland office of the inuit 
circumpolar conference said friday at a news conference that 
concluded a threeday meeting on arctic cooperation 
to my mind its a degradation of human values he said 
the native peoples of the arctic region generally prefer the term 
inuit to eskimo 
the california gray whales stranded in arctic ice for nearly 
three weeks apparently swam to freedom friday ending a 
milliondollar rescue effort that involved soviet icebreakers 
american scientists and eskimo volunteers who cut holes in the ice 
with chain saws 
lynge noted the enormous resources devoted to freeing the whales 
and said its better to eat them 
the activist said environmentalists campaigns against 
furtrapping and seal hunting in the arctic have devastated 
traditional cultures in the region 
the conference sponsored by the governmentaffiliated canadian 
institute for international peace and security and the 
torontobased private science for peace brought together native 
activists as well as scientists and academics on arctic issues 
organizers of the international conference on arctic cooperation 
said the participation among all arctic nations including the 
soviet union was remarkable 
arkady cherkasov a specialist in arctic economics from the 
soviet academy of sciences institute of the usa and canada said 
the campaign to save the two whales may have helped because of the 
attention focused on the regions problems 
its a good thing he said but still there are many other 
problems to solve in the north 
cherkasov also said the yuit people of the soviet arctic might be 
able to join the inuit interpolar conference a representative of 
the yuits who have traveled only rarely outside the soviet union 
was in toronto for the conference 
the interpolar conference claims to represent the 120000 inuit 
people from alaska canada and greenland 
but cherkasov said soviet participation in such a group could be 
difficult because more than 25 different native groups live in the 
soviet arctic 
the 70 participants were from eight arctic countries including 
canada the soviet union the united states denmark greenland 
iceland sweden finland and norway 
although they failed to agree on a final resolution organizer 
franklyn griffiths of the university of toronto said the conference 
produced thinking about what you can do up there together action 
comes later 
among the topics discussed were public health problems in the 
arctic region the results of industrialization the environment and 
the greenhouse effect militarization and science 
each polar state now faces broadly similar problems preserving 
the cultures and way of life of its indigenous peoples the 
conferences preliminary statement said 
while the need for international civil cooperation on arctic 
environmental scientific social and other matters of common 
concern has grown it is constrained by militarystrategic 
conflict

iran offered to stop searching iraqibound 
ships in the persian gulf if iraq agreed to a joint troop withdrawal 
along the border but iraq did not respond and peace talks remained 
deadlocked 
we are ready to accept a logical interlock between the question 
of troop withdrawal and the cessation of our right to search ships 
in the gulf mohammed jaafar mahallati irans ambassador to the 
united nations told reporters friday 
his offer came two weeks after he said iran would never 
relinquish its right to seize war cargo until a final peace treaty 
was signed to end the war that began in september 1980 
there was no immediate response from iraq 
during the fighting iranian gunboats in the persian gulf 
frequently stopped ships en route to iraq and searched them for war 
materiel but they stopped after a unmediated ceasefire went 
into effect aug 20 
disputes over the shattalarab waterway iraqs only access to 
the gulf as well as freedom of navigation have deadlocked the 
iraniraq peace talks that opened aug 25 in geneva shifted to new 
york in september and reconvened monday in geneva 
iraq insists the shattalarab which forms the southern boundary 
between the two countries be cleared of wrecked ships and silt 
choking the estuary after iran and iraq went to war in a border 
dispute 
iraq also has repudiated a 1975 treaty that established the 
southern boundary as running down the middle of the shattalarab 
and insists the border should be along the iranian shoreline 
on wednesday iraqi ambassador ismat kittani repeated his 
countrys stand that the 1975 treaty must be renegotiated to 
guarantee iraqs use of the shattalarab and iran would have to 
begin dredging the waterway he also said iran must guarantee iraqs 
right of free navigation in the persian gulf halting the searches 
of ships en route to iraq 
mahallati said iraqs goal is to abrogate the 1975 treaty to gain 
control over the shattalarab and added the 1975 agreement 
cannot be touched revised amended modified 
no iraqi authority has ever said why we cannot begin cleaning 
it the waterway under the 1975 treaty 
kittani may have indicated a more flexible iraqi stance wednesday 
when he said that under any shattalarab agreement both nations 
would have the right to use the passage

michael milken drexel burnham lambert 
incs junk bond chief whos at the center of a federal 
insidertrading probe says the nearly 2yearold investigation has 
taken a personal toll 
the last 20 months have been very painful the strain has been 
enormous milken said in a rare interview published in the 
trentonian newspaper friday 
am i operating at my fullest capacity no will my life be 
shorter possibly i dont know how many more wrinkles there are on 
my heart 
drexel milken and three other key employees were accused sept 7 
by the securities and exchange commission of insider trading stock 
manipulation and other civil fraud charges criminal charges also 
have been expected since federal prosecutors notified drexel earlier 
this month that it was the target of a grand jury investigation 
the defendants have denied any wrongdoing 
the investigation stems from disclosures by stock speculator ivan 
boesky who paid the sec a record 100 million in 1986 to settle 
insider trading charges and is serving a 3year prison term for 
conspiring to lie to the agency 
milken declined to discuss the charges in the interview 
stressing instead what he called his deep affection for his family 
and extensive philanthropic activities 
a native californian who is considered the pioneer of the 100 
billion market for highyield securities known as junk bonds milken 
is known for working 12hour days seven days a week and reportedly 
makes 40 million a year 
but he said professional milestones pale in significance to a 
sons problems with seizures and his fathers bout with cancer 
my first bond issue he asked it was less satisfying than 
finding out what was wrong with son greg less satisfying than 
learning lance another son was chosen valedictorian 
a dream day he added would begin with my wife calling me to 
says shes pregnant 
his wife lori a high school sweetheart whom milken married at 
22 remains fiercely proud and defensive of him 
ive told the children your father is a genius and has 
revolutionized the finance industry she said in the interview 
people dont like change and theyre trying to get rid of your 
father and if you look in your history books youll see that 
people who have tried to make change have had this happen 
the trentonian is owned by ingersoll publications co whose 
chief executive ralph ingersoll is a friend of milkens and a

president jose napoleon duarte 
says his government instilled greater respect for human rights among 
the armed forces but he acknowledged salvadorans still fear 
retribution for reporting rights abuses 
duarte said friday his administration has been totally 
dedicated to converting our military officers into faithful 
supporters of the fundamental rights of the salvadoran people 
but el salvador lacked the technical ability to investigate 
thoroughly the activities of death squads and abuses of authority by 
security forces the president said at a meeting of government 
rights officials from costa rica honduras and el salvador 
witnesses are afraid to talk duarte acknowledged he called el 
salvador a country where the people have kept quiet out of fear 
where they are afraid they will be killed if they create problems 
duarte 62 is suffering from liver cancer and returned oct 16 
from a weeklong stay in washington where he received chemotherapy 
treatment doctors in june gave him up to 18 months to live 
duarte said his administrations rights record was all the more 
notable because the government is mired in a 9year civil war 
against leftist guerrillas 
we have made great advances in the promotion the protection 
and the state of human rights despite the limitations our 
challengers impose upon us day after day and the merciless attack of 
subversive forces and international terrorism said duarte who 
was elected in 1984 
earlier this week the londonbased amnesty international human 
rights organization said hundreds of suspected government opponents 
were slain in the past two years by death squads that usually 
include members of police or military units 
duartes government has not prosecuted anyone for suspected 
deathsquad activity 
a federal judge did issue arrest warrants for four soldiers 
following the killings of 10 villagers in september but no arrests 
have been made 
witnesses said soldiers killed seven men and three women in the 
village of aldea 31 miles east of the capital after accusing them 
of collaborating with the rebels 
the armed forces first said the victims were rebels and later 
claimed they were killed by the guerrillas 
the arrest warrants were issued following an investigation by the 
attorney general 
an estimated 65000 people have been killed in the civil war the 
majority of the victims were civilians

prince charles likened modern british architecture 
to the blandness of nuclear reactors and computers saying a city is 
lucky today if it doesnt have its heart torn out and thrown 
away 
in a friday night television program that he wrote and presented 
the 39yearold heir to the british throne said developers should 
listen to ordinary people and what they want when rebuilding inner 
cities 
charles who has no formal training in architecture said in the 
british broadcasting corp program that britain was in the middle of 
another building boom and the important question was whether we 
can get it right this time with this second chance 
his impassioned argument was a return to the theme he took up 
last december when he stirred national controversy by saying 
architects planners and developers had done more damage to londons 
skyline than had german bombings in world war ii 
on a boat trip down the river thames the prince said the 
concrete national theater seems like a clever way of building a 
nuclear power station in the middle of london 
looking at a lowslung starkwhite block among the victorian 
buildings at the edge of the thames charles said thats redolent 
of a word processor 
could you imagine the french doing that sort of thing in paris 
on the banks of the seine around notre dame asked charles or 
the venetians building tower blocks next to san marco 
his comments drew mixed reaction 
legislator ron brown of the socialist opposition labor party said 
charles speaks basic good sense 
max hutchinson presidentelect of the royal institute of british 
architects said charles has chosen to criticize architects and 
architects alone

the outcome of the twoweek effort to free 
two california gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals 
faced 200 miles of iceclogged waters on the way to their winter 
home 
indeed the sentiment among rescuers friday was that ignorance 
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than 1 million 
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them 
a lot of people just didnt want to know about their fate 
said federal marine mammal biologist jim harvey 
rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the 
animals that entailed additional expense and rescue coordinator 
ron morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from 
tracking a pair of young lost whales 
but hopes were high they would survive they had the will to 
live they should make it morris said 
the whales on friday reluctantly took advantage of an escape 
route from alaskas icebound northern coast afforded them by an 
alliance of groups that are often at odds with each other eskimo 
whalers the military the oil industry environmentalists the 
soviet union and the north slope borough a countylike government 
the soviet icebreaker vladimir arseniev made four runs late 
thursday through the last 300 yards of ice between open water and 
the manmade breathing holes where the whales were resting when 
darkness fell 
on its final run during the night the arseniev reported that one 
whale entered the channel the ship had left in its wake 
but when eskimos checked on the whales friday morning they still 
were in the last breathing hole the eskimos were prepared to resume 
leading the whales to open water by cutting more holes with chain 
saws 
then the whales disappeared 
they were looking good north slope borough mayor george 
ahmaogak said after the last sighting of the animals 
it was several hours after dawn friday before rescuers could take 
to the air to confirm the whales were gone no trace of them was 
found which was interpreted favorably 
morris said he believed the whales were on their way saying 
there was at least three miles of open water in the direction they 
had to go to resume their annual migration to baja california 
originally three whales were found trapped by an early freeze 
they were discovered oct 13 after being stuck in the ice off point 
barrow about a week one disappeared oct 21 nearly five miles from 
open water and is presumed dead 
the surviving whales named crossbeak and bonnet by rescuers 
were bleeding from cuts and abrasions late thursday 
questions were raised about the whales apparent dependence on 
mans help and their attraction to the noise of the chain saws but 
harvey said he expected the whales to revert quickly to their 
natural behavior 
gray whales generally migrate within sight of land usually no 
more than three miles offshore harvey said 
gary hufford of the national weather service said that might 
present a problem since the ice near shore was more solid than the 
ice farther out 
its going to force them out hufford said what thats 
going to do to them we dont know 
because the whales no longer can rely on the regularly spaced 
breathing holes provided by the eskimos they would have to be 
willing to search out random openings in the unstructured and 
constantly changing ice ahead of them hufford added 
with the population of california gray whales estimated at more 
than 20000 and growing marine mammal experts here said there is no 
scientific reason for special efforts to save the whales even 
though they are considered endangered 
david withrow a whale specialist from the governments marine 
mammal laboratory said the species may actually be better off 
without these two whales because they were not clever enough to 
migrate in the right direction at the right time 
in the time that united states northernmost community became the 
focus of worldwide attention native craftsmen geared up to meet the 
demand for souvenirs the whale saga also spawned a tshirt 
industry with at least three commemorative logos marketed

a 1 billion redesign that improved the b2 
stealth bomber was possible because the procurement of the 
controversial b1b bomber bought designers the time they needed the 
air force chief of staff says 
gen larry d welch described the redesign which makes the 
stealth bomber less visible on radar and a stronger offensive threat 
at low altitudes as a brilliant effort by northrop corp 
engineers 
the redesign effort was a marvelous thing to be able to do 
because we had the time to do it he said friday in a meeting with 
reporters at a national symposium of the air force association 
such a redesign would have been impossible if the pentagon had 
not acquired the controversial b1b allowing those involved on the 
stealth bomber project a margin of comfort in developing the best 
possible design for the b2 welch said 
if we hadnt had the b1 we would have felt an intense 
pressure to accelerate development on the b2 and i think that 
would have been a disaster welch said 
originally the b2 was designed to penetrate enemy airspace at 
high altitudes welch said but the 1 billion redesign financed by 
the air force makes the plane strong enough to penetrate enemy 
defenses at low altitudes where there is more air turbulence he 
said 
the overhaul which was a computeraided design was accomplished 
before any aircraft were constructed the modifications also reduced 
the bombers visibility to radar and will extend the aircrafts 
life welch said 
the first public display of the bomber is scheduled for nov 22 
at palmdale calif where the bomber is being assembled under tight 
security 
welch defended the air force acquisition of the b1b bomber 
saying that it gave the united states the benefit of added nuclear 
deterrence while the stealth bomber was developed 
some congressmen have criticized the b1b for being unable to 
perform initially at the full range of specifications set for it 
most of the controversy focused on the bombers equipment designed 
to fool hostile air defenses the air force calls the b1b the most 
sophisticated and capable bomber flying 
the stealth bomber has been described as a flying wing 
reminiscent of the yb49 bomber developed in the 1940s that bomber 
was never put into production because the air force opted to build 
more conventional aircraft 
the b2 design involved a revival of the flying wingtype 
aircraft which lacks a traditional fuselage welch said the key to 
the redesign was finding the best type of wing to build 
the most recent air force cost estimate to build the 132 bombers 
requested has been around 37 billion welch said but he 
quickly added thats wrong he said that amount did not take 
into account the approximately 1 billion used in the redesign 
effort and other costs 
a new and presumably higher cost estimate will be submitted to 
congress soon and should be unclassified for the public soon after 
that welch said a recent general accounting office study said the 
bomber fleet could cost more than 68 billion

richard oyer keeps getting words that 
multiply out to be a million but he has far from a million of them 
oyer a junior high school teacher here got national publicity 
when he assigned his mathematics students the task of finding such 
words in the assignment letters in each word are given a numerical 
value and had to be multiplied to equal 1 million 
for example the letter a has a value of one b a value of two 
and so on 
oyer said at the time he assigned the project that he knew of at 
least two words that multiplied to 1 million students patrick 
sawhill and allen schneider figured out the first one as typey 
an adjective that means to embody the ideal characteristics of its 
type or breed 
sawhill came up with the second one that oyer knew of 
teaette a noun meaning tea maker oyer checked the words in 
websters third international dictionary 
since then another student jeremy yoder uncovered 
beddybye meaning bedtime in baby talk 
oyer said hes received a letter from a des moines woman that 
includes two more milliondollar words

swarms of locusts carried across the 
atlantic by tropical storms have landed on this caribbean island and 
begun a feeding frenzy experts say 
rene colon director of plant sanitation for the commonwealths 
agriculture department said it was the first time locusts have been 
seen in puerto rico the insects were first discovered in at least 
12 caribbean nations last week 
these are flying eating machines which can easily outrun 
humans colon said friday they are on a feeding frenzy and they 
destroy anything green in their path 
locusts are migratory grasshoppers that travel in hordes 
stripping vast areas of vegetation officials said the locusts 
about three inches long with pinkish legs pose no threat to humans 
colon said the locusts were spotted in puerto rico this week by 
children who thought they were praying mantises 
since last week the locusts have been devouring vegetation in 
the caribbean islands of barbados jamaica st vincent st lucia 
dominica martinique antigua barbuda and the grenadines they have 
also been sighted as far south as guyana and suriname in south 
america 
experts say the locusts were blown thousands of miles from africa 
by hurricane gilbert last month and by hurricane joan this month 
theyre exhausted from coasting with these storms and theyre 
starving said colon 
he said agriculture officials are spraying pesticides but werent 
having much success because in seconds they can hop 200 meters 
660 feet these are flying insects 
specialists from the united nations food and agriculture 
organization have been islandhopping around the caribbean to help 
local authorities eradicate the locusts they say the situation is 
mostly under control 
fao specialist phil symmons said pesticide sprays as well as 
blackbirds and other predators have controlled the locust invasion 
in most islands but that it was feared the insects left eggs he 
recommended that spraying continue 
officials said damage estimates and crop losses were still being 
evaluated sugarcane corn and bananas comprise most of the crops 
grown in these nations 
colon said locusts ravaged one farmers cornfield in aibonito in 
central puerto rico about 25 miles from the capital of san juan 
he said the agriculture department ruled out using planes to 
spray fields because it would cost us millions 
we are just hoping native birds will eat them or that they will 
go away if they appeared they can also disappear he said 
he said the insects were also sighted at roosevelt roads us 
naval base on the eastern end of puerto rico and in old san juan 
the historical spanish colonial sector of town and a major tourist 
attraction 
the agriculture ministry in guyana said on friday that spraying 
will continue over the weekend but so far the locusts have mainly 
eaten grass 
other caribbean islands were also continuing their spraying 
campaigns

drawing scholars and gayrights leaders nationwide to yale 
university this weekend to discuss topics ranging from homosexuality 
in japanese girls comics to housework in gay and lesbian families 
more than 500 people are expected up from about 300 last year 
organizers said 
the conference is the second to be sponsored by the 2yearold 
lesbian amp gay studies center at yale an organization of faculty 
staff and students devoted to promoting research bearing on the 
lives and history of gay people 
among the topics to be explored are art and the gay search for 
self gays and the mass media homosexuality as part of 
religious life and psychological perspectives on the aids 
epidemic 
interest in last years conference proved strong enough to expand 
this years program with 21 panel sessions scheduled for today and 
sunday 
people are thrilled absolutely thrilled it gives them a very 
august forum to discuss what it means to be a gay or lesbian in this 
world said brian wescott a yale graduate student and member of 
the lesbian amp gay studies center 
having the conference at yale which helped publicize the event 
helps confer on it an authority it might not otherwise have he 
said 
last years inaugural conference drew widespread publicity 
because it fell within weeks of yale president benno c schmidts 
strong criticism of a wall street journal essay that said yale had 
developed the reputation of being a gay school 
the conference is bringing together more than 100 scholars 
artists gay politicians and political activists from around the 
country 
in a panel discussion tonight jean oleary the first avowed 
lesbian appointed to the democratic national committee was to 
discuss her experiences in politics 
in seeking new ways to encourage scholarship on homosexual 
issues organizers decided to have at least one session feature 
research by undergraduates 
yale senior kristine franklins topic is gender roles power 
relations and housework in gay and lesbian families she studied 
12 gay and 12 lesbian families to find out among other things who 
did the housework when traditional gender roles were not involved 
she found that those with less power did more housework 
scholarship on homosexuality was growing even before the 
conferences were arranged at yale said ralph hexter an associate 
professor of classics at yale and one of the organizers 
what the conference does he said is provide a forum to find 
out what other people are doing 
the whitney humanities center at yale has contributed 1000 to 
the 12000 cost of the conference because the conference is free 
to participants the remainder of the costs will have to be covered 
through donations wescott said

residents near a uranium processing plant 
that spilled radioactive dust into the environment complained on 
television of birth defects and cancer and demanded the plant be 
cleaned up 
the feed materials production center in fernald has been widely 
criticized since the us department of energy admitted in january 
1985 that at least 200000 pounds of uranium oxide dust has been 
released into the atmosphere from the plant during its 37 years of 
operation 
doe officials said last week they had no plans to close the plant 
and have begun a 10year 500 million program to clean up and 
modernize it 
i dont see why we should have to wait for more studies we 
should just make them stop said an unidentified woman who drew 
applause from the audience during the live donahue show friday 
many said cancer has afflicted members of their families who live 
near the plant others in the town 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
complained their property values have dropped 
host phil donahue invited ohio gov richard f celeste and sen 
john glenn dohio to answer questions in the packed 660seat 
auditorium of hamilton high school hamilton is about two miles from 
fernald 
there were no representatives from the doe which owns the 
1000acre plant or westinghouse materials of ohio which operates 
it under contract 
they werent ducking the show said producer marlene sulip 
they werent invited but we sent them 60 tickets which they 
accepted 
dr richard luftic a professor of special education at miami 
university of ohio said there is a high incidence of cancer and 
spina bifida reported among children in the area babies with spina 
bifida are born with unclosed spines 
usually you find spina bifida once in a million births there 
are two of them down there next door to each other said luftin 
stanley chesley a cincinnati lawyer representing 14000 
residents who filed a 300 million class action lawsuit against the 
former plant operator nlo said he expects to win and the energy 
department to pay the damages nlo formerly was known as national 
lead of ohio 
if we get a judgment there is a clause in nlos contract that 
says doe has to pay the families of the seven astronauts who died 
in the space shuttle crash received fair payment i think these 
people are entitled to fair payment 
celeste and glenn agreed that fernald should be inspected by an 
independent commission of experts the secrecy of the doe has 
created this mess they cant be trusted to do the job glenn said 
glenn called on the reagan administration to budget at least 5 
billion a year to clean up 15 nuclear processing sites in the united 
states 
about 200 fernald neighbors turned out thursday night at a church 
in ross where us rep thomas luken accused the doe of lying and 
misleading the public about safety 
he noted doe admissions in us district court in cincinnati last 
week that there were no safe levels of uranium radiation the 
admissions were made in response to the residents class action suit 
the doe previously contended that there were safe levels of 
radiation for plant workers but in its court filing the department 
admitted that all exposure to uranium is dangerous 
radioactivity is measured in rem units the maximum acceptable 
level of exposure for government workers is 5 rems a year according 
to guidelines of the national council on radiation five rems is 
equal to about 200 chest xrays 
westinghouse materials says no worker received more than 12 rems 
exposure at the plant 
doe which is defending nlo says the company is not liable 
because all the problems with the plant were the result of doe 
orders 
the department says it cant be sued because it has sovereign 
immunity and that nlo is protected as the departments contractor

the government today welcomed washingtons 
announcement that it will not investigate japanese restrictions on 
rice imports but said they could not accept the demand that japan 
begin opening up its rice market 
agriculture minister takashi sato said japan is willing to 
discuss rice along with other agricultural issues as part of current 
world trade negotiations known as the uruguay round 
but he said he regretted us trade representative clayton 
yeutters warning friday that he will reconsider an investigation 
into japanese rice barriers if japan does not demonstrate 
willingness to open its market to us farm products in trade talks 
in december 
japanese officials maintain that rice as a staple food should 
be protected and the country should continue its selfsufficiency in 
the grain for security reasons 
our position is that the rice issue is not a subject for 
bilateral negotiations sato told reporters 
sato said japan is willing to discuss rice at the uruguay round 
but if the the united states singles out japan with conditions it 
will be difficult for us to respond 
in his announcement yeutter rejected a request from the us 
rice industry for a federal investigation into japanese rice 
barriers the petition was the first major test of a clause in the 
new us omnibus trade act which makes it harder to avoid acting on 
petitions alleging unfair foreign trade practices 
the japanese government regulates the domestic rice market 
buying much of the rice produced by japanese farmers and reselling 
it to consumers at lower prices 
agricultural officials have said japanese restrictions on rice 
imports should not be singled out when many other countries 
including the united states maintain barriers on farm products 
in the world trade talks held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade genevabased japan has called for 
each country to be allowed to restrict imports of certain basic 
foodstuffs

president daniel ortega has accused the 
united states of ordering thousands of rebels to reenter nicaragua 
and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of hurricane 
joan 
meanwhile it was reported today that some us charities trying 
provide humanitarian relief to nicaraguans hurt by the hurricane 
claim they are being hampering in their efforts by the reagan 
administration 
taking advantage of the damage the trauma the yankees have 
already ordered the infiltration of 3000 mercenaries into 
nicaraguan territory ortega said friday in a nationwide radio and 
television address 
in washington state department press officer anita stockman 
denied the allegations no us military aid is being provided to 
the contras at this time she said referring to the rebels 
rebel spokesman bosco matamoros said in washington that the 
contras were receiving only us humanitarian aid 
the fact is mr ortega is trying to conceal the continuous 
buildup they have carried out with the help of cuba and the soviet 
union matamoros said 
ortega said the reagan administration had rearmed the rebels 
known as contras and instructed them to sabotage and slow 
reconstruction work and delay the coffee harvest economically 
vital to nicaraguas already staggering economy 
facing a threat such as this when we are facing the 
consequences of this hurricane nicaraguans are obliged to mobilize 
organize to fulfill the job of defending the country ortega said 
some private us organizations complained the reagan 
administration has refused to assist their efforts to deliver 
donated goods to nicaragua and has even threatened to declare 
shipments of construction supplies illegal under the us economic 
embargo of the country 
its kind of appalling that the white house and the state 
department are interfering in the process of disaster aid richard 
m walden president of operation california a los angelesbased 
relief group organizing an airlift to nicaragua next week was 
quoted as saying today in the los angeles times 
white house and state department officials denied any deliberate 
effort to block private aid but they acknowledged the 
administration has taken few steps to assist the charities the 
times said 
the sovietbacked sandinista government and the ussupported 
contras agreed in march to halt offensive operations in their 7year 
civil war the government unilaterally has extended the truce on a 
monthtomonth basis the current extension ends monday 
ortega offered no proof of his allegations and did not say that 
mobilization meant the government was allowing the ceasefire to 
lapse 
most of the contras retreated to base camps in honduras after the 
us congress refused to renew arms aid legislation approved by 
congress does allow delivery of food shelter clothing and medical 
services to the rebels 
the leftist government frequently has compared the effort to 
survive last weeks killer hurricane to its struggle against the 
contras on friday ortega repeated his assertion that an end to 
contra aid would be the best hurricane assistance the united states 
could offer 
citing the latest government data ortega said hurricane joan 
left 103 dead and 186950 homeless previous government figures 
estimated the number of dead at more than 60 with about 300000 
homeless 
ortega said 110 people were missing an additional 178 were 
seriously hurt and 324861 were evacuated from their homes 29152 
homes were destroyed 33 bridges were destroyed and 33 others 
damaged and 400 miles of roads suffered direct damage 
the cattle and fishing industries and rice cotton grain 
sugar cacao and african palm crops suffered serious damage and 
unmeasurable ecological damage was done ortega said 
the storm ripped across 200 miles of nicaraguan territory from 
the atlantic to the pacific 
the data indicate we met our main goal to save lives ortega 
said 
he thanked cuba mexico panama spain britain and the european 
economic community for their aid and said east germany and the 
soviet union also promised help 
the president called the aid necessary and urgent

the government says it will hand over an 
american freelance photographer convicted of cocaine trafficking to 
us authorities for transfer to a prison in the united states 
the decision in the case of conan d owen 23 a former intern in 
the office of vice president george bush and whose imprisonment drew 
the attention of thenus attorney general edwin meese was 
announced friday by the spanish cabinet 
a government spokesman said a prisoner exchange agreement between 
spain and the united states permits the transfer of owen who was 
arrested in march 1987 when customs agents found four pounds of 
cocaine in his luggage 
it was not known when owen of annandale va will leave his 
barcelona jail where he is serving a sixyear term 
its normally a fast process said helga soto a spokeswoman 
for the spanish embassy in washington 
it means hes going to come home said a relieved ernest 
owen owens father thats the first thing and were extremely 
happy about that after so many false starts and false hopes 
once in the united states us justice department officials 
could decide to grant owen immediate parole 
its not clear at this time how long or where he would have to 
serve the remainder of his sentence said justice department 
spokesman john russell in washington in keeping with our policy 
he will probably be incarcerated in a federal institution and we 
will try to have him incarcerated as close to his home as possible 
owen who worked in bushs office in 1984 was arrested march 13 
1987 at barcelonas el prat airport customs agents found the 
highgrade cocaine in a falsebottomed suitcase he checked through 
on a flight from santiago chile to barcelona 
owen who spent more than a year in barcelonas 85yearold model 
prison before his trial last march told the court he had been 
conned into taking the suitcase to barcelona from santiago by 
several people who contracted him to take photographs for travel 
brochures he testified he never examined the contents of the 
suitcase 
a threejudge tribunal deliberated 10 days before finding him 
guilty of drug trafficking but cleared him of drug smuggling 
charges there are no jury trials in spain owen was sentenced to 
six years and one day in prison and fined 16000 
following owens conviction meese issued a statement saying the 
us regrets very much this action by the spanish court 
typically each country has its own justice system said the 
statement by meese who resigned in august we respect the spanish 
justice system it is different from ours in certain respects but 
what we can hope for is that we do have good relations with the 
spanish authorities and we hope again we continue to believe that 
the fact that the mans innocence will be ultimately be known and 
understood 
the case raised a furor in the spanish press which saw the 
action of the us justice department and the testimony by several 
agents of the us drug enforcement agency as evidence owen was 
working for the us government when he was caught he denied he was 
working for the us government 
owens attorney appealed the sentence but later dropped the 
attempt under the prisoner exchange agreement between spain and the 
united states all appeals must be exhausted before application is 
made for a transfer

takao fujinami former chief government spokesman 
and a senior member of the governing party admitted today one of 
his aides earned 148000 in profit in 1986 through the sale of 
shares made available to key politicians and business leaders at 
bargain prices 
hideo watanabe another legislator from the ruling liberal 
democratic party also said his secretary took part in dealings 
involving the stock of recruitcosmos co a real estate subsidiary 
of recruit inc currently at the center of a scandal that now 
includes 11 top japanese politicians 
fujinami former top aide to thenprime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone said that only after consulting recently with his 
secretary did he learn the aide had bought shares 
it the purchase was an ordinary commercial practice but i 
regret that the action lacked prudence said fujinami he denied 
allegations that favors had been asked of him by recruit in return 
for the profit his aide earned upon sale of the shares 
fujinami and watanabe are both members of the nakasone faction 
within the ruling party 
prime minister noboru takeshita and finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa admitted earlier that their secretaries purchased unlisted 
shares of recruitcosmos co and then sold them for hefty profits 
after they were offered for overthecounter trading on oct 31 
1986 
although the transactions were legal the incident has raised 
ethical quesitons regarding politicians who take advantage of their 
privileged access to prelisted shares to earn substantial profit 
fujinami said his aide eiji tokuda bought 12000 shares in 
recruitcosmos in september 1986 at 1850 a share and sold them for 
about double as soon they were offered to the public two months 
later watanabe said his secretary purchased 10000 shares of 
recruit cosmos 
as public interest in the scandal mounts opposition parties are 
stepping up their probe 
the tokyo district prosecutors office whose investigators are 
reportedly in possession of a list of recruitcosmos shareholders 
seized from a financial institution last week is checking into the 
possibility of bribery by recruit 
opposition party officials have charged that recruit offered the 
recruitcosmos shares to top politicians business leaders 
journalists and others in exchange for certain privileges or 
services 
we have been able to disclose only 20 percent of all the 
facts said tomio sakagami of the japan socialist party 
prosecutors last week arrested a senior recruitcosmos official 
for allegedly trying to bribe opposition legislator yanosuke 
narazaki with money in return for dropping his investigation of the 
scandal 
narazaki has spearheaded the oppositions investigation aimed of 
the recruit scandal he said friday he had new evidence pointing to 
shady dealings in the purchase of two us supercomputers by a 
japanese telecommunications monopoly and their resale to recruit inc 
nakasone agreed to the supercomputer purchase in a summit meeting 
with president reagan in 1985 
narazaki in an interview with the associated press on friday 
said he had proof the telecommunications giant nippon telegraph and 
telephone corp was providing recruit with special favors by 
selling it the two supercomputers manufactured by us cray 
research inc

the hells angels motorcycle clubs 
national leader convicted for a plot to kill members of a rival 
gang said he feels his group scored a major victory over government 
prosecutors in the 12week trial 
a us district court jury friday convicted five of 10 gang 
members accused of plotting attacks in louisville and elsewhere 
against members of the outlaws 
only ralph sonny barger jr 50 president of the oakland 
calif hells angels chapter and the clubs longtime national 
leader and michael vincent ofarrell 39 a former president of the 
oakland chapter were convicted on felony charges 
i think we won very handily in there it was just too bad that 
irish ofarrell and i were convicted but we will probably win an 
appeal barger said i think it was a devastating blow to the 
government and i couldnt be happier with the verdict except if i 
had been found innocent myself 
barger and ofarrell were convicted of conspiracy to transport 
and receive explosives in interstate commerce with intent to kill 
and damage buildings said duane schwartz of the us attorneys 
office 
the felony conviction carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine 
barger and three others were convicted on another charge dealing 
with a stolen government manual and five others were acquitted on 
all charges schwartz said 
prosecutors said they were pleased with the verdict 
the 10 were among 20 hells angels from kentucky and four other 
states indicted by a federal grand jury last year the remainder are 
to be tried beginning feb 6 
the government contended the defendants planned the attacks in 
revenge for the slaying of john cleve webb a hells angel from 
alaska who was shot outside a jefferson county bar in august 1986 a 
louisville outlaw later pleaded guilty to reckless homicide in 
webbs death 
those convicted were allowed to remain free on bond pending 
sentencing set for march 10 1989

the reagan administration is hampering efforts 
by charities to aid hurricaneravaged nicaragua where the 
sovietbacked sandinista government has long been opposed by the 
united states a relief groups head charges 
weve been told that the political directive came down nothing 
no aid at all said richard m walden president of operation 
california a los angelesbased relief group 
russ kerr director of monroviabased world vision said federal 
officials have given no indication they will help supplement 
whatever assistance his and other private charity groups can raise 
the united states often allows private charities to use military 
cargo planes to deliver aid to disasterravaged countries but both 
kerr and walden said their efforts to obtain such assistance for 
nicaragua have been rebuffed 
as a result kerr said were going to charter a commercial 
cargo plane and its going to cost us 40000 that we could be 
putting into supplies 
white house and state department officials denied they are 
interfering with private efforts to send aid to nicaragua where 
more than 100 people were killed and 187000 left homeless when 
hurricane joan struck last weekend the los angeles times reported 
today 
however white house officials have acknowledged they are 
withholding us government aid to nicaragua while sending it to 
neighboring costa rica 
we dont trust the sandinistas enough to give them aid an 
unidentified white house official told the times we dont know 
how they would make use of it and we expect they would try to 
take credit for it themselves 
another unidentified official told the newspaper that nicaragua 
recently refused an offer of us medical aid because it was part of 
a program that also provided supplies to the usbacked contras 
which are fighting to overthrow the leftist government 
were not going to stand in their way the official said of 
the efforts of private charities but our ability to facilitate 
private aid is limited by virtue of what the sandinista government 
itself has said theyve said our assistance is not welcome 
walden said the administration has told various private aid 
groups that shipments of food clothing and medicine to nicaragua 
are allowed under a us embargo on supplies to the country but 
such items as electric generators and building supplies may not be 
shipped without special government permits 
the state department has promised to expedite its consideration 
of such permits but has refused to promise that any such permits 
will be approved one official told the times

nearly 3000 demonstrators took to the 
streets to protest a california ballot initiative that would require 
disclosure of the names of people infected with aids 
no one was arrested during the noisy protest friday night which 
was sparked when gov george deukmejian announced earlier in the day 
he would vote in favor of proposition 102 
the initiative to appear on the nov 8 ballot would require 
doctors blood banks and others to report to local health officers 
any patients and blood donors they reasonably feel have been exposed 
to aids or have tested positive for the deadly disease 
deukmejian said friday the measure would provide public health 
officials with the critical information they need to stop the spread 
of aids while maintaining the confidentiality of the doctorpatient 
relationship 
the protesters gathered in the largely gay castro district and 
marched several miles past the civic center 
the outrage was motivated by the fact that so many hundreds of 
doctors and healthcare workers have said people should vote no and 
every member of the governors aids advisory council is opposed to 
102 said allen white a leader of the protest staged by 
mobilization against aids and other groups 
meanwhile friday top officials of california universities joined 
the fight against the proposition 
proposition 102 would in our opinion undermine sound medical 
and educational programs now under way in our universities and 
introduce new policies based on a misunderstanding of the public 
health and research needs of our state and nation with respect to 
aids said a statement by the officials signers included stanford 
university president donald kennedy university of california 
president david gardner university of southern california president 
james zumberge and about a dozen other educators and medical school 
officials 
the university officials said proposition 102 could discourage 
people in highrisk groups from getting tested for aids and 
volunteering as research subjects

winning north americas largest lottery jackpot about a 60 million 
windfall that triggered sales 10 times higher than usual 
most of their dreams will end with the crumpling of worthless 
tickets but anyone who picks the six numbers chosen in the 
televised drawing at 757 pm will win 3 million in beforetax 
annual income for 20 years 
the prize will bring the title for the continents biggest 
jackpot back to california exceeding the 551 million prize 
awarded by florida on sept 3 
among those who stood in line to buy the 1 lottery tickets 
friday was dorothy williams 53 of san francisco 
i come from a long line of people with money she said but 
you know it wouldnt hurt to replenish the bloodline so to speak 
with a little new cash 
lee tran a 29yearold vietnamese immigrant standing in a line 
of 10 people at a convenience store in san francisco offered 
another motivation my whole family has put up money for our 
chance to win the big jackpot this is our dream this is why we 
came to america to make it big 
tran who lives in a threeroom apartment with eight other 
people was undaunted by the 1in14million odds of picking the 
correct six numbers out of 49 numbers 
lotto 649 players friday contributed to sales for the day 
projected at nearly 30 million said state lottery spokesman bob 
taylor normal sales for a friday would be about 3 million he 
added 
the pace easily exceeded that of june 3 when the lottery logged 
227 million in sales preceding the award the next day of a 514 
million jackpot taylor said 
sales today were expected to surpass those of friday he said 
the jackpot for todays drawing was estimated in the 55million 
range thursday after four previous jackpots were rolled over to the 
prize but with gambling heavier than estimated the staterun 
lottery on friday revised the projected jackpot which also grows 
through sales of tickets upward to more than 57 million 
the lottomania that has stricken californians means the figure 
likely will go higher perhaps 60 million or more before betting 
is cut off at 745 pm lottery officials said 
meantime a state appeals court in san francisco ruled friday 
that lottery winners who owe child support may have their winnings 
used to determine the level of support they must pay 
the court ruled that 100000 won by a man in the state lottery 
in 1986 is income which is used to determine the level of child 
support the appeals court ruling reverses a lower court decision 
that lottery winnings are property not income

antiaircraft missiles worth 19 billion to jordan until it began 
peace talks with israel 
an angry hussein rejected the pressure and vowed never again to 
seek a major weapons system from the united states 
he went to the soviet union for antiaircraft missiles and to 
france and britain for advanced jet fighters but jordan still uses 
large amounts of american weaponry and trains many of its officers 
in the united states 
carlucci leaves jordan for egypt on monday and ends his tour in 
israel a few days after that country goes to the polls nov 1 to 
elect a new government he will be the first us defense secretary 
to visit israel since 1984

the fur

this was not scary although i couldnt talk at one point 
dupnik said but i could breathe for the most part

hurricane joan may have caused more 
material damage to nicaragua in 24 hours than a civil war has in 
seven years striking a savage blow at an economy many thought could 
not be worse 
the week following the oct 22 hurricane revealed massive 
destruction tens of thousands of homes were blown apart and mud 
slides covered villages crops roads and bridges were washed out 
more than 100 people died and more than 180000 were left 
homeless in the nation of 3 million at least 33 bridges were 
destroyed and another 33 were damaged 
i have nothing now nothing said luis garcia 36 one of 
those left homeless in the eastern port city of bluefields the 
prices were high the salaries too low to eat now what will 
happen 
rebuilding means more foreign loans and debts crop damage means 
lost revenue and higher domestic prices industrial destruction 
means lower output and unemployment 
before the storm nicaraguas foreign debt was 6 billion 
inflation had spiraled to a 4000 percent annually and the average 
worker earned 20 a month the trade deficit last year was 520 
million 
the sandinista government had blamed most of the economic 
problems on its sevenyear war with usbacked rebels and last 
week it compared the struggle against the storm to the war against 
the contras more than 50 percent of the national budget goes toward 
defense 
neither soviet bloc infusions of 500 million a year nor a series 
of economic measures succeeded in righting the battered economy 
nicaragua once exported rice and beans but now has to import those 
staples 
late last year there were shortages of just about everything 
long lines formed for basics 
authorities had shown some optimism about this years harvests 
because some farmers from wartorn areas returned to their villages 
after a march ceasefire agreement land that had lain fallow for 
years was planted 
but preliminary storm damage estimates indicated severe damage to 
crops nationwide salvaging coffee the largest moneymaker at 122 
million is a top priority 
the government said the plants didnt suffer as much as had been 
feared but that the harvest due to start in november will be 
severely hampered by washed out access roads 
miles and miles of rice paddies in central chontales and rio san 
juan provinces were flooded thousands of head of cattle were lost 
and thousands of acres of banana trees blown over by the winds 
the government figured that up to 40 percent of the banana crop 
which brought in 144 million last year was lost 
the atlantic coast which bore the brunt of hurricane joans 
force suffered the worst damage 
almost every structure in bluefields in scores of indian 
villages and on the corn islands turned to rubble the fishing 
industry the regions main economic activity was paralyzed 
processing plants were destroyed boats shattered 
the government said damage to the fishing industry left 1500 
people unemployed 
in the northcentral mountain villages where most of the war has 
been fought scores of villages were isolated by felled bridges and 
mud slides 
in the southwest officials reported severe loss to bean sorghum 
and corn crops 
by the middle of last week about 6000 homeless from the 
atlantic coast and the south had fled to managua 
the capital is illequipped to handle the new influx having 
absorbed thousands of refugees from war zones water and electricity 
are rationed for the population of about 1 million about onethird 
of the nations inhabitants 
the capital was never rebuilt after the 1972 earthquake that 
killed more than 10000 people ragtag homes of wood with zinc roofs 
sprang up on dirt fields around managua 
public discontent over the economic situation has caused the 
government its worst political and social crises 
the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that 
deposed dictator anastasio somoza 
political opposition figures just weeks before the storm said 
the situation in their country had never been worse 
we can only hope we get international help or we cant do it 
gilberto cuadra the president of a coalition of antigovernment 
private enterprise groups said a few days after the hurricane 
then we have to hope that if 3 billion arrives that the 
sandinista front doesnt keep 1 billion for the army he said

softer lines and longer clothes were two main points 
in the new wave of outfits seen in summer readytowear shows last 
week but the bonanza of choices made any war of the hemlines 
academic 
reallife clothes rather than gimmicky or strange costumes have 
taken over as more designers aim to please practical women rather 
than fashion groupies 
those who love short skirts can still rejoice because there are 
plenty of them but the overly seductive look is fizzling and the 
saucy miniskirt is seen only on the beach 
the new silhouette is called aline trapeze or pyramid a shape 
seemingly inspired by im peis glass pyramid outside the louvre 
to complete the pyramid form shoulders had little or no padding 
full elephantleg palazzo pants or pantskirts have taken the 
city by storm started last season by montana lacroix and lagerfeld 
at chanel theyve caught on 
montana swept the stage with grand pantskirts light as air in 
soft silky fabrics and shades of peach bone and beige with all 
kinds of toppers some had floppy lapels others came with a 
sunpleated flaring skirt effect in the back 
jumpsuits came back into the picture often backless or strapped 
with halter tops lacroix showed his in bright linen topped with a 
bolero 
others showed the pants striped and sporty at chanel they came 
out in white with belted goldbuttoned cardigan jackets 
for hot weather designers brought out wide and fairly long 
shorts some with suspenders little bloomers caught on as well but 
only for the younger crowd 
classic pants at givenchy and saint laurent were splendid tight 
pedal pushers or matador pants were another alternative sometimes 
with flared aline toppers and tunics 
lagerfeld won kudos for his pleated long skirts with cardigans 
and jackets spruced up with stripes near the hem for distinctive 
athome wear he offered flowered coat dresses 
saint laurents best concession to the trapeze line was a fitted 
white pique sun dress with a circular skirt 
most designers gave a nod to the short skirt and those who 
lopped off hemlines can still feel safe givenchy valentino saint 
laurent and others varied the straight skirt with tulip wrapped or 
backwrapped models 
for understated chic the jacket was very long at yamamoto saint 
laurent showed faultless tailored suit models lacroix had several 
boleros and bohans jackets at dior had his favorite little 
martingale back belt 
fitted short or long jackets with a suggestion of a peplum over 
lean dresses or suits added curves to ultrafeminine suits and 
strapless cocktail dresses middyblouse collars and swopped curved 
lapels gave suits and dresses a new look 
the yachting life inspired most designers who added sailor 
outfits to their array of clothes 
safaristyle clothes came with belted bush jackets and shorts 
wild animal spots on all softs of fabrics dressed up in chiffon for 
evening wear at saint laurent 
scherrer introduced an africanprint swimsuit with an 
offshoulder wrap and matching chiffon tropical print jumpsuit 
angelo tarlazzi did his indian look with long silk tunics or 
jackets with a sariscarf wrap over skirts and pants valentinos 
print mixes harked back to the layered looks of the 60s 
while the strapless bustier is still around in evening wear 
puffy overdecorated dresses have given away to sophisticated dinner 
dresses and tea gowns or flowing pajamas with draped tops that look 
back to the 1930s 
besides the ubiquitous navy black and white colors were at 
opposite poles subtle and autumnal or flashy and bright the 
subdued shades included putty sand burnt orange ruddy brown 
mossy greens khaki and pea soup for a softer touch in the fluid 
clothes designers worked with fabrics in smoky rose peach and 
spice tones like mustard saffron cinnamon and cafe au lait 
in the hotter scheme optimists like lacroix chose sunny yellow 
acid tones of lime and chartreuse neon green electric pink flame 
red peacock and turquoise 
for the new wearable clothes fabrics looked softer than ever 
from zephyrlight wools for daytime to organza crepe de chine and 
silk chiffon lame and luxrex for evening 
linen is still a favorite but it looks less rumpled this year 
poplin cotton voile cloque fabrics and pique were other summer 
favorites and lace was splashed about with abandon

a fault found at the last minute in one of the 
launch systems of the soviet space shuttle forced scientists today 
to indefinitely postpone the maiden voyage of the unmanned craft 
the official tass news agency said a computer halted the 
countdown 51 seconds before launch to prevent the booster known as 
energiya from hitting the launch platform during liftoff 
the assembly platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts 
didnt move away from the energiya body to a safe distance 
tass said the platform is believed to be an armlike structure that 
stretches to the booster 
a computer that senses 140 elements of the launch system 
terminated the launch process tass said the report quoted the test 
control chief at the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia air 
force maj gen v gudilin 
gudilin told tass he didnt think it would be long before the 
launch would be attempted again but he said a thorough analysis of 
todays problem would have to be completed before a new blastoff 
date was decided 
fuel was drained from the rocket tass said and it appeared a 
second launch attempt would not be made today 
the shuttle named buran or snowstorm in russian was originally 
set to lift off late friday from the baikonur launch site on the 
central asian steppe in kazakhstan but tass and radio moscow 
announced earlier today a fourhour delay one halfhour after the 
scheduled launch time expired 
then seconds before liftoff a second time tass in a terse 
statement announced there was an indefinite delay 
there was no live report from baikonur by either radio or 
television foreign reporters were not allowed to travel to baikonur 
buran was to make two orbits and return to a concrete landing 
strip eight miles from the launch site reports indicated the 
initial flight would be devoted entirely to checking out the craft 
and would not be used to deploy satellites or conduct any other 
missions 
ships stationed in the atlantic and pacific oceans a satellite 
network and a string of ground stations were poised to communicate 
with the craft and monitor its flight soviet television said in a 
brief report 
buran is attached to the energiya rocket the worlds most 
powerful launcher and four liquidfuel boosters it looks like the 
us space shuttle 
but soviet officials say it can carry a payload of 66000 pounds 
compared to the us shuttles 55000 pounds is safer and more 
flexible 
the fully automated guidance system permits scientists to send 
the craft into space for the first time without cosmonauts 
decreasing the risk to human life soviet officials said 
in the past the officials have been critical of the us shuttle 
program that was stalled until this fall after seven astronauts were 
killed in the explosion of the challenger in january 1986 
in a report late friday the television news program vremya 
revealed soviet military involvement in the soviet shuttle program 
as always in our country military specialists participate in 
crucial dangerous tests a correspondent said in a report from 
baikonur 
it identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations 
as alexander a maksimov it identified him as the defense 
ministrys top specialist on multipleuse space transport systems 
and the prospect of their development 
soviet officials repeatedly have criticized military use of the 
us space shuttle and have called for space to be used only for 
peaceful purposes 
the us defense department in its 1988 publication soviet 
military power says the soviets might use a shuttle to deploy 
antisatellite and ballistic missile defense weapons 
reports friday said the buran can carry as many as 10 people 
four cosmonauts and six passengers and placed its cost of energiya 
and buran at about that of the us shuttle some 10 billion 
energiya which can lift a payload of more than 100 tons has 
been used only once before on a test flight in may 1987 its 
payload failed to reach orbit but soviet officials said the problem 
was with the guidance system of the satellite rather than with the 
gigantic booster

israels 29 million voters are feeling edgy and 
shorttempered as the campaign for tuesdays parliamentary elections 
draws to a close 
a great deal is at stake 
for the first time since israel captured the west bank and gaza 
strip in 1967 the central issue in a national election campaign is 
whether most of the occupied territories can be safely exchanged for 
peace 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc says 
no foreign minister shimon peres of the leftleaning labor 
party says yes 
the two parties represent more than different attitudes toward 
making peace with the arabs they envision two different israels 
in the broadest terms the elections pit two images of israel 
against each other said harry wall the israel director of the 
usbased antidefamation league 
five wars and 40 years of conflict with the arabs have made 
israelis suspicious peres has found it difficult to overcome 
voters doubts about jordans king hussein as a potential peace 
partner 
a campaign debate on ben yehuda street the central shopping 
thoroughfare illustrated the reservations 
if king hussein wants peace so bad why hasnt he done anything 
in the past four years a man in his 20s shouted at a labor party 
worker promoting the idea of an international peace conference 
if we give up the land the palestinians will have a state it 
will make the arabs stronger and we will have a war again in 10 
years said another young man waving his finger at the labor 
activist 
peres has tried to use such fears to his partys advantage 
if likud annexes the territories we are going to have an arab 
majority he said during a tour of the likud stronghold of ramle 
in central israel 
there are fewer arabs than jews in israel and the occupied 
territories but peres was referring to the majority that could 
result from arab births 
to dispel doubts about king husseins sincerity peres aides 
worked behind the scenes to arrange for the jordanian monarch to 
appear on abcs nightline and to call peres peace ideas a 
step forward 
in the only tv debate of the campaign peres drove home the point 
that he had a possible partner in peace talks and tried to put 
shamir on the defensive 
but the 10monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories seems to have worked in favor of likud which advocates 
the use of more military force to put down protests 
in peoples minds defense takes precedence over peace and 
labors defense minister yitzhak rabin has not been successful in 
putting down the intefadeh said pollster hannoch smith using the 
arab term for the uprising 
wall said likuds commitment to retaining all the land of israel 
is underscored more by distrust than dogma it stems from the fear 
that jews historys perennial victims can expect no favors from 
the outside world and certainly none from arab enemies he said 
labors israel is more selfassured he said labor sees israel 
as belonging to the western community of nations and willing to take 
risks to remain so and to break the cycle of war he said 
the views tend to be fixed from one election to another 
what is changing is the demographic makeup of the electorate and 
this is working in likuds favor 
a larger percentage of voters are younger many serve in the 
occupied territories and polls indicate they have more hawkish 
views as a result 
also for the first time a majority of voters are sephardic or 
jews whose families come from middle eastern nations they have 
traditionally adopted a tougher line on dealing with the arabs than 
the ashkenazim of european lineage 
those wavering between the two major blocs are estimated to range 
between 4 percent and 8 percent of the vote television ads and 
personal campaign appearances have concentrated on winning over 
these socalled floating voters 
the polished and articulate peres a 65yearold protege of 
israels first premier david bengurion has consistently shown 
more personal popularity in polls than the crusty and 
uncommunicative shamir a 73yearold former operations chief of the 
mossad intelligence agency and a prestate underground leader with a 
passion for secrecy 
but both are familiar to israeli voters and their arguments have 
been heard repeatedly since 1984 when the electorate was evenly 
divided and a national unity government was formed peres and 
shamir have each served two years as prime minister 
its difficult for people to get excited about the elections 
because the players arent very exciting people but i wouldnt say 
the voters are bored theyre interested in the issues said 
yonathan shapiro a political specialist at tel aviv university 
polls indicate the vast majority of israelis do not want another 
coalition government like the one formed after the stalemated 1984 
elections but the polls say the two large parties are running 
neckandneck and a replay is possible

a woman who sued her former pastor for 
seducing her has been awarded 130000 by a jury a verdict intended 
partly as a warning to other ministers 
we want the community to see that this cant keep happening 
juror cathy zurfluh said friday its got to stop somewhere 
carol gabrielson edwards wept after the pierce county superior 
court jury verdict was announced saying she would have been happy 
with a 1 award 
i just didnt want any other woman to ever have to go through 
what i went through she sobbed if i can save one woman from 
ever going through it then thats all i cared about just having 
the 12 agree with me meant the world to me 
after the verdict was announced eileen m lawrence attorney for 
expastor jack mcdonald and his wife shirley served ms edwards 
and her exhusband ira gabrielson of puyallup with a malicious 
prosecution lawsuit 
the decision followed more than two days of deliberations in the 
case against mcdonald and the strifetorn community chapel and bible 
training center an independent pentecostal church based in burien 
a suburb south of seattle 
the tacoma branch of the church has been closed 
during a sixweek trial ms edwards accused mcdonald of coercing 
her into a sexual relationship in 1985 causing her emotional trauma 
and ending her 19year marriage then banishing her from the church 
when she broke off the affair after two months 
the jury found damages of 200000 to ms edwards but reduced the 
award to 130000 by holding that she was 35 percent to blame 
damage to her exhusband was set at 20000 less 15 percent for his 
negligence and the jury awarded him 17000 
its a real triumph for justice said don hannula ms 
edwards attorney hopefully its a message to others in positions 
of authority particularly pastors theyre going to be held to a 
standard in which their behavior is going to be accountable 
much of the testimony dealt with a church teaching that each 
member should become closer to god by forming a spiritual 
connection with someone of the opposite sex other than ones 
spouse dancing together in church services staring into each 
others eyes and spending time together 
scores of followers have been divorced after becoming 
romantically involved with spiritual connection partners and a 
lawsuit pending in king county accuses church founder donald lee 
barnett of sexual misconduct with three church members 
hannula said mcdonald used that doctrine to seduce ms edwards 
after she came to him for spiritual advice and marital counseling

democrat michael dukakis said today the republicans wont stand 
up for american jobs citing white house rejection of rice 
farmers pleas for direct action against japanese trade barriers 
bush said dukakis was trying to divide the country in his campaign 
attacks 
bush setting out on a sixstop bus tour in northeastern 
illinois renewed his own attack on dukakis saying i am not 
going to let that liberal governor divide this country i am going 
to bring it together 
appearing before a crowd that filled a small gymnasium at mchenry 
county community college bush declared he was pleased with how the 
campaign was going but said the result still hangs in the balance 
out there 
id hate to be my opponent dragging myself around the country 
trying to convince americans that everythings going to hell in a 
handbasket bush said 
meanwhile the democrats released the text of a fiveminute paid 
speech vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen will make on 
television sunday night saying that the republicans trash the 
truth 
michael dukakis says that the best for america is yet to come 
and i believe that bentsen says in the ad but in this campaign 
its been hard to think about that america for all the noisy smears 
that fill the airwaves 
dukakis flying west to renew his battle for california left 
boston early today after aides distributed his statement criticizing 
fridays administration decision to turn down a rice industry 
request for a federal investigation of japanese barriers to rice 
imports 
the reaganbush administrations decision to reject the just 
claim of american rice farmers raises the question of whose side 
they are on he said the facts are clear japans determination 
to keep its market closed hurts our farmers and serves only japan 
this decision is only the latest instance of the republicans 
refusal to stand up for american jobs and american farmers in world 
markets dukakis said 
bush speaking a day earlier in sacramento calif where he was 
endorsed by the california correctional police officers association 
and the international association of correctional officers said he 
believes most of the policemen who have endorsed him consider 
themselves democrats 
a lot of mainstream americans feel that the national democratic 
party in 1988 just simply doesnt represent them any more he said 
you might almost say that the democratic party today suffers 
from a splitpersonality with a rank and file made up of some of the 
best of america the silent majority he said but the 
leadership much of it is a remnant of the 60s the new left those 
campus radicals grown old the peace marchers and the nuclear freeze 
activists 
nixon used the term silent majority in a 1969 television address 
after demonstrations against the vietnam war had been mounting he 
appealed for support of his policies from the great silent 
majority of my fellow americans 
bush who attended a rally in omaha neb on his way to 
illinois was courting votes in the chicago suburbs today 
dukakis was to appear later today in the watts section of los 
angeles both campaigns are fighting hard for that states 47 
electoral votes 
in michigan on friday the massachusetts governor found himself a 
short distance from the facility where he rode around in an abrams 
m1 tank sept 13 a televised demonstration that turned into a 
public relations disaster and raw material for a bush ad 
recalling a remark bush made earlier this year while describing 
the efficiency of soviet tank maneuvers dukakis said i am very 
concerned when a vice president of the united states who wants to be 
president comes back from europe and says to the american people 
id like to bring some of those soviet mechanics over here to tell 
american workers what to do 
his paraphrase of bushs words brought boos from the crowd in 
warren mich where tanks are manufactured 
i dont think we need any soviet mechanics telling american 
workers how to produce dukakis said 
dukakis has been interviewed on a series of network television 
programs recently as he tries to make up ground in the polls and he 
accused his republican rival of avoiding such encounters as the 
election nears 
mr bush is out there in his little cocoon dukakis said 
they wont let him out were taking our case directly to the 
american people 
top campaign official john sasso was telling reporters that polls 
taken by the campaign showed dukakis gaining nationally this week 
and drawing within four points in the important state of california 
independent polls have shown national bush leads of eight to 15 
points but sasso said there is measurable movement this week in 
dukakis direction he declined to give exact numbers 
dukakis running mate bentsen was back in his native texas to 
cast an absentee ballot that includes his name on the presidential 
ticket and as a contender for reelection to the us senate 
indiana sen dan quayle back in washington after campaigning in 
pennsylvanias republican heartland sounded a halloween theme 
during his travels friday 
quayle said dukakis might be having trouble deciding what to wear 
monday night if he dresses up like a moderate he scares the 
liberals in his party he said if he dresses like a 
conservative nobody will believe it and if he comes as he is he 
scares america

its usually in the morning that the proponent

thoughts the firebreathing george bush shows up later in the day 
in the waning days of the campaign there often seem to be two 
george bushes on the campaign trail the statesman and the slasher 
and while campaign strategists vigorously deny they are seeking 
to project a split personality bush himself has joked with 
reporters about skippy my evil twin referring to a character 
created by gb trudeau doonesbury cartoonist and bush nemesis 
late last week the republican presidential nominee vowed at a 
campaign stop in california to ease up on the negative side and 
bring a kinder and quieter finish to this campaign but that 
didnt last long 
in the same remarks he lashed rival michael dukakis anew for the 
nowchanged massachusetts prison program under which a murder 
convict escaped while on furlough and attacked a maryland couple 
bushs roadshow managers have come up with a formula that for 
the most part they have been sticking to since the final 
presidential debate two weeks ago one major speech per day on a 
selected issue usually in the morning followed by lively stump 
rallies before friendly audiences 
the serious speeches sometimes including lofty passages are 
usually done early enough to enable bushs words to find time on the 
evening network television shows 
and the speeches are often reinforced by television commercials 
running at the same time for instance the airing of the bush 
campaign ad ridiculing dukakis ride in an army tank if defense is 
the issue of the day 
the morning speeches give bush a steady measured even 
presidential bearing for national consumption aides suggest 
they also enable him to deny that he is engaging solely in negative 
campaigning 
at the same time the slashing rallies usually held later in the 
day often in high school gymnasiums packed with squealing 
teenagers give the campaign a driving edge while keeping local gop 
campaign workers energized 
the nice bush talks about bipartisanship in foreign policy 
about ending chemical weapons about a larger vision of a free 
world at peace of working together to create opportunity and a 
good life for all about joining our voices in a mighty chorus 
that will end homelessness 
but his mean twin snarls read my lips no new taxes 
declares im not the guy that named massachusetts 
taxachusetts and tells audiences that convicts who might be 
invited to make my day by actor clint eastwood are bid have a 
nice vacation by dukakis 
he continually calls dukakis a cardcarrying member of the 
aclu drawing out the letters aclu with sarcasm and suggesting 
dukakis sympathizes more with the rights of prisoners than of 
victims he brands his rival untested and inexperienced in 
foreign policy 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said that the pattern of one 
serious speech a day touching on triedandtested themes 
followed by attack speeches at rallies seems to be working 
despite recent polls suggesting voters are wearying of negative 
campaigning on both sides 
this has been a very mild campaign by any historical 
standards atwater said it hasnt been dirty and there hasnt 
been mudslinging but im not pollyanna we have to deal with 
the system the way it is 
atwater added that in bush appearances as well as in his 
advertising the mix that is being sought is about 5050 
positivenegative but he doesnt call it negative he calls it 
comparative 
and bush himself echoes this line of defense claiming his stump 
blasts at dukakis are not an attack it is a comparative 
difference on the issues 
sometimes bushs jumps between nice and naughty are dizzying one 
recent campaign day he told a university of toledo audience in the 
morning that he wanted to be known as the president who ended the 
use of chemical weapons around the world and who ushered in a 
whole new era of peace 
but a few hours later he was telling a rally in lancaster ohio 
im not going to be outhustled by the liberal governor from 
massachusetts hes got a terrible problem he cant get elected 
unless things get worse and things arent going to get worse unless 
he gets elected 
sometimes bush himself lets audiences know in advance what kind 
of speech theyre going to get 
addressing a police group in new york bush said given the 
enthusiasm that i sense here i would like to help define for you 
the man i am running against and throw a little red political meat 
out there but i cant do it this is for serious things today

the army is rounding up civilians in the 
capital and forcing them under threat of execution to carry 
military supplies through the jungle to rebel battlefronts say some 
burmese who claim to have escaped 
eleven people who say they were forced into unpaid labor were 
interviewed recently at this base of the karen rebels they said 
they were arrested in the capital of rangoon on oct 4 tied with 
ropes and threatened with execution if they tried to escape 
trucked to frontier areas they were loaded down with weapons 
ammunition and other military supplies they said they said they 
were given no food 
ku thein a 48yearold man who said he drives a pedaltaxi said 
some in his group were beaten by government soldiers his own 
shoulders and back were marked by still bleeding scars that he 
blamed on having carried six 81mm mortar shells in a basket 
strapped to his back 
the group said they escaped burmese troops oct 18 
international human rights groups have criticized the burmese 
army for allegedly forcing people to haul supplies into rugged 
frontier areas where ethnic minorities have been fighting for 
autonomy in the past most unpaid workers were taken from the rebel 
groups rather than from the streets of rangoon where burmans 
predominate 
two million of burmas 38 million people are ethnic karens they 
have organized the strongest of about 12 antigovernment 
insurgencies 
rangoons military government which seized power sept 18 and 
crushed a popular uprising for multiparty democracy announced oct 
17 that 1120 people had been rounded up in rangoon to serve as 
porters working for a daily wage 
the announcement described those recruited as looters 
criminals who bunk and sleep in pagoda pavilions buildings and 
railways stations at night and thieves and muggers 
it said students and government workers with permanent homes 
would not be affected by what is popularly known as 
portersnatching 
the 11 interviewed said they had regular jobs which included 
selling pork and working in the rangoon dockyards the dock worker 
said he often slept aboard a ship but others said they had 
permanent homes 
ku thein said he was putting away his taxi when soldiers came to 
arrest him he said they did not tell him why he was being detained 
or where he would be taken 
he and the others said they were paid nothing and had to subsist 
largely on banana shoots and other food they could forage in the 
jungle 
officials of the karen national union the rebel group that 
controls much of the thaiburmese frontier said more than 70 people 
escaped from the forced labor some wanted to return home but 
others feared being seized again the rebels said 
earlier this year amnesty international the londonbased human 
rights group published two reports describing a consistent 
pattern of gross violations of human rights by the burmese 
military in trying to keep down the rebel minorities 
the reports cited summary executions and torture of karens mons 
shans and other ethnic groups as well as killing and extensive 
abuse of unpaid laborers 
josef silverstein an american author of several books on burma 
said that about 13000 peasants were recruited as porters for one 
major offensive against insurgents last year 
they were forced to walk ahead of troops in order to test for 
mines they were forced to carry munitions and supplies and if they 
refused or fell they were beaten and often killed the professor 
at rutgers university said

the 20 people executed during the infamous salem 
witch trials of 1692 are mostly remembered in history lessons and 
tourist attractions but some of their descendants are organizing to 
emphasize their humanity 
we want to keep the memory alive said howard hay of boston 
a descendant of accused witch susanna martin this type of thing 
keeps happening around the world people keep getting persecuted i 
dont know if well ever learn the lesson 
he is president of the recently formed sons and daughters of the 
victims of colonial witch trials which has 45 members all direct 
descendants of the trial victims 
hay founded the group with wayne higley of stoneham a descendant 
of accused witch rebecca nurse they are members of numerous 
genealogical societies and discovered their link to the witch trial 
victims while researching their lineage 
using standard statistical formulas they say there could be up 
to 20 million descendants of the accused witches in the united 
states one of the more famous according to gary boyd roberts of 
the new england genealogical society is joan kennedy former wife 
of sen edward m kennedy whose ancestry dates back to accused 
witch mary esty she is not a member of the group 
the witchcraft hysteria began during the winter of 1691 when a 
west indian slave tituba told voodoo tales to a group of young 
girls and taught them palmistry and magic 
tituba and two other women were killed as witches after a doctor 
examined them and pronounced them bewitched the scare continued for 
about a year resulting in the execution of 20 people and the 
imprisonment of 150 
the descendants group is concentrating on the approaching 300th 
anniversary of the witch trials they hope to hold an observance on 
gallows hill in salem where accused witches were hanged 
until now there hasnt been anything to really remember them 
by hay said there hasnt even been so much as a plaque we 
want people to know the real story these people were human beings 
who were unjustly accused 
higley said many of those first accused of witchcraft were either 
community outcasts or victims of neighborhood feuds 
the group said the city of salem has been uncomfortable about 
remembering the accused witches except in terms of tourist promotion 
these people had no connection with witches higley said 
it was a sad time in colonial history we dont hold a grudge 
against salem but we do think there should be something there to 
remember them the victims 
higley and hay have overseen the design of a 14foot seventon 
bronze statue of three of the accused witches sarah cloyce mary 
esty and rebecca nurse which they would like to see stand at the 
old burying ground in the heart of salem 
the city has not yet approved their proposed site not far from 
the grave of magistrate john hathorne one of the chief hanging 
judges who sentenced esty and nurse to death 
the three women depicted in the statue were sisters daughters of 
william towne of topsfield 
nurse was in her early 70s when she was accused of witchcraft and 
arrested when her sisters cloyce and esty defended her they also 
were arrested and sentenced to death though esty and nurse were 
executed cloyce was left to linger in prison 
cloyce was released in 1696 magistrates of the crown sent to 
investigate the witch trials presented her with three gold 
sovereigns in memory of her two sisters and herself she died three 
weeks after leaving prison 
higley and hay hope people viewing the statue will see the three 
sisters and everyone else persecuted during the trials as real 
people 
itll be the first time anyone has shown these people as real 
human beings higley said

the newly elected city council 
of soweto johannesburgs main black township faces hostile 
constituents when it sets out to tackle its massive problems 
voted into office last week by less than 3 percent of the 
townships 1 million adults the council must deal with a 2yearold 
rent boycott and a 4monthold strike by municipal workers 
thirty of the 35 incumbent councilors including mayor nelson 
botile were ousted in wednesdays election all but one of the 30 
new councilors belong to the sofasonke party headed by former mayor 
ephraim tshabalala a businessman his son mbutana is favored to 
be selected by the new council as botiles successor 
but the 11 percent voter turnout was so low the victors can 
scarcely claim a mandate only 28993 sowetans disregarded a 
nationwide boycott call from antiapartheid leaders and voted in the 
elections 
the low turnout followed a multimilliondollar government 
advertising campaign in which cartooncharacter squirrels urged 
voters to make it happen 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement in a 
statement issued saturday in lusaka zambia said blacks had 
rejected the apartheid local elections with contempt it urged 
newlyelected councilors to resign from their collaborative 
structures and join the ranks of the people 
by law and custom south africa maintains a system of apartheid 
under which its 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs 
which are controlled by the 5 million whites 
the city council faces two major crises a widespread rent 
boycott and a strike by municipal workers whose promised pay 
increases have been delayed because of the boycott 
the rent boycott started in a group of townships south of 
johannesburg in 1985 and spread to soweto in june 1986 it was 
launched to press a variety of political demands including lifting 
a national state of emergency withdrawing security forces from 
black townships and releasing political prisoners 
authorities have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in rent and 
service fees during the boycott an estimated twothirds of sowetos 
households are withholding rent 
in june about 3500 soweto municipal workers went on strike 
irked by the postponement of pay increases and by demands that they 
help break the rent boycott 
about 2000 strikers have been fired those who went back to work 
are mostly office clerks and administrators 
services disrupted by the strike such as garbage collection and 
sewagesystem repairs have resumed on an irregular basis but large 
piles of trash line many of the unpaved streets 
during the election campaign sofasonke leaders made sweeping 
promises to rehire the strikers improve services lower rents and 
halt evictions of rent boycotters 
the sowetan the main daily newspaper in the township attributed 
the sofasonke partys success to support from the old the 
unemployed the homeless and the sickly the partys organizational 
machinery saw to it that voters were wellfed and properly bused to 
election posts 
whether the party fulfills its promises remains to be seen 
black councilors still have a long way to go before being fully 
accepted by residents

the biggest show of artistic treasure ever to 
leave japan including a 700yearold portrait that is the nations 
equivalent to the mona lisa is taking over much of the national 
gallery of art for the next three months 
the ink and color portrait on a hanging silk scroll is of 
minamoto yoritomo the first of the shoguns military generals 
who ruled japan in the emperors name from 1185 until the great 
changes in japanese society following the arrival of the first 
american fleet in 1859 
one of 550 japaneseowned works of art in the exhibit opening 
here sunday the anonymous portrait of yoritomo is designated a 
national treasure in japan j carter brown the national 
gallerys director called it the mona lisa of japanese art 
while yoritomo was characterized in medieval military chronicles 
as a brutal ruthless warrior the portrait of him attired in a 
formal silk robe sitted on a mat represents him as courtly figure 
jumpei kato managing director of the japan foundation said 
yoritomo despite his reputation as a warrior led a subdued 
personal life 
he had no concubines he was too afraid of his wife kato 
said 
brown sees the exhibit which has been five years in preparation 
as a way to help bridge the gap between the civilizations of the two 
countries 
these days there is no country more important than japan to the 
united states he said 
the final arrangments for bringing the exhibit to washington were 
made at a tokyo conference of president reagan and former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone 
the exhibit includes paintings sculpture screens scrolls 
ceramics textiles door panels swords saddles armor and other 
objects usually associated with such showings 
but the national gallery also has built a stage in the main hall 
of its east building for the presentation of elaborately costumed 
noh talent translated in english dramas the oldest form of 
professional theater in japan dating back more than 500 years 
the exhibit also includes a replica of a japanese tea house the 
small thatched structures where members of the fuedal military 
heirarchy engaged in a highly cultivated ritual of giving and 
receiving tea as an act of social communion 
during the exhibit the huge metal mobile by american artist 
alexander calder that normally swings from the ceiling and dominates 
the east hall has been temporarily removed ruth kaplan a gallery 
spokeswoman said the mobile is being cleaned and would not have 
interfered with the japanese exhibit 
the exhibit is expected to attract several visitors from japan 
partly because the the elaborately but rarely staged noh dramas 
there and the gathering of so many other pieces of japanese art into 
one show 
so many american visitors are expected that the gallery has set 
up a system of reserving tickets for specific days and hours the 
tickets are free 
the show is called japan the shaping of daimyo culture 
11851868 the daimyo were the great feudal lords who ruled japan 
under the shoguns the exhibit will be on view until jan 23 it 
will not travel to any other city

the environmental protection agency citing the 
press of other business has suspended work on proposed standards 
for exposure to radio waves which some scientists suspect could 
cause neurological damage in high doses 
rich guimond head of epas radiation programs said in an 
interview that the science is not strong enough right now to 
justify further work on broadcast waves at a time when epa is 
swamped with other environmental problems 
guimond said growing concern about radon contamination of homes 
and several court orders to rework other standards have spread his 
staff of about 150 people too thin to continue work on broadcast 
standards 
in addition he said the agency is having to redraft regulations 
for an underground nuclear waste repository and is trying to come 
up with guidelines for lowlevel nuclear waste repositories in the 
states 
william hassinger assistant bureau chief for engineering in the 
mass media bureau of the federal communications commission said he 
was terribly annoyed by epas decision because it makes it 
more difficult for our licensees to operate efficiently 
there is no general standard that limits public exposure to 
broadcastfrequency radiation 
the occupational safety and health administration however has a 
workplace standard that uses a recommendation of the american 
national standards institute the fcc uses the same recommendation 
in issuing broadcast licenses 
the institute is a voluntary organization that recommends 
standards of all kinds to be used by american industry 
in recent years some scientists have raised suspicion that some 
people exposed to high electromagnetic fields might be suffering 
damage to neurological and immune systems in addition high fields 
can cause internal body heating much like a microwave oven 
epa in 1986 sought public comment on whether to do nothing to 
uphold the institutes recommendation or to adopt a standard five 
or 10 times as strict 
portland ore has already adopted a standard 10 times as strict 
as the institutes recommendation massachusetts has chosen one five 
times as strict 
the toughest option would have meant 46 percent of the nations 
television and am and fm radio stations would have had to make 
changes such as operate at reduced power fence in an antenna 
change radiation patterns or move an antenna 
currently if communities or states object to radiation from an 
antenna the fcc refers to the institutes recommendation hassinger 
said but he said the fcc would rather have established guidelines 
guimond said epa would not entirely abandon the field and could 
resume work in a few years 
during the current fiscal year all but one or two of the seven 
people working on the project will move to other areas but first 
they will draft a strategy of how those remaining should proceed at 
epas las vegas nev laboratory 
they also will write a pamphlet of public advice and will finish 
a review with epa cancer experts of existing scientific studies of 
possible links between lowfrequency electromagnetic fields produced 
by power lines and cancer in children notably leukemia 
some studies have found a statistical association between 
leukemia and residence near a power line others have found nothing

seven men acutely aware that the post they 
seek has been haunted by death seek the presidency of this 
politically and economically troubled pacific island state in 
national elections wednesday 
each of the candidates for the fouryear term has pledged to 
bring unity peace and reconciliation to the nearly 15000 people 
who live on eight of palaus 200 islands 
the worlds last trusteeship establised by the united nations in 
1947 palau has been crippled by mounting debts a us 
congressional investigation of alleged corruption and fiscal 
mismanagement and deep divisions over a proposed compact with the 
united states that would give palau selfrule 
palaus only two elected presidents since constitutional 
government began eight years ago died from assassination and suicide 
the candidates include thomas o remengesau who became president 
in august when lazarus salii died from a selfinflicted gunshot 
wound 
a longtime national government cabinet officer remengesau was 
vice president and is serving the remainder of saliis term which 
ends this year 
all of the candidates support a new political status with the 
united states although they dont agree on the terms the united 
state has been administering palau affairs under the trusteeship 
the candidates also advocate a stronger government role for the 
island chains 16 traditional chiefs 
three candidates businessman roman tmetuchl high chief yutaka 
m gibbons and john o ngiraked minister of state in saliis 
cabinet have sought the presidendy in previous elections 
the other candidates are santos olikong speaker of the national 
house of delegates moses y uludong a former national senator and 
ngiratkel etpison a businessman 
etpison gibbons and uludong are governors of their states of 
which palau has 16 
because of the crowded field it is unlikely that the winner will 
receive a majority there is no runoff under palaus constitution 
final results may not be known for several days 
the estimated 10000 registered voters including about 1800 who 
live outside palau also will elect 14 senators and 16 house members 
to the national congress 
since the death of president salii everything is wide open 
said one government official who asked to remain anonymous there 
is a new mood palau is at a juncture where the old ways are making 
room for new approaches 
the official said most of the campaigning has been centered 
around local issues such as road construction and service to the 
villages 
the proposed compact of free association would bring palau 
selfrule and hundreds of millions of dollars in us economic aid 
once the trusteeship is terminated financial aid is now 
administered by the department of the interior on a piecemeal basis 
under free association money would go to the palau government to 
spend as they see fit 
a compact was approved by the us congress and president reagan 
in 1986 that would provide 460 million in aid over 15 years but 
congress failed to act on a bill this month that would have provided 
an extra 40 million as an incentive to get palau to approve the 
pact 
palauans have held six plebiscites since 1982 but each has 
fallen short of approving the free association arrangement that is 
similar to ones the united states has with two other former trust 
territories the marshall islands and the federated states of 
micronesia 
palau has a constitutional prohibition against nuclear weapons on 
its territory each plebiscite won a majority but came up short of 
the 75 percent support needed to overrule the nonukes provision 
palau west of the international dateline is about 600 miles 
east of the philippines 800 miles southwest of guam and 4500 miles 
southwest of honolulu 
it is of strategic interest to the united states which would 
retain defense and mutual security responsibilities for the islands 
under the proposed compact

federal prosecutors expect to bring the first 
indictments in the pentagon fraud and bribery scandal just one week 
after the presidential election and may continue charging people for 
up to a year they wont rule out congressmen as targets of the 
investigation 
henry e hudson the us attorney in suburban virginia who is 
running the multistate multiagency investigation is well aware 
of whispers that the reagan administration wanted charges delayed 
until after nov 8 so that democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis wouldnt have them as ammunition against george bush 
nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down 
indictments in the first part of october hudson said in an 
interview at weeks end indeed he and his bosses at the justice 
department had predicted that kind of timetable last june when the 
scandal broke with fbi raids on 44 sites coasttocoast 
but hudson said complexity not politics pushed the time back 
this is the largest case his office has ever handled his attorneys 
and investigators have reviewed 700000 documents and more are still 
under subpoena to be turned over theyve listened to thousands 
and thousands of tapes of two years of telephone interceptions 
prosecutors say the 2yearold investigation into the 150 
billionayear pentagon procurement system has turned up evidence 
that consultants including some former highlevel reagan 
administration officials and former highranking military men 
working for the nations largest defense contractors bribed pentagon 
officials for information vital to winning contracts worth billions 
of dollars five pentagon employees have been transferred away from 
contract work 
hudsons investigators have found foreign or offshore bank 
accounts tied to some of the principals in the case and he said 
they are seeking foreign bank records always a delicate issue 
and a timeconsuming process 
also government and defense sources who wont allow use of their 
names indicate hudsons men have been kept waiting for responses 
from some potential defendants to offers of plea bargains 
hudson is using 15 attorneys including some from the justice 
departments fraud and public integrity sections and 75 federal 
agents from the fbi the naval investigative service and the 
internal revenue service theyve been working 10 and 12 hours a 
day including weekends 
in addition he said the federal judges of eastern virginia 
known for moving cases quickly impose a burden not found in other 
federal jurisdictions the very day the indictment is handed down 
our judges assume i am ready for trial so i will not present 
this indictment until we are ready for trial 
now hudson said im very optimistic on midnovember 
indictments justice sources fix the date at nov 15 which 
happens to be next day the grand jury meets 
hudson would only say that historically his office has kept 
indictments below a dozen defendants justice sources expect even 
fewer than that in the first round perhaps half a dozen 
individuals 
but hudson conceded that charges against additional defendants 
could very well expand for a year sure 
hudson would not discuss the ownership or location of the foreign 
bank accounts nor would he say what charges were contemplated but 
the presence of the irs agents on his team indicates that tax 
charges are being considered in addition to the more obvious counts 
of theft of government property bribery fraud conspiracy to 
defraud the government 
court papers filed in brooklyn ny indicate the prosecutors 
are looking at allegations that campaign contributions were 
extorted raids in new york came at the business of james kane who 
set up the long island aerospace political action committee to make 
contributions that might help area defense contractors and at the 
long island home of dennis mitchell a unisys corp official 
identified as turning over contributions to rep roy dyson dmd 
who sits on the house armed services committee dyson has denied any 
wrongdoing 
dyson and several other congressmen were mentioned early in the 
case prompting hudson to visit capitol hill members who attended 
the closed meeting emerged saying that no congressman was a target 
of the investigation 
but i never made such a statement hudson said i told the 
members of the house of representatives that no member of congress 
had been the subject of electronic surveillance had received a 
subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury at that time or had 
been the subject of a search warrant 
in the last month hudson won full control of the case when 
assistant attorney general edward dennis told us attorney andrew 
maloney in brooklyn to step out of the case 
hudson denies and maloney will not discuss reports they 
argued over what priority to put on going after congressmen maloney 
said there were targets and players in both jurisdictions but ed 
dennis just decided he wanted to keep central control in virginia 
long island also has been the site of alleged document 
destruction according to federal court papers fbi agents told a 
judge they overheard kane ordering his employees to dispose of 
documents after the initial fbi raids hudson would not say whether 
that problem cropped up elsewhere 
court papers in brooklyn show the government granted some 
individuals immunity for their testimony 
hudson wont comment on the immunities or any plea bargain 
negotiations but one source said they offered to let a guy in 
his 60s plead guilty to a 20year and a 15year count the lowest 
ive heard is a guy with nexttono involvement who was offered a 
fiveyear sentence 
thats why they arent getting many accepted because theyre 
offering relatively hard deals 
defense sources said they believed at least one deal may have 
been agreed to but federal sources would not confirm that 
federal sources acknowledging they had initially expected more 
targets would seek deals said some individuals had rejected offers 
of leniency in return for guilty pleas but others simply had not yet 
responded to offers 
one federal investigator noting that anyone who pleaded guilty 
now might spend christmas in prison not at home said going to 
jail is like paying bills if you can do it tomorrow instead of 
today you do it tomorrow

foreign ministers of the sovietled 
warsaw pact ended two days of talks saturday after calling for a 
35nation european summit on reducing conventional weapons official 
reports said 
most of the proposals made at the meeting were contained in 
previous documents issued by the military alliance but the summit 
call was new there was no mention of who should attend the proposed 
summit 
in their declaration the foreign ministers said measures worked 
out in eastwest negotiations should ultimately cover the activity 
of all elements of armed forces ground air and naval forces 
the state news agency mti reported 
since the united states and soviet union signed a treaty in 
december to eliminate their intermediaterange landbased nuclear 
weapons military strategists and political leaders have shifted 
attention to bolstering other forces 
the united states and other nato countries have long argued that 
the nuclear deterrent is needed in europe to offset a soviet 
advantage in conventional forces 
since the end of world war ii red army forces in europe have 
been dominated by huge armies of men tanks and artillery suitable 
for attack 
the pentagon estimates that the soviets have 230 divisions 
compared with 121 for nato it also says the soviets hold a 
52000to24250 edge in battle tanks and a 42000to18350 
advantage in artillery units the seven warsaw pact countries and 
the 16 members of the western north atlantic treaty organization are 
already laying plans for talks on conventional weapons to supplant 
14 years of unsuccessful eastwest negotiations in vienna austria 
it was not clear how the new warsaw pact proposal might affect 
plans for the smaller 23nation talks 
the warsaw pact officials also proposed a string of eastwest 
confidencebuilding measures intended to make war less likely mti 
said they included broader prior announcement and curbs on military 
maneuvers talks on freezing or reducing military spending and an 
exchange of data on armed forces

the ancient college clock chimed noon 
the race began and it was chariots of fire all over again 
this time sebastian coe played winner harold abrahams and steve 
cram was loser lord lindsey 
coe and cram two of britains most illustrious modernday 
athletes who have a stream of world records between them staged a 
highnoon charity run saturday duplicating a piece of sports and 
film legend 
watched by prince edward youngest son of queen elizabeth ii and 
approximately 1500 other spectators the two recreated the great 
court run of the film chariots of fire racing the bells of 
cambridges trinity college 
history says only one man ever before completed the college quad 
circuit in the approximately 46 seconds it takes the clocktower 
bells to strike the 24 chimes that mark noon 
in 1927 lord burghley accomplished the feat as a cambridge 
student and went on to win the olympic 400meter hurdles the 
following year 
burghley was the model for the fictional lord lindsey character 
the film shows lindsey outrun by abrahams who nips the nobleman at 
the last chime 
a wellmaintained modern running track it wasnt but coe and 
cram managed to keep their balance around the 367meter circuit and 
surged past the finish line saturday just as the clock stopped 
coe crossed the line before the clock ceased chiming said 
norris mcwhirter author of the guinness book of records he hailed 
the winning time of 4552 seconds as a record 
because of the crowd noise which virtually obliterated the clock 
chimes there was doubt whether cram also beat the clock

president reagan ridiculed white 
house hopeful michael dukakis today asserting the democrat is 
trying to make voters believe hes switched sides 
referring to dukakis only as a certain candidate for 
president reagan said he says hes on your side but hes 
wearing the liberal teams taxandspend jersey 
the president on a weeklong crosscountry campaign swing for 
frontrunner george bush devoted his weekly radio address to 
attacking his vice presidents opponent 
reagan poked fun at dukakis recent attempts to insert more 
warmth and personality into his campaign with the slogan im on 
your side 
maybe its just that at fourth quarter with the two minute 
warning sounding he wants you to think hes switched sides 
reagan said 
but he hasnt changed he hasnt changed his ideas look at 
the record and you can see whos on whose side reagan said 
the president delivered the address from his mountaintop rancho 
del cielo wheres hes taking a weekend respite with his wife 
nancy 
the couple planned to mark their absentee ballots later in the 
day white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reagans plan 
to be in washington on election day but are registered to vote in 
california 
reagan asserted that dukakiss argument that the 1988 election 
battle against bush is about competence not ideology doesnt 
hold up 
ill stack our record of competence against any any day of the 
week reagan said insisting that with bushs aid his 
administration has been able to slash government bureaucracy and 
lead the economy to a record of unparalleled prosperity 
yes the leader of the other ticket says ideology doesnt 
matter but of course it does reagan said 
were now doing a much better job than has ever been done of 
managing every single dollar that the government spends to make sure 
its spent in the very best way it can be reagan said 
the government does all of its jobs better and faster he 
said 
reagan made no mention of the pentagon mismanagement scandal 
over the overpayments of billiondollar weapons systems 
instead he pointed to the governments ability to cut the 
paperwork for passports from 43 days to a 10day waiting period and 
the waiting time for a social security card from seven weeks to 10 
days 
reagan told a foreign policy group in los angeles friday that he 
is concerned not only about who will succeed him in the oval office 
but also whether soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will retain the 
power to press ahead with his economic and political reforms 
reagan in a questionandanswer session offered a wideranging 
and at times amusing commentary on the list of foreign policy 
concerns that will be left to his successor three months from now 
responding to one query of how he felt about being replaced 
in the oval office the president quipped my concern is not just 
replaced its who the replacement is and i have some very strong 
feelings about that 
reagan whos spending several days in his home state rounding up 
votes for his handpicked successor vice president george bush got 
a round of hearty laughter from the audience 
the president went on to say that he didnt think any president 
could step down without having things left undone things that 
youd hoped could be accomplished and so you leave hoping that they 
will be then accomplished by someone else 
at another point reagan was asked whether he believed the new 
soviet drive toward economic prosperity and coexistance with other 
nations would falter if gorbachev were forced from power 
the president replied that it would depend upon gorbachevs 
successor but he also said he believed it would be a great 
setback if anything happens to prevent him from continuing the 
program that he has set forth 
reagan who has met four times with the soviet leader said he 
believed gorbachev has hurdled over stalin and has no respect 
or regard whatsoever for the late soviet dictators 
repressionist policies 
reagan contended that gorbachev has gone back to some of the 
teachings of lenin that he advocated working beside 
capitalists and that soviets could learn from them 
this man seems to have some ideas of that in mind i hope that 
he can continue and will continue on this path reagan said 
adding the people in the street seem to be on his side 
on arms control the president said a treaty cutting longrange 
nuclear missiles is attainable in the next few years a 
lessoptimistic projection than in his recent speech to the un 
general assembly in which he said a treaty might be possible next 
year 
reagan greeted with caution the kremlins announcement thursday 
that is it turning over its controversial radar installation at 
krasnoyarsk in siberia to the soviet academy of sciences for use as 
a civilianrun international space research center 
we are certainly listening to what they have to say the 
president said but our legitimate concerns must be met 
the administration maintains that the radar installation is a 
violation of the antiballistic missile treaty we have told the 
soviet union that unless that violation is corrected in a verifiable 
manner we will not be able to conclude any new strategic arms 
control agreements reagan said 
reagan said his term is ending at a portentous time in 
eastwest affairs and called upon his successor to continue support 
of nicaraguan contra rebels aggressively pursue star wars defense 
technology and maintain us military strength

the chief witness for the prosecution at the 
divorcefixing conspiracy trial of former miss america bess myerson 
says she just wants to get at the truth 
but sukhreet gabels motives for testifying on the governments 
behalf at a trial where her own aging mother is also a defendant 
have confused and confounded the crowds watching the bizarre 
courtroom drama 
ms gabel 39 ended nine grueling days on the witness stand 
friday and told reporters outside federal court i testified but 
i dont see it as testifying against my mother im proud to 
participate 
her mother is former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 
75 who is on trial with miss myerson 64 and miss myersons 
boyfriend carl andy capasso 43 on charges of engaging in a 
conspiracy to slash capassos temporary alimony payments to his 
estranged wife 
miss myerson once the citys cultural affairs commissioner is 
accused of giving ms gabel a 19000ayear city job to influence 
her mothers decisions in capassos bitter divorce in which miss 
myerson was named corespondent 
defense lawyers tried to portray ms gabel as a neurotic 
resentful daughter who cooperated with prosecutors because of a 
deepseated hatred of her parents 
even prosecutors conceded that a woman who records her own 
mothers telephone conversation for the government may not be a 
pretty picture 
but whatever her motives short round sukhreet gabel managed to 
steal the spotlight from the glamorous bess myerson who was voted 
miss america 1945 
camera crews and reporters waited outside the courthouse each day 
to see what ms gabel was wearing and to hear what she had to say 
inside the courtroom ms gabel testified that she had considered 
suicide and sought treatment for clinical depression before miss 
myerson gave her a job 
she still takes antidepression medication and conceded that 
electroshock treatments have turned her memory to swiss cheese 
ms gabel testified about deliberately recording a telephone 
conversation with her mother for prosecutors she also admitted 
taking four satchels of her mothers papers to prosecutors without 
her mothers knowledge and asking is this important 
the same day she admitted recording her mother ms gabel also 
conceded that she deceived a grand jury to protect my mother 
yet ms gabel steadfastly maintained her mothers innocence 
i dont believe youre guilty of a damn thing she was heard 
telling her mother on a tape played in court 
during breaks in the proceedings mrs gabel accompanied by her 
81yearold husband milton a retired dentist went up to the 
witness stand to talk with her daughter pat her hand and blow her a 
kiss 
i think she sounds charming mrs gabel told a reporter early 
in her daughters testimony 
a defense lawyer accused ms gabel of stealing the money her 
parents gave her to pay rent and other expenses noting that she was 
once subject to eviction proceedings for being 3000 behind in her 
800amonth rent 
when he asked what she did with the money ms gabel answered 
melodramatically i bought drugs prompting gasps in the crowded 
courtroom 
her mother got the lawyer to clarify that it was prescription 
drugs her daughter bought ms gabel suffers from a thyroid 
condition in addition to depression 
outside the courtroom ms gabels comments were equally 
outrageous 
she talked to perfect strangers who called her apartment at all 
hours supporters critics prison inmates proposing marriage even 
a radio personality who offered her a tryout as a contest girl 
on a rock station 
i like talking to the interesting people who call she told a 
reporter 
ms gabel was asked by reporters how she could live with the 
thought of testifying for prosecutors seeking to convict her own 
mother 
she replied i can live with an overriding overwhelming need 
to get to the truth could it not be that this would establish 
her innocence

after decades of floods and heated debates 
over how to deal with them italy on saturday launched the first 
stage of a 5 billion project to shelter the venetian lagoon from 
the high tides of the adriatic sea 
since its founding 1100 years ago venice has been plagued by 
frequent floods water pollution and a steady sinking the city has 
dropped nine inches this century 
after flood waters in 1966 inundated the famous st marks square 
and damaged most of the old city the government began studying how 
to solve the problem 
but the studies became bogged down in political infighting and 
budgetary problems until three years ago when the government came 
up with a plan that includes construction of a line of mobile dikes 
across the lagoons three entrances 
the barriers can best be described as giant jaws on the seabed 
that will open when necessary to slow high tides rushing toward the 
city the rising jaw will drop back to the seabed as the tides 
weaken and will remain invisible at normal times 
deputy premier gianni de michelis inaugurated the first prototype 
in a ceremony at the industrial section of marghera the steel dike 
weighs 1100 tons and has been dubbed moby duck 
for about a year 24 hours a day engineers will test the system 
after the experiment is completed 70 to 80 dikes similar to the 
prototype varying in length from 17 to 27 yards and up to 180 feet 
high will be built the system is scheduled to be fully installed 
in 1995 
other parts of the plan involve efforts to preserve the 150 
canals shore up the islands and the seawalls around the 
cresentshaped 340squaremile lagoon and control pollution 
for years this has been called a lagoon of debates now we 
finally have action de michelis told a crowd saturday at the 
metalotecnica yards where 26 italian companies have combined to put 
together the dike project 
members of the consortium supervising the project visited the 
thames river estuary and hollands schelda river where similar 
projects have been built 
they also studied chicagos work in cleaning up lake michigan and 
looked to the san francisco and chesapeake bays to imitate their 
organization in creating an overall authority to supervise the 
project 
flood tides are triggered by differences in atmospheric pressure 
at either end of the adriatic or the sirocco wind that drives the 
waters of the sea north 
flood tides have wreaked havoc in venice as far back as the 
middle ages when one killed 1000 people in 1410 the great flood of 
1966 caused an estimated 85 million damage

here is the text of president 
reagans weekly radio address given from his west coast residence 
rancho del cielo 
my fellow americans not long ago a certain candidate for 
president said that this election is not about ideology its about 
competence id like to take a few moments to talk about competence 
competence in the government and what weve done to improve it 
over the last eight years 
when george bush and i arrived in washington we found a grossly 
mismanaged federal government to give you one example in the last 
year of the previous administration federal spending was increasing 
at the dizzying rate of 17 percent a year which is to say almost 
two times as fast as the economy as a whole 
now with the cost of the government growing that fast youd 
think those in charge would have been keeping track of exactly how 
each dollar was spent but in fact at that time the government did 
not know until long after the fact how much was spent and even when 
it knew how much had been spent it couldnt say for certain exactly 
what it had spent your money on 
this together with excessive regulations deteriorating 
services evidence of rampant waste fraud and abuse in a number of 
agencies pointed to a government that was too big and out of 
control 
look at how we changed things start with excessive regulations 
we set up a task force headed by vice president bush its job 
identify and eliminate unnecessary federal regulations 
the results weve cut by over 600 million man hours a year the 
time that businesses state and local governments and you and i as 
ordinary citizens have to spend filling out federal forms and doing 
other federal paperwork 
this achievement has been even more important than many of us 
realize a leading historian has written that government 
intervention and regulation was among the principle reasons for 
americas economic stagnation in the 70s 
under george bushs leadership we lifted the weight of excessive 
regulations and that played a major role in getting our economy to 
really fly 
we also set up the private sector survey on cost control led by 
peter grace with almost 200 top business executives this 
commission spent months looking at every part of the government 
finding out where modern business practices could eliminate waste 
fraud and abuse in the government 
when they were through theyd come up with 2478 suggestions 
and almost every recommendation we could put into effect without 
congressional action has been implemented and weve saved close to 
80 billion 
were hoping that the next congress will pitch in and do its part 
within the administration we set up the council on integrity and 
efficiency thanks to the council the government has saved or put 
to better use over one hundred billion dollars in the past six 
years 
for example its put in computers so that we can now identify 
bidrigging contractors or catch con artists who take out loans from 
many federal agencies and default on all of them and weve 
initiated the largest management improvement program ever reform 
88 
by installing government wide cash credit financial personnel 
payroll and productivity systems weve brought common sense to the 
way we handle two trillion dollars that pass through the government 
annually 
most of these improvements are now up and running right on 
schedule and the result is that were now doing a much better job 
than has ever been done of managing every single dollar the 
government spends to make sure its spent in the very best way it 
can be 
as a result of our many reforms the government does all its many 
jobs better and faster for example in 1980 it took seven weeks to 
get a social security card now it takes ten days it took 43 days 
to get a passport now it takes ten days it took 75 days for an 
export license now its five days to some countries and no more 
than 17 days for any and processing a claim for a title one 
department of housing and urban development loan has dropped from 
100 days to 22 
yes the results speak for themselves but there are other 
results too results that show competence these results include the 
longest peacetime economic expansion on record more new jobs 
created than europe and japan combined while cutting inflation to a 
third of what it was and interest rates in half 
come to think of it ill stack our record of competence against 
any any day of the week because you see our ideas work and they 
work for you 
yes the leader of the other ticket says ideology doesnt matter 
but of course it does he says hes on your side but hes wearing 
the liberal teams tax and spend jersey maybe its just the fourth 
quarter with the two minute warning sounding he wants you to think 
hes switched sides but he hasnt changed he hasnt changed his 
ideas 
look at the record and you can see whos on whose side until 
next week thanks for listening and god bless you

a woman who fed her husband rat poison over 
several years was placed on four years probation after her 
nowailing husband pleaded with the judge not to send her to jail 
if the victim doesnt want her put in jail chances are she is 
going to get probation dale county district attorney david emery 
said saturday adding that he put up only token opposition to 
the request 
judge charles woods imposed the sentence friday on flora 
crittenden 47 who originally was charged with attempted murder but 
pleaded guilty to assault in an agreement with prosecutors 
her husband james crittenden 46 had made a living as a logger 
and was in good health before the poisoning started emery said 
her husband forgave her before he even got out of the hospital 
the district attorney said 
during a hearing last month the husband told the judge the 
couple had been married 28 years if i ever needed her i need her 
now said crittenden who now uses a walker to get around i 
cant even make it to the bathroom now 
authorities have said a life insurance policy on crittenden was a 
possible motive in the poisoning 
sheriff bryant mixon has said mrs crittenden poisoned her 
husband by putting arsenic in his food and drinking water he said 
his department was notified after crittendens doctor detected a 
high level of arsenic in him 
mixon said crittenden had refused to sign a warrant for mrs

seven south american presidents 
pledged saturday to devise a common strategy to persuade creditors 
to write off part of their 339 billion foreign debt 
the leaders also called for a new dialogue on regional issues 
with richer industrialized countries they said they would seek 
meetings with us government officials to coordinate efforts to 
curtail drug trafficking and end wars in central america 
it is our intention to initiate a new dialogue with developed 
nations in the search for a system of more equal relations the 
presidents said in a communique at the end of a threeday summit 
they discussed mainly foreign debt since arriving wednesday at 
this posh atlantic resort 
the problem of the debt has become the main obstacle to growth 
in our region given the massive net outflow of resources to the 
industrialized nations the communique stated it said interest 
paid on the debt siphons money from needed domestic projects and 
services 
seven countries brazil mexico argentina colombia peru 
venezuela and uruguay came to the conference of nations known as 
the group of eight the eighth member panama was suspended from 
the group after its military chief gen manuel antonio noriega 
deposed the civilian president eric delvalle in february 
delvalle sent a letter to summit host president julio m 
sanguinetti saying he was willing to relinquish his claim to office 
if it would bring about early fair elections in panama however 
delvalle said he doubted the integrity of any balloting administered 
by noriega who has called elections for may 
all the nations at the summit have had difficulty repaying their 
debts they all have suffered economic or social upheaval for years 
tripledigit inflation in argentina and brazil budget shortfalls in 
venezuela and mexico guerrilla insurgencies in colombia and peru 
and a stagnant economy in uruguay 
our region is confronted by the gravest economic crisis in 
its history said uruguay foreign minister luis barrios tassano 
who read the groups communique to diplomats and invited guests in a 
municipal gymnasium 
the stability and economic and social development of latin 
america is threatened by the grave economic problems of the debt and 
the unfavorable evolution of international trade barrios tassano 
said the development of our nations should be an objective shared 
with countries that are highly developed 
the communique provided only a sketchy framework of a plan for 
debt forgiveness finance ministers will meet before years end in 
rio de janeiro brazil to flesh it out 
however brazils finance minister mailson ferreira da nobrega 
said friday the nations would continue to negotiate on their own 
not as a cartel 
a un conference on trade and development recommended last month 
that creditor banks and governments forgive 30 percent of the debt 
owed by 15 of the most heavily indebted nations including all seven 
at the conference 
on drug trafficking the presidents said they would continue 
programs of crop eradication and seizure they urged industrialized 
nations to fight consumption of cocaine and marijuana and laundering 
of money from the illegal sale of the drugs 
the production illegal trafficking and use of narcotics 
is assuming proportions that affect the stability of institutions in 
some of our countries the communique stated 
the group of eight traces its roots to the 1983 joint effort by 
mexico panama colombia and venezuela to promote a political 
solution to civil wars in nicaragua and el salvador peru 
argentina brazil and uruguay joined that effort in 1985 and the 
eight countries decided a year later to meet regularly to discuss 
regional issues

the soviets may have violated a troop 
withdrawal agreement by deploying up to 30 highperformance ground 
support warplanes in afghanistan us officials said saturday 
afghan guerrillas who are battling the kremlinbacked kabul 
regime say the soviets have based two squadrons of mig27 floggerd 
close air support fighters at shindand 100 miles south of herat in 
far western afghanistan near the iranian border said one official 
the mig27s are suited for offensive operations whereas the 
soviet union has said that it would undertake military operations in 
afghanistan only to protect its own troops from attack 
we are investigating said one us official speaking on 
condition of anonymity certainly the introduction of offensive 
equipment into afghanistan could be viewed as a violation of the 
agreements but there are legal technicalities in every agreement 
under the geneva withdrawal accords signed last spring the 
soviets are obliged to pull out their entire occupation force once 
estimated at 115000 troops 
soviet officials have said the withdrawal timetable was 
jeopardized by continued us and pakistani support for resistance 
units who are operating with increasing boldness deep inside 
afghanistan launching repeated rocket attacks on the capital 
a second state department official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that the mig27s are believed to have replaced two 
squadrons of older mig23 flogger fighters each squadron has 1215 
planes according to david isby author of russias war in 
afghanistan 
the us official repeated the reagan administration formula on 
afghanistan that we still expect the soviets to be out by feb 
15 as called for under the geneva accords 
the new york times which reported the presence of the mig27s 
in saturdays editions quoted an unidentified us official 
predicting the soviets might resume offensive operations in 
afghanistan 
the presence of the mig27s was reported by resistance units 
fighting in the area and has not been confirmed independently by 
us diplomats who are restricted largely to kabul the afghan 
capital the times quoted officials as saying the sighting was 
confirmed by satellite photos 
the soviets have had two or three squadrons of mig23 warplanes 
in afghanistan since at least 1984 and may have had mig27s there 
as well according to isby 
the mig23 and mig27 use the same basic air frames but the 
forward fuselage air intakes and weapons mounts of the mig27 
enable it to carry airtoground missiles and maneuver at subsonic 
speeds to support ground forces according to janes all the 
worlds fighting aircraft an authoritative reference 
earlier this week the chairman of the afghan resistance 
alliance burhanuddin rabbani said the soviets were deploying new 
highaltitude tu16 bombers in afghanistan the times said state 
department officials denied that assertion

a 20yearold woman from rome served as a 
surrogate mother for her own mother italian newspaper said and the 
vatican on saturday called the case unacceptable experimentation 
newspapers have reported that the younger woman recently gave 
birth to a boy at a rome hospital after carrying to term the 
artificially fertilized egg of her 48yearold mother the sperm of 
the daughters 35yearold stepfather was reportedly used to 
fertilize the egg 
the recent reports have touched off a debate in medical and 
religious circles over the ethical questions raised some doctors 
and scientists have expressed doubt that the episode occurred 
the daily la stampa of turin reported that the stepfather wanted 
his own children but that his wife already the mother of the 
20yearold and two other children had been advised against further 
pregnancies 
the family discussed the matter with a gynecologist and the 
daughter volunteered to lend her womb to her mother the paper 
said without citing sources 
newspaper reports have not identified the people involved or said 
exactly when the child was born 
the vatican newspaper osservatore romano criticized the people 
involved and called the case unacceptable experimentation that 
kills the dignity of the person 
the newspaper cited a document on respect for human life by 
cardinal joseph ratzinger a vatican official in charge of the 
congregation for doctrine of the faith 
what happened in these days is a consequence of not accepting 
that from a moral point of view responsible procreation must result 
from a conjugal act if separation of procreation from the conjugal 
act is permitted conception becomes a question of mere technical 
reproduction and terms such as conjugal love maternity and 
procreation become meaningless the newspaper said in an editorial 
the girl was painfully used as an object she was used for nine 
months as an incubator a prisoner of the egotism of the mother and 
of the detestable techniques she killed her dignity as a woman she 
definitely injured her personal future the newspaper said

here is the democratic response to president 
reagans weekly radio address given by rep steny hoyer 
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen im steny hoyer a 
congressman from maryland a democrat and for the next few minutes 
your guest and my partys spokesman 
on this weekend as americans reset their clocks to standard time 
we all get a small bonus an extra hour in the day let me ask you 
to use your precious 60 minutes for some calm reasoned thinking 
about the choice you will make 10 days from now a choice that could 
shape our lives for the next four years and beyond 
it is a choice between honorable experienced decent men mike 
dukakis and lloyd bentsen or george bush and dan quayle 
it is a crucial choice but because the campaign has often been 
distorted and confusing it is not an easy choice many of you i 
know are angry at what youve seen and heard many of you are 
uncertain not just about how to vote but whether to vote and what 
to expect of your future 
one candidate has in my opinion defined his priorities and 
americas goals and he has a track record of delivering on his 
promises 
michael dukakis has spelled out a mainstream program for a main 
street america he has told us how he can create jobs at wages that 
families can live on jobs that will last so that families can build 
on them 
mike dukakis has shown us how to reach for excellence in 
education and how to share the costs of improving our skills and 
expanding our childrens horizons he has put forward a national 
plan for a national need comprehensive health insurance and hes 
shown us how to finance it 
mike dukakis has given us a battle plan for a clean environment 
and a way to make polluters pay for the pure air and safe water that 
we cannot afford to live without 
mike dukakis has also laid out an affordable strategy for 
american security in a dangerous world a sensible combination of 
arms and arms control he will choose the weapons we need not just 
sign off on the pentagons wish list and the defense contractors 
cost overruns 
and while we rebuild our military forces in the field we will 
regain our economic clout 
just as we cannot let other nations hold our destiny hostage to 
our debts we cannot let our trading partners close off their 
markets while they have a field day in ours 
mike dukakis understands that the soviet challenge is not the 
only one we face he will lead america into economic competition 
forward again into first place in the global marketplace 
above all governor dukakis has pointed the way to a stronger 
america to a society that is fair and caring to a nation that is 
competent and on the move 
hes an optimist he sees what is best in americans and how to 
make the most of it for the best of america that is the difference 
i suggest to you between governor dukakis and the vice president 
george bush is no ronald reagan george bush has not voiced our 
dreams he has played on our nightmares george bushs campaign is 
drawn on fear on the lowest instincts not on our highest hopes he 
has told us what he is against not what he is for if he has an 
agenda for the future hes kept it hidden 
i do not think that is the way you should win elections i know 
that is not the way you should govern america scaring americans 
deceiving them dividing them only makes it harder to lead us 
forward to bring us together 
mike dukakis has given america a vision which brings us together 
his program for economic growth does not promise new benefits for 
those at the top of the economic ladder rather it promises hard 
work and a fair shake for americans in the middle and on their way 
up 
it promises security and dignity for those whose working years 
are past and it promises a bright future full of challenge and 
reward for the young who are the hope of the future 
so the choice is clear the choice between positive values and 
negative advertising between leadership with conscience and 
salesmanship without substance i again ask you to use your extra 
hour to reflect on that choice once more to put aside the shrill 
sound bites the slick commercials and the frantic polling and to 
decide with your common sense and your decency about our common 
future 
democrats believe the best in america is the best in the world 
and we believe the best america is yet to come it is your choice to 
make soon to make wisely as americans do let your conscience and 
our future will be enriched 
good afternoon and god bless you

lloyd bentsen pulled on his cowboy 
boots and voted in this south texas town saturday urging local 
residents to take advantage of a new state law that allows early 
absentee voting without requiring a reason 
get your friends and neighbors out to vote dont wait until 
nov 8 he told a crowd of about 200 he addressed after voting at 
the starr county courthouse 
you dont know what the weather is going to be you dont know 
how things are going to be on the job or if there will be long 
lines at the voting booth he said lets do it early 
a texas law passed last year has allowed people to cast absentee 
ballots since oct 19 and until nov 4 without having to claim 
theyll be away on election day 
bentsen and his wife ba filled out their paper ballots and 
stuffed them in a box in a small courtroom packed with reporters and 
television cameras asked afterward how he voted bentsen said 
people could count on him voting for himself but added im not 
supposed to electioneer within 1000 feet of the polling place 
mike mccurry bentsens press secretary joked that if the 
cameras missed the shot well be glad to vote two three four 
times 
the county on the mexican border is 96 percent hispanic and 
bentsen spoke in both english and spanish 
vote the straight ticket bentsen onlookers in spanish as 
car horns blared approval 
the new absentee voting law has proved so popular that some texas 
election officials have speculated that as much as onefourth of the 
vote could be done that way bentsens use of the statute was 
designed to help democratic officials in their effort to boost voter 
turnout among blacks and hispanics 
bentsen has been projecting an unusually high profile for a vice 
presidential candidate as the democratic campaign seeks to contrast 
him with republican dan quayle and use him to vouch for dukakis on 
conservative issues 
the campaign released to reporters on saturday the fiveminute 
television commercial featuring bentsen which will air on the abc 
network sunday night the spot is the first by a presidential 
campaign to feature the running mate 
in the commercial bentsen says the campaign this year has been 
absolutely miserable 
youve been told that mike dukakis will take away your gun 
thats just not true bentsen says 
youve been told that mike dukakis is in favor of letting 
criminals loose in the streets thats outrageous and its sure not 
true he says 
youve been told that governor dukakis and i oppose virtually 
every major weapon system important to our national security he 
says thats certainly not true and i wouldnt be on the 
ticket with a fella if he didnt believe that america must be the 
strongest nation on earth 
also saturday bentsen taped an appearance on the cable news 
networks newsmaker sunday program while continuing to attack 
the republican campaign he also defended a democratic ad 
bentsen who said a republican commercial made by an 
independent organization not connected with the bush campaign that 
focused on a black man who raped a white woman was racist said a 
democratic ad featuring a hispanic criminal was not 
i dont think so at all he said in that instance we were 
not using the name and it was a direct response to the kind of 
an attack that was made on us he said 
these kinds of things should not be part of the campaign he 
added 
bentsens father lloyd bentsen sr accompanied him to rio 
grande city but did not vote himself the elder bentsens residence 
is in neighboring hidalgo county 
i cant vote in starr county he quipped but if nobodys 
watching i will

its troops in the united states participates in maneuvers with 
american forces and uses american tanks artillery antiaircraft 
missiles and fighter planes

united states after congress refused to upgrade weapons systems to a 
level competitive with those used by israel syria and other 
neighboring countries 
in 1986 congress blocked a proposed 19 billion sale of jet 
fighters and antiaircraft weapons to jordan and hussein vowed 
never again to seek major us weapons systems 
the king has continued to encourage us efforts to solve the 
arabisraeli conflict hussein however has insisted that the 
palestine liberation organization must approve or take part in any 
peace negotiations 
carlucci said in a speech last week that us arms sales to 
moderate arab governments would help make them secure enough to 
welcome efforts to negotiate peace with israel

asked his supporters to do the same 
i urge you to go that extra mile to get that vote out bush 
urged precinct workers gathered outside a farmhouse in west dundee

dukakis is a divisive candidate while im going to bring it 
together i am not going to let that liberal governor divide this 
country he said bush said dukakis is trying to depict him as an 
elitist and to divide the electorate on class lines 
id hate to be my opponent dragging myself around this 
country trying to convince americans that everythings going to 
hell in a handbasket bush said 
he even summoned two trapped grey whales since freed to his 
campaign cause i sympathize with them trapped up there in 
alaska said bush thats what america looked like back in 1980 
trapped in there trying to get out 
and now weve strengthened the military brought the economy 
back he said i only hope for those whales that they dont end 
up in boston harbor they think theyve got troubles in alaska

basic campaign speech no new taxes no gun controls support for 
the death penalty a strong national defense

150 of the international union of operating engineers the campaign 
issued a statement saying that 30 prominent labor officials had 
endorsed bush on saturday 
along the way bush stopped to buy a halloween pumpkin for his 
grandson george p bush it would have cost 650 but the stand 
operator wouldnt take money from the vice president 
barbara bush meanwhile rode the press bus and told reporters 
she does not like negative campaigning which she blamed on the 
democrats 
while she said she doesnt like the tone of the campaign she 
also said im absolutely convinced that george bush is doing no 
mudslinging i think hes taken a very high road 
she said neither she nor bush thinks the election is won and 
that they both expect to see it tighten in the final days 
does he think the things in the bag no remember the first 
vote he and i ever cast was for dewey mrs bush said

life returned to normal saturday in the 
united states northernmost community as the last of a crowd of 
people left town after the rescue of two whales trapped by arctic 
ocean ice 
its pretty quiet said connie kunaknana desk clerk at the 
40room top of the world hotel packed since midoctober when the 
plight of three california gray whales drew scientists other 
rescuers and reporters to barrow 
two of the whales apparently swam to freedom friday after one of 
two soviet icebreakers crashed through the ice that imprisoned the 
mammals for nearly three weeks off the northern alaska coast a week 
earlier a third whale ceased to appear at a breathing hole in the 
ice and was presumed dead 
the whales became trapped while migrating southward to warmer 
waters off the coast of mexico 
with the rescue over at a cost of more than 1 million and the 
outoftowners gone residents of barrow settled back into their 
saturday routines 
people get up and go to the post office some people work 
said kp miller an announcer at kbrwam when the store opens 
they go to the store and do their shopping a lot of people do 
laundry the school gymnasium opens later in the day and is a 
popular gathering place she said 
with winter approaching first light in the town of some 1500 
residents doesnt come until about 1030 am 
its getting dark now so people arent getting up as early as 
they were miller said if it were hunting season people would 
be getting up early and getting their boats ready 
whales are among the animals hunted by eskimos who have 
subsistence hunting rights 
but they generally hunt bowheads and when the california grays 
were confined by the ice eskimos wielding chain saws put in long 
hours to cut holes that allowed them to breathe the series of holes 
gradually led the two survivors toward a channel cut by one of the 
icebreakers 
the sawyers were paid 15 to 16 an hour under a jobs program run 
by the north slope borough 
the influx of people triggered by the trapped whales generated 
work and income in addition to the jobs on the ice a tshirt 
industry offering at least three commemorative logos took shape 
quickly some of the visitors bought fur garments taxi services did 
a booming business and residents rented out their snowmobiles 
by saturday only three guests remained at the top of the world 
where people had been lodging three to a room during the crush 
kunaknana said a hotel near the airport also had been full and 
part of the overflow went to quarters at an arctic research 
laboratory nearby residents willing to turn their homes into 
temporary inns put their names on a list 
pepes north of the border specializing in mexican food was 
back to its normal clientele saturday after weeks of feeding frenzy 
said bob green an employee at the restaurant 
this morning we have our regular people more familiar faces 
than weve seen in the last few weeks he said 
green said the restaurant had to place its food orders earlier 
than usual and used reserves to keep meals on the table during the 
unexpected patronage by journalists and whale specialists 
it was a good experience but were glad to see it over with

a resurgent michael dukakis carried his on your side rallying 
cry to the farm belt on saturday while george bush accused his 
democratic rival of trying to divide americans by telling them 
everythings going to hell in a handbasket 
with 10 days remaining to the election the nationwide public 
polls continued to show a substantial advantage for republican 
candidate bush but democrats insisted their private soundings were 
showing unmistakable signs of movement in dukakis direction in 
states from california to florida 
bush sidestepped a question on cnns newsmaker saturday about 
whether he was concerned over tightening polls he forecast a close 
election and said everybodys predicted that from day one 
the vice presidents campaign threw a fresh commercial into the 
battle of the airwaves attacking dukakis as the author of the 
largest tax increase in the history of massachusetts 
dukakis tailored his populiststyle rhetoric to his farm 
audience they want to help the people who live high off the 
hog he said in sioux falls sd we want to help the people who 
raise the hogs 
a 50state survey by the associated press meanwhile shows that 
bush is leading for as many as 359 electoral votes but has not 
locked up the 270 that would assure him a victory dukakis leads for 
just 78 electoral votes nine states offering 101 votes are rated as 
tossups including illinois pennsylvania and wisconsin 
the presidential race aside both parties had their eyes on the 
33 senate races on the ballot the odds favored continued democratic 
control although bush and president reagan have coordinated their 
appearances to raise the chances of gop candidates in several states 
democrats are heavily favored to retain their majority control of 
the house in the nov 8 elections as well 
dukakis was pursuing his underdogs strategy to the end lining 
up network television appearances and making the unprecedented 
decision to give his running mate a fiveminute solo performance on 
a network commercial lloyd bentsen said in the ad scheduled for 
sunday night that the republicans have run a campaign of trash 
the truth with their attacks on dukakis 
there were the usual light moments blended into the serious 
business of running for president 
barbara bush joked that if bush does end up in retirement after 
the election and wants to drive his own car shes not sitting with 
him i am not getting in a car with a man who hasnt driven in 
years she said in reference to the secret servicedriven 
limousine that the vice president rides everywhere 
after months and months of candidates charges and commercials 
there were a few reminders that there actually is an election 
waiting at the end of the campaign trail 
president and mrs reagan cast their absentee ballots in 
california bentsen and his wife ba did likewise in texas 
that made the score two for the democrats and two for the 
republicans with one week and two days of frantic campaigning to go 
dukakis was in south dakota speaking to an audience from the 
surrounding states 
his aides issued a statement criticizing the reagan 
administrations rejection of complaints that rice farmers are being 
treated unfairly by the japanese the decision raises the question 
of whose side they are on the statement said of the republicans 
japans determination to keep its market closed hurts our 
farmers and serves only japan it said 
bush campaigned by bus through chicagos suburbs during the day 
criticizing dukakis for trying to depict him as an elitist and 
accusing his rival of trying to divide the nation along class lines 
im going to bring it together i am not going to let that 
liberal governor divide this country he said id hate to be my 
opponent dragging myself around this country trying to convince 
americans that everythings going to hell in a handbasket 
he also spoke of the whales trapped in ice off alaska now freed 
to campaign against dukakis i only hope for those whales that 
they dont end up in boston harbor he said

mississippi corrections officials didnt 
realize shelly teague had never served a single day of his fouryear 
prison sentence until they couldnt find him to let him out on 
parole 
they said the convicted drug dealer must have escaped but they 
later learned teague was at home in pascagoula where hed been all 
the time waiting for word on when to report to prison 
now teague who was arrested sept 3 has filed a motion asking 
that the sentence be set aside 
public defender tom fortner who represented teague in 1985 said 
he expects the motion to be heard this week 
according to the motion teague pleaded guilty to a charge of 
drug distribution in 1985 based on a promise he would be given a 
90day sentence 
when the fouryear sentence was imposed teague was allowed to 
delay his prison entrance date because of an illness in his family 
teagues motion says he reported back on the scheduled date ready 
to go to the mississippi state penitentiary at parchman and was 
given a later date 
petitioner did in fact keep the second return date and that 
time was instructed by mr fortner to go back home but to keep in 
touch with him that due to overcrowding conditions at parchman 
there was no available bed the motion says 
teague said he followed these instructions until he was told by 
fortner that the public defender would notify him of further 
developments 
petitioner did exactly as he was told to do the petition 
says he quit worrying about his sentence and went on with his 
life 
the circuit court clerks office says teague never paid his 
1000 fine or 250 in restitution 
it was unclear if teague was in custody saturday no telephone 
number is listed for him attorneys and prosecutors involved the 
case did not answer their phones and a person who answered the 
phone at the prison refused to answer questions

michael dukakis opened a 10day final 
push in his underdog bid for the presidency saturday by promising a 
crowd of about 10000 at a rousing rally that he would fight for 
american farmers and workers 
dukakis stopped on a trip to california to visit sioux falls for 
a salute to rural america a fairgrounds event with an audience 
including supporters bused in from iowa north dakota nebraska and 
minnesota 
they want you to forget their record dukakis told a 
boisterous crowd of about 10000 people rural americans have lost 
a lot but they havent lost their memories 
the democratic presidential nominee blamed reagan administration 
farm policies for a drop in farm exports falling crop prices and 
the loss of 250000 family farms in the past eight years 
dukakis promised an administration sympathetic to small towns and 
said rival george bush instead wanted to give a 40 billion tax 
break to the nations wealthy 
they want to help the people who live high off the hog 
dukakis said we want to help the people in this country who raise 
the hogs 
dukakis surrounded by elected officials from the five states 
told his audience that the republican philosophy is the fewer 
farms the better 
every farm and ranch in this country counts and every small 
town is somebodys home dukakis said to enthusiastic applause 
dukakis ridiculed bushs promise to wage a kinder gentler 
campaign in the final weeks a pledge bush made just before resuming 
harsh attacks on dukakis 
i wish his handlers would make up his mind dukakis said 
sioux falls was the first stop for dukakis on a finalpush 
campaign trip that will bring him to an average of four cities a 
day still well behind bush in most polls but encouraged by a recent 
tightening of the race dukakis is keeping a high television profile 
during the waning days of the campaign to help him spread his 
message 
dukakis tailored his populist appeal to rural and farm issues 
accusing the reagan administration of turning its back on family 
farmers and rural communities 
he also criticized a friday decision by the administration to 
refuse a request by us rice farmers to investigate japans trading 
practices and said the decision was an ominous harbinger of the 
trade policies bush would bring to the white house 
this decision is only the latest instance of the republicans 
refusal to stand up for american jobs and american farmers in world 
markets dukakis said in a statement the facts are so 
unequivocal that this decision raises grave doubts about the 
republicans intention to enforce the new trade act 
in contrast dukakis said he and running mate lloyd bentsen 
would demand that foreign countries with access to us markets open 
their doors to us products and he said a dukakis administration 
would bring to rural america reasonable price supports for farmers 
financing for economic development in rural communities an 
immediate 100 million investment in rural health care and 
agressive enforcement of worker safety guidelines a hot issue in 
this state where the john morrell amp co meatpacking plant was 
fined 43 million friday after being accused of violations of 
safety standards 
dukakis met with several morrell workers before addressing the 
rally and he questioned the timing of the fine 
were not going to wait until 10 days before the election to do 
something about it he said of safety problems in the meatpacking 
and other industries 
he also said the farmers home administration was waiting until 
six days after the election to mail out notices to 90000 family 
farmers telling them they will have to refinance loans or face 
foreclosure 
dukakis said he could sense the race was tightening and joked 
about his vision of the outcome 
this one is going to go down to the wire and its going to be 
one by a nose dukakis said if this one is one by a nose i 
dont have to tell you whos going to win 
dukakis headed from south dakota to california for an evening 
rally with supporters in the watts section of los angeles on sunday 
he is taking a train tour through several california communities 
dukakis is on the road through election day scheduled to arrive 
home on a crosscountry flight that gets him to boston shortly after 
the polls open

the government is spending about 8 million 
this year to design computer programs that will enable researchers 
for the first time to glean treatment information from the files of 
some 32 million medicare recipients 
bob hardy a spokesman for the health care information resource 
center which runs the medicare and medicaid programs said the 
agency will seek another 72 million next year for the program aimed 
at tapping the nations largest collection of medical data 
dr william l roper head of the hfca said the computerized 
network on treatments planned to start in 1990 may provide the 
next revolution in medical care 
were trying to extend the science roper said referring to 
the belief among physicians and other practitioners that medicine 
has always been a combination of both art and science 
the government has been collecting data on patients diagnoses 
treatments and outcomes since the medicare insurance program began 
in 1965 the information comes from claims billed by physicians 
hospitals and other health care providers 
hardy said the data base has not been used before to analyze the 
most effective treatments out of concerns for patient privacy a 
lack of computer resources and fear of government intrusion into 
medical practices 
the time is ripe for it now hardy said adding there is no 
intent in the program to force doctors to use specific 
procedures 
roper and hardy acknowledged that quantified data from the files 
on various treatments could be used by professional societies 
private insurers and the government in setting new treatment 
guidelines and ferreting out ineffective or unneccessary practices 
that part is secondary hardy said its down the pike and 
would happen naturally but ultimately it would be a byproduct 
the only way this thing will work successfully is with the 
cooperation of the medical community 
at the agencys request 13 leading physicians convened by the 
national academy of sciences institute of medicine met last week to 
pick priority areas where the quantitative studies should begin 
among a list tentatively chosen were treatments for angina or 
heart pain heart attacks breast cancer prostate troubles strokes 
and hip fractures hardy said together they account for billions 
of dollars spent on health care annually 
in practice physicians want to do the best by their patients 
that they can hardy said and when they can plug into a source 
of better more updated information we believe theyre going to be 
able to do a better job

seconds before the scheduled blastoff the maiden 
voyage of the soviet space shuttle was delayed saturday because of 
trouble with ground equipment it was the fifth setback this year 
for the soviet space program 
soviet officials did not immediately announce when a second 
attempt would be made to launch the buran on its unmanned test 
flight 
tass the official soviet news agency said scientists at the 
baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia traced saturdays snag to 
an equipment platform that failed to pull away from the booster 
rocket 
with 51 seconds to go a computer stopped the countdown because 
the booster known as energiya would have hit the platform at 
takeoff 
the sudden halt was similar to the dramatic lastminute 
postponement of the liftoff of the worlds first shuttle the us 
craft columbia was delayed for two days in april 1981 because of 
computer software problems some subsequent us shuttle flights 
also were delayed 
the accessory platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts 
didnt move away from the energiya body to a safe distance 
tass said 11 hours after the scheduled 623 am liftoff 
tass said a computer that senses 140 elements of the launch 
system halted the countdown and that thousands of tons of liquid 
fuel were being drained from energiya the report quoted baikonurs 
test control chief air force maj gen vladimir e gudilin 
the government newspaper izvestia said the platform contained 
equipment to aim the spacecraft toward the proper trajectory the 
newspaper quoted gudilin as saying the platform withdrew somewhat 
but not completely 
gudilin was quoted as saying he didnt think it would be long 
before the launch would be attempted again but he said a thorough 
analysis of the problem would have to be completed 
soviet television in its evening news program vremya said the 
words automatic termination of preparations flashed on a 
computer screen at baikonur as dozens of scientists watched 
the broadcast showed the gleaming white shuttle orbiter and 
rocket booster on the launch pad after the liftoff attempt with 
what it said was liquid oxygen venting from energiya 
the shuttle which looks like the us space shuttle was 
scheduled to orbit the earth twice and land on a runway eight miles 
from the blastoff site the flight was to be controlled entirely by 
computers and was meant to test launch and landing equipment and 
procedures soviet news reports said there was no indication the 
shuttle was to have deployed any satellites 
buran can carry as many as 10 people four cosmonauts and six 
passengers it is attached to energiya the worlds most powerful 
launcher and four liquidfuel boosters 
saturdays postponement was the latest in a series of problems 
that have dogged soviet space flights since the spring 
ground controllers lost contact in april with a soviet

david snow embarked on a oneman crusade 
for childrens safety after a stray lawn dart killed his 7yearold 
daughter and he says it wont stop until he draws his last breath 
michele snow died in april 1987 after one of the heavy 
metaltipped toys pierced her skull her father launched an 
emotional campaign to ban sales of the darts and on friday the 
federal consumer product safety commission voted to do just that 
the ban came too late for another little girl not much older than 
michele elevenyearold amy herrin of mcminnville tenn has been 
in a druginduced coma in a nashville hospital since a lawn dart 
penetrated 2 inches into her skull while she played the game 
tuesday doctors began to bring her out of the coma on saturday as 
the swelling in her brain subsided 
snows battle against lawn darts exposed him to hundreds of 
unsafe products sold in toy stores and now he wants them banned 
too 
you aint seen nothing yet he said lawn darts are just 
the tip of the iceberg my anger gets greater every day with the 
discoveries i make 
michele was playing with dolls in the front yard while her 
9yearold brother paul and two friends played out back with lawn 
darts plasticfinned projectiles tossed horseshoestyle toward a 
hoop on the ground one of the children threw too hard and a lawn 
dart sailed into the front yard striking micheles head 
doctors said the dart struck a major artery in her brain 
machines kept her alive until they were turned off on the third day 
i literally sat in a chair for about a month and the anger 
started to swell inside of me snow said last week i stood over 
micheles grave and i promised her that this thing that killed her 
would never kill another child 
at 40 snow left behind a comfortable life and became a consumer 
activist writing letters phoning congressmen meeting with 
reporters and testifying at congressional hearings 
he has spent 21000 in savings and missed four mortgage payments 
to fund his lobbying research and travel took him away from his job 
as an aeronautics production supervisor at hughes aircraft for weeks 
at a time 
in march the consumer product safety commission rejected a ban 
on lawn darts but snow kept plugging backed by his wife linda 
in june the commission released a study reporting lawn darts had 
killed three children and injured an estimated 6100 people between 
1978 and 1986 
reversing itself the commission decided to consider a ban on 
lawn darts fridays vote confirmed that ban which could take 
effect as early as dec 4 
snow is already working on other hazards facing children he left 
hughes aircraft in june to start the michele snow foundation it 
pays him a salary of 36000 a year 15 percent less than he made at 
hughes 
micheles old bedroom is foundation headquarters i sit in this 
room 16 hours a day seven days a week snow said ive never 
worked so hard in my life 
next to the desk sits a box of toys that fail to amuse snow he 
grabbed a plastic rattle and squeezed two little bells fell out 
and snow popped them into his mouth to show how easily a baby could 
choke on them 
he pulled on a flimsy mobile made for hanging over a crib the 
string broke and plastic disks showered onto the desk 
can you imagine a kid choking on this he asked i 
guarantee you these are going to kill children people dont realize 
what crap is out there within three miles of this house i could buy 
you 100 illegal and dangerous toys 
snow mails dangerous toys to congressmen and confronts store 
managers in toy departments hes planning a newsletter on 
childrens safety and said he will press for more safety 
restrictions and better enforcement of current laws 
i cant hug my little girl like i used to he said this is 
the only way i can manifest my love for michele if i can save one 
child or spare another family this horrible pain that were going 
to have to live with the rest of our lives its all going to be 
worth it

prime minister yitzhak shamir on saturday 
accused his election rival foreign minister shimon peres of 
leading israel on a dangerous adventure in his quest for peace 
the leader of the rightwing likud bloc told about 2000 cheering 
supporters waving signs reading only shamir will bring peace 
that their choice in tuesdays general election will be crucial 
its time for the people of israel to decide whether well go 
to direct facetoface talks with our arab neighbors in the normal 
way or to an international conference a dangerous adventure 
he said 
peres who heads the leftleaning labor party favors the forum 
and territorial concessions on the israelioccupied territories as a 
possible middle east peace solution shamir advocates direct talks 
rejects the conference and opposes a territorial compromise 
peres is saying give me a chance close your eyes shut your 
ears and ill bring peace shamir said what is this a 
gambling hall a casino 
the crowd of likud fans mostly from jerusalems working class 
areas booed every time shamir said international conference and 
shouted peres go home during the rally at a sports hall here 
peres took his campaign to the southern negev desert town of 
dimona where he was greeted with flowers kisses and applause by 
about 1100 labor supporters at an auditorium 
we will be able to develop the negev peres said if you 
vote again for likud forget the negev development god knows why 
you gave likud your vote 
he referred to a high percentage of likud voters among residents 
of the negev peres accuses the likud of directing funds to jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank instead of development towns 
in israel such as dimona 
the likud responded by broadcasting a television ad on saturday 
quoting labor officials as saying financial help should be given 
only to laborled municipalities in development towns 
polls published friday predicted either a likud victory or a 
stalemate the two major parties have governed jointly in a unity 
government for the past four years following a tie in the 1984 
elections 
likuds meir shitrit an outgoing parliament member said he 
favors another likudlabor coalition government 
but labors campaign manager nissim zvili said his party would 
agree to a national unity government only for six months until new 
elections could be held 
the peace process is the top issue in the campaign because of the 
palestinian revolt against israeli occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip more than 300 palestinians and six israelis have been 
killed since the unrest began dec 8

the space shuttle atlantis will be 
transported to its launch pad this week for a late november liftoff 
carrying a secret military satellite 
the shuttles giant tracked transporter is scheduled to set out 
from an assembly building at 1201 am wednesday for the fourmile 
sixhour journey to launch pad 39b 
officials had scheduled the rollout for early tuesday but said a 
24hour delay was forced to reconnect a loose wire in a fuel line 
system 
there will be only a few spectators in contrast to july 4 when 
discovery made its trip to the launch pad for the first 
postchallenger shuttle flight 
discovery moved out into the glare of huge floodlights and was 
greeted by music thousands of space center workers a flagbedecked 
grandstand and nasa officials and an astronaut who made speeches 
hailing a major step toward americas return to space 
the space agency said the lack of fanfare for atlantis rollout 
does not reflect the fact that the vehicle will carry into space a 
classified intelligencegathering satellite for the defense 
department 
officials said discoverys move was a onetime celebration 
marking the first time a shuttle had gone to the launch pad since 
the shuttle challenger exploded and killed seven astronauts on jan 
28 1986 
discovery was launched sept 29 with five astronauts who deployed 
a communications satellite and completed a successful fourday 
mission 
now that the shuttles are flying again officials said they are 
returning to a more normal way of doing things shuttles almost 
always move to the pad in the early morning because the weather is 
usually better then 
atlantis flight will be the third allmilitary mission in 27 
shuttle flights like the two previous ones the defense department 
and nasa have shrouded much of it in secrecy 
the launch date will be announced but the public will be told 
only that the shuttle will lift off sometime during a threehour 
period the countdown will be made public nine minutes before the 
planned launch time and there will be launch commentary through the 
8minute ascent into orbit 
after that there will be an announcement every 24 hours reporting 
that atlantis and its crew are still in orbit if there is a major 
problem affecting crew safety that will be disclosed if everything 
is normal the landing time will be announced 16 hours in advance 
and there will be commentary through the touchdown period 
no information will be made available on the deployment of the 
satellite 
five military astronauts commanded by navy cmdr robert gibson 
will fly the mission the others are air force lt col guy gardner 
air force col richard mullane air force lt col jerry ross and 
navy cmdr william shepherd 
discoverys crew had several prelaunch news conferences and 
private media interviews the media will have no access to atlantis 
crew 
the air force says the secrecy is necessary to protect national 
security aspects of the mission however on the previous two 
shuttle military flights many news organizations reported 
extensively on the payloads and other details

fifty years after orson welles 
fictitious martians invaded earth this town commemorated the 
anniversary saturday with a parade a carnival and a bronze relief 
to mark the landing site 
revelers painted themselves green in honor of the 1938 halloween 
eve when the mercury theatre of the air broadcast war of the 
worlds and unwittingly duped up to 1 million americans into 
believing that the end of the world was at hand 
howard koch who adapted the hg wells novel for the broadcast 
was the marshal at saturdays parade 
he told the crowd that a week before the show he still had not 
chosen an invasion site so he bought a gas station map in new 
jersey closed his eyes and picked the hamlet of grovers mill he 
liked the name because it had an authentic ring to it 
im so glad my pencil landed on grovers mill koch said as he 
surveyed the costumed extraterrestrials parading by 
a float by the prince of peace lutheran church proclaimed the 
martians might be coming but the lutherans are here 
a convertible filled with martians and two men wearing george 
bush and michael dukakis masks read we have better choices on 
mars 
a quartet of national guardsmen opened the ceremonies evoking 
memories of the night when martians large enough to wade across the 
hudson river wiped out the militia with poison gas and heat rays 
this is an m16 maximum effective range of 460 meters said 
specialist lorena elmy 
guaranteed to knock a martian right out said sgt craig 
mccumming 
the fourday celebration also included a masquerade ball 
fireworks a reenactment of the broadcast and panel discussions on 
space travel and the power of the news media 
at eddie kemps lawnmower company down the road sweatshirts that 
read grovers mill co where martians buy power equipment 
sold briskly 
several hundred people gathered at the clearing where the radio 
show said the beings landed and where 50 years ago farmers roamed 
surrounding fields with shotguns and curiosity seekers trampled 
crops for a glimpse of the invaders 
a bronze relief was unveiled depicting welles at the microphone 
a spaceship landing near the water tower that was shot at that night 
by frightened residents and a family huddled by a radio 
richard wilson an actor on the original show marveled at all 
the hoopla he said the young cast of the mercury theatre had no 
great hopes for the broadcast 
we thought it would be one of the weaker shows he said it 
sort of came together at the end and we thought its not bad but 
there was no idea it would cause such a stir 
it is clear that what happened here 50 years ago was not just a 
small local event but an event whose meaning we are just beginning 
to fathom said douglas forrester the main organizer of the 
celebration 
he and others noted that the bizarre chapter in broadcast history 
prompted a halfcentury of analysis of the enormous power of the 
airwaves 
gov thomas h kean recounted some of the stories reported by 
hoodwinked residents that night probably embellished in five 
decades of retelling 
a new jersey man stopped to warn a friend then broke off 
hurriedly and said gotta go now the world is coming to an end 
and ive got an awful lot to do according to historical accounts 
an outraged nbc executive fumed that his network had been 
scooped on the story of the millenium 
one man packed his family into the car headed for the shore and 
accidentally drove off the end of a pier nobody was hurt 
another man drove through his garage door in his haste to flee 
and told his wife it didnt matter because they wouldnt be needing 
the garage anymore 
it left a more lasting legacy it taught us about the 
tremendous power of media communications kean said 
later saturday the amazing kreskin a mentalist and night club 
performer had some 60 unsuspecting fairgoers believing the war 
of the worlds was happening all over again 
after assembling the participants on stage kreskin dropped a 
handkerchief 
soon some of the subjects claimed they saw ships starting to land 
behind a display of kites some distance away several women began 
sobbing many ran off the stage most pointed in the air and one man 
began taking pictures of the imaginary spectacle 
kreskin had talked to the people earlier selecting them from 
about 80 potential subjects and apparently laid the groundwork for 
a sort of mass hypnosis 
that was so real i never saw anything like it i actually 
turned around a couple of times to see if anything was there said 
lt george johnson a state corrections officer helping with 
security at the festival at mercer county park 
kreskin then regrouped the panicked subjects and with the drop of 
a handkerchief ended the illusion

president chadli bendjedid dismissed his 
secondincommand at the nations only legal party saturday less 
than a week before a referendum on political reforms sparked by 
bloody riots 
mohamed cherif messaadia who was in charge of the national 
liberation fronts permanent secretariat but considered an opponent 
of bendjedids reform plans was replaced by abdelhamid mehri 
ambassador to neighboring morocco 
bendjedid also fired gen mejdoub lakehelayat the chief of 
military security and gave the job to col mohamed bechine who was 
in charge of security in the algerian army 
the changes were announced by the official news agency aps 
citing a statement issued by the presidents office 
the government has said 159 people were killed and 154 injured in 
a week of confrontations that started oct 4 in algiers and spread 
to many provincial cities in the north african nation unofficial 
reports said more than 400 were killed 
most of the deaths came when troops fired on unarmed protesters 
who were violating a ban on demonstrations under a state of 
emergency 
benjedid announced the referendum at the end of the week of 
unrest the nov 3 referendum would institute several reforms 
including making the premier answer to the national assembly for his 
governments policies 
until now the premier has been responsible only to the president 
and could not be ousted by the assembly 
mehri and betchine are believed to be more supportive than their 
predecessors of bendjedids efforts to break the ruling partys 
monopoly on political power and public expression 
but bendjedid has ruled out allowing other parties to compete 
with the front which led the war with france that brought 
independence in 1962 and still is presented as an essential symbol 
of algerian unity 
the reforms to be voted on thursday would not make major changes 
in themselves since the national assembly remains controlled by the 
party but they are seen as part of bendjedids attempt to open up 
political life 
bendjedid also made mehri the head of a commission preparing a 
crucial party congress expected in december 
the congress is to consider further proposals to allow nonparty 
members to run for office and introduce contested elections for 
party posts 
the riots started as a protest against economic policies but 
spread into an expression of resentment against symbols of power 
ranging from staterun department stores to government ministries

it said waldheim met with president hafez assad in damascus and 
told reporters later he raised the question of the extradition 
request and that further talks will be held on the issue

balkans during world war ii he served as a lieutenant in the 
intelligence unit of a command accused of atrocities

a 525 million settlement has been 
reached with the chubb group of insurance cos and a subsidiary in a 
dispute over drought insurance sold to minnesota farmers last 
spring it was announced saturday 
all farmers who otherwise would be entitled to benefits under a 
policy will receive restitution or compensation under this 
settlement said minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch 
hatch said about 770 minnesota farmers may be eligible for 
payments under the agreement with the new jerseybased chubb and its 
subsidiary federal insurance co 
the settlement was granted preliminary approval friday by steele 
county district judge frederick hough who also certified as a class 
action a lawsuit against chubb and federal filed on behalf of 
minnesota farmers who were denied drought insurance coverage the 
judge scheduled a dec 19 hearing to consider final approval 
the dispute arose when chubb sold more drought insurance policies 
than it could cover and denied coverage to most of the more than 
8000 midwestern farmers in minnesota and nine other states who 
bought the policies during the early summer 
both hatch and brice gamber a vice president and regional 
manager of chubb said the ruling applied only to minnesota 
the resolution here may be substantially different than what 
occurs in other states hatch said 
chubb said it intended to issue only 40 million in coverage and 
it considered the remainder of the 400 million worth of policies to 
be only applications 
more than 1000 minnesota farmers applied for the coverage hatch 
said 
chubb said it issued 228 policies providing coverage totaling 
87 million in minnesota incurred losses according to chubb 
amounted to 27 million in that state 
to the remaining minnesota applicants chubb made 773 
goodwill payments totaling 14 million the company said under 
terms of the settlement those payments and premium costs that were 
refunded will be deducted from the reimbursement amount hatch said 
farmers will receive exactly what the benefit bargain was less 
compensation that attorneys involved will receive said hatch 
estimating that attorney fees would amount to about 5 percent of the 
settlement 
gamber said the company was delighted to have this resolved 
both for the farmers and to avoid protracted legal and 
administrative proceedings in minnesota 
the company also agreed to pay a 50000 civil penalty plus an 
additional 50000 to cover expenses incurred by the commerce 
department in investigating the drought insurance dispute hatch 
said 
chubb is the nations 16thlargest property and casualty insurer 
with a net worth of 21 billion as of june 30 
the drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack 
of rain between june 1 and aug 31 based on a sliding scale

savannah river plant inspectors who 
monitor radiation exposure have been retrained after two workers 
were mistakenly treated for excessive contamination a newspaper 
reported saturday 
this is an extremely unusual occurrence carol palmiotto 
plant health protection department supervisor told the charleston 
postcourier on friday 
on oct 13 two workers at the nuclear weapons production plant 
discovered they had picked up some radioactive material on their 
clothing ms palmiotto said 
the workers apparently picked up the material at one of the 
plants chemical separations facilities and reported it to the 
health protection department she said 
our initial survey of the individuals indicated that they had 
some minimal lowlevel contamination in their nasal passages ms 
palmiotto said this is determined by what we call nasal smears 
we wipe the area of the nostril with a qtip and then put the qtip 
in some radiation monitoring devices 
the employees were referred to the plant medical department and 
chelation therapy was initiated she said 
chelation therapy involves the use of an experimental drug called 
dtpa which is manufactured for the department of energy by a an oak 
ridge tenn firm before dtpa is administered the worker must 
sign a waiver indicating he or she is aware that the drug is 
considered investigational by the federal food and drug 
administration 
subsequent measurements indicated that our initial calculations 
were in error ms palmiotto said 
all health protection department inspectors have been 
reinstructed in proper calculation methods since the incident she 
said 
she said even with the calculation error the employees had 
received minimal nominal exposure in their nasal passages and that 
she believed the plant physician would have ordered the chelation 
therapy anyway 
dr george a poda a medical director at the plant until his 
retirement in 1986 said chelation therapy is as safe as taking 
aspirin and is used whenever contamination is suspected 
a chelate is a chemical compound that grabs onto something and 
holds it in suspension so that it cannot be absorbed into the body 
poda explained 
the aiken sc plant is one of 16 plants nationwide producing 
nuclear weapons materials for the department of energy it is the 
only site where the main nuclear production materials plutonium and 
tritium are produced all three of its reactors have been closed 
for safety reasons

texas land developer and democratic 
fundraiser thomas gaubert was found innocent saturday of fraud 
charges stemming from a us justice department investigation of a 
32 million loan made in a condominium project 
gaubert 48 tearfuly embraced his son mike after the federal 
jury acquitted him of three fraud counts and two counts of making 
false statements 
i was never guilty of anything he said 
gaubert a fundraiser for house speaker jim wright and other 
texas democrats was indicted in march in a justice department 
investigation into texas land dealings he was on trial in iowa 
because the case involved the capitol savings and loan association 
of mount pleasant 
prosecutor thomas mcquillan the only member of the prosecution 
team in of us district judge harold vietors courtroom when the 
verdict was returned declined to comment on the jurys decision or 
how it would affect the texas investigations 
prosecutors contended gaubert withheld information that he was 
the seller of 44 acres of dallas land bought by the individuals 
obtaining a 32 million loan commitment from the iowa thrift in 
early 1983 they said gaubert bought property for less than 50 cents 
a square foot and that it was sold that same day for 525 a square 
foot through a series of transactions that netted him a 56 million 
profit from the 8 million first installment of the loan 
capitol officials testified during the threeweek trial they 
would not have agreed to the loan if they knew gaubert was the 
seller federal regulators said the gaubert deal is one reason why 
the thrift was declared insolvent and later closed 
documents on file with the court but not introduced as evidence 
in the criminal trial showed that despite the initial profit 
gaubert repaid 7 million to capitol in 1985 as part of an 
outofcourt settlement of civil charges arising from the same 
transaction 
prosecutor richard fishkin portrayed gaubert during closing 
arguments thursday as a schemer who used capitols shaky financial 
position to his advantage he said gaubert misled capitol about the 
loan from which the thrift stood to earn millions of dollars in 
fees 
in his closing arguments defense attorney abbe lowell said his 
client and capitol shared several profitable deals and that 
capitols officers knew or should have known all the details of 
the controversial loan he said there was ample documentation for 
the directors to learn of gauberts involvement had they chosen to 
do so 
the jury found no lies no misrepresentation no attempt to 
hurt a thrift lowell said

were rescheduled or referred to clinics not being picketed 
counterdemonstrators at some sites chanted right to life your 
names a lie you dont care if women die and not the church 
not the state women will decide their fate 
abortion opponents offered one woman approaching a clinic in 
irvington nj money and shelter to help her raise her child 
abortion never makes you unpregnant it only makes you the mother 
of a dead child she was told 
despite the arrests mostly for blocking access or trespassing

gay activists on saturday sought to counter 
gov george deukmejians endorsement of a proposition that would 
require disclosure of aids patients names but a cosponsor of the 
measure praised the move 
there is concern that whatever we do we dont want to draw more 
attention to the governors endorsement said terry beswick of the 
aids coalition to unleash power what we want to do is perhaps 
draw more attention to those who have come out against the measure 
to make our actions more constructive 
deukmejian announced friday he would vote in favor of proposition 
102 which would require doctors blood banks and other institutions 
to report to health officers any patients and blood donors they 
reasonably feel have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency 
virus or who have tested positive for it the virus causes the 
deadly and incurable acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
deukmejian said the measure would provide public health 
officials with the critical information they need to stop the spread 
of aids while maintaining the confidentiality of the doctorpatient 
relationship 
the governors announcement triggered protests by nearly 3000 
demonstrators friday night who gathered in the predominantly gay 
castro street neighborhood and marched several miles many 
protesters fear mandatory reporting would discriminate against 
homosexuals the group most affected by aids 
health officials also have opposed the initiative fearing it 
would discourage people in highrisk groups from getting tested for 
the virus and from volunteering as research subjects 
the outrage was motivated by the fact that so many hundreds of 
doctors and healthcare workers have said people should vote no 
and every member of the governors aids advisory council is opposed 
to 102 said allen white a leader of the protest staged by 
mobilization against aids and other groups 
antitax crusader paul gann the initiatives cosponsor praised 
the governor for making an informed decision 
gann who tested positive for the hiv virus after open heart 
surgery called the measure our best hope to at long last begin 
the process of identifying tracing and treating this killer 
disease

the governing congress party on saturday 
shifted the location for its memorial ceremony for slain prime 
minister indira gandhi because protesting farmers refused to move 
from the planned site 
the ceremony scheduled for monday was to be held on the boat 
club lawns in the center of delhi where major political rallies are 
frequently held 
but tens of thousands of farmers demanding higher crop prices 
and protesting electricity bills have occupied the lawns since they 
began a sitin tuesday 
congress party spokesman ghulam nabi azad said the ceremony will 
be held instead at the red fort comlex to avoid a confrontation with 
the farmers 
late saturday police announced over public address systems near 
the boat club lawns that the sit in was illegal and ordered 
protesters to surrender their weapons 
many of the demonstrators were armed with wooden staves knives 
and handheld implements from their farms 
a delegation of farmers met saturday with home minister buta 
singh and other government officials but no agreement was reached 
the united news of india said that the leader of the indian 
farmers union mahender singh tikait earlier told the protesters 
that the sitin would continue until the farmers demands were met 
uni quoted azad as saying we will not allow the solomn 
occasion of indira gandhis martyrdom to be marred and we would 
rather shift the venue 
preparations for the ceremony including the construction of a 
stage began at the lawns in central new delhi more than two weeks 
ago 
mrs gandhi the leader of the congress party for nearly two 
decades was slain on oct 31 1984 in the garden of her residence 
by two sikh bodyguards the government said the sikhs killed her in 
revenge for the assault she had ordered by army troops on the sikhs 
holy golden temple in the punjabi city of amritsar 
hundreds of people were killed in the assault and the government 
said that sikh extremists seeking a separate sikh homeland in the 
punjab had used the temple as an arsenal and fortress 
mrs gandhi was succeeded as prime minister and head of the 
congress party by her son rajiv gandhi

the outcome of the twoweek effort to free 
two california gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals 
faced 200 miles of iceclogged waters on the way to their winter 
home 
indeed the sentiment among rescuers friday was that ignorance 
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than 1 million 
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them 
a lot of people just didnt want to know about their fate 
said federal marine mammal biologist jim harvey 
rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the 
animals that entailed additional expense and rescue coordinator 
ron morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from 
tracking a pair of young lost whales

millers that japans virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible

george bush stands uneasily on the brink of an electoral college 
landslide with michael dukakis picking up strength in several 
battleground states according to an associated press survey that 
permits democrats to dream of a finalweek presidential comeback 
the 50state survey shows that bush leads for as many as 359 
electoral votes but has not locked up the 270 that would assure him 
a victory dukakis leads for just 78 electoral votes nine states 
offering 101 votes are rated as tossups including illinois 
pennsylvania and wisconsin 
the ap survey indicates bush has maintained republican strength 
in the south and rocky mountain west while dukakis has failed to 
accomplish the same in the industrial states the survey was based 
on polls as well as interviews with politiciasns and political 
analysts around the country 
were spending all our time in states that should be his 
dukakis base and hes spending none of his time in states 
that should be our base says top bush strategist lee atwater 
thats a campaign managers dream

of whispers that the reagan administration wanted charges delayed 
until after nov 8 so that democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis wouldnt have them as ammunition against george bush 
nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down 
indictments in the first part of october hudson said in an 
interview at weeks end indeed he and his bosses at the justice 
department had predicted that kind of timetable last june when the
