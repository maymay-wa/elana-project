the federal government will pay nearly 25 
million to counties hit by the 1989 loma prieta earthquake to help 
displaced poor people officials said thursday 
federal emergency management agency officials backed out of a 
similar agreement announced in february saying it had been signed 
under a misunderstanding 
legal aid lawyers for the poor said the new settlement had been 
approved by fema highlevel justice department officials and us 
district judge eugene lynch 
assistant us attorney george stoll confirmed the agreement was 
reached saying it was binding and the government should provide 
funding quickly 
we are confident they will not renege said morgan gilhuly 
a volunteer san francisco lawyer this is a good deal for fema 
and a good deal for people who lost their housing 
under the settlement fema is to distribute the funds to san 
francisco santa cruz and alameda counties said stepehn ronfeldt 
of legal aid society of alameda county 
the funds will be distributed according to each countys 
proportionate losses in lowincome housing units 
san francisco planning official carla javits said the city would 
use most of its money to renovate two centers providing 425 beds 
and a variety of services to the homeless 
alameda county which lost more than 1100 residential hotel 
rooms will use some money for reconstruction and some for a newly 
designed housing voucher program said rae mary of the countys

computers are challenging the sandbox and 
easel in preschool programs across the country although educators 
have mixed opinions about introducing technology to toddlers 
youngsters should begin as early as possible to view computers 
as a tool said suzanne thouvenelle vice president of an 
alexandria va firm that developed software for young children 
but john lindley principal of south colby elementary school in 
port orchard wash countered children need to be involved in 
active learning computers are too passive computer introduction 
to them is something they get too much of already and thats 
television 
even bernard gifford vice president of education marketing for 
apple computer inc acknowledged that computers in preschool may 
be a bit too early 
i believe strongly in making it available to kids but i would 
be reluctant to impose a structured program at that age i think 
the most important skills for youngsters at ages 3 and 4 frankly 
are social skills 
in a sampling of head start preschool classes around the 
country children used computers to create animals and plant 
imaginary gardens one program allowed them to combine facial 
features on the computer while dictating stories to their teachers 
the youngsters were so excited and motivated by the computers 
that attendance improved thouvenelle said parents also showed a 
greater interest in their childrens work and enthusiastically 
volunteered to work in the classroom 
walt disney computer software inc recently introduced a line 
of software that had been tested at two burbank calif 
preschools nowhere on the package does it say educational 
software notes sam palahnuk walt disney product developer 
what we claim this stuff is a fun exploratory software for your 
kid 
fun is what 3yearold heather leffler 4yearold emily koleini 
and her 2yearold brother massoud were having during a 
demonstration of the software at an upscale virginia mall with 
parents nearby the children watched in delight the colorful 
animated graphics of mickey mouse and his friends and listened to 
the digitalized speech fully orchestrated music and reallife 
sound effects 
the youngsters used numbers to help mickey mouse plan a birthday 
party forggoofy named animals at a county fair with letters of the 
alphabet and identified shapes as mickey performed magic acts 
it certainly isnt boring said andrea fleury of mclean 
va as she threatened to leave her 3yearold who had tinkered 
with the computer for nearly two hours 
we went for the approach let kids really have fun and theyll 
learn as a side effect said palahnuk we dont want to claim 
that its going to teach your kid anything we think it will but 
you start getting into teaching philosophy and curriculum and all 
that kind of thing 
a study by the national association of elementary school 
principals found that elementary school children are more likely to 
use computers in school than high school or college students and 
even 15 percent of kindergartners and preschoolers in the public 
schools use computers 
research dating back to 1932 showed that technology as simple 
as a typewriter had significant effects on the reading and writing 
performance of elementary students said james e dezel 
international business machines corp vice president the 
technology available to schools today and in the future could bring 
about amazing results 
ibm sponsored the threeyear study exploring classroom uses of 
computers with children and parents in head start a popular 
federal preschool program that provides education meals and health 
screening for poor youngsters aged 3 through 5 
eleven of head starts 1300 programs participated including 
four in baltimore md and one each in winder ga deridder la 
new york city lexington ky toledo ohio las cruces nm and 
dayton ohio 
head start was used because of its emphasis on providing 
equity for kids from lowincome families said thouvenelle vice 
president of mobius corp which developed new software after 
evaluating the program 
she said the software meets the guidelines of the national 
association for the education of young children as being 
developmentally appropriate association officials take no 
position on computers in preschool 
our major concern was whether or not computers were 
applicable or would work for preschool children 3 and 4 years 
old said thouvenelle a second concern she said was whether 
young children can use computers as a tool the same way they use 
blocks or easel painting 
each of the 44 classrooms participating in the experiment had 
two computers that shared a printer mouse and a large 
touchsensitive device known as the powerpad thouvenelle said the 
powerpad is important to young children who often do not have the 
fine motor skills needed to hold a pen or pencil 
the computers ran a program called kidsway which came equipped 
with voice cards in the native language of the parents of the 
children who participated such as spanish navajo swahili and 
japanese 
a key finding said thouvenelle is that computers should be 
available and accessible to youngsters in the classroom the same 
as reading materials art work blocks sandbox and other socalled 
learning center areas preschoolers should not be marched down the 
hall to a computer laboratory she said 
she said a lack of teacher training and support remains a key 
drawback to the program 
winnie porter a 12year teaching veteran of kindergarten 
through fifth grade in san francisco is against pushing academics 
too early in kindergarten computers she said are good as long 
as kids are allowed to explore with them and they are not forced on 
them 
i think children could learn what they would learn from a 
computer as they would learn from other things said pat 
wynneevans who retired last year as a san francisco teacher 
with many school districts plagued by tight budgets lindley 
the south colby principal said if i had to make a financial 
decision between buying big blocks for 400500 and a computer for 
850 id go with the big blocks every time 
kids need active learning computers are not 
multidimensional also you want children using their imagination 
rather than looking at a screen lindley said

in this dusty village progress is not a 
question of telephones or television it is a matter of water 
stanislaw szablowski and his neighbors had to truck water in 
every day for years their wells were too shallow and tainted even 
for their livestock and crops 
like more than 70 percent of polish villages zastawie had no 
running water recent health ministry tests of the farmyard wells 
villagers depend on throughout poland found the water in 67 percent 
was too polluted to use 
i dont have to tell you the impact of the lack of enough 
clean water on the quality of life on the amount of work for 
women on hygiene on farm productivity said maria stolzman a 
member of parliament 
her water supply foundation led by the roman catholic church 
helped zastawie build a deepwell pumping station that brought 
plentiful fresh water to the 31 farms in august 
polands water crisis also affects urban areas where more than 
half the supply comes from surface water so contaminated that 
experts say it should not have been collected in the first place 
of the 4500 health ministry tests made on city water systems in 
1989 only 376 percent found good water 
we are really struggling said eugenia koblakkolinska 
deputy director of the environment ministrys water department 
everything that can be done on paper regulations 
theoretical research preparation of plans and progress is 
already worked out what we lack is a way to put it into practice 
the new technologies the money 
eastern europe after communism is revealing a horror of 
pollution that was created by heavy industry and untamed by concern 
for the environment 
the nations of the former soviet bloc have neither the expertise 
nor money to reverse the decades of destruction and their efforts 
for economic development often compete with environmental 
protection 
there is optimism however that the change to market economics 
will provide governments newly focused on environmental hazards 
with the ability to fight wanton polluters 
under the old system stateowned factories subsidized by the 
national treasury could afford the modest fines occasionally 
imposed for pollution the fines have been increased by up to 27 
times however and will be much more important to industries 
forced to survive in capitalist competition 
our minister made an ultimatum to a large group of factories 
either you will do something for environmental protection 
during a certain period of time or the factory will cease to 
exist mrs koblakkolinska said the factories still cannot 
believe that something like this might happen 
pollution fighters look with some hope at offers from western 
nations to provide environmental help as part of their aid 
programs 
what they offer us credits with very low interest and some 
modern technologies this is all very interesting mrs 
koblakkolinska said then added but credits have to be paid 
back 
years of pollution of polands water supply are documented in 
handwritten ledgers stacked in the health and environment 
ministries 
in lomza province northeast of warsaw for example only 66 
percent of 280 wells tested in 1989 had acceptable water in 
slupsk a baltic province 40 percent of the 265 wells tested were 
polluted 
communist officials did not act on the information or make it 
public a regime unable to provide jobs housing and food tended to 
dismiss environmental controls as luxuries 
under communist censorship the information about polluted water 
might have been known to a certain very narrow circle of 
people said alicja lopatek a health ministry sanitary 
inspector but it could not come into the open 
reports by the health and environment ministries say 
thirtyfive percent of river water is not even fit for 
industrial use polands main river the vistula running from the 
southern mountains to the baltic is unfit for any use for more 
than half its length 
warsaw is the only european capital without a sewage treatment 
plant and there are none in such other major cities as lodz 
bialystock and radom 
nearly half the 800 small cities and towns lack water 
purification systems environmental officials estimate poland needs 
1900 major sewage treatment plants in towns and cities and 8300 
in rural areas at a total cost of 20 billion to 25 billion 
half the nitrogen deposited in the baltic comes from poland 
along with a large share of other pollutants polands baltic 
resorts are closed to swimmers and its fishing catch is 
questionable prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said curbing the 
pollution poses many problems and may even be unrealistic 
without significant technological and financial support from 
abroad 
water pumped from polands coal mines is so salty when it pours 
into rivers that it kills biological life and corrodes machinery 
lack of purification systems exacerbates the health threat of 
polluted water 
the filter stations are oldfashioned said stanislaw 
sadanski a health ministry water expert some were built in the in 
the 1920s and 1930s he said and the one in warsaw is 100 years 
old 
mrs lopatek of the ministry said local water systems 
generally dont have any equipment for cleaning water and the 
worst situation is with the wells public and private even on the 
outskirts of warsaw people are using wells 
shallow wells collect surface water that picks up chemicals 
human and animal waste and other contaminants the answer is 
deepwell water facilities with purification and sewage systems 
if you are a mother with a child it may be shocking to hear 
the pollution standard is exceeded by 10 times but if you have 
no other water what do you do sadanski said

crayola company officials might be 
turning a little red make that fuchsia with news that its top 
crayon maker is colorblind 
emerson moser who is retiring next week after 35 years isnt 
colorblind in the sense that he cant see color at all its just 
that some colors are confusing to him 
that means trying to spot the difference between a cadet blue 
and a blue green can make him feel well like a shrinking violet 
if you have a serious case of it you could foul up a lot of 
materials said moser 63 who has made a record 14 billion 
crayons his title at binney amp smith co is a crayon molder 
as far as moser and the company can tell theres been no threat 
of children coloring the sky green and the grass blue unless they 
were doing their andy warhol imitations 
hes bluegreen colorblind but despite his handicap hes 
gone to the top of his trade said brad drexler spokesman for 
the eastonbased company 
moser has made seas of salmon pecks of plums and is a king 
crayon craftsman drexler said tuesday moser made yards of yellow 
and wednesday it was oodles of orange colors that give moser no 
trouble 
when you have shades of one color you get a little doubt 
about it before you go do anything you doublecheck yourself 
said moser 
its the second technicolor shock to come out of the crayola 
plant this year in august it retired eight traditional colors 
into the crayola hall of fame 
the company is asking moser to donate his final pair of 
anklehigh boots splashed with the waxy colorful remains of his 
time on the job for inclusion in the hall 
the colors splash a little bit when it comes out of the kettle 
into the bucket said moser people daily clean their shoes 
but i dont i have a multicolored pair of shoes its probably 
made them waterproof 
this pair i have now theres yellow on them because i 
worked yellow today and some orange and some red moser said in 
a telephone interview tuesday 
a company doctor detected mosers slight vision problem during a 
physical conducted when he was hired oct 12 1953 as a floor boy 
in the packing department 
its so slight that if the doctor wouldnt have tested me i 
probably would have never noticed it moser said 
less than two years later moser graduated to the most colorful 
job in the world pouring molten wax into 2400crayon molds nearly 
100 times a day once the wax is set crayons are flicked out of 
the racks and stacked in a bin for a conveyor belt to carry them to 
a labeling machine 
at crayola there are subtle shades of everything 
but can anyone over age 12 really tell the difference between 
violet and blue violet cornflower and navy blue blue green and 
cadet blue sepia and brown orchid and thistle or mulberry and 
red violet 
other colors to worry about are the new shades of cerulean a 
type of blue dandelion fuchsia jungle green royal purple teal 
blue vivid tangerine and wild strawberry they replaced blue gray 
green blue lemon yellow maize orange red orange yellow raw 
umber and violet blue last summer 
for less than obvious reasons moser likes the eight basic 
crayola colors black white red yellow green blue brown and 
orange he even liked the eight retired colors which now are 
remembered only in 5foottall models at the hall of fame 
but moser says there is no reason to wax nostalgic about 
retiring the crayon colors 
the new ones are nice they really stand out when you color 
with them moser said the other colors were nice too you 
grew up with them and got used to them but you cant survive on 
sentiment sentiment doesnt keep a company moving forward

a mismarked piece of lumber was a warning to greg 
clarke that something was awry in the closelyguarded business of 
grading wood for the construction industry 
an angry seattle lumber wholesaler telephoned clarkes macdonald 
inspection services in vancouver british columbia early last 
month 
he found spruce lumber that was marked as hemlock clarke 
said the next day we were down there 
since then a search for substandard lumber carrying 
highergrade marks has resulted in the closure by building 
inspectors of dozens of apartmentbuilding construction projects in 
the puget sound area up to 60 projects have been shut down 
while builders inspectors and engineers have worked to ferret 
out lowquality lumber and resume projects the royal canadian 
mounted police has started an investigation in british columbia to 
find the source of the mismarked wood 
costs to fix buildings are expected to run into the millions of 
dollars however inspectors and builders said there were no safety 
problems and the buildings would be built to code 
were not looking at this as a significant structural problem 
right now said mike dykeman commercial inspection supervisor 
for king county building and land development 
rather than a health and safety issue i think what we have is 
a consumer fraud issue colin quinn lincoln property co vice 
president said tuesday mislabeled studs were found in a new 
192unit lincoln apartment complex 
clarke and tom searles executive vice president of the american 
lumber standards committee in germantown md said the mislabeled 
lumber appeared to be limited to the seattle area and to larger 
construction jobs 
the problem is with framing lumber generally considered no 3 
quality but graded to indicate it is of no 1 or no 2 quality 
and with spruce marked as more desirable hemlock or fir 
the lumber carries the macdonald grading stamp which is 
registered and licensed to mills marking lowerquality wood a 
higher grade can double its price 
searles said the case was the biggest he could remember 
people have copied grade stamps before but its never been 
this blatant he said adding that the international 
lumbergrading system is zealously guarded and there have been few 
cases of fraud 
the most recent he could recall involved a truss plant in south 
florida several years ago where the manufacturer had illegally 
copied a stamp 
searles said the mismarked wood was a very small percentage in 
the overall picture of things 
the united states building industry imports 12 billion to 14 
billion board feet of lumber a year from canada searles said 
estimates of the mismarked timber involved range from 140000 board 
feet to millions of board feet 
dykeman said inspection agencies have asked builders to check 
records inspect buildings and dig through wastewood piles in 
search of suspect wood 
in some instances plumbing electric wiring and wallboard have 
had to be torn out to brace or replace mismarked lumber the 
biggest problems arise with joists horizontal beams that support 
floors or ceilings 
dykeman said some projects have been shut down for six weeks and 
could be shut down eight more weeks 
quinn said the apartment builders would go to court to push the 
losses they have sustained further up the chain of suppliers 
in canada the mounted police has said little about its search 
for culprits 
chris perkins investigating officer declined to provide 
details of the investigation except to say it would be lengthy 
macdonald inspection services has retrieved its grading stamps 
from two firms moga timber mill ltd and ap timber co which 
market lumber from a single mill in surrey 
the operations are owned by the brar family brian brar on 
monday denied any wrongdoing we will not tolerate any claims 
made against moga or ap timber he said 
lumber carrying stamps licensed to the mill was sent to the job 
sites in the puget sound area however it was shipped through 
bbm lakeview lumber ltd of surrey which had sold it to lumber 
brokers in seattle 
bbm lakeview this week did not return phone calls to the 
associated press the companys attorney said earlier his company 
was a victim and did nothing wrong 
in a separate case bbm lakeview pleaded guilty may 6 1988 
to defrauding the public in a case involving mismarked wood and was 
fined 100000

high over hiroshima a navigator in a b29 
recorded the worlds introduction to the power and terror of 
nuclear weapons 
bombaway 0915 reads the simple entry from the 
navigators log for aug 6 1945 
the log from the top secret mission of the enola gay goes on the 
auction block friday pearl harbor day christies auction house 
expects it will attract a price of 100000 to 150000 
i think in looking at the log you see in effect the world 
moving from the preatomic into the atomic era you see humanity 
crossing a very profound boundary said chris coover a 
manuscript specialist at christies 
he said the timing of the sale on the 49th anniversary of the 
japanese attack on pearl harbor is a coincidence 
but he said there was a historical symmetry to the attacks 
on pearl harbor and hiroshima one marking the beginning of 
hostilities and the other effectively the end of hostilities 
but martin sherman director of the nuclear age history and 
humanities center at tufts university called it an unfortunate 
date 
it implies an appropriateness about hiroshima sort of a 
balance on the scales of justice he said they attacked us so 
we gave them any eye for an eye so to speak which is completely 
inappropriate and historically inaccurate 
in the attack on pearl harbor 18 us ships were sunk or 
severely damaged about 170 planes were destroyed and the american 
casualties numbered about 3700 there were 130000 casualties at 
hiroshima 
christies is selling the log for the widow of capt robert a 
lewis copilot of the enola gay eileen lewis hopes she can retire 
on the sale price and wants no publicity herself coover said 
she is very concerned she is going to catch all kinds of hate 
mail and flak for putting this up for sale coover said 
the log recorded the enola gays basic flight information 
position altitude air speed compass direction on three yellow 
oblong sheets during the 12hour roundtrip mission between the us 
base in the marianas islands and hiroshima 
the bomber with 12 people aboard left tinian island at 245 
am the pilot was col paul tibbets commanding officer of the 
509th composite group which had been specially trained for the 
mission 
tibbets selected lewis a brooklyn native as his copilot 
lewis was one of the most experienced b29 pilots in the air force 
he had survived two crashes and had a reputation for remaining 
calm in moments of stress 
in the planes bomb bay rested a single 9000pound uranium 
bomb tibbets carried cyanide capsules to distribute to each man if 
the plane experienced engine failure or was shot down 
the log was recorded in tinian time one hour ahead of the time 
in hiroshima by navigator theodore s van kirk at 555 am he 
noted iwo in the lefthand column as the enola gay 
rendezvoused with two other b29s near iwo jima 
at 830 am the notation iff off appears the planes 
radar identification gear was turned off to prevent any 
interference with the bombs detonation devices 
at about this time tibbets decided on the missions primary 
target hiroshima over secondary choices nagasaki and kokura 
at 912 am the bomber was 12 miles from its target in the 
righthand column of the log the navigator wrote eight large 
ships in harbor at mishima 
the bombbay doors opened three minutes and 17 seconds later 
bombaway 0915 reads the log entry within a minute 80000 
people were instantly killed or seriously wounded twothirds of 
the city was destroyed in the nowfamiliar mushroom cloud 
if i live a hundred years ill never quite get these few 
minutes out of my mind lewis wrote in notes that a new york 
times reporter asked him to keep during the hiroshima mission 
asked how the copilot came to have the navigators log coover 
said only that he got it from someone in the squadron 
lewis who died in 1983 at age 65 kept the log in a safe 
deposit box

what flagrant exhibitionism what terrible 
identity crisis what suicidal yearnings would compel a middleaged 
man to wriggle into a womans dress and brave the taunts of 56000 
howling fans at a washington redskins football game 
michael torbert stood thoughtfully at his frontrow seat at the 
50yard line at rfk stadium he fluffed his bright yellow tresses 
smoothed the wrinkles from his polkadot skirt and sniffed through 
his plastic hog snout 
hey priests have been wearing dresses for years right he 
said we just add a little color 
torbert and his potbellied buddies are familiar to millions of 
tv football viewers as the hogettes the unofficial redskins 
cheerleaders who go hogwild every sunday afternoon in gaudy wigs 
and skirts floppy hats and pink snouts 
our designer is calvin swine says ralph campbell who wears 
a bleachedblonde wig and ruffled yellow dress with red hogette 
sash across his ample waist a retired navy helicopter mechanic 
hes known as the pretty one 
these bearded bimbos have nicknames like pork chop and big 
georgette and peewee they boast an average weight of 243 
pounds nurtured by plenty of hot dogs and beer they like to chew 
on huge plastic cigars 
and when the redskins are rolling toward a touchdown they wave 
their parasols and hoist their beefy legs over the railing 
bellowing encouragement 
torbert organized the hogettes in 1983 to lead cheers for the 
hogs the nickname of the redskins offensive linemen and to 
raise money for their favorite childrens charities 
the hogettes range in age and occupation from a 28yearold mail 
carrier to a 59yearold retired civilian employee of army 
intelligence torbert 45 an energy department engineer and 
longtime redskins fan said all the hogettes are devoted fathers 
and civic activists 
since 1983 he said the hogettes have helped raise 30 million 
for sick and underprivileged children by appearing at golf 
tournaments telethons parades and other charity benefits at their 
own expense 
each of the 11 regular hogettes spends as much as 1000 out of 
pocket to attend redskins games and log about 5000 miles traveling

i didnt have a dress in my closet for the first 40 years 
said george maxfield alias big georgette 
my mom didnt raise me that way but id do anything to raise 
money for these kids he said 
campbell whos nickname is grandpa says he has no qualms 
about looking foolish in a womans skirt if it brings smiles to 
the kids faces and makes some money for the sick ones 
the hogettes have stolen dresses from their mothers closets and 
learned how to drink beer without getting their hog snouts wet 
theyve been pelted with ice and game programs theyve had 
their snouts pulled back and snapped in their faces shouts of 
youre mighty cute and what are you doing after the game 
are commonplace 
they take personal bodyguards when they travel to philadelphia 
to protect them against violence we know how the israelis feel 
when we attend an eagles game four of us surrounded by an armed 
camp torbert said 
the hogettes have endured not only icy stadium winds but more 
than a few surprise pinches on their tushes from playful fans 
maxfield who stands 6feet4 remembers a particularly painful 
grab at the hogettes first super bowl at tampa fla in january 
1984 
i was going up into the stands for lunch when somebody hogged 
down on my right cheek bigtime he said i swung around and 
it was a woman who must have been at least 7 feet tall 
she said im sorry i just couldnt resist i said if it 
turns you on feel free so darned if she didnt do it again 
real hard and i almost went to the emergency room to see if shed

infertile couples are flocking to clinics 
joining selfhelp groups and lobbying congress for help but 
contrary to popular perception a new study says there is no 
infertility epidemic 
the overall rate of infertility didnt change between 1982 and 
1988 said william mosher a statistician who coauthored the 
federal report this is another chapter in the life story of the 
baby boom whose members have affected american society at every 
stage of their lives 
one out of 12 women had an impaired ability to have children in 
both 1982 and 1988 a steady rate of 84 percent according to the 
report by the national center for health statistics in 1988 that 
rate translated into 49 million women aged 15 to 44 
the infertility rate for married couples actually fell from 85 
percent in 1982 to 79 percent or 23 million couples in 1988 
nevertheless said mosher and coauthor william pratt some 
popular descriptions of infertility have suggested there are 9 
million to 10 million infertile couples or that one in six couples 
is infertile fertility is increasing rapidly or there is an 
epidemic of infertility in the united states 
not true mosher and pratt said based on their analysis of the 
1982 and 1988 national surveys of family growth in fact the 
surveys found that the percentage of women with fertility problems 
has decreased among baby boom women aged 25 to 44 
still the authors said infertility problems are plaguing more 
people now than ever before due to the aging of the outsized baby 
boom generation and its propensity to delay childbearing 
the number of childless women aged 35 to 44 jumped 64 percent 
over the sixyear period in the study and while the percentage of 
those with fertility problems did not change the sheer size of the 
group added to the number afflicted 620000 in 1988 up from 
454000 in 1982 
mix those statistics with an explosion in infertility treatments 
and doctors trained in the field stir in a heavy dose of news 
coverage including letters to syndicated advice columnists like 
ann landers voila a trend 
as the technology progresses more stories are out and more 
people are learning about the availability of options more people 
are seeking services and subsequently receiving help said joyce 
zeitz a spokeswoman for the 10000member american fertility 
society in birmingham ala 
but zeitz said her group never expected the report the first 
national fecundity estimate of all 579 million women of 
reproductive age regardless of marital status to document rampant 
rises in infertility 
at one point we thought that with the aftermath of the iud 
intrauterine device problems and the prevalence of sexually 
transmitted diseases we might see a slight increase in the 
infertility rate she said in the overall scheme that was 
probably not as significant as we thought it was going to be but 
we never really felt there was going to be an epidemic 
even without the rapid rise some had anticipated zeitz said the 
disorder remains a serious concern 
were still talking about 23 million couples 49 million 
women who have a problem she said we still need more 
research better contraceptives better insurance coverage better 
lab regulation 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo is pushing a number of those 
concerns in congress one of her bills led to money this year for 
the national institutes of health to establish several 
contraceptive and infertility research centers around the country 
mrs schroeder plans to reintroduce next year a bill that would 
earmark federal money for programs that screen and treat women for 
sexually transmitted diseases a leading cause of infertility 
another proposal would require federal employees insurance 
policies if they offer pregnancy benefits to also cover 
infertility treatment and medical or counseling expenses related to 
adoption 
mosher said the focus on infertility and the visibility its 
victims have gained is not surprising 
whatever the baby boom is concerned with gets attention he 
said when they were in their late 20s they started buying houses 
and pushed up the demand for housing now they have children or are 
trying to have children so infertility adoption and child care 
are issues when they retire retirement and social security will 
be the issues

a gene that aids development of a sex organ in a 
worm may lead to new insights into human cancer scientists 
reported 
researchers have discovered that it is a socalled ras gene 
a type linked to several cancers and have figured out one of its 
normal roles in the worm 
those advances will give scientists their first chance to use a 
living animal to determine the details of what a ras gene does and 
how it is controlled commented princeton university scientist 
james broach 
were going to have a big explosion in our understanding of 
what ras does in the biology of an organism broach said we 
anticipate well be able to understand all the players that 
talk to ras and that ras interacts with 
that may illuminate the process by which a ras gene promotes 
cancer revealing new targets for therapeutic drugs broach said 
however any such payoff would be a long way in the future 
cautioned h robert horvitz a biology professor at the 
massachusetts institute of technology and an investigator at the 
howard hughes medical institute there 
ras genes normally help control cell growth and development but 
little is known about how they do that or how they are regulated 
abnormal ras genes are frequently observed in pancreatic lung 
colon and blood cell cancers 
in todays issue of the british journal nature horvitz and 
colleagues describe the ras genes role in development of female 
genitalia in a worm called caenorhabditis elegans 
the worm gene called let60 was identified as a ras gene by 
paul sternberg and min han of the california institute of 
technology in research reported last friday in the journal cell 
in the nature paper scientists report that let60 acts as a 
switch controlling signals that are supposed to tell cells to form 
genitalia called the vulva 
the researchers showed that if let60 is mutated such that it 
cannot be activated the cells fail to form genitalia when they 
receive the signals in contrast if let60 is mutated such that it 
is always turned on the cells will form a vulva even without 
any signal to do so 
scientists also found that mutations that permanently activate 
let60 resemble a mutation linked to cancer in humans such 
permanent activation of ras is what occurs in the human cancers 
with which it is associated horvitz said

us and soviet negotiators aiming toward an 
early 1991 summit in moscow are tackling the remaining obstacles 
to a treaty on strategic weapons 
after clearing away three major roadblocks to the strategic arms 
reduction treaty or start officials say experts from both sides 
will meet friday in washington to work on remaining technical 
issues they involve inspections to verify treaty compliance and 
telemetry data from ballistic missile testing 
those areas of disagreement still could block completion of the 
treaty but one us official said they are not enough for anyone 
to fall on their sword over 
the negotiators have made significant progress over the past 
month by agreeing to limit soviet backfire bombers that would be 
outside the start treaty itself to allow us nuclear programs 
with britain to continue and to restrict the launch and payload 
weight of the soviets modernized groundbased ss18 missiles 
said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the white house is holding off on preparations for president 
bushs trip to moscow anticipated for january saying the 
president will go only if the start treaty is ready to sign 
the treaty aims to cut us and soviet longrange nuclear 
weapons by 30 percent scrapping hundreds of warheads 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze will meet in houston next monday and 
tuesday to hash out the remaining issues and shevardnadze will fly 
to washington to meet with bush on wednesday 
on the three big stumbling blocks recently resolved 
the united states agreed that the soviet backfire bomber can be 
counted separately from the overall start limits of 1600 heavy 
bombers and ballistic missiles the soviets are allowed to retain 
said an official close to the talks 
the source declined to say how many backfires would be permitted 
under the politically binding letter that will be outside the 
treaty itself the soviets have an estimated 355 backfires now 
according to the international institute for strategic studies a 
londonbased think tank 
the soviets agreed to continued us nuclear programs with 
britain as long as those programs are not seen as upsetting the 
overall strategic balance the cooperation primarily involves 
technology and missiles the united states provides for british 
submarines 
the negotiators agreed that any modernized ss18 could not have 
the capability to carry heavier payloads including warheads than 
the current ss18 the treaty however would not limit 
modernization such as improved accuracy or fuel efficiency or 
alteration in the types of warheads 
under the pact the soviets would cut the number of ss18s by 
half to 154 
us officials said the remaining issues involve 
monitoring of production facilities for mobile ballistic 
missiles the two nations disagree on where in the missile 
construction process the monitoring should be allowed the united 
states wants assurances for early inspection of soviet ss24 
missiles which have 10 warheads while the soviets have insisted 
that inspection of final assembly is sufficient 
to what extent each side must provide uncoded telemetry from 
testing of ballistic missiles so that the other can interpret the 
data and verify compliance with the treatys restrictions on 
missile performance 
whether the soviets will be allowed to inspect the b2 bomber 
to ensure it is not equipped to carry longrange cruise missiles 
armed with nuclear warheads

the commerce department approved more than 20 
shipments of bacteria and other biological agents in recent years 
to iraq and syria a congressional lawyer says 
us experts said that while the agents could be intended for 
medical purposes they also could be used to develop biological 
weapons both countries are believed to be developing such lethal 
arsenals 
as a result of the shipments iraq could end up using 
ussupplied goods against american soldiers if war breaks out in 
the persian gulf said ted jacobs chief counsel of the house 
subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs 
we never thought that iraq would be so dangerous said peter 
chalfont secretary of the wiltron co of morgan hills calif 
which sold 45000 in electronic test measuring equipment to iraq 
in 1987 its easy to say in hindsight that maybe the license 
shouldnt have been approved 
the bush administration has indicated growing concern about 
iraqs dangerous chemical and biological weapons since us troops 
moved into the gulf region in august to try to force saddam 
husseins forces out of kuwait american troops routinely don 
special antigas suits as part of their readiness drills and carry 
antidotes to counter poison gas 
jacobs said he has obtained information showing that the 
commerce department has approved about half of the license 
applications for shipments to the atomic energy commissions of iraq 
and syria over the last three years 
the subcommittee has issued a subpoena to undersecretary of 
commerce dennis kloske to testify about the sales to iraq and 
syria after the commerce department refused repeated requests for 
additional information and stalled on others said jacobs 
the department approved licenses worth 700 million to iraq over 
a threeyear period ending oct 1 jacobs said licenses were 
required because all these goods were dual use items meaning 
they could be used either for peaceful or lethal purposes 
syria is under greater export restrictions than iraq because it 
is one of seven nations listed by the administration as supporters 
of terrorism still the commerce department approved 120 out of 
251 applications between oct 1987 and oct 1 1990 according to 
information obtained by jacobs 
the approval rate as well as information about the types of 
items sold to syria was first disclosed by the washington jewish 
week newspaper 
jacobs said he had received limited information from the 
commerce department that showed more than 20 shipments of bacteria 
protozoa and fungi from one us company to a post office box in 
baghdad used by that nations atomic energy commission the agency 
is a government purchasing arm for weapons and technology 
the commerce department declined to release the names of any 
companies granted export licenses citing a law that defends firms 
proprietary interests a spokeswoman at the departments bureau of 
export administration declined to discuss jacobs allegations on 
the same grounds 
most us exports of biological agents require commerce 
department approval because of the possibility they could be 
diverted for nonpeaceful use 
the department in its annual 1990 report to congress regarding 
export control measures said applications to export such agents 
will generally be denied for iran iraq syria and libya 
a company that sold the agents to iraq and syria said it was 
told the germs would be used to manufacture vaccines said a 
source who asked not to be identified but the source said an 
expert could manipulate these germs to create a stronger lethal 
strain 
the recipient of the biological agents in damascus was also the 
atomic energy commission said jacobs 
jacobs said the syrian commission also was sold a us 
oscilloscope the device is used to measure electric impulses and 
a highspeed version is vital in the development of ballistic 
missiles and other weapons 
a californiabased company techtronics has said it sold an 
oscilloscope to iraq last year but jacobs said he did not know 
whether it also sold the device to syria 
the commerce department also approved the sales of electronic 
optic and photographic equipment to syrias atomic agency 
commission jacobs said 
the total value of the goods licensed to syria over the past 
three years was 255 million according to a letter from commerce 
undersecretary kloske to the chairman of jacobs subcommittee rep 
doug barnard dga 
the nov 16 letter parts of which were obtained by the 
associated press said most of the export applications were 
referred to expert opinions at the state defense and energy 
departments 
the commerce departments 1990 export control report said most 
of the goods licensed for syria were computerrelated items 
primarily for use in the countrys petroleum industry 
but critics say the use of much of the equipment in syria an 
authoritarian state where the government controls all industry 
cannot be monitored and they point to iraq as an example of a 
country where us goods are known to have been used to manufacture 
weapons

cornet rilkes song of love and death is a 
beautiful opera by siegfried matthus 
an hour and a half long it was given its american premiere by 
students of the manhattan school of music 
when matthus called the most often performed living german 
opera composer had his first american opera debut of judith 
last summer in santa fe nm he was an east german he attended 
both that premiere and cornet rilke on wednesday night here 
judith depicting a story from biblical times is exceeding 
tense musically and dramatically cornet rilke though matthus 
means it as an antiwar piece soars with youth and promise and 
lovely melodies 
the students all had pleasing voices capable of singing the 
music but almost none of the english translation was 
understandable except that of the 30member chorus david gilbert 
conducted the orchestra of 15 
matthus bases his opera on an 1899 epic poem by rainer maria 
rilke about a person in his family tree who died at 18 fighting the 
turks since the opera reopened the dresden opera house in 1985 
burned 40 years before matthus begins it with the chorus singing 
on such a night there once was a fire a lament for the opera 
house and for the young rilke 
tattered curtains pull away showing the youths body on the 
ground staging using a diagonal ramp and imaginative lighting 
was telling throughout near the end the chorus holds pieces of 
wall which reflect the fire 
the opera is in a number of concise scenes each ending in 
blackout every detail and bit of music works toward the whole 
effect at first soldiers on their way to battle make horseback 
riding motions as they sing putting a foot down then bending 
their knees twice before stepping again they sing of mothers and 
wives at one point are met by tarts 
rilke finds a mans body a woman tied to a tree is promoted to 
cornet meaning standard bearer the part is written for a woman 
womens light voices sound younger than tenors christine abraham 
sang rilke and lisa livingston walking behind like a shadow sang 
a larger part rilkes thoughts 
the soldiers are given a party at a castle and the countess 
seduces rilke 
the next morning the boy joyfully awakened to the 
possibilities of adulthood grabs the flag and runs into battle 
where he is stabbed to death 
musical styles change depending on moods of scene sometimes 
there is melody in the orchestra but modernsounding angularities 
for the singers the love scenes music is tenderly melodic instead 
of passionate at the end drums roll

blood banks will have to ask a broader range 
of personal questions of wouldbe donors under new regulations that 
recognize the growing spread of aids among heterosexuals 
the new policy announced wednesday also ends the ban on 
donations from haitians and eases the ban on donations from natives 
of subsaharan african nations 
the haitian government called for a massive program of 
reeducating americans about a policy it said has ruined that 
countrys tourism industry cost thousands of jobs and caused 
haitian children to be snubbed and taunted 
the regulations should be implemented at all blood 
establishments including red cross centers within a few 
months said brad stone a spokesman for the food and drug 
administration which oversees the safety of blood supplies 
the strengthened program will enhance rather than replace 
the current procedures used to safeguard the blood supply health 
and human services secretary louis w sullivan said in a statement 
the changes will eliminate the need for excluding certain 
donor populations based solely on their geographical or national 
origins he said 
under the new regulations all potential donors will be 
questioned orally as well as in writing using terminology that is 
understandable culturally sensitive and avoids sexual 
stereotyping the announcement said 
potential donors will be asked about all highrisk behavior and 
will be asked direct questions about whether they have been treated 
for syphilis or gonorrhea within the last year 
the exclusion for potential donors who have either paid for or 
sold sex will be extended from six months to a year 
the exclusion for people who have received transfusions of blood 
or blood products will be extended from six months to one year 
this change aims at reducing the risk of hepatitis c another 
bloodborne disease 
haitians were singled out in 1982 early in the aids epidemic 
because scientists found a higherthanusual incidence of infection 
among haitian heterosexuals 
the policy originally covered only haitians who came to this 
country after 1977 but was extended this year to cover all 
haitians many of whom had fled to this country to escape political 
persecution 
closer investigation determined that the occurrence of aids 
among haitians was due to the same risky behavior as among the 
population at large and there was no connection with national 
origin 
the focus that is resulting from the secretarys decision 
would seem to be quite appropriate said dr s gerald sanders 
director of medical services for the american red cross 
the number of aids cases associated with heterosexual contact 
rose from 755 in 19881989 to 1026 in the next reporting period 
sanders said quoting statistics from the centers for disease 
control that jump from 2 percent of all aids cases to 3 percent in 
a single year is statistically significant he said 
verbal screening of prospective donors is important because 
testing of the blood supply has a gap the aids antibodies do not 
appear for up to six months after infection 
sanders said the screening is reliable because the kind of 
people to take the time out to donate blood do not want to hurt 
others and the process is anonymous 
the policy continues the ban on donations from black africans 
unless they can be tested for a form of the aids virus hiv2 that 
is endemic in west africa such tests have been developed but are 
not widely used in the united states

in four months the bush administration has 
reversed itself on whether economic pressure can force saddam 
hussein to give up his conquest of kuwait 
the president and his people have gone from saying sanctions 
might work to saying sanctions were biting to saying they wont 
do the job 
the turning point the assertion that sanctions wont budge 
saddam came abruptly this week after last weeks united nations 
vote imposing a jan 15 deadline for withdrawing 
just as president bush and his advisers began publicly 
abandoning hope on the worth of sanctions others found them to be 
a promising alternative to war if given time to work 
two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff air force gen 
david jones and adm william crowe told the senate armed services 
committee last week that sanctions could achieve their goal in 12 
to 18 months 
it is dead wrong to say that iraq is not being hurt crowe 
testified it is being damaged severely the issue is not 
whether an embargo will work but whether we have the patience to 
let it take effect 
former defense secretary james schlesinger said sanctions 
already had reduced iraqs economic activity by 40 percent 
democrats generally endorsed those views 
after bush imposed sanctions on aug 2 the day saddams army 
took over kuwait he expressed increasing confidence that economic 
pressure supported worldwide would force saddam back 
eight days after the invasion bush told reporters listen 
id love to see the economic sanctions be so successful that the 
us forces could be withdrawn and i think they will be 
successful but i just cant my problem is i just cant estimate 
the time right now how long it will take 
five days later addressing defense department employees during 
a visit to the pentagon bush said sanctions are working 
and the following day after meeting jordans king hussein at 
kennebunkport maine the president said sanctions were taking 
hold i dont think one can sustain true international isolation 
for long especially when you depend on the outside world for a lot 
of your goods he said 
on aug 28 briefing members of congress the president said 
the united nations sanctions are in effect and have been working 
remarkably well even on a voluntary basis 
and on sept 11 in an address to a joint session of congress 
iraq is feeling the heat we continue to hope that iraqs 
leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them 
they are cut off from world trade unable to sell their oil and 
only a tiny fraction of goods gets through i cannot predict 
just how long it will take to convince iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait sanctions will take time to have their full intended 
effect 
then last thursday at the united states behest the security 
council authorized the use of force after jan 15 to compel iraqs 
expulsion from kuwait 
almost at once the administration line on sanctions changed 
defense secretary dick cheney was first there is no guarantee 
that sanctions will force him saddam out of kuwait he 
testified monday he can ride them out 
bush visiting uruguay on tuesday elaborated on the new theme 
ive not been one who has been convinced that sanctions alone 
will bring him to his senses he said while adding that the 
measures were having some effect 
the best chance for peace is for him saddam to understand 
that all means all means necessary will be used against 
him the president said 
secretary of state james a baker iii drove the point home 
wednesday nobody can ever tell you that sanctions alone can 
force saddam hussein out of kuwait i am personally very 
pessimistic that they will 
and cia director william webster said our judgment has been 
and continues to be that there is no assurance or guarantee that 
economic hardhips will compel saddam to change his policies or 
lead to internal unrest that would threaten his regime 
the administrations change could be intended to send saddam the 
message that the united states was ruling out all possibilities 
except the use of force for settling the dispute 
or it could be intended to send that message to the american 
people to prepare them for going to war 
the change of signal is clear its purpose is not

ok kids its pizza night see what the 
supermarket has to go hold the anchovies 
its the coming thing says the agriculture department and one 
of these days the local supermarket may be delivering fresh hot 
pizza directly to the front door 
supermarkets have been edging into the fresh pizza business 
for the past few years says charlene price of the departments 
economic research service pizza is now becoming the food of 
choice and is closing in on hamburgers as the most popular takeout 
food 
price writing in the agencys national food review said an 
estimated 43 percent of the nations supermarkets now offer fresh 
pizza 
as an example she said bashas supermarkets in arizona offer 
hot pizza using fresh crusts prebaked daily at each stores 
bakery prices start at 299 for a 12inch hot cheese pizza made 
to order from a fully exposed work station in the deli department 
orders can be phoned in 
for this type of service to continue to grow supermarkets 
must be able to provide more customer service by offering an option 
of eating in as well as installing a phone solely for the pizza 
department she said they must also provide pickup or delivery 
service 
pizzas just one example of the changing services being offered 
by supermarkets 
more than half of safeways stores offer prepared foods such as 
lasagna pastas barbecued chicken salads and desserts at deli 
counters selfservice salad soup and sandwich bars as well as 
yogurt and ice cream machines are in some stores 
farmer jack supermarkets in detroit mich introduced 
prepared food sections yvonnestogo five years ago price 
said the section offers large selection of freshly prepared 
entrees imported gourmet coffee and tea ice cream pastries and 
other desserts all prepared instore 
also she said the store has a sitdown restaurant that serves 
up to 20 people the customers have a choice of salads soups 
sauces frozen pasta items quiches pates and sausages 
raleys in california has expanded its takeout food program in 
selected locations to offer complete specialty menus of authentic 
ethnic food price said some stores feature chinese while others 
go with mexican 
sitdown eating areas in supermarkets have been steadily 
increasing she said more than twothirds of the supermarkets 
with service delis have some sort of eating area ranging from a 
few chairs and tables to elaborate sitdown restaurants 
most of these eating areas are quite small however less than 1 
percent are fullscale restaurants or cafeterias 
another trend has been the move by processors to get on the 
microwave bandwagon in supermarkets price said the latest 
innovations include microwaveable fast foods such as breakfast 
sandwiches hamburgers cheeseburger and various potato products 
goodings super markets in florida has set up microwaveable 
fastfood sections in its frozen food departments items include 
hamburgers french fries cheese sticks popcorn fish or meat 
sandwiches pizza and chicken snacks all heated and served in the 
store 
microwaveable hamburgers and cheeseburgers are competing with 
fast food chains for the awayfromhome food dollar price said 
the microwaveable sandwich business posted an estimated 130 
million in sales last year and sales are expected to grow by 20 
percent annually over the next couple of years the researcher 
said 
food service in supermarkets has come a long way yet it 
represents only the beginning she said 
according to schotland business research inc the value of food 
prepared specially for microwave heating will grow from 5 billion 
in 1988 to 7 billion by 1993 
an estimated 94 percent of homes will contain microwave 
ovens price said the number of microwaveable frozen foods 
will grow by 25 percent during the next four years 
despite the growth in supermarket food services price said some 
problems still are being worked out 
for example there is a shift to fewer hot foods since the 
first phase of readytoeat meals because it is difficult to 
maintain the quality she said heat lamps and steam tables 
that keep foods hot also tend to dry them out and reheating causes 
moisture loss 
and although microwave technology is fast and convenient some 
foods do not respond well to it pot pies and french fries often 
are soggy when heated in a microwave oven 
price said designers are also producing packages that allow 
foods to brown better and get crisper 
the new food services and microwaveable products are the hot 
items for the 1990s she said but industry officials say 
traditional foods wont be pushed out of the picture

the us government should review canadas 
findings in the crash of a military charter plane that killed 256 
americans says a congressional panel that probed a possible 
terrorist link to the 1985 disaster 
canada should turn over its investigative reports on the gander 
newfoundland crash to the fbi while the national transportation 
safety board analyzes the cause of the tragedy rep william 
hughes dnj said wednesday 
fbi agents were barred from the crash scene and the ntsb 
embraced canadas findings about the cause without consulting the 
chief us investigator who looked into the disaster according to 
testimony before the house judiciary subcommittee on crime chaired 
by hughes 
a canadian panel ruled that the plane probably went down due to 
ice on its wings 
the fbi should have insisted on playing a role in the probe and 
the ntsb was derelict in its duty hughes said at the conclusion of 
two days of hearings 
ntsb investigator george seidlein was sent to gander and 
concluded that the weather conditions simply werent right for ice 
to have formed on the wings in sufficient amounts to cause the 
crash seidlein testified that he wasnt invited by his superiors 
to give his views and didnt volunteer them 
fbi agents sent to gander following the crash spent two days in 
a motel and left after canadian investigators assured them there 
was no terrorist connection to the crash 
the royal canadian mounted police handled the criminal aspects 
of the probe said nicholas ohara deputy assistant director of 
the fbis criminal investigative division 
i never found your organization in 25 years to be timid 
hughes commented im surprised you fold your tent after two days 
and go home the rumors of terrorism and sabotage were 
rampant 
the fbi has a high level of cooperation with the rcmp ohara 
insisted 
the families of the victims have a right to expect more 
said hughes im disappointed with the fbi no wonder the 
families are so angry 
hughes said the subcommittee has been pressing canada to provide 
investigative reports compiled by the rcmp 
the canadian embassy says it is still working on the request 
hughes said he will urge congress to pursue the matter and that the 
fbi and intelligence agencies should review the reports once the 
us government gets them 
the fbi and the state department told the crime subcommittee 
there is no credible evidence the dc8 jetliner carrying troops of 
the 101st airborne division from the middle east was sabotaged or 
targeted with a terrorist bomb 
the canadian government findings have been challenged by other 
canadian investigators several congressmen and families of the 
victims who suspect terrorism as the cause 
several eyewitnesses say they saw a bright flame just before the 
crash a terrorist group with ties to iran claimed responsibility 
for the disaster which occurred amid the reagan administrations 
secret arms sales to iran

there will be no more threeeyed fish on the 
simpsons whose producers say theyre cooling their nuclear 
industry jokes after touring a real power plant 
but dont have a meltdown simpsons fans 
the primetime cartoon show will continue to rib the industry in 
its third season next year but in a more responsible way 
executive producer sam simon said in an interview this week 
simon said the fox broadcasting co program had been guilty of 
cheap shots 
the us council for energy awareness a nuclear industry group 
told simon in a february letter that the show offended a lot of 
people in the energy industry 
at a time when we should be concerned about where well get 
enough electricity to fuel our economy later in this decade you 
are confusing and frightening your viewers by portraying nuclear 
power plant personnel as bungling idiots the letter said 
top idiot on the councils list was homer father of the 
simpson family and an employee of the fictitious springfield 
nuclear plant homer seems to care less about safety than about 
having enough tartar sauce for his fish sticks 
in various episodes homer gives away the plants blueprints to 
a foreign exchange student his boss tries to bribe a plant 
inspector with a bushel of cash and threeeyed blinky is found 
swimming near the plant 
i agree with you that in real life homer simpson would not be 
employed at a nuclear power plant on the other hand he probably 
wouldnt be employed anywhere simon said in a feb 5 letter to 
carl goldstein a vice president of the energy group 
simon suggested that he and other fox executives tour a real 
nuclear power plant 
in april the group converged on the san onofre plant in san 
clemente calif 40 miles south of foxs los angeles offices 
we dont have any homers at our nuclear plant said david 
barron a spokesman for san onofres owner southern california 
edison who accompanied the producers and writers 
simon said the tour showed that the simpsons had been right 
and wrong about nuclear power 
although they did little initial research he said the 
simpsons creators seemed to accurately represent worker 
conditions the cafeterias lunch pails and radiation warning 
signs the writers placed homer in a sector to illustrate an 
impersonal bureaucracy then discovered some plants actually used 
that term 
but simon also said the tour also changed a lot of peoples 
minds i think the facts are pretty powerful that its a clean and 
safe and important source of energy while some of the shows were 
in the works before we really backed off that as a source of 
comedy no more threeeyed fish 
but the show will still feature jokes about what evil 
springfield nuclear plant owner montgomery burns terms his 
nuclear nuclear family 
for example plans call for homer to avert a nuclear meltdown 
hes kind of asleep at the wheel and wakes up when theres an 
alarm and doesnt know which button to press so he goes 
eeneymeeneymineymo and hits a button and does avert a 
meltdown simon said he becomes a hero and feels guilty about 
it its not a politically charged episode 
and homer is to begin a dinner grace with this thank you for 
nuclear power which has yet to cause a single fatality at 
least in this country 
the us nuclear power industry has been sensitive about its 
image since the three mile isand accident in 1979 that led to a 1 
billion cleanup and in 1987 pennsylvanias peach bottom plant was 
shut down for a time and 33 workers fined on charges of sleeping 
andor inattention to duty 
asked if she watched the simpsons three mile island 
spokeswoman mary wells jokingly told a reporter goodbye but 
she relented and confessed she finds the show funny 
simon said the producers had a practical reason for placing 
homer at a power plant 
it was really just for the joke that this boob had a position 
where he could possibly make a mistake and destroy the world he 
said

california is looking for businesses 
willing to hire criminals and only criminals by the thousands 
the new gang of factory workers wont have to commute in fact 
theyll be in big trouble if they try and they wont be organizing 
unions guzzling beer after work or chasing coworkers of the 
opposite sex 
the jobs will be blue collar literally prison blue 
pressed by a rising prison population and tight budget 
california voters decided to encourage businesses to set up shop 
inside prisons and put inmates to work so they can contribute to 
their upkeep and gain valuable job skills 
if successful it would be the largest such program in the 
nation 
pay will be similar to what prisoners might make on the outside 
but some of their earnings will be deducted to help defray the 2 
billion annual cost of feeding and housing californias 98000 
state prisoners 
why should lawabiding citizens have to work and pay taxes to 
support a free ride for convicted criminals said gov george 
deukmejian who sponsored the ballot measure approved nov 6 
the state prison population has more than quadrupled during 
deukmejians two terms in office 
about 8000 adults in state prison now make only minimal wages 
producing goods such as furniture and license plates the products 
can be sold only to government agencies in order to limit 
competition with private industry 
a separate program employs about 100 juveniles in private 
businesses at california youth prisons 
organizers of the new program for adult inmates hope to create 
7000 jobs with operations like recycling or clothing manufacture 
nationwide about 1500 prisoners work for private businesses 
according to the us justice department 
craig brown undersecretary of the state youth and adult 
correctional agency said inmates will scramble for the new real 
world jobs to make money and gain skills 
working in the prison kitchen probably doesnt provide you too 
much you can use on the outside he said 
the california manufacturers association supports the program 
but wants to ensure it does not create unfair competition with the 
private sector said president bill campbell 
its an exciting innovative program and the manufacturing 
community will look upon it very favorably he said 
unions oppose the measure arguing it will turn back the clock 
of history to chain gang memories with controlled labor being 
exploited to the detriment of free labor said john henning of 
the california labor federation 
state officials said they will try to limit any competition by 
targeting emerging and laborintensive industries in a further 
safeguard companies are barred from using prison labor to replace 
striking workers 
brown said a task force setting up the program hopes to bring 
the first businesses into the mens and womens prisons sometime 
next year 
state analysts said they dont know how much the program will 
save because there are too many variables but savings will come 
from diverting workers pay to cover room and board and from early 
releases earned with work credits 
officials also hope the job skills learned will reduce the 
number of inmates who return to prison 
but the state also will lose some money by giving employers tax 
credits 
task force member kathy kinser of the state corrections 
department said the program requires that inmates get paid at 
levels comparable to those on the outside 
proposed regulations call for 20 percent of inmates net wages 
to go to room and board up to 20 percent for restitution to crime 
victims and up to 15 percent to mandatory savings paychecks would 
be subject to the usual tax withholdings and other deductions 
including family support 
the program for putting imprisoned juveniles to work in private 
enterprise has employed 1000 youths in five years the 100 people 
in the program handle overflow calls for trans world airlines 
flight reservations assemble electronics for exercise machines 
microfilm documents and form sheet metal for ducts

a federal reserve survey of the nations 
economic pulse finds business conditions either declining or 
growing weakly in every region of the country as november came to 
an end 
the beige book survey released wednesday showed retail sales 
down in virtually all 12 of the central banks districts 
manufacturing conditions weakened in most districts and most 
districts also reported continued sluggishness in construction 
demand for business loans softened in many areas at the same 
time banks were tightening their standards for making loans 
on balance business conditions display a weaker pattern 
than a similar survey conducted in midoctober that found either 
slow growth or an actual decline in economic activity in the fed 
districts 
in one of the few bright spots agriculture is reported to 
have been doing very well a summary of the survey said crop 
yields have been good and livestock prices have been high 
the report was the latest piece of evidence that the economy has 
weakened in recent months to the point that many economists say it 
now is in a recession 
manufacturers in particular expressed concern about business 
prospects for the coming months the survey found 
the majority of manufacturers contacted in the boston district 
expect a national recession lasting two to four quarters the 
report said business leaders contacted in the san francisco 
district expect continued deterioration in the national economy 
automobile sales were reported to have weakened particularly in 
the cleveland chicago and st louis districts dallas was an 
exception 
the pessimism however was not universal 
philadelphia manufacturers expect modest improvements over the 
next six months and manufacturers in the richmond district were 
less pessimistic about prospects than they had been a month ago 
the report said 
and soft domestic demand was partially offset by strong export 
orders 
despite the weakness inventories were described as under 
control an excessive increase in inventories could mean job 
layoffs as industries cut production in an attempt to reduce 
backlogs 
nevertheless several districts report a decline in consumer 
and business confidence and many refer to expectations of continued 
diminution in economic activity the survey found 
retail sales apparently have weakened in almost all the 
districts the report said most districts report that 
retailers were pessimistic about sales prospects for the christmas 
season as well as for 1991 
most districts also reported continued sluggishness in 
construction activity 
residential construction continued to be weak with several 
districts citing a glut of houses for resale the report said 
nonresidential construction is also reported to be generally 
weak 
however there are bright spots it continued new york 
reports a recent pickup in office leasing activity in downtown 
manhattan chicago reports that construction slowdowns are not 
universal and that development continues in communities outside 
major metropolitan areas minneapolis reports a recent rebound 
in construction activity 
but the report said activity in the financial sector generally 
was slower 
several districts report a decline in consumer and business 
loan demand it said almost all districts also report some 
tightening by banks of business loan terms particularly for 
construction and land development 
none of the districts reported any major problems with 
inflation although reports of price increases varied in fact the 
strong agricultural production contributed to lower crop prices 
although this adversely affected farmer incomes in some areas 
the report was written at the federal reserve bank of 
minneapolis based on information collected before nov 26 the 
report was prepared for the dec 17 meeting of the federal open 
market committee the fed arm responsible for setting monetary 
policy

president hussain muhammad ershad who 
has promised to resign after widespread protests against his 
government dissolved parliament on thursday after lifting a state 
of emergency 
staterun radio announced the dissolution of parliament but gave 
no reason parliament had been expected to remain in session until 
saturday to ratify ershads successor who would govern in a 
caretaker capacity until new elections 
constitutional experts and wellplaced opposition sources said 
ershad would swear in his own successor 
they said this method of transition of power was chosen because 
it appeared parliament would not be able to summon a majority to 
endorse the caretaker leader supreme court chief justice 
shahabuddin ahmed 
the sources speaking on condition of anomnymity said the 
swearingin might take place later thursday 
twothirds of parliaments members belong to ershads jatiya 
party many have been reluctant to appear in public for fear of 
being attacked by antiershad activists 
some jatiya party offices and officials residences around the 
country have been stoned or ransacked in the past week the 
dissolved parliament was seated in 1986 elections called 
fraudulent by observers that ershad also won 
ershad lifted the state of emergency late wednesday eight days 
after he imposed it because of increasingly violent demonstrations 
for his removal 
but the street protests continued despite the deployment of 
army troops and a curfew that was supposed to keep people indoors 
on tuesday night ershad bowed to the groundswell of opposition 
and said he would step down as soon as a temporary successor was 
chosen 
opposition leaders sheik hasina and khaleda zia agreed 
wednesday night on shahabuddin a career lawyer and judge with a 
reputation as a political independent the two women led the 
sevenweek campaign to oust ershad a former army general who took 
power in a bloodless 1982 coup 
ershads announcement that he would resign ended an 
oftenviolent campaign for his ouster the opposition claims at 
least 100 people were killed by security forces since the 
emergency the government says only six people died 
ershad who only a few weeks ago had confidently predicted he 
would be reelected in the spring caved in to the oppositions 
demands with an abruptness that stunned the country 
antiershad demonstrations had become routine in recent years 
but the latest round were marked by unprecedented unity and 
spontaneity 
as the protests snowballed eight years of rumors and discontent 
over what was perceived as ershads arrogance and tolerance of 
corruption burst out of private drawing rooms into the streets 
the presidents downfall was hastened by a wave of resignations 
in support of the opposition hundreds of doctors professors 
civil servants merchant seamen and at least 19 parliament members 
of his jatiya party resigned from their jobs in protest against 
ershad 
on wednesday a student leader was killed and two other people 
were injured by security guards when they attempted to storm the 
home of a highranking government official in a northern town 
several thousand people assembled at dhaka airport demanding 
that airport authorities stop ershad or other government officials 
if they tried to flee the country 
but there was no indication that any government official was 
planning to leave ershad spent wednesday in his home and in an 
office deep in the wellguarded military cantonment in dhaka and 
canceled all appointments 
a senior member of his cabinet who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said ershad was still in charge of the government other 
sources said the military was still taking orders from ershad 
mrs zia and hasina appealed to their followers for calm they 
said the effort to end ershads rule was not yet over and they 
warned the president of the peoples wrath if he reneged on his 
promise to resign 
addressing 50000 cheering and chanting followers at a rally 
hasina said although ershad announced that he had resigned in 
fact he is still in power 
mrs zia echoed those concerns at another gathering accusing 
ershad of conspiring to stay in power 
let there be no doubt that people will fight until they have 
achieved the victory and ousted the autocratic government she 
said 
on wednesday staterun media let hasina and mrs zia address 
the people for the first time 
the two women have been agitating for ershads ouster since he 
took power but their political differences thwarted any lasting 
campaign 
then in october the opposition was galvanized by ershads 
announcement that he would be a candidate in june presidential 
elections 
mrs zia and hasina have said they have buried their 
differences but they still have not spelled out their stands on 
constitutional changes or on other domestic or foreign issues 
hasina is the daughter of sheik mujibur rahman bangladeshs 
first president mrs zia is the widow of another former president 
ziaur rehman both men were assassinated 
ershad is the countrys ninth president since it gained 
independence from pakistan in 1971 like all of his predecessors 
he was installed by military action

house democrats are tossing out two veteran 
committee chairmen in a move that reflects restlessness over an 
embarrassing year on capitol hill and a trying election season for 
incumbents 
wednesdays votes that ousted rep glenn anderson of california 
as chairman of the public works and transportation committee and 
rep frank annunio of illinois from the committee on house 
administration were seen as a warning to the chambers leaders to 
improve performance and efficiency 
neither of them saw it coming it was a tidal wave said 
rep mary rose oakar dohio 
the house is in a position where some shaking up is a 
necessary thing to do said rep dan glickman dkan its not 
a mutiny but the status quo cannot prevail theres a healthy 
questioning going on right now and a few chairmen are getting the 
boot because of it 
in addition to the ousters of anderson and annunzio several 
committee chairmen racked up worrisome levels of opposition in 
secretballot votes of confidence behind the closed doors of the 
caucus 
rep henry b gonzalez of texas chairman of the banking 
committee kept his position on a vote of 16389 
rep morris udall of arizona the interior committee chairman 
drew 47 opposition votes north carolina rep walter jones of the 
merchant marine committee was opposed by 46 members and three 
chairmen drew 34 no votes each energy and commerce chairman 
john dingell of michigan veterans affairs chairman sonny 
montgomery of mississippi and appropriations chairman jamie 
whitten of mississippi 
several lawmakers described the shakeups as aftershocks from 
last months elections and others said they were an effort to weed 
out figures who do not convey the vigorous clean image the party 
wants 
throughout 1990 the house was given a black eye because of the 
protracted budget mess said rep byron dorgan dnd 
americans were asking why cant you get your work done this is 
an expression of that discontent its laying down the law that 
were not going to sit by and let it happen next year 
democrats sent their signal not directly to the leadership 
which was all reelected but by knocking off what were deemed the 
weakest of their committee chairmen 
the 77yearold anderson who was the subject of complaints of 
ineffectiveness and passivity was replaced by the secondranking 
democrat on public works and transportation rep robert roe of new 
jersey 
what the committee was looking for was stronger policy 
positions and better coordination roe said after he edged the 
no 3 committee democrat norman mineta of california 121107 for 
the chairmanship 
this is the basic committee that provides the infrastructure 
for the nation roads bridges highways airports it really 
determines the direction what the priorities will be in rebuilding 
america roe said 
annunzio 75 who was linked to the savingsandloan scandal 
during a difficult reelection campaign in his chicago also was 
described by colleagues as ineffective and too willing to let an 
abrasive aide run the committee for him 
he was replaced by rep charles rose of north carolina the 
administration committees no 3 member rose prevailed over 
secondranking joseph gaydos of pennsylvania on a 15864 vote 
the caucus also gave the committee on science space and 
technology which had been chaired by roe to rep george brown of 
california next in the line of seniority on the panel 
in other changes rep william d ford dmich gave up his 
chairmanship of the post office and civil service committee to 
replace the retiring augustus f hawkins of california as chairman 
of the education and labor committee rep william clay dmo 
moves up to fords old job

chrysler corp is rejecting a consumer 
advocacy organizations request to recall 500000 cars and minivans 
with a newly designed automatic transmission insisting its flaws 
have been worked out 
we addressed those problems quickly and believe the 
transmission is now fully competitive from reliability and 
durability standpoints and ahead of the competition in many other

the two women who forced a change of 
government this week have one thing in common they were thrust 
into politics by assassinations that deprived them of the men who 
had the most influence on their lives 
both men were presidents of bangladesh 
apart from that sheik hasina and khaleda zia share little 
except a dogged determination to oust president hussain muhammad 
ershad the ninth president in 19 years and like all his 
predecessors installed by military might 
their personal and political rivalry had long been a stumbling 
block in their shared goal of ousting ershad 
mrs zia asked once why she couldnt patch up her differences 
with hasina said frostily two days ago i invited her to tea 
she didnt come 
hasina and mrs zia had usually boycotted national elections for 
the presidency and parliament 
but finally they were forced to face the fastapproaching 
reality ershad planned to seek election in june for another 5year 
term and might win unless they mounted a joint campaign 
both women had long vowed not to run against him charging that 
he would would rig the elections to ensure his own victory 
changing their minds would have meant backing down on what they had 
called a matter of principle 
neither was ready to run unless the other did and even if they 
both ran ershad might have emerged the victor in a threeway 
contest 
since the one thing they could agree on was getting rid of 
ershad they concentrated on that as they never had before their 
street rallies and nationwide strikes took on a life of their own 
drawing in people who previously had been content to sit at home 
and gripe about ershad without taking public action 
after seven weeks of strikes and demonstrations ershad said 
tuesday that he would resign as soon as his replacement was chosen 
the question of who will eventually emerge as bangladeshs top 
leader hasina or mrs zia or a political compromise or darkhorse 
candidate is unanswered so is the matter of what political 
course hasina and mrs zia will pursue while they hold the 
momentum 
hasina 43 presides over the awami league and seven allied 
parties which are slightly leftofcenter 
mrs zia 46 is the leader of the bangladesh nationalist party 
which is grouped with six other centrist parties 
hasina inherited the awami league leadership after her father 
bangladeshs first president sheik mujibur rahman was 
assassinated in a military coup in 1975 
hasina was in germany at the time except for a sister who also 
was abroad hasinas entire family was wiped out in the coup her 
father mother three brothers two sistersinlaw two uncles and 
a cousin were all slain by the army officers who stormed into the 
family home 
hasinas office is her fathers library just across the hall 
from the stairs where his bloodstains have been preserved and fresh 
flowers are placed daily 
mrs zias husband president ziaur rahman was an army general 
who took power in a 1977 coup and was assassinated four years 
later 
despite their common personal tragedies hasina never warmed to 
mrs zia a charismatic woman who strikes the sort of empathy with 
crowds that hasina has never achieved 
hasina harbors suspicions that gen zia might have had a role in 
the coup that killed her father according to her closest 
associates 
besides that the two women have fundamental political 
differences hasina prefers a parliamentary system of government 
where power goes to the party that wins the most seats and whose 
leader automatically becomes prime minister 
mrs zia favors the presidential system wheretthe voters elect 
an individual leader 
hasinas main strength is that her awami league is believed to 
have a larger and betterorganized grass roots following than mrs 
zias bangladesh nationalist party 
but mrs zia inspires the crowds by her mere presence she 
exudes warmth and glamor with discreet makeup and jewels and 
silken saris 
hasina with her wirerimmed spectacles and practical cotton 
saris appears like a lecturer facing a classroom of dutiful 
students the dry wit she displays in small gatherings seldom comes 
across in public 
both were brought into politics by supporters of their 
assassinated menfolk 
after her father was killed hasina spent six years in 
selfexile in india where her husband nuclear scientist wazed ali 
miah was studying 
she was elected head of the awami league before she ever 
returned to bangladesh although she says she had been tutored in 
politics since childhood 
mrs zia was pressured to enter politics by her late husbands 
followers who were looking for someone to unite his party 
but both women evolved into dominant leaders in their own right 
she gets her own way when the question of party decision 
comes said a senior leader of mrs zias party speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
hasina has a similar reputation within her party where she is 
periodically at odds with the older leaders she surrounds herself 
with young people who support her in the internal party fights 
against the senior leaders

reigning champion garry kasparov and 
challenger anatoly karpov resume their duel for the world chess 
title this weekend karpov having won game 17 and again brought the 
score to a tie 
i feel very confident now karpov said wednesday after 
winning on the 40th move it was quite clear that he was not in 
good shape 
the two soviet grandmasters are now tied 85 points each with 
the next game scheduled for saturday a win counts for a point a 
tie for a halfpoint 
kasparov had gone ahead tuesday when he won the marathon 16th 
game after 102 moves played over four days but karpov with the 
white pieces on wednesday evened the match 
the first player to gain 125 points wins the championship and 
17 million of a 3 million purse in the event of a tie kasparov 
retains the title the first 12 games were played in new york 
after forcing kasparovs resignation wednesday karpov said 
it was a very complicated game but i felt i always had the 
advantage 
the game began with a familiar scenario as the two previous 
games in lyon with karpov playing white the opening was a grunfeld 
with an exchange variation as kasparov castled on the eighth move 
but karpov moved his knight into deeper territory on the 10th move 
that caused kasparov almost 30 minutes of reflection before 
countering with a pawn exchange then bringing a knight forward 
each player is allowed 2 hours for his first 40 moves 
karpov wasted his time advantage on the 25th move when he had to 
decide how to capture a black knight he finally did so with a 
bishop 
at that point both players had less than 30 minutes for 15 
moves 
the game turned in karpovs favor when he advanced a queen and 
established a rook deep in black territory 
kasparov tried to get out of trouble but karpov kept advancing 
karpov even moved a pawn to the seventh rank blocking the black 
queen and attacking a rook 
kasparov gave up two moves later

accept a collect call from a new york state 
inmate and youll be helping battle aids give prisoners cable tv 
and make conjugal visits more comfortable 
like many state prison systems new yorks keeps a share of 
telephone company profits from inmate calls which are all collect 
because there are no pay phones behind bars 
weve provided them with a captive audience amy colodny 
spokeswoman for the new york prison system said of the rationale 
for collecting a portion of phone company profits 
in new york the state gets 16 percent of the phone companys 
profits on long distance calls made by inmates for local calls 
which are also collect the state receives between 6 percent and 12 
percent of the profits 
this year the states share will be about 85 million 
officials said 
thirtyfour state prisons systems and the federal prison system 
contract with phone companies for longdistance service of those 
32 states receive a portion of the profits ranging from 5 percent 
in west virginia to 50 percent in arizona according a survey by 
the publication corrections compendium 
several states put the money toward inmate programs in alabama 
prison officials said part of the money goes toward legal 
materials in indiana and new hampshire the money pays for inmate 
recreation and in michigan it pays for vocational education 
pennsylvania receives about 100000 per month through the program 
and spends the money on inmate activities 
inmates in most new york state prisons can use the phones 
between 8 am and 11 pm whenever theyre not participating in a 
prison program 
the largest portion of the money 28 million is spent on the 
aids drug azt and 15 million is spent on aids training for staff 
and inmates 
prison officials estimate that up to 8000 of new yorks 52000 
inmates are infected with the aids virus and about 800 have aids 
another 15 million is spent on such things as job services 
reception centers for visitors and furniture for family reunion 
trailers where conjugal visits take place 
approximately 76000 is spent on cable television about half 
of the states prisons have cable 
an additional 650000 provides bus trips to prisons for 
inmates relatives and nearly 500000 is for a program to help 
inmates be better mothers and fathers when they get out

a volcano at the bottom of the pacific that 
is destined to be the next hawaiian island is going hightech with 
a 4 million network of cameras and seismic sensors to document its 
deepsea rumblings 
we would love to catch an eruption fred k duennebier a 
professor of geology and geophysics at the university of hawaii 
said wednesday of the hawaiian undersea geoobservatory 
the observatory will be installed on loihi seamount an 
underwater volcano 22 miles southeast of the island of hawaii 
loihi rises about 11200 feet above the ocean floor but its 
cratered summit is still 3300 feet beneath the waves 
it will be the next hawaiian island in about 50000 years or 
so duennebier said at a meeting the american geophysical union 
i wouldnt buy real estate yet 
the observatory which scientists hope to have in operation 
within two years will be a network of 20 or more cameras and 
instruments draped across loihis summit and slopes 
hugo will be connected to the big island by a power cable that 
will also carry data from the observatory to scientists on shore 
a ship will lay a network of electrooptical cable and outlet 
boxes then remotecontrolled submarines and manned submersible 
vehicles will plug in cameras microphones seismometers and heat 
and chemical sensors 
it will work for at least 10 years unless it is buried by lava 
flows or landslides duennebier said 
scientists are sure loihi is active but havent actually 
observed an eruption intense earthquake activity suggests 
eruptions happened in 1986 1988 and early this year duennebier 
said 
the hawaiian islands were created by a hot spot a plume of 
molten rock that rises from deep inside the earth loihi is now 
over the hot spot which also has branches feeding hawaiis active 
kilauea and mauna loa volcanos 
roughly 60 percent to 80 percent of the worlds volcanos are on 
the sea floor 
we have no idea how these volcanos are built up from the ocean 
floor duennebier said we dont know how the lava actually 
makes it to the top of the volcano

cnn said it is giving up the fight to prevent the 
release of court transcripts of its manuel noriega prison tapes 
us district judge william hoeveler ruling in favor of four 
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts said 
tuesday they would be released today unless cnn appealed on 
wednesday cnn said it would not do so 
cnns main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts 
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources cnn 
spokesman steve haworth said 
but after reviewing the transcripts network officials decided 
there was little danger of compromising those sources he said 
cnn has televised some of seven tape recordings of noriegas 
jailhouse conversations with his legal team and had argued that the 
recordings of the telephone calls and therefore the transcripts of 
them were its property 
sanford bohrer the attorney for the news organizations that 
asked for the transcripts applauded cnns decision to drop the 
fight 
i could never understand how cnn could claim to own 
conversations that were taped by the united states government of 
an inmate in a federal prison he said 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges he took 46 million in 
payoffs to allow safe shipment of cocaine through panama to the 
united states 
the organizations seeking the transcripts were the miami herald 
the associated press postnewsweek station wplgtv of miami and 
gannett co and its usa today they argued that the public has a 
right to examine the content of the tapes which were at the center 
of a freedomofthepress dispute 
the controversy began last month when cnn aired a series of 
telecasts based on the recordings which it said were provided by 
an anonymous source 
hoeveler ordered the telecasts stopped while he determined 
whether the action threatened noriegas right to a fair trial cnn 
opposed the move as an unconstitutional prior restraint on the 
press but the supreme court refused to intervene 
hoeveler eventually ruled that the tapes didnt jeopardize the 
case and could be aired 
cnn hasnt said where it got the tapes but noriegas attorneys 
have claimed they were released to the government of panama by the 
state department or the drug enforcement administration and that 
panama gave them to cnn

portauprince haiti ap after gunmen attacked one of his 
rallies the populist priest who is leading the race for president 
tearfully urged supporters not to fear casting ballots in the dec 
16 election 
the rev jean bertrand aristide blamed the wednesday night 
attack in which five people were reported killed and 54 wounded 
on the tonton macoutes the private militia that enforced the 
brutal 29year duvaler family rule 
the violence occurred just as a rally by about 10000 people 
near portauprince was breaking up and appeared intended to 
intimidate aristide supporters into staying away from the polls 
it came as haitians were feeling optimistic they could at last 
have democratic elections the first in the 186yearold history of 
this former french colony 
take heart dry your tears hold one anothers hands 
aristide said in a tearful interview with radio antilles we are 
going to continue walking together because on the 16th of december 
whether they like it or not the macoutes will disappear from 
haiti 
a november 1987 attempt at elections was aborted after thugs 
backed by the army killed 34 voters at the polls 
the government promised a probe but similar undertakings have 
failed to bring arrests or charges in earlier violence 
all necessary steps have been taken and an investigation has 
been opened said minister of interior joseph maxi 
the violence broke out in the wealthy suburb of petionville 
about 7 miles from the capital a half hour after aristide had 
left 
the 37yearold priest the target of three assassination 
attempts in the past has been hailed as a prophet by many he 
has a huge following among the countrys poor the majority in this 
caribbean nation of 6 million people where violence and 
intimidation have traditionally pervaded politics 
as aristide supporters were dispersing the area was hit with a 
10minute blackout that was followed by a loud explosion and then 
gunfire witnesses said they saw men in a jeep drive up moments 
before the blackout 
it happened during the blackout there was a big boom we ran 
and while we were running there was shooting the lights went on 
after said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity 
hundreds of people ran screaming down the streets after the 
explosion rocked the suburb scores of people fell to the ground 
it was unknown what caused the blast 
witnesses and radio metropole said five people died and 54 were 
wounded 
aristide said the incident could have been prevented if 
authorities had arrested roger lafontant the tonton macoutes chief 
who returned from exile to run for president but was disqualified 
the race 
the tonton macoutes were formed under the late dictator papa 
doc francois duvalier in 1957 the familys rule ended in 1986 
when his son baby doc jean claude duvalier was forced into 
exile in france 
the country has been rocked by violence since duvaliers fall 
and the interim government of president ertha pascal trouillot 
appointed in march is the fifth since his fall 
reinhardt helmke a united nations representative said he 
didnt think elections would be canceled as a result of the 
wednesday attack 
at this stage the electoral process is not compromised he 
said this is the type of thing that everybody was expecting 
would happen at some point 
more than 400 international observers from the united nations 
and the organization of american states are to monitor the 
elections about 200 of them are already in haiti

the suspicion that profits influence the way 
doctors treat patients got some support today from a study showing 
that those who make money on xrays take four times as many of 
them researchers say 
the study based on a review of insurance records compared 
doctors who owned their own office xray and ultrasound machines 
with those who send their patients to other specialists for xrays 
doctors make a profit on each image they take on their own 
equipment but make nothing when they send patients to other 
experts 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
found that those who owned their own machines took four times as 
many xrays and ultrasound scans for such routine conditions as 
colds and backaches 
it also found that doctors who owned their own equipment charged 
considerably more for them than did outside radiologists 
although the study could not determine precisely why these 
doctors did more xrays one has to wonder whether its an issue 
of having these machines and realizing that incomes can be 
increased by their utilization said dr bruce j hillman who 
directed the study at the university of arizona 
ethical standards require that doctors put patients health 
ahead of their own financial interests 
e haavi morreim a philosopher at the university of tennessee 
college of medicine said there may be other explanations for the 
higher xray use aside from the obvious possibility that frankly 
there is money to be made in them there hills 
there is the simple fact that when something is available 
its easy to use it often she said when you have a hammer 
everything looks like a nail 
physicians who own xray machines were critical of the study and 
its implications dr james weber a family practitioner in 
jacksonville ark said doctors who do more xrays may be 
practicing better medicine 
the assumption is inferred that these tests are ordered to 
benefit the physician rather than the patient he said i can 
tell you that wherever you go in the country that may be true of 
less than 1 percent of practicing physicians the vast majority of 
physicians have their patients interests at heart 
dr j harold morris an internist in kansas city said doctors 
who buy this equipment may take more xrays because they fear 
malpractice or simply because they are by training more inclined 
to seek test results 
the study was based on computerized records of 65517 doctor 
visits by privately insured patients who worked for several 
companies mostly in the midwest 
the researchers compared the number of xrays and ultrasound 
scans used by doctors who treated patients for stuffy noses 
pregnancy low back pain and for men difficulty urinating 
medstate systems the company that provided the computerized 
records estimates that working americans spend 290 million a year 
on xray and ultrasound scans for these four conditions

stanislaw tyminski an unknown emigre 
businessman who has not lived in poland for the past 21 years 
became a serious contender for the nations presidency with hardly 
a question raised 
when journalists finally started to take a hard look at 
tyminskis past he called them wolves and benefited from a 
wave of voter sympathy 
what started as a cautious first foray into fair election 
coverage has ended in a virtual freeforall as the final round of 
elections between tyminski and solidarity leader lech walesa draws 
to a close sunday 
almost daily newspapers and television unleash a torrent of 
disturbing news about tyminski but truth has been mixed with rumor 
and supposition some reporters frustrated by tyminskis evasive 
answers have become so partisan that they boo and hiss him at news 
conferences 
in a country in which communist authorities manipulated the news 
media for decades people became accustomed to believing that the 
opposite of what they were reading must be true 
as a result some have ignored the alarms being raised in the 
independent but factional press about the vague man with the 
mysterious past who could assume the nations highest office 
lost in the fury were latetosurface facts that tyminski has 
advocated arming poland with nuclear weapons that he is connected 
with longtime communist operatives that he claims a lifechanging 
spiritual experience in the peruvian jungle that he is not the 
wellknown magnate he claims to be 
we have somebody coming from nowhere and no reporter checks 
who he is says andrzej szczypiorski a senator and 
internationally acclaimed writer now all the fire is aimed at 
this puppet because the country is in danger 
the communists once tried a similar allout character assault 
against walesa szczypiorski recalled you know what effect that 
had walesas stature only grew 
until the week before the nov 25 first round of voting the 
polish press was preoccupied with the bitter contest between walesa 
and his former adviser prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
back then the selfproclaimed millionaire from abroad was an 
oddity covered dutifully but uncritically along with other 
lesserknown candidates 
that changed when tyminski who promises speedy prosperity 
charged mazowiecki with economic treason and showed up a shocking 
no 2 in an opinion poll he finished second in the election 
eliminating the prime minister who was cautiously overseeing 
painful freemarket reforms 
suddenly polands press was engaged in a frantic effort to 
discredit tyminski in raucous news conferences journalists mixed 
hardhitting questions with ineffectual polemics derisive laughter 
and outright condemnation 
tyminski has largely stood his ground with eerie calm and 
clipped replies often refusing to answer straightforward 
questions 
this is the first campaign of this sort in poland so our 
journalists do not have enough experience said maciej ilowiecki 
chairman of the association of polish journalists 
after a sluggish start he said reporters tried to make 
up for this professional neglect i think they tipped the scale to 
the other side and forgot about valid ethical rules 
for example on tuesday night state television broadcast an 
interview with a couple who said they were friends of tyminskis 
wife graciela in canada 
the pair said tyminski had abused her and refused food and 
medicine to his children that a childprotection agency once 
investigated him 
but the television network never gave tyminski a chance to 
respond to the allegations 
on wednesday morning tyminskis campaign dismissed the 
broadcast as slander 
the media should build a solid base of facts before you show 
he beats his wife said szczypiorski 
only in the second round four days before election ends 
someone goes to canada he said it was their duty to do it 
four months earlier 
polands press does not have a tradition of objective 
journalism of establishing a clear line between reporting and 
editorializing 
tyminski has accused television of dealing only with filth and 
lies and the press of conspiring against him his stance has won 
support 
i will vote for tyminski thanks to journalists warsaw 
resident jerzy krosmicki said the reporters behavior convinced 
me that there is no democracy 
however it appears some voters now are beginning to question 
tyminski an independent opinion poll wednesday showed walesa 
leading 61 percent to 20 percent compared with 58 percent to 30 
percent a week ago 
still pollsters caution that tyminski may do better at the 
ballot box they say the current atmosphere may encourage some of 
his supporters to hide their preference

massive street protests resigned thursday a spokesman in the 
presidents house said 
fulfilling a vow he made to opposition leaders ershad handed

new york city has proposed a 18 billion 
anticrime plan that would add nearly 3500 officers to the police 
force and would be paid for in part by a new cityonly lottery 
game 
the sixyear program announced wednesday also includes increases 
in property and income taxes and comes amid rising fear of street 
crime dramatized by a string of slayings of children hit by stray 
bullets 
the incometax increase and the lottery need the approval of the 
state legislature the city can raise property taxes on its own 
the program which would cost about 300 million a year was put 
together by mayor david dinkins and the city council it comes at a 
time when the city is trying to bridge a budget shortfall through 
cutbacks in other city agencies 
we have had enough of crime enough of bloodshed enough of 
the suffering and the tears which flow in the wake of criminal 
activity dinkins said wednesday 
officials said the lottery would bring in 50 million to 120 
million each year 
the police force now has about 25000 officers 
the program provides for more money for prosecutors legal aid 
lawyers prisons and drug treatment the plan also calls for 
improving security in schools reducing delinquency and finding 
jobs for high school graduates 
herb berman chairman of the city council finance committee 
said homeowners would pay about 10 more in property taxes in the 
first year and about 25 at the end of the program the citys 
surcharge on personal income tax that expires in mid1993 would be 
extended

a ku klux klansman arrested for wearing his hood 
in public lost a state supreme court bid to overturn a 39yearold 
ban on masks 
the court voted 61 wednesday to reject arguments by klansman 
shade miller jr that the georgia law enacted to curb klan activity 
is unconstitutional 
the justices said the 1951 law does not violate freespeech 
rights and is a legitimate attempt to prevent violence and 
intimidation 
the decision overruled a gwinnett county judge who dismissed 
misdemeanor charges against miller for wearing a mask in public 
attorney general michael bowers said miller faces arrest if 
caught wearing his klan hood but did not say whether the initial 
charge might be pursued 
the offense carries up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine 
disguise is commonly used by those committing crimes of violence 
and intimidation chief justice harold g clarke said 
a nameless faceless figure strikes terror in the human 
heart he wrote for the majority but remove the mask and the 
nightmarish form is reduced to its true dimensions the face 
betrays not only the identity but also human frailty 
millers lawyer michael hauptman said that the high courts 
description of the nomask laws range might allow for klan members 
to wear hoods in explicitly nonthreatening situations such as a 
parade 
bowers said he didnt interpret the ruling that way if his 
client wears a mask itll make my day he said 
the lone dissent came from justice george t smith who said he 
found the la unconstitutional on first amendment grounds 
it is a contentbased restriction on political speech directed 
to a dissident group in a public forum and is not narrowly 
tailored to serve a compelling state interest he said 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith called the rulihng 
a rejection of klaninspired intimidation and a blow to 
extremism

cautious in everything he did northwest pilot 
bill lovelace seemed like the last person who would get caught in 
the fiery detroit airport crash that killed eight people friends 
say 
lovelace an accomplished magician and woodworker as well as 
veteran pilot was just putting his life life back together after a 
bankruptcy and an illness that kept him from flying for five years 
then on monday the northwest dc9 he was commanding collided on 
a runway with a northwest boeing 727 eight people on the dc9 were 
killed and 24 injured 
lovelace whose own injuries were minor once was a dc9 flight 
instructor he had logged 20000 hours of commercial flying in a 
career spanning 24 years friends and northwest officials said 
i dont honestly believe it was his negligence that led to 
the collision said dave giannini who lives across the street from 
lovelace in a moderately affluent phoenix neighborhood whose 
residents range from retirees to families with young children 
that guy was a straight guy even driving a vehicle he was 
really cautious 
i would never hesitate to fly with him added gianninis 
wife barbara 
mondays flight would have been lovelaces 13th since returning 
to work on nov 25 after five years on disability for treatment for 
kidney stones it was also his first flight without the company of 
a supervising pilot 
the cause of the crash is under investigation but according to 
a transcript obtained by nbc lovelace indicated to the control 
tower he had become lost in the fog moments before the accident 
the federal aviation administration recertified lovelace as fit 
to fly on oct 10 and he returned to the air after two weeks of 
ground training and 13 hours of simulator flying 
flying was his no 1 love he talked about it often said 
judy wells a friend of 3 years 
three weeks before returning to active duty lovelace had been 
declared bankrupt under a petition he had filed in midjuly in 
phoenix court papers listed debts of about 152000 against assets 
of 106000 and a monthly income of 4212 in pension and 
retirement benefits 
his bankruptcy laywer david engelman said part of lovelaces 
debt stemmed from an unsuccessful gift shop that he sold in 1989 
divorced and with two grown children lovelace remarried in 
september 
no one answered the dor at his home wednesday where a neatly 
trimmed kumquat tree graces the front yard of the onestory stucco 
house 
but several neighbors and friends described him as a friendly 
helpful conscientious person as well as a talented magician and 
woodworker 
good enough to be professional jack wall said of the magic 
shows lovelace performs for schools and hospitals under the name 
the great orsini 
friends said he also turns out prizewinning wooden bowls on a 
lathe in his garage and in his backyard workshop lovelace has told 
of spending 40 to 50 hours on a woodworking project getting it 
just right 
his house shop anything he did had to be just right 
said giannini

nearly a year after a us invasion 
installed president guillermo endara the government remains so 
weak that it needed american gis to put down an attempted mutiny 
led by a disaffected officer 
wednesdays rebellion in a panamanian sergeant was killed was 
the most serious challenge mounted to the yearold endara 
government and a setback in us efforts to foster a stable 
government 
washington agreed just over a decade ago to cede control over 
the panama canal at the end of the century 
the bush administration removed dictator gen manuel antonio 
noriega last dec 20 in an invasion it said was justified because 
it put a democratically elected politician in office and fostered a 
return to wellbeing in panama 
but the economy remains depressed despite endaras efforts to 
revive it he has cut government spending sold off moneylosing 
state companies and instituted other belttightening measures 
about 30000 of panamas 100000 public workers held a 24hour 
strike wednesday called by the coordinator of unions an umbrella 
group that includes noriega supporters 
strike leaders threaten longer strikes to continue pressing for 
job security easing austerity and wage raises which endara says 
panamas economy based on small canal revenues and a meager 
agriculture cannot afford 
workers pay is still low about 200000 people out of a 
population of 24 million remain jobless at 35 billion panamas 
foreign debt is the highest per capita in latin america 
on tuesday afternoon while about 40000 public workers were 
holding a street demonstration the former deputy national police 
chief escaped from jail on the pacific island of nao 
retired col eduardo herrera hassan who was awaiting trial on 
charges of plotting against the government flew to his former 
panama city headquarters where the government says he tried to 
organize an uprising 
herrera accused the government of humiliating members of the 
national police the entity created in january to replace noriegas 
disbanded defense forces the 13000strong force includes many 
former defense forces soldiers 
herrera had been named national police deputy chief but was 
removed in august and jailed in october 
after his escape he radioed units nationwide for support but 
except for a few dozen supporters the national police remained 
loyal to endara 
endara summoned a special joint uspanamanian task force to 
quell the mutiny the force of 500 troops led by american 
soldiers had been helping the hitherto untrustworthy police keep 
order since the invasion 
their attempts to rally panamanian troops unsuccessful herrera 
and his coconspirators tried to flee military headquarters and a 
panamanian sergeant was killed and three civilians wounded in the 
shooting that followed 
herrera a hardnosed veteran trained in israeli and the us 
military schools was captured along with 35 others fifteen rebels 
were at large 
some 120000 us troops are stationed in the country and the 
joint patrolling agreement they have with the panamanians expires 
at the end december due to the political uncertainty and questions 
about the loyalty of the national police it appears that agreement 
could be extended 
tuesday was the first time since 1925 that a panamanian 
president formally asked us troops to help restore order the 
last time they helped quell riots to protest increases in housing 
rents 
us troops werent invited last december they just roared in 
from bases inside and outside panama crushed the defense forces 
and flew noriega to miami to stand trial on drug trafficking and 
money laundering charges 
some 370 panamanians were killed in the fighting then 
endara who had won handily in may 1989 elections that noriega 
annulled was sworn in as president just as us troops made their 
move 
corruption remains widespread in panama having thrived during 
the years of military rule that began when gen omar torrijos 
seized power in 1968 militarydominated regimes succeeded his 
dictatorship when he died in a mysterious plane crash july 31 
1981 
seven puppet civilian governments came and went at noriegas 
whim while he wielded power as defense forces chief in the 1980s 
a cousin close to torrijos herrera was also a noriega crony 
until the two had a falling out and the dictator packed him off as 
military attache to israel when herrera returned in january 
endara put him in charge of demilitarizing the police 
herrera told reporters shortly before his arrest wednesday that 
he was not leading a coup but trying to dramatize the disaffection 
of the former military turned policemen 
many of them are known to miss the power and the perks they once 
had no military force was created after noriegas defense forces 
were disbanded 
panama seized independence from colombia in 1903 with us 
warships standing off its coasts by to help after that the us 
government built ran and owned the panama canal 
in 1978 the treaties ceding the canal to panama 2000 were 
ratified and panama became its titular owner 
the two governments now jointly administer the waterway and the 
us southern command keeps its troops on 11 military bases along 
the canals shores under the treaties the bases are to be 
eliminated by the year 2000

the city council voted to abolish bostons 
13member school board accusing it of ripping off the 
taxpayers and failing to educate the citys children the move 
needs the approval of the governor and legislature 
the city council approved 103 wednesday a measure to put 
education of the citys 57000 public school children under the 
direct control of the council and mayor raymond flynn 
flynn said legislative approval would put boston in the 
forefront of education reform 
the school committee as the elected board is known had been 
criticized for failing to find a new superintendent last week it 
called off its eightmonth search 
the quality of the citys schools had also come under attack as 
had the boards failure to close a 12 million deficit in this 
years 3895 million budget 
the school committee over there has been ripping off the 
taxpayers unmercifully said councilman albert dapper oneil 
today is dday 
no matter what the particular issue nothing happens or if it 
happens its done in an incorrect way said councilman james 
byrne who proposed abolishing the board 
school committee president daniel burke said the move was 
politically motivated and not in the school systems best 
interests committee member robert cappucci said flynn is involving 
himself in an issue he cannot handle 
for the mayor to assume that he is going to be the answer to 
quality education is ridiculous cappucci said 
if the move is approved by the state school committee members 
will be forced to step down at the end of the current school year 
flynn said he was optimistic about passage because he expected 
lawmakers to see the correlation between bostons high homicide 
rate and its poor schools 
were seeing turmoil in our city because public education has 
failed the schoolchildren he said 
councilman charles yancey who voted against the measure said 
we are depriving the right to vote by the people of boston it 
was ramrodded through and i think my colleagues will regret this 
decision

the associated press and the wire service guild 
reached tentative agreement on a twoyear contract covering more 
than 1300 employees nationwide 
the agreement which would replace a contract that expired 
friday provides for raises of 28 percent in the first year and 
23 percent in the second 
i think its a realistic contract and i think that given the 
economic climate in the industry and its obvious impact on us 
thats what makes it realistic d byron yake ap director of 
human resources said wednesday 
the other side of that is that were pleased we can offer a 
contract that has raises and not freezes and cuts 
kevin keane guild president said obviously the bargaining 
committee is disappointed with the size of the wage increase but 
they worked hard and were convinced that this is the best 
contract we can get given the labor and economic climate 
he said the guild was recommending ratification by the 
membership 
the contract calls for pay increases that would raise top scale 
for newspersons and photographers from 720 to 740 weekly in the 
first year of the contract and from 740 to 757 in the second 
year 
economic differentials also would go up in the second year of 
the contract news staff employees in new york and washington would 
receive a 10 a week increase in the differential bringing it to 
97 the differential in los angeles san francisco boston and 
chicago would go up 15 to 60 
the contract also offers improved retirement benefits for those 
already retired and service credits for active participants in the 
pension plan 
the tentative pact cuts paid maternity leave for women from four 
weeks to one week while keeping one week paid paternity leave for 
men and changes unpaid leave time from 18 months to 12 months for 
both men and women 
under the old contract men were not given unpaid paternity 
leave 
in addition women on maternity leave will be allowed to use 
eight weeks fullpay disability regardless of their length of 
employment

doctors say a drug taken by transplant 
recipients to prevent organ rejection will be tested on diabetics 
to see if it helps them fight the disease 
the drug fk506 already has shown promise in reversing the 
effects of some types of skin diseases leading researchers to 
study whether it will halt the onset of a related type of diabetes 
said dr thomas starzl 
starzl heads the university of pittsburghs transplant program 
where about 800 patients since february 1989 have taken the drug to 
prevent their white blood cells from rejecting donor organs 
he said wednesday that the drug also shows promise in treating 
autoimmune diseases in which the bodys white cells destroy 
healthy cells 
the us food and drug administration has approved a twoyear 
test of the drug on 60 type 1 diabetes patients starzl said 
fk506 has already reversed the effects of psoriasis a skin 
disease that creates unsightly lesions in all six patients who 
took it starzl said 
the drug also reversed the effects of pyoderma gangrenosum a 
rare skin ulcer in six of seven patients he said 
were seeing some very dramatic recoveries said starzl who 
performed the worlds first successful human liver transplant in 
1967 
he said researchers want to move ahead quickly with the tests on 
people with type i diabetes in which a persons white cells 
destroy their pancreas insulinproducing factories requiring that 
the person take insulin shots to survive 
we are anxious to get the information out that there is 
something that could switch off this disease he told reporters 
at least 11 million americans suffer from type 1 diabetes which 
can cause blindness and kidney failure its symptoms are excessive 
thirst frequent urination rapid weight loss and blurred vision 
fk506 which is derived from a fungus is taken orally twice a 
day it is manufacturered by the fujisawa pharmaceutical co of 
japan 
transplant patients using the drug have displayed such side 
effects as dizziness and excessive dreaming said dr patricia 
carroll of the universitys medical school but she said side 
effects havent shown up in people who have taken the drug but who 
have not undergone transplants

highimpact aerobics enthusiasts bouncing their 
way to trim tummies and tight tushes may also be jolting their 
inner ears into episodes of vertigo and inviting hearing loss from 
loud workout music a doctor says 
dizziness ringing in the ears and loss of balance were found 
among aerobics teachers and others who do the popular form of 
exercise frequently dr michael i weintraub of new york medical 
college wrote in todays issue of the new england journal of 
medicine 
five recent cases prompted him to question 37 highimpact 
aerobics instructors at two fitness clubs weintraub said results 
suggested a link between the exercising and shock to the ears that 
could be causing damage to the inner ear he said 
aerobics exercising popularized by actress jane fonda in the 
1980s features repeated jumping and running in place highimpact 
aerobics exercising is an advanced more intense form of aerobics 
workouts 
among the five cases that alerted weintraub was a 29yearold 
woman aerobics teacher who suffered vertigo skewed balance that 
caused her to inadvertently to veer to the right and hearing loss 
in another case a 20yearold aerobics enthusiast suffered 
vertigo and general dizziness after exercising a 42yearold 
instructor suffered reduced hearing in one ear 
a 35yearold instructor reported a muffled sound in one ear and 
sense of imbalance that worsened after exercising and a 
26yearold enthusiast had a 7month history of dizziness and 
hearing problems during and after exercises 
the hearing loss was thought to be related to exposure to 
the loud music played during the exercise routine weintraub 
wrote 
of the 37 instructors questioned weintraub said five reported 
episodes of vertigo and some hearing loss and eight reported 
tinnitus ringing or buzzing in the ear 
the injuries came despite the use of specially cushioned shoes 
he said 
vertigo is a loss of balance commonly accompanied by a whirling 
feeling or the feeling that things surrounding the sufferer are 
spinning possible dangers from aerobics need more study weintraub 
said 
in calling attention to this potential association i do not 
intend to discourage highimpact aerobics but rather to urge an 
increased awareness among clinicians as well as exercise 
instructors and enthusiasts he said

the first marine to refuse orders to go to the 
persian gulf says now that hes won a military discharge hell 
fight to keep his former colleagues out of war 
the marine corps agreed wednesday to grant jeff paterson an 
administrative discharge and drop courtmartial proceedings against 
him in exchange for his dropping legal action against the military 
i think now ill be in a better position to mobilize support 
against the war said paterson who attended a celebration at a 
local coffehouse late wednesday ill continue speaking out and 
being very vocal against the war 
in a related development wednesday army spec sebastian correa 
sued the military and president bush for extending his activeduty 
enlistment because of the persian gulf crisis 
correas fouryear activeduty tour was to have ended nov 24 
in early september he was asked if he wanted to reenlist he 
declined two weeks later correa 24 was sent to saudi arabia 
and two weeks after that he learned his tour was extended until 
december 1991 
paterson 22 was accused of violating orders for refusing to 
board a plane for saudi arabia with his unit on aug 29 
he also was charged with unauthorized absence on aug 16 when 
he failed to report for duty to hold a news conference announcing 
his plans to seek conscientious objector status 
the marines denied that request saying it was based on 
political and not moral considerations and they didnt believe it 
was sincere 
paterson said wednesday he might have helped the antiwar 
movement more if he had fought the charges at a courtmartial 
but the government probably would have won their case and i 
would have been in jail he said i have no desire to be a 
martyr 
he and his lawyer eric seitz said the military decided to drop

iraqi president saddam hussein today 
called for the release of all foreign hostages saying recent 
diplomatic moves have prompted him to respond to positive 
changes the iraqi news agency reported 
saddam also said the hostages presence was no longer needed to 
deter attack because his forces were fully deployed in kuwait 
saddam who rules parliament with an iron hand asked the body 
to approve the hostages release the official report said it was 
assumed the hostages would be freed immediately after parliaments 
approval 
the report did not say exactly when he wanted the estimated 
2000 westerners including 1000 americans to be freed about 90 
of the detained americans have been held at strategic sites to 
deter an attack on iraqi forces saddam previously had said he 
would free all hostages over a threemonth period beginning 
christma day if nothing mars the atmosphere of peace 
his decision was apparently a reaction to a decision by 
president bush last week to propose direct usiraqi talks on the 
persian gulf crisis iraq has accepted the offer for highlevel 
negotiations 
saddams message also comes exactly one week after passage of a 
un resolution authorizing force against iraq by jan 15 if its 
fails to withdraw from kuwait the united states also recently 
announced it would dramatically boost its forces in the persian 
gulf region 
the iraqi new agency monitored in nicosia said saddam urged 
parliament to act in a letter he sent to the national assembly 
chairman sadi mehdi saleh 
the agency quoted saddam as saying in the letter we deem it 
necessary that our national council convene to take a final and 
irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue which you and the 
rest of the world are aware of 
he said the most annoying factor of the gulf standoff was that 
some people with no confrontational or evil intentions were 
caught in the middle 
some of the foreigners who have been prevented from travel 
fall under that category 
saddam said that when the travel ban was first announced iraqi 
forces had not completed their mobilization in kuwait to confront 
a potential military aggression 
any measure that could delay war at the time was appropriate 
so that we use the opportunity to complete preparations for 
that possibility saddam said according to the iraqi news agency 
text 
but now our forces with the blessings of the almighty are 
fully prepared to defend our values and principles against the 
traitors and infidels and to defend our national regional and 
humanitarian wealth he said 
we had suggested different timing for the release of 
hostages saddam said referring to the previous offer to allow the 
foreigners to leave in batches over a threemonth period starting 
dec 25 
but he added that recent overtures have prompted him to 
respond to positive changes 
iraq this week accepted a bush administration proposal to hold 
talks on the crisis which began when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 
2 
cnn on wednesday quoted a ranking iraqi source it did not 
identify as saying all issues are on the table everything it 
said saddam was feeling enormous pressure to withdraw from kuwait 
saddam told parliament i invite you to take a just decision 
to end the travel ban imposed on foreigners and restore to all of 
them the freedom to travel we apologize to those who may have been 
harmed and from god we seek forgiveness

iraq is accepting president bushs offer to 
hold talks on the occupation of kuwait but the gap between the two 
sides remains wide as secretary of state james a baker iii 
testifies on capitol hill 
baker plans to use his trip to baghdad to reiterate three us 
demands that iraq withdraw from kuwait free all foreign hostages 
and permit the return of the ousted kuwaiti government 
iraq today appeared to move closer to accepting one of those 
demands when president saddam hussein called for the release of all 
foreign hostages saying recent diplomatic moves have prompted him 
to respond to positive changes 
the iraqi news agency reported that saddam said the hostages 
presence was no longer needed to deter attack because his forces 
were fully deployed in kuwait saddam who rules parliament with an 
iron hand asked the body to approve the hostages release the 
official report said it was assumed the hostages would be freed 
immediately after parliaments approval 
sadiq al mashat the iraqi ambassador told reporters wednesday 
that the palestinians dispute with israel is the backbone of 
iraqi policy 
it has to be addressed some way or another he said let 
us negotiate and arrive at a peaceful settlement which would be in 
the interest of everybody in the region 
al mashat coupled that statement with a warning to the united 
states if you are going to war you are going to receive ashes 
and animosity 
baker who appears today before the house foreign affairs 
committee would go to baghdad after tariq aziz the iraqi foreign 
minister comes to washington for talks with bush 
testifying wednesday to the senate foreign relations committee 
baker appealed for broad support for the administrations persian 
gulf policy 
amid rising dissent baker said we ought to send a clear 
signal here that there is a willingness and a resolve to threaten 
the use of force in a credible way so this man saddam will know 
if he doesnt leave peacefully force could be used against him 
taking a tough line baker said his message to saddam would be 
get out of kuwait or risk all 
he said he would not negotiate with saddam and added a new 
warning if force must be used it will be used suddenly 
massively and decisively 
meanwhile bush said in a news conference in buenos aires 
argentina that the united states would make no effort to give 
saddam a facesaving way out 
when naked aggression takes place its not a question of 
finding face for the aggressor the president said when a 
country is literally raped and pillaged should the world go out 
and try to find a way to save face for he who has raped and 
pillaged that country 
baker meanwhile said a trade embargo and other economic 
sanctions imposed by the united nations security counil after the 
aug 2 invasion had not worked he said he was very pessimistic 
they would compel saddam to withdraw and said that also was the 
judgment of intelligence experts 
put bluntly this is the last best chance for a peaceful 
solution baker said of his forthcoming trip to baghdad which 
iraq has accepted in principle with the details still to be worked 
out 
he said he would not negotiate with the iraqi president on 
subjects unrelated to the seizure of kuwait 
i will not be negotiating the palestinian question or the 
civil war in lebanon he said saddam did not invade kuwait to 
help the palestinians he did it for his own selfaggrandizement 
if baker made any converts on the senate foreign relations 
committee they were not evident 
committee chairman claiborne pell dri said sanctions have 
not been given adequate time to work his mail is running eight 
or nine to one to slow down the rush toward military action pell 
said there is little evidence of impatience or of a popular 
clamoring for war 
and sen paul sarbanes dmd said this is a time for the 
qualities of the longdistance runner perseverance stamina 
determination lashing out may be less courageous than to stick the 
course particularly when youre talking about a significant loss 
of life

eleven years after the islamic revolution 
forced women under veils and banned social contact between the 
sexes president hashemi rafsanjani is championing a freer attitude 
toward sex and social interaction 
we imagine that it is good if we suppress ourselves endure 
frustrations and be patient in our sexual desires this is 
incorrect it is wrong rafsanjani said last week at friday 
prayers an important forum for political statements 
god has created certain needs in the human being and he does 
not want them left unanswered he said addressing thousands of 
worshippers at tehran university and millions of his countrymen 
listening on radio 
the efforts are part of a broad political and social 
liberalization ransanjani has pressed despite sharp opposition 
since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini died in june 1989 
rafsanjanis moves have ranged from such major policy steps as 
encouraging private businesses and expanding ties with western 
countries to permitting more contemporary music and even making 
television more lively 
why is it improper for a lady to marry twice in her lifetime 
or to have a temporary relationship a temporary marriage with 
someone else rafsanjani said in his sermon 
sigheh or temporary marriage according to shiite islam 
the branch of islam in iran can be verbally contracted between 
two consenting adults they take a temporary vow before 
engaging in sex 
attempting to make the idea of sigheh as loose as possible 
rafsanjani said in his sermon that some people imagine that for a 
temporary marriage we have to find a turbaned man cleric 
rafsanjani said 
none of this is necessary he said they can make a 
contract for themselves if they want to be together for a month or 
two 
it wasnt clear whether rafsanjanis comments friday would 
quickly lead to a liberalization of popular attitudes toward sex 
social and moral codes are often interpreted differently from city 
to city and some religious and government leaders still hew to 
khomeinis ascetic line 
under khomeini irans 55 million people endured a rigidly 
enforced islamic social and religious code that outlawed even 
preteen boys and girls from sitting together in classrooms 
in many places the allpervasive neighborhood komitehs or 
revolutionary committees still swoop down on women who defy the 
dress code that decrees they must always wear a headtotoe robe 
armed uniformed komiteh militants still raid parties where both 
sexes are allowed to mingle 
rafsanjanis sermon drew wide attention 
he is calling for men and women to mingle in public to eat 
together in restaurants to walk around in the parks to be 
normal a university professor in tehran said on condition of 
anonymity 
in my opinion this temporary marriage thing is to wrap these 
relationships in an islamic cloak to silence opponents the 
professor said 
rafsanjanis antiwestern hardline rivals locked in a power 
struggle with him claim to be the real heirs of khomeini 
spiritual leader of the 1979 islamic revolution 
they demand unflinching adherence to the patriarchs strict 
teachings 
using khomeinis parlance the hardliners have accused 
rafsanjani of favoring american islam a diluted version of 
the real thing 
the more open atmosphere encouraged by rafsanjani is palpable in 
the streets of tehran where pretty young women made up with 
lipstick and eyeliner push back their headscarves to show a peek of 
their carefully coiffeured hair 
a day after rafsanjanis sermon a crowd in central tehrans 
ferdowsi square pleaded on behalf of a chic young woman being 
arrested for showing a lock of hair still considered a violation 
by komiteh revolutionaries 
growing nervous because of the size of the crowd the 
revolutionary sister attempting the arrest relented 
she returned to her patrol car muttering one day well get 
your american president then youd better watch out 
hardliners led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi and parliament speaker mehdi karrubi are vehemently 
opposed to rafsanjanis steering of the revolution in a more 
liberal direction 
they have been the target of a purge by rafsanjani and have 
gone on the defensive since khomeinis death 
they agonized when rafsanjani moved toward normalizing ties with 
a number of western countries they endured when he said he favored 
private enterprise over the stifling governmentrun economy 
but rafsanjanis latest statements a call to reverse what his 
rivals consider the revolutions most visible achievements 
has them up in arms 
i hope we will never undermine the dignity of women we should 
never hurt their feelings karrubi said in parliament monday

president hussain muhammad ershad 
resigned today and surrendered power to an oppositionnominated 
political independent who will lead the country until elections 
promised for within three months 
ershad a former army general who held power for eight years 
agreed on tuesday to step down after a sevenweek campaign of large 
street protests that grew only fiercer when he imposed a state of 
emergency last week 
fulfilling a vow he made to opposition leaders ershad 
administered the oath of office to shahabuddin ahmed chief justice 
of the supreme court 
ershad then resigned as president of this impoverished nation of 
107 million people 
allah bless you ershad told shahabuddin you have our 
blessings i want peace to return to the society 
shahabuddin sworn in as vice president will serve as acting 
president and preside over new elections that are to be held within 
90 days 
i have no political ambition i shall not stay here beyond the 
mandated 90 days shahabuddin told opposition leaders after the 
ceremony 
during this period i shall try to ensure peace and stability 
hold free and fair elections and hand over power to the elected 
representatives of the people he said 
the transfer of power was shown on staterun television 
ershad wearing a black suit and looking grim was flanked by 
the chiefs of the army navy and air force it was the first time 
he had appeared on television since monday night when he first 
expressed a willingness to resign 
the ceremony took place at the presidents office inside dhakas 
military cantonment a wellguarded complex of offices and houses 
ershad 60 was an army general when he seized in a 1982 
bloodless coup he resigned his military commission before running 
the 1986 presidential election that opponents said he stole through 
massive voterigging 
shahabuddin 62 met the opposition leaders later in the day 
originally his nomination was to be approved by parliament on 
saturday but ershad unexpectedly dissolved the lawmaking body this 
morning 
constitutional experts and opposition sources said ershad 
dissolved parliament because it was doubtful a majority of 
legislators would emerge in public 
twothirds of parliament belonged to ershads jatiya party many 
deputies were reluctant to appear in public for fear of being 
attacked by antiershad activists 
some jatiya party offices and officials residences around the 
country have been stoned or ransacked in the past week 
ershad lifted the state of emergency late wednesday eight days 
after he imposed it because of increasingly violent demonstrations 
for his removal 
emergency measures had included a curfew and press censorship 
but street protests continued despite the deployment of troops 
on tuesday night ershad bowed to a sevenweek groundswell of 
opposition and said he would step down as the opposition had chosen 
someone to run the country until new elections 
the top opposition leaders sheik hasina and khaleda zia agreed 
wednesday night on shahabuddin a career lawyer and judge 
ershad has not been seen in public for nearly a week but 
longtime aides said he remained at his home and office inside a 
dhaka military base 
the opposition claimed at least 100 people were killed by 
security forces since the emergency was declared on nov 27 
ershads govenment said only six people died 
mrs zia and hasina have been agitating for ershads ouster 
since he took power but their personal and political rivalries had 
long thwarted any lasting campaign 
then in october the opposition was galvanized by ershads 
announcement that he would be a candidate in june presidential 
elections 
hasina leader of the leftofcenter awami league is the 
daughter of sheik mujibur rahman bangladeshs first president 
mrs zia head of the bangladesh nationalist party is the widow 
of another former president ziaur rahman both men were 
assassinated 
ershad is the countrys ninth president since it gained 
independence from pakistan in 1971 like all of his predecessors 
he was installed by military action

one of the rising political stars of the french 
right wing mayor michel noir of lyon quit his party today 
describing the entire political system as sick 
his resignation from the rally for the republic the nations 
largest conservative party came a day after its leader jacques 
chirac denounced the concept of an integrated europe 
noir 46 loses his seat in the national assembly by the 
resignation he had been seen by many as a potential heir to 
chirac a former prime minister and now the mayor of paris 
at a news conference in lyon noir accused all french political 
parties of failing to provide leadership as the country faces 
disturbing social ills and tough choices for its future 
france is sick sick of the crises in justice education 
safety health noir said sick of no longer holding its 
historic role on the international stage 
france has been rocked in recent months by strikes by students 
demanding better education protests by judges angry at political 
interference and riots by youths in suburban ghettos 
chirac broke a national consensus wednesday on further 
integrating the 12 countries of the european community declaring 
paris was ceding too much sovereignty 
the denunciation came as president francois mitterrand and 
chancellor helmut kohl of germany discussed proposals on political 
union ahead of next weeks ec summit in rome 
we reject the conception of the french socialists as well as 
of the germans and of the italians for a federation of the 12 
chirac declared 
chirac who lost the 1988 presidential race to mitterrand is 
one of the most prominent politicians to oppose further ec 
integration since prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
resigned last month his comments in many views echoed her views 
noir did not address the change in policy toward europe but his 
break with chirac appeared certain to again steep the party in the 
confusion it has experienced ever since the 1988 election loss 
the rally for the republics main political ally the union for 
french democracy led by former president valery giscard destaing 
strongly supports european integration it was not immediately 
clear what effect chiracs proposals would have on the alliance 
the resignation deprives the rally for the republic of its most 
charismatic young leader noir has fared consistently well in 
opinion polls and has resolutely denounced moves by party bosses to 
form an electoral pact with the extremeright national front of 
jeanmarie le pen 
political analysts predicted that noir would seek some sort of 
national role outside the rally for the republic

americas economic future will be jeopardized 
unless colleges and universities develop strategies to recruit 
retain and graduate more minorities a report by a national task 
force said today 
the education commission of the states task force said an 
18month study of colleges and universities in 10 states found 
there are too few minorities in higher education and those who do 
attend college often dont graduate or go on to graduatelevel 
programs 
in comparison labor statistics show that in less than 10 years 
onethird of workers entering the work force will be members of 
minority groups and that a majority of all new jobs will require 
postsecondary education 
americas economic future will be severely jeopardized until 
all colleges and universities place the same priority on educating 
a much higher proportion of minority citizens said the report 
entitled achieving campus diversity policies for change 
indeed diversity can be a source of americas strength rather 
than a force that divides said garrey carruthers outgoing 
governor of new mexico who is chairman of the national task force 
on minority achievement in higher education 
to increase campus diversity the report said states should set 
two goals against which to measure their progress minority 
enrollment in higher education should be at least proportional to 
the minority population in each state also minority graduation 
rates should be comparable to those of other students the report 
said 
the report studied every fouryear institution in california 
florida illinois massachusetts new jersey new mexico ohio 
south carolina tennessee and texas 
the states represented 42 percent of the nations 1985 
population and enrolled 39 percent of native american 42 percent 
of african american and 72 percent of hispanic college students 
the states showed declines in enrollment for all the groups 
according to the report colleges must remove barriers to 
participation by recruiting more underrepresented students 
providing adequate financial aid using broadened admissions 
criteria and scheduling classes at convenient times for employed 
adults 
colleges and universities also must help students achieve by 
making it clear what they expect and taking steps to help students 
reach academic standards institutions should develop partnerships 
with public schools and work with community colleges to ease the 
transition from twoyear to fouryear institutions 
institutions also must increase the use of mentors and academic 
advising 
the final step for colleges and universities is to use 
assessment learning assistance better teaching strategies and 
curricular reform to change learning environments for all 
students

the united states and britain asked 
their nato allies today for more help in transporting and equipping 
their forces in the persian gulf 
at a nato defense ministers meeting british defense secretary 
tom king urged his colleagues to provide more ammunition medical 
equipment and chemicalwarfare gear as well as ships and planes to 
transport troops to the gulf 
king told reporters defense secretary dick cheney made a similar 
request on the opening day of the twoday meeting at the nato 
headquarters here 
he cheney expressed his appreciation for allied support to 
date king said but we both said we were looking for further 
support and contributions from other members of the alliance 
the united states with about 300000 soldiers in the gulf 
region has the largest force facing iraq followed by britain 
whose total deployment will reach 30000 over the next few weeks 
all 16 nato members except germany iceland luxembourg and 
turkey have sent forces to the gulf 
king said he received one or two informal commitments from 
other nato nations for new aid to support the british military 
presence in the gulf 
in recent weeks washington issued two separate appeals to its 
allies for help in flying and shipping american forces to the gulf 
while the response generally has been good officials said more 
help was needed in view of the scope of the us military buildup 
the nato defense ministers meeting comes a week after the 
adoption of the united nations resolution authorizing military 
action against iraq unless it leaves kuwait by jan 15 
he said public support for an attack on iraq and western 
credibility in the middle east could slide away if the 
27nation force fails to stick to that deadline 
the idea that you could somehow drift longer is not a credible 
option king said 
also today the defense ministers reviewed work to date on a new 
nato defense strategy to reflect the dramatic changes in eastwest 
relations 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg told a news 
conference there was a general wish among the allies to involve 
france more closely in allied military operations 
france although a nato member does not take part in the 
alliances integrated military structure from which it withdraw in 
1966 
stoltenberg said it is very important to strengthen the 
european security element in nato through a new defense strategy 
focusing on multinational force formations with links to french 
troops 
without elaborating he said informal talks with france had 
already been held and were continuing 
king said natos new defense strategy due to be adopted next 
year must reflect changes in eastern europe yet provide the allies 
with adequate defenses 
quite clearly the scale and nature of the threat has changed 
but there are considerably instabilities remaining not least 
the rise of nationalism in eastern europe king said 
officials said the new strategy will call for smaller forces 
the maintenance of some nuclear arms as well as the continued 
pressence of american troops in europe but in far smaller numbers 
than has been the case since the second world war

the soviet defense minister said 35000 young men 
have evaded the draft this year most in republics where 
independence movements have fostered antimilitary sentiment the 
official tass news agency reported today 
in addition more than 4300 deserters from the army are at 
large aided in their flight by local authorities tass quoted 
defense minister dmitry yazov as saying at a conference of military 
officials held wednesday 
two thousand soldiers died in the first 11 months of 1990 and a 
quarter of those were suicides the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
said in a report on the same conference citing figures given by 
col gen nikolai shlyaga the head of the main political 
directorate of the armed forces 
the report did not specify how the other soldiers died but many 
deaths apparently were the result of hazing of draftees by veteran 
soldiers 
many draftees refuse to serve outside their home republics 
because they fear the vicious hazing that often is ethnically 
motivated 
yazov said the draft was disrupted in the republics of latvia 
lithuania estonia georgia armenia and the western ukraine tass 
reported 
as independence or nationalist movements have strengthened in 
these and other republics sentiment against the soviet military 
has been growing some of the breakaway republics have proposed 
setting up their own armed forces 
the soviet military does not reveal how many youths are drafted 
each year citing state security but every soviet man 18 or older 
must serve in the military 
addressing the conference of junior and middlelevel officers in 
the armed forces the kgb secret police the interior ministry and 
the railroad troops yazov said that attacks on the army its 
prestige and combat traditions are directed against the integrity 
of the soviet state tass reported 
can you jest with the army well you can insult it once or 
twice but after all this is a man with a gun yazov said in an 
interview wednesday night with soviet television 
some people fail to understand that it is they who the army 
defends he added 
yazov also said civilians were involved in the slayings of 69 
officers and 32 warrant officers tass reported without further 
elaboration 
last week yazov ordered a crackdown on assaults against red 
army units saying such actions are endangering national security 
he ordered soldiers to use weapons if any military installation is 
attacked and he urged the protection of installations from 
officials who would cut off power water or other services 
the soviet military announced last month it was embarking on a 
10year restructuring program to cut manpower and weaponry the 
plan includes cutting personnel from the current 4 million to about 
3 million to 32 million the draft will continue but alternative 
service will be allowed for those who object on religious grounds

iraqi president saddam hussein today 
called for the release of all foreign hostages from iraq and 
kuwait saying recent diplomatic moves helped prompt the decision 
the iraqi news agency said 
saddam also said the hostages presence was no longer needed to 
deter an attack by the usled multinational forces in the persian 
gulf because his forces were now fully deployed in kuwait 
saddam urged his compliant parliament to approve the hostages 
release the official report said it did not say when the captives 
would be freed but it was assumed they would be allowed to leave 
after parliaments vote 
the 250seat national assembly which has no record of ever 
challenging saddam scheduled a meeting for late friday morning to 
debate saddams request the state radio later announced 
relatives and friends of american and british hostages were 
overjoyed when they heard their loved ones could be freed soon 
this has been the hardest thing ive ever had to go through in 
my life said doris whatley of shreveport la whose husband 
donald has been held in iraq now to know hell be coming 
home well im a changed person 
patricia hale of spring texas whose husband ed was seized 
from an oil rig in kuwait by iraqi troops said this surprise is 
delightful truly delightful its all we ever wanted for the 
hostages to go free 
in britain relatives of hostages in iraq and kuwait were also 
excited 
im over the moon its what weve prayed and prayed for 
said sue dorrington whose husband david is being held in baghdad 
saddams announcement coincided with a report that his foreign 
minister tariq aziz will meet with president bush in washington 
on dec 17 to discuss a possible settlement of the 4monthold gulf 
crisis 
there are thousands of western hostages in iraq and kuwait 
including about 900 americans some 90 of the detained americans 
are believed held at strategic sites to deter attack by the 
330000strong multinational forces 
despite warnings by the us state department dozens of 
americans have traveled to baghdad trying to win freedom for their 
family members and friends 
saddam previously had said he would free all hostages over a 
threemonth period beginning christmas day if nothing mars the 
atmosphere of peace 
the white house today welcomed the offer as a hopeful sign 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it shows that saddam 
hussein realizes that his position on the hostages has earned him 
the outrage of the world 
britain also applauded the move 
we greatly welcome this news we have been pressing throughout 
for the return of all our hostages the sooner they are back the 
better said a statement for the british foreign office 
a foreign office spokesman said however that the government 
has received no confirmation that the approximately 1300 british 
citizens in iraq and kuwait will be free to leave 
saddams message came one week after passage of a un 
resolution authorizing force against iraq by jan 15 if its fails 
to withdraw from kuwait the iraqi new agency monitored in 
nicosia said saddam urged parliament to act in a letter sent to 
national assembly chairman sadi mehdi saleh 
in his letter saddam said his decision was prompted by recent 
consultations with his arab brothers a reference to a meeting 
with king hussein of jordan palestine liberation organization 
chairman yasser arafat and yemeni vice president ali salem 
albaidh on tuesday 
he said recent overtures prompted him to respond to positive 
changes 
saddam said the reason for which the foreigners were prevented 
from travel have dinmished and have been replaced by something more 
powerful a change in the american public opionion which will 
impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions of the evil 
ones led by bush the enemy of god 
but despite this change he said the iraqi armed forces 
should maintain the highest degree of alert and vigilance because 
the forces of aggression remain on our sacred soil in saudi arabia 
fanning the flames of fire 
iraq banned foreigners from leaving in response to the allied 
troop buildup in saudi arabia the united states has contributed 
230000 troops and promised another 200000 iraq has deployed 
430000 troops in southern iraq and kuwait 
saddam said that when the travel ban was first announced iraqi 
forces had not completed their mobilization in kuwait to confront 
a potential military aggression 
now that the iraqi military is battle ready saddam said 
the foreigners should regain their freedom to travel 
we deem it necessary that our national assembly convene to 
take a final and irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue 
he said

the bush administration today welcomed iraqs 
dramatic announcement that it would free all foreign hostages as 
evidence our strategy of diplomatic and military pressure is 
working 
still the administration pressed its efforts to win 
congressional support for using force against iraq if saddam 
hussein does not order his army to quit kuwait soon secretary of 
state james a baker iii said releasing hostages was not enough 
it does not lessen nor should it our determination that 
iraqs aggression against kuwait should be reversed baker said 
in his second straight day of congressional testimony 
baker and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration had received no official word from baghdad 
nevertheless this is a welcome and significant development 
but we do want to see it actually happen baker told the house 
foreign affairs committee i think this is a sign that our 
ste of the british journal nature 
discovery of the gene called sry was announced in july along with 
some evidence for a sexdetermining role 
sry lies within the bundle of genes called the y chromosome 
which is usually inherited only by males 
the new studies provide fairly strong support for the role of 
sry in sex determination dr david page of the whitehead 
institute of cambridge mass said in a telephone interview 
the european scientists said they failed to find any sry 
mutation in most women they tested who carried the gene in those 
cases a mutation may lie in a part of the gene that was not 
examined or there may be a defect in some other gene that helps 
determine gender they suggested

william k black a bluntspoken savings and 
loan regulator once prompted financier charles h keating jr to 
write kill him dead 
lawyers for the socalled keating five senators didnt go that 
far but they clearly were unhappy with blacks testimony wednesday 
before the senate ethics committee 
black offered the most dramatic and damaging testimony so far in 
the panels hearings into allegations that the senators improperly 
intervened with sampl regulators on behalf of keating a financial 
contributor 
it is the most fundamental smear declared william taylor 
attorney for sen alan cranston dcalif 
black a redbearded senior attorney with the federal 
governments thrift regulatory agency was returning to the witness 
stand today for more crossexamination by the defense lawyers 
after hearing black on wednesday the ethics committee disclosed 
it had voted to grant limited use immunity to compel the testimony 
of james grogan the former top aide and lobbyist for keating 
the panel met in private for two hours today and afterward said 
grogan would produce subpoenaed documents in an executive session 
next wednesday and undergo questioning again on monday dec 17 
the new schedule will extend the schedule of he public hearings 
now in their 13th day and leave the date of their conclusion 
further in doubt 
sen warren rudman rnh the committees vice chairman said 
grogan would be questioned in public after the executive sessions 
the senators under investigation will be questioned in public 
session after grogans appearance rudman said meaning the 
hearings may run until close to christmas 
black in his first day on the witness stand supported earlier 
testimony that the senators pressured regulators to help keatings 
lincoln savings and loan 
and he raised new allegations saying that pressure by the 
senators prompted the federal home loan bank board to delay and 
relax regulatory controls on irvine califbased lincoln which 
subsequently was taken over by the government 
the result black said was greater losses which taxpayers 
eventually must bear than otherwise would have occurred 
this is probably the worst institution in america and 
instead of people trying to help bring it under control five us 
senators were pushing us in the opposite direction he testified 
none of the five senators was present for blacks testimony 
besides cranston they are republican john mccain of arizona and 
democrats dennis deconcini of arizona john glenn of ohio and 
donald riegle of michigan 
keating had targeted black as a problem to be eliminated long 
before 
the ethics committee released copies of a memo keating wrote to 
grogan his lobbyist on july 15 1987 making clear he wanted 
black removed in it keating referred to the thenhouse speaker 
jim wright dtexas as an ally 
the memo began highest priority get black with the last 
two words underlined 
good grief keating wrote if you cant get wright and 
congress to get black kill him dead you ought to retire 
throughout blacks testimony the defense lawyers objected 
paced stammered and complained 
innuendo said james hamilton attorney for deconcini 
reckless and irresponsible 
what this witness testified to are not facts said taylor 
cranstons attorney 
the lawyers tangled with the committees special counsel robert 
s bennett who called black as a witness committee chairman 
heflin settled the dispute in his unruffled drawl saying now 
hes got wide latitude to address the witness 
black said lincoln operated like a ponzi scheme or 
financial pyramid dependent on an everincreasing churning of 
assets 
its parent keatings american continental corp was no more 
than a shell that siphoned dividends from lincoln and 
distributed them through inflated salaries to keating his family 
members and associates black said 
we call it a scam black said i think most people do 
keating the arizona highflier who contributed 13 million to 
the senators campaigns and favored causes is under indictment in 
california 
the cost to taxpayers of paying off lincolns insured deposits 
are estimated at more than 2 billion 
black testified the bank board backed off its tough position on 
lincoln in may 1988 after first taking a hard line on may 5 he 
said a cranston aide carolyn jordan called two senior officers 
at the bank board and indicated severe displeasure 
the board revised its policy black said to let lincoln make 
new speculative investments and expand its sale of junk bonds 
this led to greatly increased losses for the taxpayers he 
said

columbias astronauts today lost 
the only working computer terminal for operating their 150 million 
observatory once again shutting down their stargazing efforts 
in the latest glitch on the problemprone scientific mission 
the flight deck computer overheated and shut down automatically 
this morning the same thing happened sunday with the only other 
similar termimal it has remained off since then 
although the crew smelled something burning each time no smoke 
was reported in the cabin there was no danger to the crew but 
their observing was halted by the second computer shutdown 
the suspension in observations by the three ultraviolet 
telescopes was expected to last until late tonight if not longer 
as nasa scrambled to devise a plan to control the instruments from 
the ground 
we know its going to be difficult said mission scientist 
ted gull but were not giving up 
the telescope lenses were covered for protection as ground 
controllers tried to get either of the problem computer terminals 
working at the same time they quickly developed a plan in which 
the telescopes would be brought back up one at a time 
at least one of the computer terminals is needed for the 
astronauts to operate the astro observatorys three ultraviolet 
telescopes when the computer that crashed sunday was opened today 
its air vents were found to be clogged with lint the astronauts 
said by radio the reason for todays problem with the second 
computer was not immediately determined 
columbias commander vance brand said other computer screens 
unrelated to the malfunctioning ones that guide the ultraviolet 
telescopes still were working well the astronauts manual 
startracking system also appeared to be fine and the crew planned 
to use it with commands sent from the ground while efforts 
continued to restore a computer 
when we first start up were going to be slower than the crew 
simply because we havent trained or practiced it anywhere near the 
way they have said flight director bob castle 
it was the latest setback in a flight that has already been 
plagued by technical problems as a result the crews astronomers 
have missed roughly half the celestial targets they had hoped to 
observe by now 
earlier during intermittent failures of the automatic pointing 
system the astronauts wiggled a videogamelike joystick and used 
a computer keyboard the one that has since malfunctioned to 
position the telescopes manually and got more proficient at aiming 
the observatory nasa said 
nasa said the crew had charted just 45 of 86 intended targets 
through early wednesday updated figures were not immediately 
available but officials were optimistic after wednesdays showing 
mission spokesman al jordan said 
we expect to show an improvement he said 
scientists had planned to begin using the observatory late 
sunday the day the shuttle lifted off 
the schedule for the 10day mission is tight but nasa said the 
crew might be able to make up a few hours viewing time toward the 
end of the flight if things go well 
an xray telescope with its own pointing system was unaffected 
by the computer problems nasa halted xray observations as a 
precaution but planned to resume work later this morning an 
alignment problem was corrected wednesday and the instrument was 
working well today 
about 250 celestial sources of ultraviolet light and xrays were 
supposed to have been studied during the mission such rays which 
are emitted from galaxies quasars and stars cannot penetrate 
earths atmosphere 
the automatic system has been successful in directing the 
telescopes toward a targets general area but has often failed to 
find the specific object when that occurs an astronaut uses the 
joystick and keyboard to guide the system 
mission scientist ted gull could not say when the observatory 
might reach peak efficiency but he was confident that finetuning 
would increase viewing time 
were just learning more and more about how to use the 
spacecraft he said 
successes included observations of a white dwarf star a star 
near the end of its life a galaxy 41 million light years away that 
is believed to contain a black hole ad crab nebula a remnant of 
a supernova that occurred more than 900 years ago 
scientists from johns hopkins university principal investigator 
for one ultraviolet telescope also studied one of their main 
targets a bright quasar 1 billion light years away in the 
constellation virgo for 30 minutes 
astronaut samuel durrance operated the system manually to find 
the quasar the brightest in the sky 
its his steady hand to which we owe our success with this 
one said arthur davidsen of johns hopkins 
the automatic system finds the target very closely but not 
close enough to do a beautiful job thats where the astronaut 
comes in he said 
the crew took some time out wednesday night to sing happy 
birthday to beverly bev brand brands wife and barbara 
hoffman wife of mission specialist jeffrey hoffman 
the mission is scheduled to end with a night landing tuesday it 
had been scheduled for 1986 but was postponed after the challenger 
accident and was delayed six months more this year largely because 
of shuttle hydrogen leaks

trapped on the top floor were rescued by firemen on ldders 
rescuers found one teenage girl uninjured under the planes 
wing and continued to dig for bodies four hours after the 
midmorning crash bologna prosecutor mario forte said he expected 
the death toll to remain at 12 
officials said all the dead were believed to be students many 
of the injured suffered serious burns about 200 students aged 14 
to 18 were in school at the time 
police said the pilot bailed out and the plane crashed minutes 
later into a classroom of the school smashing a 12footwide hole 
in the wall on the second floor 
i saw this plane in flames coming down slowly it seemed to 
level off and then it turned suddenly and crashed into the 
school a witneses told state rai television 
students rushed in panic escape as flames and smoke swept 
through the building witnesses said 
the upper floor was full of flames and students who were

plane coming at us and only had time to say this is crazy 
the plane a macchi 326 trainer came down in casalecchio di 
reno three miles outside of this central italian city and crashed 
into the gaetano salvemini technical high school 
air force gen carlo brandini said the plane was on a mission to 
test radar effectiveness for antiaircraft readiness the aircraft 
took off from villafranca military airport near verona 55 miles 
north of bologna and was scheduled to return there 
the pilot reacted according to regulations the general 
said brandini said the pilot whom he identified as 2nd lt bruno 
viviani hoped to make an emergency landing at bolognas airport 
after the engine trouble developed 
when he saw he couldnt do it he directed the plane toward an 
open area if the plane had cleared the school it would have 
crashed in an area of open fields brandini said from air force 
headquarters in rome 
brandini said the jets only engine had developed some sort of 
problem and caught fire 
the 24yearold pilot suffered fractured vertebrae and was 
questioned by a prosecutor in the hospital the italian news agency

the copilot of a dc9 involved in a 
collision that killed eight people told controllers he thought the 
plane had strayed onto a runway in use but the captain told 
investigators he didnt hear him 
national transportation safety board investigator john lauber 
said wednesday that the dc9 copilot james schifferns radioed 
the detroit airport control tower moments before mondays crash to 
say he thought his taxiing plane had wandered onto an active 
runway the fiery collision when a northwest boeing 727 struck the 
dc9 also injured 24 people 
lauber added that pilot william lovelace reported he didnt hear 
what schifferns said 
had the captain heard that he said i would have headed for 
the weeds meaning he would have turned off the runway 
immediately lauber said 
a control tower supervisor who did hear schifferns shouted 
stop all aircraft stop all aircraft lauber said 
but it was too late to halt the 727 which was on its takeoff 
roll 
ntsb investigators said today they were putting on hold their 
plans to retrace the route that led the dc9 onto the foggy runway 
board spokesman brent bahler said the walkthrough might not 
be needed because a videotape had been made of the runway area 
since the accident using a dc9 to retrace the route would require 
that the runway be shut down and the agency didnt want to disrupt 
airport operations unnecessarily he said 
in mondays collision the 727s right wing clipped the dc9 
tearing off its rear engine and sparking a fire that incinerated 
the dc9 no one aboard the 727 was hurt but toxic fumes from the 
fire killed eight of the 43 people aboard the dc9 
lauber said investigators know the dc9 made two wrong turns in 
the fog as it prepared for takeoff 
the first time the crew missed a turnoff and asked the tower 
for a new taxiing route lauber said 
then lauber said schifferns radioed the tower saying we 
may be on the active runway 
northwest said lovelace 52 of phoenix was making his first 
flight without another pilot observing since his return last week 
from a fiveyear medical leave schifferns 43 of spokane wash 
joined the airline in march 
improved ground radar equipment designed to prevent planes from 
straying onto the wrong runways was on order for the detroit 
airport and 28 others when the crash occurred said federal 
aviation administration spokesman fred farrar 
but farrar said it was not certain whether the new equipment 
which tracks vehicle and aircraft movement on runways would have 
prevented the accident 
lauber said investigators are also examining reports that some 
of the airports runway lights may have been out at the time of the 
accident 
he said a control tower supervisor reported that all lights on 
active runways were working but the 727 crew reported that the 
center lights on their runway were out 
one dc9 survivor milio rinna a 60yearold health and safety 
official for the united steelworkers on wednesday filed the first 
lawsuit over the crash he sued northwest in state court for at 
least 10000 
rinna was treated at a hospital for injuries to his hands head 
and knees and was released said his lawyer william l martens

the leader of the usbacked unita rebels 
says he would sign a ceasefire in the 15yearold civil war if 
angolas ruling party approved a multiparty system at its current 
congress 
but rebel leader jonas savimbi on wednesday reiterated his call 
for international forces to monitor a ceasefire a condition 
opposed by the sovietbacked angolan government 
if they the government approve the multiparty system 
nowwhat we do is sign a ceasefire savimbi told a news 
conference in the countrys extreme southeast corner headquarters 
for his national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita 
in luanda more than 600 miles to the northwest president jose 
eduardo dos santos ruling party the popular movement for the 
liberation of angola suspended its weeklong congress wednesday 
the congress was expected to debate constitutional amendments to 
convert the oneparty state to a multiparty system officials 
blamed printing problems that delayed distribution of documents 
but observers said party hardliners opposed to the reforms may 
have caused the suspension 
dos santos opened the gathering tuesday by calling for political 
and economic reforms saying hanging on to its marxist ideals would 
be rowing against the tide 
he predicted the partys 15year political monopoly would end 
and said resolving the civil war was essential to restoring 
economic growth in the southwest african nation 
angola is a potentially wealthy nation with substantial oil 
deposits and diamonds but the civil war that began after angola 
gained independence from portugal in 1975 has killed more than 
300000 people and devastated the economy 
despite the end of the cold war the united states and the 
soviets still provide assistance to the competing factions the 
united states is giving unita 60 million in aid this year 
the government controls luanda the capital and other cities in 
the north and central parts of the country unita claims control 
over much of the southeast 
the government and unita have held five rounds of peace talks 
this year with a sixth round scheduled for late january in 
portugal 
progress toward a ceasefire has been reported but there have 
been snags over recognition of unita as a political party the 
mechanics of a ceasefire and integrating the two armies 
the government rejects recognizing unita before a ceasefire it 
also has rejected any international peacekeeping force to monitor a 
ceasefire as a violation of angolan sovereignty 
savimbi called on the government to carry out the proposed 
change to a multiparty system then from there there will be no 
need to say recognize unita or not he said 
savimbi continued to call for an international force to monitor 
any ceasefire similar to the un force deployed in namibia to 
oversee a ceasefire and elections 
namibia gained independence from south africa in march under an 
agreement reached by angola cuba and south africa with backing 
from the united states and the soviet union the agreement also 
called for cubas 50000 troops supporting the angolan government 
to withdraw by july 1991 at least 35000 have left so far 
a similar un force would give unita guarantees of protection 
during the transition to a multiparty system and free elections 
savimbi said it also could provide stability when the rebel and 
government armies merged under an elected government he said 
savimbi also called for just fair and verifiable elections 
within a year after a ceasefire the government has said it would 
take three years to set up voting

having done so del cid told the judge what i was doing was 
following orders of a superior officer 
del cid acknowledged making at least three separate cash 
transactions for noriega he admitted to the governments 
contention that he gave noriega 100000 in cash from drug pilot 
floyd carlton caceres in november 1982 he also delivered an 
envelope with 150000 cash from carlton nd later picked up a 
suitcase stuffed with cash all of which was delivered to noriega 
among the admissions by del cid was agreement with government 
claims that he accompanied noriega to a meeting with fidel castro 
in cuba in the summer of 1984 to discuss the seizure of a drug 
cartel lab they had paid the panamanian leader to protect 
del cids plea negotiations stalled in march because of his fear 
that following a us sentence panama would demand his return for 
criminal prosecution the plea agreement was signed wednesday 
the department of justice has now agreed to oppose deporting 
or extraditing my client defense attorney sam burstyn said 
del cid was an aide to noriega at the time of their capture 
following the us invasion in 1989 prosecutors have charged he 
acted as a liaison and money courier between drug traffickers and 
noriega 
del cid who faced up to 70 years in prison could be free under 
the agreement after serving as little as two years burstyn said 
no sentencing date was set at todays hearing 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
released a statement that said that del cids the admission of 
guilt today is significant we will carefully consider any 
cooperation and truthful testimony before making a recommendation 
regarding sentencing to the court the statement said 
the defendants testimony could back up that of government 
witness floyd carlton caceres a former drug pilot who served 4 
years in prison 
del cid is accused of accepting 200000 in cocaine profits from 
carlton who prosecutors said had cut a deal with noriega at a 
meeting in 1983 to pay the money in exchange for panamanian 
protection of a usbound drug shipment 
the government has said that the money was then passed on to 
noriega 
a noriega attorney professed little concern about del cids 
possible testimony 
hes just another witness who is getting paid for his 
testimony said jon may del cid is just one among many 
witnesses who are getting the keys to the jailhouse door from a 
government thats desperate to shore up its case 
the defense previously disputed prosecution claims that del cid 
was a key aide to noriega forcing the us attorneys office to 
acknowledge he was not head of panamanian intelligence as they 
first asserted 
noriega is accused of taking 46 million in bribes to ship 
cocaine through panama

several governments quickly welcomed iraqi 
president saddam husseins announcement today that he intends to 
release all foreigners detained in his country and kuwait 
however governments were waiting for confirmation and details 
of how the release would be organized 
we greatly welcome this news we have been pressing throughout 
for the return of all our hostages the sooner they are back the 
better said a spokesman for the british foreign office 
irish foreign affairs minister gerry collins said in dublin that 
he was very pleased by the report but we are somewhat cautious 
and will be so until such time as the news is confirmed 
there are nearly 1200 britons held in iraq and kuwait and 
about 250 irish citizens 
a spokesman at the kuwaiti embassy in london said lets hope 
this is a prelude to him saddam leaving kuwait altogether 
denmarks foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen commented 
the decision underscores how crucial it has been to seek a 
united solution on the detained foreigners by means of 
international solidarity and efforts within the un framework 
we must now hope that the coming diplomatic efforts lead to 
saddam husseins unconditional withdrawal of his troops out of 
kuwait ellemannjensen said sixteen danish hostages remain in 
iraq 
swiss foreign minister andrea reichlin said the government was 
reacting cautiously to the news switzerland has seven citizens 
detained in iraq 
at the united nations in new york secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar was also cautiously optimistic 
if all the information is confirmed it will be a very good 
development but i always need the proper official information 
about it he said but the un chief said iraq had not contacted 
him about the hostages 
in belgium the north atlantic treaty organization termed 
saddams call for the release of all foreign hostages very good 
news but stressed iraq must abide by all other united nations 
demands 
if he saddam really does what he says he is going to do it 
will be very good news said a nato official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
at the headquarters of the gulf support group in london 
spokesman andy charles said the relatives of the hostages were 
cautiously optimistic and cautiously delighted but weve had a 
lot of similar announcemnts in the past which have not borne 
fruit 
some relatives however were more excited 
im over the moon its what weve prayed and prayed for 
said sue dorrington whose husband david is being held in 
baghdad 
i have been in tears all morning since i heard the news i 
just hope it is true said linda grant part of a group of 30 
women related to british airways employees who planned to go to

thursday to hold a final rally in the bitter campaign for control 
of yugoslavias largest republic 
opposition leader vuk draskovic a candidate in sundays 
election for the serbian presidency charged that a supporter of 
his serbian renewal movement had been shot and killed by a rival 
communist the charge further escalated tensions in the republic 
the crowd of 15000 to 20000 people chanted down with red 
bandits and down with red fascists after draskovic announced 
the death of slobodan ivanovic 30 in the southern serbian town of 
vranje late wednesday 
sundays election in serbia and in the republic of montenegro is 
considered the crucial last act in a decadelong struggle for 
control of yugoslavias future following the death in 1980 of josip 
broz tito who governed with an iron hand for 35 years 
the leaders of yugoslavias diverse regions have waged an 
increasingly bitter battle since titos death with tensions now so

18 months and civil war could break out 
the serbian election the republics first free vote in 50 
yearspits the ruling hardl in

slovenia on the countrys future 
draskovic on the other hand has said he would negotiate with 
the devil if it benefits serbia

the bush administration today renewed its 
opposition to a mideast peace conference as the idea surfaced anew 
in the united nations president bush said there is no linkage 
between an iraqi pullout from kuwait and israeli withdrawal from 
palestinian territories 
the united states will not give saddam hussein some 
facesaving way out of something he shouldnt have gotten into in 
the first place bush told a news conference in santiago chile 
the question is the aggression against kuwait there will be 
and is no linkage to the palestinian or the west bank question 
he said 
with backing from the palestine liberation organization and arab 
governments a group of neutral nations has been trying to persuade 
the un security council to approve a resolution calling for a 
peace conference that would discuss israels occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the united states has sought in the past to resolve palestinian 
demands for national rights and to end israels occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip captured in the 1967 mideast war bush 
said and we continue to be very interested in moving forward 
the search for a solution he added 
but he said saddam has tried from the start to justify his 
invasion of kuwait by saying it would lead to a solution for the 
palestinians 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the house foreign 
affairs committee that us policy on te question of an 
international conference has not changed 
weve taken the position for a long time that an international 
conference properly structured at an appropriate time might be 
useful that has been the policy of the united states for a long 
time we are not now recommending that an international conference 
on the arabisraeli conflict be held baker said 
he added nor are we supporting a resolution in the security 
council that would seek to convene such a conference precisely 
because of our consistent position that we will not link the gulf 
crisis and the arabisraeli dispute this is certainly not an 
appropriate time for an international conference 
diplomatic sources said us diplomats in new york were trying 
at this point to modify the proposed text to make the call for a 
peace conference more a longrange goal than an immediate demand 
we are against an international conference said avi pazner 
spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir we favor 
facetoface negotiations with the arabs peace with egypt did not 
come as a result of an international conference we hope there will 
be no such resolution 
pazner was in washington preparing for a visit next week by 
shamir the prime minister will meet with president bush vice 
president dan quayle secretary of defense dick cheney secretary 
of state james a baker iii and key members of congress 
as the bush administration seeks to maintain arab support 
against iraqi president saddam hussein supporters of the 
palestinians have seized the occasion to promote a peace conference 
and other measures designed to force concessions from israel 
although bush and baker have said they would not link their 
campaign to force iraq out of kuwait with the palestinian issue 
baker said last week the problem must be addressed he also said he 
had made no commitments in exchange for support of the resolution 
approved by the security council last thursday to authorize force 
if iraq does not withdraw its troops voluntarily by jan 15 
shamir intends to stand by his proposal that palestinians on the 
west bank and gaza vote to choose leaders who would negotiate with 
israel five years of limited selfrule pazner said 
it was approved by the bush administration earlier this year 
but when baker added provisions to permit palestinians expelled 
from the territories to participate in the negotiations the 
israeli cabinet refused to go along 
pazner said shamirs visit to washington was initiated by the 
president the israeli spokesman described relations between the 
two countries as good 
bush and baker have excluded israel from the diverse coalition 
they organized in an attempt to force iraq out of kuwait pazner 
said israel has no objections to that arrangement 
part of the decisionmaking process and our policy 
is very clear we want to stay out of it he said

amid a spate of bombing incidents carried 
out by leftist guerrillas president bush arrived here today and 
hailed chiles democratic renaissance and progrowth economic 
policies 
the bombings apparently were designed to dramatize guerrilla 
opposition to bushs call for conservative economic policies 
throughout the hemisphere no injuries were reported 
bush at a news conference after talks with president patricio 
aylwin also pledged to go as far as we can to bring the 
killers of orlando letelier to justice and sought to deflect anger 
over last years ban on chilean grapes in a poison scare 
bush said his enterprise for the americas initiative to spur 
trade with the continent is not going to be an empty slogan and 
will not be thwarted by his own bureaucracy 
here as elsewhere in bushs weeklong goodwill tour of south 
america the latest news from iraq stole the headlines 
bush learned aboard air force one on his flight here from buenos 
aires of saddam husseins change of heart on holding foreign 
hostages 
bush said he hoped it was true but no single hostage should 
have been taken in the first place he said hussein needs to 
get out of kuwait without trying to complicate this matter with 
his call for a middle east peace conference 
before bush arrived leftist guerillas exploded a halfdozen 
bombs overnight at sites with us ties including four mormon 
chapels a new mcdonalds restaurant and a downtown park outside a 
hotel where some officials in bushs advance party were staying 
police reported no injuries 
one dissident scored a bulls eye with an egg on bushs 
limousine splattering it over the door next to the presidential 
seal most of the crowds that lined santiagos streets were 
friendly however 
bush and aylwin faced the press in the small garden outside the 
presidents private home before bush flew by helicopter to the 
pacific port city of valparaiso to address chiles congress in its 
new home 
at the redcarpet welcome for air force one at the airport 
aylwin said mr president we welcome you with joy 
we value your presence in our land we share common ideals 
said aylwin elected last december as chile restored democracy 
after the 17year military rule of gen augusto pinochet 
no where among the nations of this continent has the pace of 
free market reform gone farther faster than right here in chile 
bush said 
chiles return to the ranks of the worlds democracies is 
cause for pride and celebration he said 
bush said these past few days from brasilia to montevideo to 
buenos aires i have witnessed first hand the irresistible power of 
the democratic ideal around the world across the americas a 
democratic renaissance is under way 
letelier a former chilean foreign minister and staunch foe of 
strongman gen augusto pinochet was killed by a bomb on a 
washington street in 1976 along with an american associate ronnie 
moffitt 
a us court indicted three chilean army officers and secret 
police members but the chilean supreme court blocked extradition 
aylwin has promised to reopen the case with a special civilian 
prosecutor and to compensate the families 
bush said i think the president aylwin has moved to get 
that contentious matter cleared up as far as we can we want 
to cooperate fully 
aylwin promised that a full clarification of truth and 
justice will be made 
on the grape embargo imposed after food and drug administration 
inspectors reportedly found two grapes laced with cyanide in the 
hold of a ship in philadelphia chilean growers are demanding 
compensation for losses estimated at 330 million 
bush said he planned to discuss this very sensitive question 
later with aylwin but asked for understanding 
citing the deaths of several people who ingested poisoned 
tylenol in the early 1980s bush said it isnt the chilean grape 
that was singled out this is the way in the united states we 
approach matters that can adversely affect the health of our 
people 
bush arrived at a time when us economic and military ties have 
been restored to normalcy with the removal of sanctions imposed 
during the years of military rule 
on wednesday police used tear gas and water cannons to scatter 
400 demonstrators marching through the streets and chanting 
antibush slogans 
the bush administration prefaced the visit by lifting sanctions 
imposed during the dictatorship of pinochet 
in late november washington allowed chile back into the general 
preferences system which grants tariff concessions to exports from 
various countries 
finance minister alejandro foxley said that should allow chile 
to increase exports to the united states by around 100 million 
from the present 145 billion a year 
the reagan administration excluded chile from the system in 1988 
to protest pinochets repression of the chilean labor movement 
last weekend the administration lifted a ban on military aid 
and the sale of military equipment imposed in 1976 following the 
letelier and moffitt murders 
according to protocol the 75yearold pinochet who is still 
army commander should attend several ceremonies with bush 
but pinochet has long accused the united states of interfering 
in chilean affairs when king juan carlos of spain another strong 
supporter of democratic changes visited chile in october pinochet 
snubbed him by leaving santiago for what were officially described 
as military activities

president hussain muhammad ershad 
resigned thursday after ruling the country for eight years handing 
power to an interim leader chosen by the opposition 
ershad a former army general who took power in a 1982 coup had 
faced seven weeks of often violent nationwide protests against his 
government on tuesday he promised to step down as soon as a 
replacement was named 
earlier thursday ershad lifted the state of emergency in effect 
since nov 27 
later he administered the oath of office to shahabuddin ahmed 
a political independent nominated by the countrys opposition 
parties as caretaker vicepresident then he signed a letter of 
resignation making him acting president 
allah bless you he told shahabuddin after the 15minute 
ceremony in the presidents office you have our blessings i 
want peace to return to society 
originally shahabuddins nomination was to be approved by 
parliament on saturday but ershad unexpectedly dissolved the 
lawmaking body early thursday 
constitutional experts and opposition sources said it had been 
doubtful that a majority of legislators would emerge in public for 
a vote twothirds of parliament belonged to ershads jatiya party 
and many were reluctant to appear in public for fear of being 
attacked by antiershad activists 
shahabuddin 62 chief justice of the supreme court will 
supervise elections to parliament which must be reconstituted 
within 90 days the new body will decide whether to retain power or 
hold presidential elections 
i have no political ambition i shall not stay here beyond the 
mandated 90 days said shahbuddin 62 after he was sworn in 
during this period i shall try to ensure peace and stability 
hold free and fair elections and hand over power to the elected 
representatives of the people 
reporters who attended the transfer of power ceremony said 
ershads eyes were filled with tears as he bade farewell to chiefs 
of the countrys army navy and air force and his personal staff 
army chief lt gen nooruddin khan played a pivotal role in 
persuading ershad to resign according to wellplaced sources he 
acted as a middleman between the president and the opposition after 
junior army officers advised khan they would not support a man 
opposed by the people the sources said 
after thursdays ceremony ershad and khan shook hands and 
embraced ershad then left for his home 
ershad was the army chief when he took power in a bloodless coup 
eight years ago he resigned from the army after winning 
presidential elections in 1986 which the opposition claimed were 
rigged 
charges of vote fraud also dogged the 1986 and 1988 elections to 
parliament which were won by ershads jatiya or peoples party 
the opposition made vote fraud the pivotal point of their protest 
campaign when ershad announced his candidacy for the june 1991 
presidential poll 
ershads resignation capped a dizzying reversal of his political 
fortunes three weeks ago he was confidently predicting success in 
next years presidential elections 
the opposition campaign to oust him had long been little more 
than an irritation during his rule of this impoverished nation of 
107 million people 
but it gained new impetus with the end of longstanding political 
differences between sheik hasina and khaleda zia the opposition 
leaders its growth continued even after ershad declared the state 
of emergency in late november and called out the army to quell 
street protests 
hundreds of doctors professors merchant seamen civil servants 
and some jatiya party members of parliament resigned to back the 
opposition call on monday ershad offered to resign 45 days before 
the next presidential polls the opposition rejected the offer and 
intensified its protest campaign 
then on tuesday night ershad promised to resign immediately 
one of his last acts before resigning was to withdraw the state 
of emergency and restore civil rights the opposition claims that 
at least 100 people were killed by government troops during the 
emergency ershads administration said only six people had died 
the choice of shahabuddin to head the interim government was 
made by ms hasina and mrs zia 
ms hasina leader of the leftofcenter awami league is the 
daughter of sheik mujibur rahman bangladeshs first president 
mrs zia head of the bangladesh nationalist party is the widow 
of another former president ziaur rahman both men were 
assassinated 
ershad is the countrys ninth president since it gained 
independence from pakistan in 1971 all were installed by military 
action

gennady i gerasimov whose statements of 
new thinking in soviet foreign policy made him a familiar 
figure on the world stage has been named communicator of the 
year by a group of american public affairs officials 
gerasimov chief spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry lost 
much of his visibility earlier this year when president mikhail s 
gorbachev named his own presidential spokesman 
the 60yearold former soviet journalist has been replaced by 
vitaly churkin an aide to foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
gerasimov is expected to be named ambassador to portugal 
the national association of government communicators whose 
members include public affairs employees of federal state and 
local governments in the united states will present its annual 
award friday 
the groups announcement said the selection of gerasimov marks 
the first time the organization has selected a foreign 
communicator 
it would have been unthinkable to consider a soviet official 
as recipient of this award just a few short years ago the 
announcement said 
previous winners have been onetime state department spokesman 
bernard kalb former us surgeon general c everett koop and voice 
of america beijing correspondent al pessin who covered the 1989 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square 
as the kremlin emerged from its hostile secretive stance in the 
latter 1980s gerasimov rose to prominence as a spokesman for the 
new leadership his frequent press briefings fluent english and 
acerbic wit made him an oftcited source in news stories about 
developments in the soviet union 
he was criticized however for his inability to manage the 
exploding public affairs operation of the soviet government as 
gorbachev captured the world stage

lewis greene flecks of blood clinging to his 
glasses still looked a little dazed as he watched workers hose 
down the rhinoceros house at the audubon zoo 
greene had just lost if not a loved one a longtime 
companion jessie a 32yearold african white rhinoceros died as 
veterinarians removed part of her horn in hopes the operation would 
enable them to breed her before she was too old 
both of our males have very small horns and both females have 
large horns we think that prevented them from mating the females 
with larger horns would spar with the males and were able to keep 
them away said greene the zoo keeper in charge of rhinos 
other zoos that have had the problem have had good luck 
reducing the females horn greene said putting them on equal 
footing so to speak 
because rhinoceroses in the wild are disappearing zoos are 
trying to breed those they have in accordance with an international 
species survival plan 
all of the five surviving species are endangered because of 
habitat destruction and illegal hunting especially for their 
horns said curt burnette audubons general curator 
the horns made of matted hair are considered an aphrodisiac in 
the far east where they sell for as much as 18000 a pound 
their situation in the wild is from bad to critical 
burnette said of the five species the white is the most 
plentiful there are probably several thousand of them the 
sumatran rhino probably numbers in the dozens in 10 years i doubt 
there will be any rhinos existing in the wild 
jessies biological clock was ticking away and officials hoped 
to breed her before it was too late since the four rhinoceroses at 
audubon were all caught in the wild adding their genes to the 
genetic pool of captured rhinos would improve the longterm chances 
of the species surviving greene said 
short term there will be rhinos in zoos but longterm their 
survival even there could be in jeopardy if only 20 percent of 
the captive rhinos breed as the years go by therell be fewer and 
fewer that can reproduce greene said 
the operation to reduce jessies horn was considered safe 
burnette said the animal had been anesthetized previously without 
difficulty he said 
it was low risk and we were willing to take a small risk 
because we have to burnette said her genes werent crucial 
but they were important since she was captured in the wild the 
offspring would be new to the captive breeding stock 
after the horn was trimmed the four veterinarians were doing 
some blood tests and an ultrasound test on the animals 
reproductive organs when she stopped breathing burnette said 
a 12hour necropsy was done to determine what caused the rhino 
to die burnette said it might take weeks before results were 
known 
jessie still might contribute to the overall genetic pool 
burnette said veterinarians harvested unfertilized eggs which 
will be frozen in hopes of fertilizing them and implanting them in 
another rhinoceros 
thats just a hope at this time burnette said the 
technique hasnt been perfected its kind of like having your body 
frozen when you die and hope theyll be able to bring you back 
later but when something is so close to disappearing you take 
every chance you can to prevent that

potential jurors in elizabeth taylors legal 
battle with an exboyfriend over dollars and scents were asked 
about alcoholism aids and what type of perfume they wear 
miss taylors former beau henry wynberg is suing the actress 
for a share of the profits from her perfume passion claiming she 
breached a contract with him to market the fragrance 
during jury selection wednesday in superior court two potential 
jurors disclosed they splash on passion but said it wouldnt affect 
their objectivity 
today two potential jurors said they had never seen the academy 
awardwinning actress on film a third said he had seen most of her 
films since he had been going to movies since the silent film era 
miss taylor reacted with a mock expression of horror then laughed 
along with others in the courtroom 
wynberg a former usedcar salesman who courted miss taylor 
between her two marriages to richard burton claims he created the 
fragrance 
miss taylor signed a contract with wynberg in 1975 but in 1986 
struck a deal instead with chesebroughponds inc the company that 
ultimately launched passion 
wynberg then sued for 72 percent of the some 70 million a year 
passion generates in profit he also argued that her alcoholism and 
weight gain destroyed the glamorous image he counted on to market 
the cosmetics 
miss taylor contended that wynbergs criminal record led her to 
abandon their business deal and on wednesday she won permission 
from judge coleman swart to tell jurors about her former 
boyfriends criminal past 
wynbergs attorneys had tried to bar as irrelevant and 
prejudicial evidence that he once pleaded guilty to statutory 
rape providing drugs to underage girls in return for sex and 
taking pornographic photos of girls 
miss taylors attorney neil papapiano asked the 50 prospective 
jurors whether they knew alcoholics and had any views about 
rehabilitation programs most said they knew alcoholics and 
approved of efforts to help them 
it has been fairly well publicized that miss taylor at one 
time had an alcohol abuse problem and went to the betty ford clinic 
and since that time has had no problem papiano said 
the lawyer also also asked potential jurors if they knew about 
miss taylors work for aids research and how they felt about it he 
said a percentage of her perfume profits go toward aids research

president bush today welcomed saddam 
husseins dramatic promise to free american and other hostages but 
insisted the man must leave kuwait without reservation without 
condition before the gulf crisis can end 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said the 
united states had received official notification in baghdad that 
the hostages 900 americans among them would be set free it was 
unclear when 
the state department in a message for broadcast by the voice of 
america advised us citizens in iraq and kuwait it was making 
preparations for their evacuation as soon as they are permitted to 
leave 
until that time stay where you are stay in touch with the 
us embassy and monitor the voa closely it said we will let 
you know as soon as we have more information 
bush stressed that no deal with saddam was in the works or 
would be considered 
there are no secret negotiations direct or indirect with iraq 
over this question bush said none and there will be none 
he said he hoped the iraqi decision to release the hostages from 
kuwait was credible and stressed no single hostage should 
have been taken in the first place 
iraq invaded and occupied kuwait on aug 2 triggering a crisis 
that involved a sequence of hostagetaking and partial releases 
the americans and thousands others continue to be held as part of 
saddams effort to use hostages as human shields against a possible 
attack 
saddam was quoted today as saying that diplomatic and military 
developments made the hostages unnecessary 
bush is in chile as part of a fivenation swing through latin 
america but his attention was forced back to the gulf crisis with 
word of saddams initiative 
we are not going to get diverted from the full implementation 
of the united nations resolutions in order to give him some face 
saving way out of something he shouldnt have gotten into in the 
first place bush said again rejecting saddams calls to link 
resolution of the current crisis with the arabisraeli conflict 
he doesnt need any face he needs to get out of kuwait 
without trying to complicate this matter it is clear what his 
ploy is and that ploy is not going to be successful 
iraq on wednesday accepted bushs offer to send baker to baghdad 
for a facetoface meeting with saddam in his testimony baker 
also rejected iraqi demands that the talks include discussion of 
other mideast crises 
i will not be negotiating the palestinian question or the 
civil war in lebanon baker said 
bush made that point as well saying there will be and is no 
linkage nor bush said would there be any concessions to iraq 
of the hostage development he said this would be welcome if 
true but it will not change my thinking on his need to comply 100 
percent without conditions to the un resolutions 
i hope it shows that the strategy is working and that saddam 
understands that his hostage policy has incurred the condemnation 
of the whole world bush said 
he tempered his praise for the announcement with harsh criticism 
of saddams hostage taking like baker he said the promised 
release of hostages was far short of what needed to be done to end 
the crisis 
weve got to continue to keep the pressure on bush said 
the release of all hostages would be a very good thing but the 
problem is the aggression against kuwait and the man must leave 
kuwait without reservation without condition 
on capitol hill baker embraced the announcement from baghdad 
but said nothing short of a complete withdrawal from kuwait and 
restoration of its government would end the 4monthold standoff 
this is a welcome and significant development but we do want 
to see it actually happen baker told the house foreign affairs 
committee it seems to me no coincidence that this comes just 
one week just one week after the international community has 
authorized the use of force 
the initial administration reaction to the hostage announcement 
came from spokesman marlin fitzwater who said if its true 
well do what is necessary to get our people out 
baker said anew that bush hopes for a peaceful solution and has 
not decided whether to use force immediately should saddam ignore a 
united nations resolution demanding that iraq withdraw from kuwait 
by jan 15 
but he gave yet another pessimistic administration account on 
the impact sanctions have had against iraq over the past four 
months and said waiting too long was not in the united states 
interest 
at some point delay carries a very high price for all of us 
said baker including higher casualties among the usled forces 
in the event of war should iraq be given much more time to fortify 
its positions in kuwait 
he has to be stopped peacefully if possible but if necessary 
by force baker said a willingness to use force against iraq 
remains essential 
baker was following defense secretary richard cheney and gen 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in a weeklong 
administration effort to silence congressional critics of bushs 
gulf policy 
let the united states speak with one voice baker said 
during one of several animated exchanges with lawmakers 
bakers won support from one liberal democrat on the panel rep 
stephen solarz of new york who said it must be made clear that 
unless he withdraws a war will be inevitable and unless he 
withdraws he and his military machine will be destroyed 
baker is to go to baghdad after tariq aziz the iraqi foreign 
minister comes to washington for talks with bush

the families of about 900 american hostages held in kuwait and 
iraq awoke today to the promise of an end to the frustration and 
fear that have haunted them since saddam hussein sparked the 
persian gulf crisis four months ago 
there were times i couldnt eat i couldnt sleep said 
doris whatley of shreveport la all of a sudden i am a changed 
person because my husband is coming home 
mrs whatleys husband is an oil worker among about 90 of the 
americans who are being used as human shields at strategic 
sites he called from baghdad this morning to share in his wifes 
elation but for the friends and relatives of other hostages it was 
a time of restraint 
well celebrate when we see them coming out and not before at 
my age you learn to have a little equanimity about these things 
said margaret williams whose son and daughterinlaw were working 
in kuwait when saddams troops invaded aug 2 
the couples daughter jennifer williams was among a group of 
about 20 americans who against state department recommendations 
traveled this week to baghdad to seek their loved ones release 
you cant give up hope theres always hope mrs williams 
said this morning from her home in germantown tenn but this 
could well be just another one of saddams catandmouse games 
saddam called for the release of all foreign hostages in a 
directive to the iraqi parliament a decision he said was prompted 
by recent diplomatic moves that may include president bushs 
proposal for direct usiraqi talks 
the directive which did not say when the captives would be 
freed followed saddams previous offer to release all hostages 
over a threemonth period beginning christmas day if nothing 
mars the atmosphere of peae 
so far weve heard a lot of rhetoric doubletalk and 
halftruths said david mcdonald jr whose old friend and client 
is among the americans who have been hiding in kuwait but this 
seems like the first serious break 
bonnie anderton of larkspur colo whose husband has been holed 
up at the us embassy in kuwait agreed saddams directive was a 
potential turning point in the persian gulf crisis 
but saddam has a habit of putting real nasty catches on 
things said mrs anderton who was among the wives and children 
released several weeks after the invasion occurred it looks 
good but we still need more details 
still families could not help but cheer the longawaited 
earlymorning news around the country relatives stayed home from 
work to follow the story and celebrate the first glimmer of hope 
theyd seen in weeks 
its an answer to our prayers we have been praying him home 
for christmas and it looks like our answer is coming said 
rande vallekoop whose husband has been stranded at the us 
embassy in baghdad 
i feel freed too but none of us are ever going to be the 
same she said this morning from minneapolis there will be 
emotional and mental stuff in becoming a family again 
im sure it will take some time mrs vallekoop said but 
i dont mind that at all not one bit

a senior energy department official accused 
japan on thursday of hoarding crude oil in the months after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait despite agreement among most consuming nations 
to draw down stockpiles and ease supply problems 
linda stuntz an energy department deputy under secretary for 
policy and planning said she expects the issue to be raised next 
week at a meeting of the governing board of the international 
energy agency 
the parisbased agency is responsible for coordinating responses 
by oil consuming nations in an oil supply emergency 
if everybody in the world did what japan is doing we would 
have a much more serious problem than we do prices would be a lot 
higher said ms stuntz in remarks to a group of reporters 
she later said in an interview that she did not want to 
overstate the concern but added that japans actions raise 
questions about the success of future cooperative activities among 
consuming nations in response to oil supply shocks 
ms stuntz said that in the months after the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait last august us oil companies and most companies in europe 
drew down crude oil stocks in order to keep supplies adequate 
without having to dramatically increase imports 
but she said the japanese rather than drawing down crude oil 
stocks after the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti oil elected instead to 
continue importing at high levels and in fact increased imports 
to meet additional demand 
that is stockpiling she said something the united states 
and other consuming nations had sought to prevent to ease the 
immediate shock of losing 43 million barrels of oil a day as a 
result of the iraqkuwait crisis 
ms stuntz said that despite increasing consumer demand us 
imports were 12 percent lower in september and 25 percent lower in 
october than they were last july before the iraqi invasion 
because us refineries were relying on existing stocks 
in october japan imported 33 percent more oil than it did in 
july she said 
what does this mean for future cooperative activities she 
asked

president bush on thursday welcomed 
iraqs surprise promise to free all foreign hostages but said the 
united states must not relax its war footing in the persian gulf 
weve got to continue to keep the pressure on he said 
iraq officially notified the united states that all 900 
americans held in iraq and kuwait would be released secretary of 
state james a baker iii disclosed in washington it was unclear 
when but americans in the area were told to be ready 
the state department said the voice of america was broadcasting 
a message thursday night saying we are making preparations to 
evacuate all us citizens as soon as they are permitted to 
leave 
bush citing the promised release of the hostages and the easing 
of iraqs pressure on the american embassy in kuwait said it 
seems to be a little movement here a little movement there 
yet he said saddam hussein still must leave kuwait without 
reservation without condition 
bush spoke at a news conference at the nexttolast stop of his 
fivenation south american tour while baker 5000 miles away 
testified before congress to win support for a possible military 
strike against iraqi forces 
baker said of saddams announcement it seems to me no 
coincidence that this comes just one week just one week after the 
international community has authorized the use of force 
yet the dramatic move if carried out could well strengthen 
demands in congress that bush allow more time for sanctions to work 
before resorting to force 
facing baker at a house foreign affairs committee hearing rep 
lee hamilton dind asked why should we not wait for this 
policy of sanctions diplomacy and putting in place a credible 
military force to work 
what is working baker responded is that we are beginning 
finally to get the clear message across to saddam hussein if 
we want a peaceful solution it should be crystal clear to them 
that force is not going to be ruled out as an option 
bush promised there would not be any secret deal with saddam to 
end the persian gulf crisis 
there are no secret negotiations direct or indirect with iraq 
over this question bush said none and there will be none 
bush dismissed proposals circulating at the united nations for a 
middle east peace conference renewing his rejection of saddams 
attempt to link resolution of the crisis with the arabisraeli 
conflict 
we are not going to get diverted from the full implementation 
of the united nations resolutions in order to give him some 
facesaving way out of something he shouldnt have gotten into in 
the first place bush said 
i dont care about saving face he doesnt need any face he 
needs to get out of kuwait without trying to complicate this matter 
by talking about some middle east peace settlement or peace 
conference 
it is clear what his ploy is bush said and that ploy is 
not going to be successful 
the news of saddams pledge to release the hostages reached bush 
on air force one during a bumpy flight over the andes from 
argentina to chile on his salutetodemocracy tour on friday he 
will fly to caracas venezuela for an overnight visit before 
returning to washington 
release of the hostages has been a key demand of the united 
states and the global coalition against iraq along with the 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait the restoration of the 
exiled emir and a guarantee of security in the gulf 
at a joint news conference with chilean president patricio 
aylwin bush said he hoped the iraqi decision to release the 
hostages could be believed some of the foreigners are being held 
as shields to prevent attack against strategic targets 
no single hostage should have been taken in the first place 
and i hope that it shows that the strategy is working and that 
saddam understands that his hostage policy has incurred the 
condemnation of the whole world the president said 
and weve got to continue to keep the pressure on said 
bush who has authorized the deployment of more than 400000 
americans to the gulf 
the pentagon said thursday that iraq had moved an additional 
30000 troops into kuwait and southern iraq and that 10000 us 
reinforcements had arrived in the persian gulf 
there are now more than 480000 iraqi troops in the region and 
more than 250000 american troops including at least 130000 us 
army soldiers in saudi arabia 
bush said his planned meeting with iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz and a meeting between baker and saddam would not be 
negotiating sessions in which concessions might be offered to iraq 
what i want to do is be sure by going this last extra step 
for peace that the iraqis know from me and aziz knows from me and 
saddam hussein knows directly from the secretary of state what is 
at stake in this matter and how supportive the united states is of 
the consolidated un position bush said and thats what its 
about 
on capitol hill baker also rejected iraqi demands that the 
talks include discussion of other mideast issues 
i will not be negotiating the palestinian question or the 
civil war in lebanon baker said 
baker said anew that bush hopes for a peaceful solution and has 
not decided whether to use force immediately should saddam ignore a 
united nations resolution demanding that iraq withdraw from kuwait 
by jan 15

the head of the federal communications 
commission announced on thursday an endeavor to squeeze future 
technologies such as highdefinition tv personal phones and 
digital radio onto the nations crowded airwaves 
fcc chairman alfred sikes noting that congress and his agency 
are making decisions today that will affect american lifestyles and 
economic competitiveness well into the 21st century said the fcc 
will initiate a search next year for frequencies to satisfy the 
voracious appetites of new radiobased technologies 
my ultimate goal will be to create a new spectrum reserve for 
emerging technologies sikes said in what was good news for a 
host of wouldbe broadcasters and telecommunications companies that 
are waging a fierce battle for wave space 
but in a bit of bad news for existing licensees sikes warned 
that locating spectrum to accommodate new technologies could not be 
done without some pain to incumbents 
if we are to have sufficient spectrum to meet projected new 
technology needs some of the incumbents will have to find new 
homes sikes said in a speech to the practicing law institute 
he added however that the legitimate needs of incumbents must 
be considered and that any comprehensive program will have to be 
implemented over a period of years 
new technologies such as hdtv and pocketsized goanywhere 
telephones are expected to arrive worldwide by the end of the 
decade and dramatically change todays communications systems 
digital broadcasting is another area of promise in which 
compactdisc quality sound may be available from traditional radio 
stations or from new satellite companies 
these technologies will require a radical overhaul of existing 
transmission and receiving systems creating new jobs and business 
opportunities and are expected to play a crucial role in 
determining the nations economic wellbeing in the next century 
the house this year passed a bill by rep john dingell dmich 
that would force the government to relinquish for private use about 
a third 200 mhz of the radio spectrum that is allocated

new and more spectrumefficient radio technology promises to 
ease the pain somewhat of reallocation of spectrum and 
technological advances also promise the ability for different users

but something will have to give somewhere as sikes noted since 
there is only so much wave space 
the creation of spectrum reserve will not be without costs 
sikes said but the benefits to the public of facilitating new 
communications services will be dramatic 
he noted that in europe and japan important chunks of the 
airwaves already have been set aside for these emerging 
technologies 
we need to do at least as much as our international trading 
partners sikes said 
sikes said the commission also will be looking at how to deal 
with proposals to create new multipleuse technologies such as 
linking satellite and cellular systems together allowing telephone 
companies to provide cable tv service over phone lines or allowing 
cable and mobile communications companies to link up as an 
alternative to private or public phone networks

here are questions and answers dealing 
with the persian gulf crisis excerpted from president bushs news 
conference 
q mr president do you view saddams do you view this 
promise by saddam hussein to release the hostages as credible and 
will it affect the us war footing in the persian gulf 
a one i hope it is credible two no single hostage should 
have been taken in the first place and i hope that shows that the 
strategy is working and that saddam understands that his hostage 
policy has incurred the condemnation of the whole world and weve 
got to continue to keep the pressure on 
and this would be welcomed if true but it will not change my 
thinking on his need to comply 100 percent without condition to the 
un resolutions 
 
q mr president thank you i wonder if youd take te context 
of whats going on since you got the un resolution authorizing 
the use of force you know you made the announcement last week 
that they were resupplying and helping to resupply the us 
embassy now the announcement on the hostages my question mr 
president is whether you believe saddam is serious about defusing 
the tension or if he is playing chess 
a well first i dont consider a couple of cases of pepsicola 
a serious release on our beleaguered embassy in kuwait i hope 
though in response to the broader aspects of your question that 
saddam hussein is getting the message the message so clearly 
stated in the last un resolution and the release of all hostages 
would be a very good thing 
but the problem is the aggression against kuwait and the man 
must leave kuwait without reservation without condition and the 
whole world is united in this and i will not speak for chile but 
i believe the chileans agree with that 
 
q mr president there were reports this morning out of new 
york apparently linking american diplomats to a suggestion that 
the us might go along with a un resolution backing a mideast 
peace conference this was linked with saddams latest statement 
about the hostages since then we understand that secretary baker 
has denied any change in the us position certainly you have said 
there should never be any linkage and youre aware that saddam is 
trying to link them however having said that there is no linkage 
can you offer any hope that the united states might take a 
favorable position toward a mideast peace conference 
a the question is the aggression against kuwait there will be 
and is no linkage to the palestinian or the west bank question and 
to help clarify i would refer people to secretary bakers 
statement today to my comments at a press conference in helsinki 
with mr gorbachev and to what i said at the united nations in my 
speech and i hope that will make clear there is no linkage 
and the united states of course remains interested in a 
solution to that other question but there is no linkage with what 
has to happen in kuwait or what will happen in kuwait 
 
q mr president in making his announcement today saddam 
hussein said he was moved to release these hostages by what he 
called positive diplomatic changes are there any secret 
negotiations backdoor negotiations going on now between the 
iraqis and the us and when you sit down with foreign minister 
aziz will you be laying down the law or will you be offering 
further incentives to encourage iraq to leave kuwait 
a one there are no secret negotiations direct or indirect 
with iraq over this question none and there will be none secret 
negotiations of that nature 
secondly i am not looking for incentive or further incentive 
what i want to do is be sure by going this last extra step for 
peace that the iraqis know from me and aziz knows from me and 
saddam hussein knows directly from the secretary of state what is 
at stake in this matter and how supportive the united states is of 
the consolidated un position and thats what its about 
and i said that before and ill keep repeating it because i 
dont want any people to think there are secret negotiations going 
on or that i on behalf of this worldwide coalition will even 
consider making a concession if you will or you can call it 
incentive if you will that is not what these meetings are about 
 
q mr president id like to come back to johns question about 
a middle east peace conference 
a from the very beginning saddam hussein has tried to justify 
his illegal aggression against iraq basdd on an overall middle east 
problem that involves the west bank and the palestine question and 
we are not going to get diverted from the full implementation of 
the united nations resolutions in order to give him some 
facesaving way out of something he shouldnt have got into in the 
first place 
as you know jim baker has been very active up until quite 
recently in trying to move that whole peace process forward and we 
continue to be very interested in moving the peace process forward 
but it will not be linked in any way with saddam husseins 
aggression i dont care about face he doesnt need any face he 
needs to get out of kuwait without trying to complicate this matter 
by talking about some middle east peace settlement or peace 
conference and it is clear what his ploy is and that ploy is not 
going to be successfulssed on thats the way the companies take 
advantage of changing market conditions 
the oil industry which maintains that prices are set by supply 
and demand says pricing is not such a simple thing 
the american petroleum institute has acknowledged there are 
times when savings have not been passed along promptly to 
consumers but it has also pointed out trends in which crude oil 
prices were rising at the same time the pump price of gasoline was 
falling 
if the price of crude oil goes down and stays down then the 
price of gasoline will undoubtably follow institute spokesman 
gus ensz said its difficult to analyze each and every 
situation because thousands of people are running service 
stations and the people who run those service stations make the 
ultimate decision 
the industry has asserted that all recent probes into petroleum 
pricing have given oil companies a clean bill of health but 
rothschild said a comparison of recent prices shows that consumers 
are paying too much 
from the beginning of november to december theres been a 
20centagallon drop in the spot price of gasoline and yet 
theres been barely any decrease at all in the pump price of 
gasoline rothschild said my suspicion is if anything we 
should now be much more concerned about oil companies ripping 
consumers off 
on the new york mercantile exchange the leading market for 
petroleum contracts wholesale gasoline prices fell below 65 cents 
thursday to the approximate level they were at right before iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and caused a spike in the price of oil 
but the latest nationwide survey by the american automobile 
association found the average price of a gallon of selfserve 
regular unleaded to be 1387 thats 312 cents higher than the 
price on aug 1 and just 1 cent less than aaas highest recorded 
price of 1388 just before the easter holiday in 1981 the aaa 
said when the survey was released tuesday 
gasoline was up 21 cents for the week and aaa pointed out that 
it probably would have fallen a few cents for the week had it not 
been for the imposition of an additional 51cent federal tax 
which took effect saturday 
rothschild agreed that the tax had an impact and that otherwise 
pump prices could be coming down although he insisted any decrease 
will take too long 
early in the latest oil crisis the petroleum industry said 
prices shot up quickly because companies were worried about paying 
higher replacement costs for their overseas supplies the industry 
has also maintained that it showed restraint and never passed on 
the complete cost increase to consumers 
the replacement cost for crude has been steadily falling and 
we have not seen steadily falling prices for gasoline and heating 
oil rothschild said

the secret trust that owns city hall 
is trying to evict about 200 city hall workers because claiming 
the city owes nearly 500000 in back rent on the building 
eviction notices for city hall employees are only the newest 
knot in a tangle of money troubles and lawsuits started when a 
judge decided to give away city hall to settle a damage suit 
the latest development occurred when attorney patrick m young 
filed a lawsuit in st clair circuit court nov 21 saying east st 
louis owes the private trust he represents 447300 in rent unpaid 
from sept 30 through nov 30 
the city says its nonsense 
we dont owe any rent city attorney eric e vickers said 
thursday the city still owns the property 
but vickers has also appealed the ruling by st clair county 
circuit judge roger scrivner that awarded the city hall building to 
walter debow 
debow had been severely beaten in the citys jail several years 
ago and won a 34 million damage award against the city which 
refused to pay 
debow sold the building and two accompanying pieces of property 
to the private trust for less than 200 the identity of the trust 
remains a secret young estimated the value of city hall at 75 
million and the daily rent at 7100 
young was out of his office thursday and could not be reached 
for comment 
vickers said he hadnt seen a copy of the lawsuit but doubted 
it was enforceable he also said he wasnt aware of the city being 
warned that eviction was likely which is customary 
we may try to seek an injunction vickers said i dont 
think anyone will be evicted 
on wednesday vickers filed a countersuit in us district court 
in st louis against police sgt jw cowan and his attorney amiel 
cueto that was a week after cowan sued vickers for 12 million for 
allegedly failing to file a timely appeal of the ruling that gave 
away city hall 
vickers called cowans suit political garbage aimed at mayor 
carl e officer 
i think with the city election coming youve got shots being 
taken at the mayor through me he said i didnt start this 
nonsensical legal warfare but im going to end it 
the city attorney is also seeking 25 million for the damage he 
claims cowans lawsuit did to his reputation

ignorance about female biology still impedes 
the treatment of breast cancer and other diseases of women a panel 
of scientists said thursday 
theres no research on the normal breast said dr susan 
love an author and professor of surgery at harvard therefore 
we dont have a clue when carcinogens are acting 
yet breast cancer will strike one woman in 10 in her lifetime 
and will kill 44000 this year she said 
it is appalling that in 1990 we have little or no information 
on the natural course of the endocrine and tissue changes that 
occur during menopause said barbara sherwin of mcgill 
university 
the two medical expas that medical professionals consider 
closely but also look beyond the biological factors unique to women 
such as the menstrual cycle pregnancy and hormonal differences 
they said professionals also need to gather data on individual 
patients social and economic status as risk factors poverty 
raising children alone and on psychosocial factors such as 
depression occupational stress and the multiple demands on women 
as mothers workers and spouses 
special centers should be established at academic research 
facilities to study the interactions and complexities that have 
an impact on womens health said dr susan blumenthal chief of 
the behavioral medicine program at the national institute of mental 
health 
that women generally live longer than men poses challenges in 
itself noted dr william hazzard chairman of the medical school 
at wake forest university and spokeswoman for the cardiovascular 
panel 
for example he said heart disease accounts for more than a 
quarter of all deaths in women in the united states but women 
suffer heart attacks and heart disease later in life and often 
they must endure their suffering alone while men usually have their 
spouses for support he said 
the growing longevity of women also exacerbates ignorance about 
menopause said sherwin changes brought about by menopause account 
for an estimated 250000 hip fractures a year 
another problem that follows menopause urinary incontinence 
accounts for billions of dollars in costs not to mention the 
human misery that results from the problem she said 
panelists in all four fields also agreed on the need for further 
understanding of hormones especially hormonal therapy because of 
their impact on diseases and treatments 
we desperately and urgently need prospective studies of 
postmenopausal hormones and their effects on cardiovascular 
disease on atherosclerosis breast cancer and endometrial 
cancer said love otherwise women cannot make the decisions 
that they need to make 
it may be worth the small increase in breast cancer to 
eliminate the large number of women dying of heart disease but 
until we know what risks were weighing we cant make those kinds 
of decisons 
the panelists reiterated the criticism raised in recent months 
in congress that women are being excluded from clinical research 
and they noted efforts within the federal national institutes of 
health to monitor research grants to be sure women are included

jesse jackson said thursday he is considering 
suing the federal government on behalf of citizens of the nations 
capital in an effort to gain statehood for the district of 
columbia 
were weighing a lawsuit on this matter said jackson who 
won election in november to an unofficial shadow senate seat 
from which he will lobby congress to grant the district statehood 
we are restricted to paying taxes without representation we 
serve up our sons and daughters in times of war yet we have no 
voting representation in congress that is fundamentally 
undemocratic 
in outlining his lobbying strategy for statehood the twotime 
democratic presidential contender said he will attempt to combine 
litigation lawmaking and mass protest in the fashion used by the 
civil rights movement 
jackson did not provide specifics on the lawsuit 
were still researching this but the whole thing would center 
on the question of taxation without representation said a top 
jackson aide who asked not to be named it might well end up as a 
standard civil rights lawsuit 
jackson aides said they are also trying to learn whether any 
districts or territories have ever sued the federal government to 
gain admission to the union the shadow concept was first used 
by the tennessee territory prior to its admission to the united 
states in 1796 the concept was last used by alaska which in 1959 
became the nations 49th state 
the federal government would be the target of the lawsuit since 
congress governs the admission of states to the union the aide 
said 
another goal of the lawsuit would be to gain jackson the right 
to set up a separate office for statehood purposes if he so 
chooses jackson aides said 
earlier this year the general accounting office concluded that 
shadow congressional delegations could not use either public or 
private funds to acquire office space without congressional 
approval

the vatican restored diplomatic ties with 
bulgaria thursday thus achieving ties with all members of the 
former warsaw pact and formally ending an era in which the church 
and the east bloc were foes 
the former hardline communist nation had been implicated in an 
attempt to kill pope john paul ii 
in a brief statement the vatican said ties between the holy see 
and bulgaria would be at the ambassadorial level 
diplomatic links were broken in 1949 when the communist 
government prevented the vaticans representative from reentering 
the country 
since democratic revolutions swept eastern europe in the past 18 
months ousting communist governments the vatican has also restored 
ties with czechoslovakia hungary romania and pope john paul iis 
native poland 
also this year ties were forged for the first time with the 
soviet union 
the pope has been invited to visit bulgaria he has already made 
a brief trip to czechoslovakia and is to travelt to hungary in 
1991 
relations between the vatican and bulgaria reached a 
particularly low point after the 1981 assassination attempt on pope 
john paul ii 
italian prosecutors said the plot involved bulgarian agents and 
the soviet kgb a rome court however acquitted three bulgarians 
of conspiracy to murder the pontiff citing lack of evidence 
bulgaria denied involvement in the shooting which was carried 
out by a turk 
catholics make up only around 1 percent of bulgarias population 
of about 9 million 
under bulgarias previous communist government freedom of 
religion was guaranteed by law however most bulgarian christians 
were at least nominal members of the bulgarian orthodox church 
which avoided antagonizing authority 
the country has a large moslem minority but many discontinued 
practice of their religion under pressure from the communist 
government

homicide the leading cause of death among young 
black males has increased by twothirds among that group in four 
years researchers with the national centers for disease control 
reported thursday 
nationwide 2741 black males aged 15 to 24 were homicide 
victims in 1988 cdc epiemiologist dr robert froehlke said 
the killings represent a rate of 1011 for every 100000 black 
males in the age group up 67 percent from the 1984 rate of 606 
the new figures indicate a reversal in a trend that saw 
homicides decrease among young black men in the early 1980s the 
cdc said 
meanwhile rates for females and white males in that age group 
have either stayed essentially the same or in fact decreased a 
little bit froehlke said the disparity between black males 
and other groups has widened even more 
in 1987 the latest year in which complete statistics are 
available young black males homicide rate is some six times 
greater than the rate for all americans aged 1524 among blacks 
the rate was 846 per 100000 compared with 138 per 100000 
froehlke said 
the nations overall homicide rate in 1987 was 85 per 100000 
that year homicides accounted for 42 percent of the deaths of 
black males in that age group 
the cdcs analysis is based on 1987 figures the 1988 
statistics released just last week have not yet been analyzed 
indepth froehlke said 
the homicide problem is getting worse faster for black teenage 
males the cdc said the 1988 homicide rate for black males 1519 
was 768 per 100000 up 99 percent since 1984 the rate for black 
males 2024 was 1272 per 100000 up 53 percent since 1984 
firearm homicides accounted for more than 95 percent of the 
198487 increase in killings of young black males the cdc said 
six areas california florida michigan missouri new york 
and the district of columbia accounted for 51 percent of the 
deaths of young black males in 1987 
those six locations have 29 percent of the nations population 
of black males aged 1524 the cdc said 
in its weekly report the cdc called for more research into ways 
to stop the killings 
research and evaluation efforts have not demonstrated 
effective programmatic approaches to prevent homicide the 
atlantabased agency said

elizabeth taylor pretended she was horrified 
then joined the courtroom in a hearty laugh thursday when a 
prospective juror said hes seen most of the stars silent films 
during the second day of jury selection in her court contest 
with her exbeau henry wynberg a majority of potential panelists 
said they have only vague memories of the 58yearold miss taylor 
as an actress wynberg claims he conceived the actress popular 
perfume passion and hes seeking a hefty share of some 70 million 
a year in profit 
two prospective jurors said they had never seen the academy 
awardwinning actress on film and one associated her with the 
silentfilm era which predates her career 
i go back to the silent movies so ive seen most of her 
films the panelist said when asked if he had ever seen miss 
taylor on the screen 
miss taylor wearing a black dress and a thick gold necklace 
bracelet and earrings reacted with a mock expression of horror 
then laughed along with others 
when jury selection began wednesday miss taylors bout with 
alcoholism was raised as her lawyer probed prospective jurors 
feelings about the actress 
the issue is relevant to her court contest because wynberg 
claims her alcoholism and related weight gain destroyed the 
glamorous image he counted on to market cosmetics under her name 
as miss taylor sat facing jurors attorney neil papiano said 
it has been fairly well publicized that miss taylor at one time 
had an alcohol abuse problem and went to the betty ford clinic and 
since that time has had no problem 
the attorney asked the prospects whether they knew others with 
such problems and had any views about rehabilitation programs most 
said they knew alcoholics and approved of efforts to help them 
miss taylor claims wynbergs criminal record led her to abandon 
their planned business deal and turn to the major cosmetics 
company she won permission to tell jurors about wynbergs 
statutory rape conviction 
the legal dispute pits miss taylor against wynberg a former 
used car salesman who courted her between her two marriages to 
richard burton in the 1970s 
wynberg and miss taylor signed an agreement in burtons presence 
in 1975 for wynberg to market cosmetics under miss taylors name 
she says he breached the contract by doing nothing to fulfill it 
he says she breached it when she agreed to sell passion through 
another company 
during jury questioning papiano asked panelists if they knew 
about miss taylors work for aids research and how they felt about 
it 
i support it said one woman 
i think its a great cause said another 
the attorney explained later that the question was asked because 
evidence will show that a percentage of miss taylors profits from 
passion go to benefit research for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome

the african national congress 
pressed its demand for an interim government thursday in rallies 
that drew 18000 supporters and it threatened to increase pressure 
if its demands are not met 
a steppedup campaign of rallies and other mass action could 
heighten tensions with the government which considers such tactics 
detrimental to the nations stability and delay talks on reform 
in johannesburg anc leader mac maharaj blamed the government 
for the slow pace of talks with black leaders about 40 miles north 
in pretoria winnie mandela and communist party chief joe slovo 
blamed security forces for violence in black townships 
a third march was in bloemfontein 180 miles south of 
johannesburg 
we say to the government stop stalling on negotiations 
maharaj told about 10000 people in downtown johannesburg we 
want an interim government now maharaj said those who have 
presided over the apartheid system must not be allowed to oversee 
change 
president fw de klerk has pledged to end apartheid and 
negotiate a new constitution but he rejects demands for an interim 
government to oversee the changes 
demonstrators demanded the government speed up talks with the 
anc make good on promises to release all political prisoners and 
permit exiles to return and take action to stop black factional 
violence 
mrs mandela the wife of anc deputy president nelson mandela 
said in pretoria that the peace process could be derailed if 
township violence is not stopped 
mrs mandela repeated allegations that security forces have 
sided against anc supporters in township battles a charge the 
government denies since august nearly 1000 people have died in 
johannesburg townships most of the unrest involves backers of the 
anc and its main rival the inkatha freedom party 
the 5000 protesters marched to de klerks offices and handed 
over a letter stating the demands security was tight with 
soldiers in riot gear and police dogs lining the route at one 
point three air force mirage fighter jets flew overhead 
demonstrators in johannesburg marched several blocks to city 
hall and then to a police station with a list of demands the anc 
said if the demands were not met a program of boycotts and rallies 
would be called 
the government has denounced such actions saying activities 
such as marches and strikes lead to violence black leaders accuse 
security forces of causing the violence by interfering in peaceful 
protests 
the demands presented thursday included freedom by christmas of 
all political prisoners an interim government and the integration 
of bophuthatswana into south africa 
bophuthatswana is a black homeland considered independent by the 
south african government but not recognized as such by other 
nations the anc considers the homeland system an attempt by the 
government to perpetuate apartheid by keeping blacks and whites 
apart 
about 3000 people rallied peacefully in bloemfontein 
the anc supporters were joined by members of the closely allied 
south african communist party and ancaligned trade unions 
the johannesburg demonstration was the first mass rally in the 
city since nov 17 when two people died in clashes with police 
after an illegal march no violence was reported thursday and 
police presence was not heavy all three marches had official 
permission

new estimates that the budget deficit is 
soaring past 300 billion will test voters tolerance for federal 
red ink but analysts are divided over whether the record 
shortfalls will blunt congress spending appetite 
the congressional budget office projected thursday that next 
years budget gap will be at least 337 billion the nonpartisan 
budget office blamed the slowing economy and the expensive bailout 
of the nations savings and loans 
that would easily set a record despite the nov 5 enactment of 
a fiveyear package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to 
shrink the deficits by 496 billion in that period 
the record deficit puts one more arrow in the quiver of those 
who would oppose higher spending said carol cox president of 
the committee for a responsible federal budget a bipartisan group 
that studies budget issues there is a political constraint in an 
era of 300 billion deficits when somebody wants to spend even more 
money 
others noted that new budget procedures virtually eliminate the 
current system of acrosstheboard spending cuts if the deficit is 
too high as a result they said large budget gaps may not 
dissuade congress from seeking new spending programs 
with the new system were suddenly being told that the 
deficit is not the real enemy said stanley collender a budget 
analyst for the accounting firm of price waterhouse the last 
decade has shown that the average american doesnt want spending to 
stop 
but collender said that with deficits expected to hit record 
levels for the next few years it was unclear how americans would 
react 
well be really testing the mettle of the american people on 
this stuff collender said if they get riled up a person who 
proposes new spending will at a disadvantage but thats a big if 
we havent seen that before 
cbo director robert reischauer warned the house budget committee 
that with the economy continuing to worsen next years shortfall 
could well be even worse than 337 billion as the economy 
declines the government collects less revenue and spends more for 
unemployment and other programs driving up the deficit 
reischauer told the lawmakers that he expected the economy to 
shrink during the last three months of 1990 and that the same 
thing would probably happen during the first quarter of 1991 if the 
large us troop deployment in the middle east continues but he 
did predict an improving economy beginning in 1992 and a shrinking 
federal deficit 
it looks like a period of weakness followed by a rebound 
he said 
this years budget gap should be 320 billion the cbo said 
fiscal 1991 runs through next sept 30 
the deficit for fiscal 1990 was 220 billion just below the 
record 221 billion shortfall in 1986 
those figures cannot be directly compared with the 320 billion 
projection for next year 
past years deficits included the huge and growing social 
security surplus expected to reach 66 billion this year 
under new budget rules that surplus is no longer included in 
federal deficit calculations the fiscal 1990 budget gap would have 
been 277 billion had the social security surplus not been included 
in the deficit figures 
the new deficit calculations also do not include the costs of 
operation desert shield which will be counted separately 
reischauer said us operations in the persian gulf this year will 
probably cost 12 billion if fighting does not break out he had no 
figures on the costs if war erupts

her car was never mistakenly towed she was 
never charged with someone elses unpaid fines never billed for a 
ticket shed already paid but barbara james has won the 
competition for the citys worst parking nightmare 
youre kidding the 33yearold advertising consultant from 
clifton nj said thursday when informed she had won the 100 
grand prize 
her skepticism was understandable for this is the city where 
the parking nightmare was invented an evergrowing number of 
vehicles and an evershrinking number of parking spaces has created 
a happy hunting ground for quotaburdened ticket agents and tow 
truck crews 
in such an environment mrs james nightmare sounds more like 
an unpleasant daydream but welcome to it 
eight years ago barbara was single living in the city and 
dating bob james who would become her husband he was living in 
new jersey where she refused to go and drove a snazzy sporty 
mustang 
she persuaded bob against his better judgment to drive into 
the city for the last night of the san gennaro festival in little 
italy a cramped old neighborhood 
but bob and barbara found what looked like a parking space just 
two blocks from the festival there were other cars parked on the 
block none were ticketed and a sign said no parking until 6 
pm it was 555 
they asked a policeman standing on the corner if they could park 
there and he said go ahead the couple giddily walked off 
heres the rest of the story according to mrs james we came 
back stuffed with cannoli and almost threw up when we found a 35 
parking ticket on the car issued at 559 not 30 seconds after 
the cop assured us it as ok to park 
bob wrote out a check smeared the ticket with marinara sauce 
and mailed both to the city 
however luckless in parking mrs james does well in contests 
several years ago she won a caribbean cruise by composing a poem of 
25 words or less on the topic what id do for a miller beer 
but she was surprised that her entry won the parking nightmare 
competition which was staged by glenn bolofsky publisher of a 
calendar that charts the days when the citys byzantine 
alternatesideofthestreet parking rules are suspended bolofsky 
said he received more than 200 entries 
there are many local drivers with a better claim on the 100 
and who need it more than mrs james 
michael cutrone who had to pay 8240 in parking tickets even 
though copies of the tickets showed they were not issued to his 
car he paid after the citys parking violations bureau obtained a 
lien on his house 
carlos gonzales whose nissan was seized while he was in church 
because the bureau claimed he owed about 5400 in fines and 
interest but the car to which the tickets were issued was a 
pontiac belonging to another carlos gonzales who had the same 
birthday as the nissan owner 
joann didomenico who paid the same parking ticket twice 20 
on sept 1 1987 and 45 including penalty the following spring 
after the bureau changed computers lost record of her first 
payment and billed her a second time 
none of these unfortunates entered the contest however maybe 
they just want to forget bolofsky mused 
mrs james feels sorry for them but shell take the 100 
shell also take her free copy of the parking calendar even though 
she never drives into new york ive learned my lesson she 
said i take the bus

testing of equipment designed to help 
airliners avoid collisions on runways has uncovered flaws that 
could delay by a year plans to use the radar system at 29 airports 
nationwide the systems maker said 
among those to receive the new ground radar system is detroit 
metropolitan airport where two jets collided on a runway monday 
killing eight people and and injuring another 24 
the system which uses radio waves to relay images of ground 
traffic to the the control tower might have averted mondays 
accident said phil leman an federal aviation administration 
electronic engineer involved in testing 
but a key component in the ground radar system being tested at 
greater pittsburgh international airport is falling apart and must 
be replaced before it can be used said scott brinckerhoff a 
spokesman for the manufacturer norden systems inc of norwalk 
conn 
a reflector in the system antenna atop the airports control 
tower separates from the antennas outer surface when the unit 
spins said brinckerhoff 
norden plans to replace the antenna before testing continues he 
said 
the problems with the antenna and software have delayed use of 
the socalled airport surface detection equipment 3 at pittsburgh 
and installation of similar systems at 28 other airports 
a new prototype should be in operation by fall 1991 about one 
year later than expected said faa spokesman dick stafford 
norden had wanted to install all systems by july 1992 said 
brinckerhoff it will ask the faa for a oneyear extension he 
said 
of the airports to receive the system 13 have older ground 
radar systems and 16 including those at pittsburgh and detroit 
have no ground radar the faa said

pope john paul ii on thursday voiced support 
for a plan to combat rising antisemitism in eastern europe but 
vatican officials declined appeals by a jewish delegation to 
recognize israel 
a jewish leader seymour reich said two days of talks between 
the jewish delegation and the vatican marked the beginning of a 
new chapter in the catholicjewish relationship 
but he said delegates of the international jewish committee on 
interreligious consultations were somewhat disappointed the 
pope did not go further in his comments 
the vaticans new foreign minister monsignor jeanlouis tauran 
cited the vaticans traditional reasons for not recognizing israel 
including unsettled borders the status of jerusalem and the 
palestinians lack of a homeland 
the pope hailed progress in relations between jews and catholics 
in his speech to the 30member jewish delegation and top vatican 
officials 
in particular he praised a september plan drawn up by jews and 
catholics in prague czechoslovakia for fighting antisemitism in 
eastern europe 
the sixpoint plan included calls for setting up courses for 
priests to counter antijewish sentiment and omiting religiously 
divisive material from textbooks 
the prague meeting also branded antisemitism a sin 
jewish leaders have expressed concern about an upsurge of 
antisemitism in the former communist countries of eastern europe 
including the popes native poland 
the pope praised the prague meeting for coming to conclusions 
that are of great importance for the continuation of our dialogue 
and cooperation it is my hope that these may be widely recognized 
and that the recommendations then formulated will be implemented 
wherever human and religious rights are violated 
besides the popes endorsement for the plan to combat 
antisemitism the jewish delegation had sought the vaticans 
formal recognition of israel 
but reich of great neck ny said they saw no change in the 
vatican position on the jewish state 
reich said the jewish delegates told vatican officials there 
can be no full normalization of relations between the catholic and 
jewish communities until the vatican has full normalization of 
relations with the jewish state 
nevertheless delegates said the onehour papal meeting was 
warm lisa palmieribillig of the antidefamation league quoted 
the pope as reiterating his wish to visit the holy land 
i hope one day to be able to visit the holy sites beginning 
with those of abraham in jerusalem he said according to 
palmieribillig 
that would be our joy replied rabbi david rosen according 
to palmieribillig rosen is a representative of the 
antidefamation league in jerusalem 
the catholicjewish meetings were held to mark the 25th 
anniversary of nostra aetate adopted during the second vatican 
council the document considered a turning point in 
catholicjewish relations withdrew the accusation that the jews 
were responsible for killing christ

in compelling james grogan to testify the 
senate ethics committee is summoning the person who probably knows 
more than anyone but charles h keating jr about keatings 
relationship with five powerful senators 
at the start of thursdays 13th day of hearings the committee 
announced grogan will begin closeddoor testimony on dec 17 
followed by his appearance at an open hearing 
grogan was keatings main liaison with congress hes the man 
who can tie together any relationship between the money keating 
raised for the keating five and their intervention with thrift 
regulators on his behalf 
documents released in the case show that grogan who earlier 
declined to testify on fifth amendment grounds had often arranged 
for keatings political donations and had enlisted the senators 
backing for keatings failing lincoln savings and loan 
in testimony thursday a career counsel for the federal home 
loan bank board william k black said the five senators mounted 
defense after defense after defense of lincoln at a 1987 
meeting when examiners informed them of massive violations at 
keatings thrift 
and the senators did so black said despite use laying out in 
the starkest terms exactly what was wrong and it didnt 
impress them 
but four members of the ethics panel appeared skeptical about 
whether the senators had been as aggressive as portrayed by black 
sen terry sanford dnc accused the witness and his fellow 
regulators of having a siege mentality when they entered the 
meeting with the five lawmakers 
the committee is trying to learn whether the 13 million 
keating raised for the five influenced their conduct the senators 
are dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz donald w 
riegle jr dmich alan cranston dcalif and john glenn 
dohio 
grogan was the corporate counsel for keatings american 
continental corp and vice president of lincoln he undertook 
several activities that could spark the committees interest for 
instance he 
arranged for keatings contributions to three 
voterregistration projects supported by cranston keating donated 
850000 
set in motion a complaint by a cranston aide to regulators 
about a tough enforcement action planned against lincoln in may 
1988 
played a role in arranging two crucial meetings with 
regulators one on april 2 1987 involved all of the five 
senators except riegle the second a week later included all the 
senators 
was told in a memo from keating to try to get black fired for 
his tough stance against lincoln 
in that july 1987 memo keating wrote 
highest priority get black good grief if you cant get 
wright and congress to get black kill him dead you ought to 
retire wright is a reference to former house speaker jim wright 
black testifying thursday repeated his assertion that 
political pressure by the senators caused the bank board to loosen 
its regulatory control on lincoln 
he blamed the senators pressure for the decision by top 
regulators in washington to take san franciscobased regulators off 
the examination of lincoln the examination he said would have 
disclosed phony transactions and a taxsharing scam that sent 
false profits to lincolns parent company 
this is the most likely explanation for this completely 
unprecedented and grossly improper action of halting the 
examination that would have blown all of these thing so wide 
open black said 
the committees vice chairman sen warren rudman rnh 
announced thursday that under a grant of limited immunity grogan 
will be asked to produce key documents wednesday five days before 
his closeddoor testimony 
there could be more private testimony after dec 17 and then 
public testimony by grogan after that the revised schedule will 
delay testimony from the five senators until they hear what grogan 
has to say rudman announced 
seven witnesses including grogan and keating have refused to 
testify on fifth amendment grounds rudman said keating would not 
be offered immunity and is not expected to appear 
documents abound on grogans role in dealing with the senators 
and their aides 
on oct 6 1987 cranston wrote keating i am very grateful 
for your willingness to contribute 250000 this year and have 
asked joy to discuss with jim grogan the states in which you would 
most like to help 
joy is cranston fundraiser joy jacobson the money was for 
voterregistration projects 
in the same letter cranston expressed his pleasure that 
keatings meeting with m danny wall then chairman of the federal 
home loan bank board had gone so well 
on may 6 1988 cranston aide carolyn jordan wrote the senator 
that she had just received a call from grogan who said the board 
had decided to take an enforcement action against lincoln 
including placing an overseer at the institution 
black testified that ms jordan then complained to the 
regulators causing a weakening of the action and eventually 
delaying the takeover 
glenn in his opening statement said grogan who once worked 
for the senator had influenced his attendance at the april 2 1987 
meeting with regulators 
grogan according to glenn had told my staff that lincoln was 
being harassed and was receiving unfair treatment by federal 
banking regulators 
glenn said he then asked his staff for additional evidence of 
unfair treatment a corroboration he said was routine even though 
the staff knew and trusted jim grogan

the state department said thursday former 
president jimmy carter agreed last summer that beleaguered liberian 
president samuel does appeal for carters intervention to halt a 
civil war was unworkable 
carter in a broadcast interview published wednesday said the 
state department asked him not to play peacemaker in the bloody 
liberian civil war and he obeyed 
the former president said doe who was later killed by rebel 
forces appealed to him last summer to come to liberia to negotiate 
a peaceful solution to the civil war 
i called the state department and told them that i had this 
invitation that i thought horrendous bloodshed was going to take 
place in liberia carter said in a recent interview conducted for 
alabama public television after a day or two they called back 
and asked me not to go so i didnt 
david denny a state department spokesman said thursday that 
doe asked the department last june to deliver a letter to carter 
in which doe asked for president carters assistance for holding 
early elections in liberia 
at that time does executive mansion was already under 
siege the spokesman said in a department response to a query 
from the associated press his calls for an election were 
rejected by the other parties us policy was to encourage doe to 
enter into serious negotiations with other political and military 
forces to try to bring about a settlement to the liberian crisis 
denny said carter was briefed by telephone on the situation and 
our view of the essential unworkability of does appeal 
at that time president carter agreed with our approach the 
spokesman reported 
doe a 40yearold master sergeant who had seized power in a 
bloody coup in 1980 was slain in september by a breakaway rebel 
force after being lured to what was billed as a meeting to discuss 
a peaceful settlement of the conflict 
tribal massacres in the wake of the bloody power struggle have 
claimed more than 10000 lives and about half of liberias 23 
million people are estimated to have sought refuge in neighboring 
countries 
carter who was the only american president to visit liberia 
said he now devotes his efforts to waging peace in troubled 
areas of the world he has acted as mediator in two of the african 
continents most intractable wars in ethiopia and the sudan 
he cited the liberian case as an example of his willingness to 
back away from sensitive issues and accept the advice of the state 
department spokesmen for the department declined comment wednesday 
on carters remarks 
carter said he routinely shares his invitations with president 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii whom he described 
as very supportive 
sometimes they request that i not undertake a project where 
ive been invited in and invariably i defer to their request he 
said he did not say who asked him to turn down does request to 
visit liberia which was founded by freed american slaves in 1847

a lawyer for thousands of ptl 
contributors suing to get their money back argued thursday a fraud 
scheme that put jim bakker in prison worked only because he had 
help from his accountants 
tom anderson an attorney for former bakker believers in a 757 
million lawsuit blamed the accounting firm deloitte haskins amp 
sells for his clients troubles 
if deloitte had not aided and abetted we would not be here 
he said 
anderson made the remarks during his closing argument in a 
sixweek civil trial about 145000 people are seeking 
reimbursement for money they paid to stay at heritage usa ptls 
nowdefunct religious theme park in fort mill sc lodging at the 
park entitled donors to be lifetime partners in ptl bakkers 
bankrupt ministry 
bakker 49 is serving a 45year prison sentence on conspiracy 
and mail fraud charges for overselling lifetime partnerships 
the lawsuit said bakker other ptl officials and accountants 
including those of deloitte conspired to set up secret bank 
accounts that were tapped to give huge bonuses to the bakkers and 
ministry officials 
the case could go to the jury friday 
attorneys for bakker and deloitte argued that when it came to 
using donations no harm was intended by the televangelist his 
wife tammy and other ptl officials 
jim bakker did not intentionally wrong his people said his 
lawyer jim toms like all men he was flawed and he made 
mistakes but he gave every ounce of his strength to build his 
dream 
corporate america will be listening to your verdict whatever 
it is anderson said the auditing profession will be 
listening 
jim williams representing deloitte told the jury im not 
representing corporate america 
in his opening argument anderson sought to simplify the case 
which has generated volumes of evidence and brought dozens of 
witnesses to the federal courthouse here 
this is a case in which jim bakker stole from the church this 
is a case in which jim bakker defrauded the lifetime partners and 
he went to jail for this anderson said deloitte knew all 
about the fraud this is a case in which deloitte didnt tell 
anyone 
toms said there was nothing simple about ptl or bakker 
this was not a simple man this was not a simple place he 
said it was not a simple task he was undertaking 
toms described bakker and his ptl followers as people of faith 
and vision 
visionaries may not always be practical but theyre people of 
faith who in their day did great things toms said 
the lawsuit also named the accounting firm of laventhol amp 
horwath as a defendant the firm has since filed for bankruptcy 
protection and last month its attorneys withdrew from the trial 
the other defendants are david taggart bakkers former personal 
aide and aimee cortese a minister from new york who served on 
ptls board of directors in the mid 1980s 
bakker did not testify at the trial mrs bakker was never 
charged 
three othe ptl officials have gone to jail for charges related 
to the case

the government is expected to give american 
women their first new birth control option in three decades when it 
approves a hormonal implant that prevents pregnancy for up to five 
years officials said thursday 
the implant called norplant was expected to win government 
approval within days according to government and industry sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the method involves implanting in a womans upper arm six 
silicone rubber capsules each about the size of an 
inchandahalflong wooden matchstick the procedure is done with 
local anesthesia and the implant isnt noticeable 
the capsules contain a hormone called levonorgestrel a 
synthetic progestin that is released slowly over time 
the contraceptive effects are reversed immediately upon removal 
norplant is one of the most significant advances in 
contraception weve had in the last 30 years since the birth 
control pill and intrauterine device became available said dr 
samuel a pasquale of the robert wood johnson medical school in new 
brunswick nj 
its the most effective reversible method of contraception 
available in the united states with a failure rate of less than 1 
percent said pasquale a principal investigator in the norplant 
studies 
it also would be the first longacting hormonal contraceptive 
available in this country 
its a new choice women have and there havent been any new 
choices in the united states in a long time said c wayne 
bardin vice president and director of medical research for the new 
yorkbased population council which began researching the method 
in 1966 
it offers them a new choice which is longlasting and 
convenient uses the lowest dose of hormone thats used in any 
hormonebased method and it doesnt contain estrogen which can 
cause problems for some women he said 
norplant has been approved in 16 countries the council said 
in the united states it would be marketed by wyethayerst 
laboratories of philadelphia 
the company was reluctant to talk about norplant without formal 
approval from the food and drug administration 
however wyethayerst spokeswoman audrey ashby said that 
assuming the drug is approved soon the contraceptive would be 
available commercially in february the company will train 
physicians on how to implant the capsules but there will be some 
lag time she said 
ashby declined to discuss the cost of norplant saying that 
pricing was being evaluated however she said expected it will 
be priced significantly below oral contraceptives over five 
years 
birth control pills cost about 15 to 20 per month 
bardin said he had been told the price for norplant would be 
200 to 300 which does not include the fee for implanting the 
device 
that cost worries lisa kaeser of the alan guttmacher institute 
a research and education group that deals with reproductive health 
issues 
im not sure its going to be available for lowincome 
women she said 
the contraceptive contains nothing new the silicone rubber and 
the hormone have been used for many years according to the 
councils literature however the delivery over a long period of 
time is a new technique 
an fda advisory board recommended approval of norplant in april 
1989 saying the method was at least as safe and effective as any 
other contraceptive on the market 
the national womens health network has expressed concern about 
the longterm safety of the implant and wants postmarketing 
surveillance to be conducted for 15 years to get more data 
the contraceptive is more than 99 percent effective overall 
meaning that for every 100 women who use norplant for one year at 
most one will become pregnant according to the councils 
literature 
during the first two years the pregnancy rate for women on 
norplant was one per 200 to 300 per year pasquale said in the 
third year however women weighing more than 154 pounds had a 
higher pregnancy rate about five per 100 he said 
its major side effect is menstrual irregularities including 
prolonged periods and spotting between periods about 15 percen of 
women who have the implant have it removed because of bleeding 
bardin said 
its been very popular in other countries bardin said if 
you ask women what they like about it most they say convenience 
norplant seems to be more popular when compared with oral 
contraceptives he said among women who discontinue either after 
less than a year 15 percent stopped using norplant compared with 
50 percent who stopped using the pill he said

deaths from lung cancer are continuing to 
increase faster among women than men said health researchers who 
predict the trend wont slow down until 2013 
the federal centers for disease control said thursday that lung 
cancer incidence and death rates for 1987 sustained a pattern of 
the 1980s increasing steadily for women and fluctuating slightly 
for men 
previous studies have blamed increasing lung cancer rates among 
women on their giving up smoking less readily than men 
cdc researchers estimate that 85 percent of lung cancer cases 
are caused by smoking that excludes cases in nonsmokers caused by 
secondhand smoke said dr ronald aubert a cdc epidemiologist 
the whole passive smoking issue has been recognized more and 
more recently and thats something to take into account he 
said 
the lung cancer death rate in this country rose slightly from 
1980 to 1987 from 425 per 100000 population to 479 the rate 
for males who still suffer the most lung cancer despite the 
increases among women rose by fewer than 5 percentage points 
from 716 to 750 
but the lung cancer death rate for women increased by more than 
onethird in seven years from 209 in 1980 to 282 in 1987 aubert 
said 
similarly lung cancer incidence nationwide increased from a 
rate of 524 in 1980 to 555 in 1986 the latest year available 
for those statistics and increased faster for women than for men 
the increases in lung cancer incidence and death rates among 
women are consistent with historically increasing trends in 
smoking the atlantabased cdc said 
cdc researchers cautioned that because peaks in smoking are 
historically followed by peaks in lung cancer as much as 35 years 
later todays lung cancer increases in women will continue for 
decades 
based on these trends the increases for females are not 
expected to plateau until after the year 2013 the cdc said 
citing a mathmodel projection taking into account smoking 
prevalences and progression of disease 
thats our best guesstimate aubert said i dont think 
its fully understood why you have some more rapid growing cancers 
for some people and not for others 
in general lung cancer death rates in the 1980s have been 
higher for black men than for white men but did not differ 
significantly between white and black women the cdc reported 
surveys have shown that smoking prevalence is higher among black 
men who also tend to smoke brands higher in tar and nicotine the 
cdc said

not long ago margaret thatcher rolled out the red 
carpet at 10 downing st for ronald reagan but on thursday the two 
old and now powerless pals just had a cup of tea at his hotel 
then reagan had to hurry off to downing street to see the prime 
minister john major and mrs thatcher headed back to suburban 
london where she moved last week after her ouster in a governing 
conservative party revolt 
they reminisced about their years together said reagans 
spokesman mark weinberg they have many many memories of their 
years in office and they talked about what it is like to have been 
in office and then return to private life and about current world 
affairs 
reagan on a fourday british visit had been scheduled to see 
mrs thatcher at downing street just like so many previous times 
when their great friendship made the usbritish relationship more 
special than at any time since world war ii 
instead the 65yearold exprime minister showed up at 
claridges hotel in a chauffeurdriven jaguar a dozen passersby 
stopped to clap and wave 
she was a few minutes behind four police escort vehicles but 
they were for someone else a visiting president from one of 
africas tiniest nations dawda jawara of gambia 
when reagans second term was drawing to a close in 1988 mrs 
thatcher laid on a magnificent farewell with motorcades and 
fanfares for a ceremony in the splendid setting of londons ancient 
guildhall 
she hailed him as the president who restored the american dream 
he called her an inspiration to the world 
but when british leaders who have no fixed terms fall it is 
swift with no time for farewells 
so the pair who governed through the 1980s met again with a 
handshake and a kiss before a clutch of photographers outside the 
hotels second floor royal suite reagan his wife nancy and mrs 
thatcher then headed in for tea 
reagan lauded mrs thatcher the fellow conservative who stood 
with him in the days of cold war saying i salute you 
at downing street reagan arrived just as visting israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir was leaving and he came out with major 
when the new british leader spoke to reporters to welcome iraqs 
decision to release western hostages 
a downing street spokeswoman said reagan and major spent about 
45 minutes together it was extremely amiable she said 
earlier the 79yearold former president and his wife made the 
royal rounds lunching with queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace 
after a meeting with the queen mother at nearby clarence house 
the queen who gave reagan an honorary knighthood in 1989 came 
out to meet him apologizing that her husband prince philip had 
been delayed by fog on his way home from australia 
the reagans are due to return to los angeles on saturday

nine paintings that vanished in a brazen 1985 
theft including the monet masterpiece that gave impressionism its 
name returned to paris on thursday after police found them in a 
corsican villa 
police said recovery resulted in part from information gathered 
from gangsters in japan 
its the best christmas present we could have said arnaud 
dhauterives curator of the marmottan museum 
he said claude monets impression sunrise and the other 
works might be ready for redisplay at the marmottan by the end of 
the month after specialists treated them for damage caused by 
humidity 
dhauterives joined culture minister jack lang in praising the 
persistence of a special police art theft unit headed by 
commissioner mireille balestrazzi 
balestrazzi one of the highestranking women in the national 
police force said the key breakthrough in the case came during a 
1987 trip to japan to bring home four paintings by camille corot 
that had been stolen in 1984 from a museum in eastern france 
she said her team learned that a japanese collector had been 
considering the purchase of one of the nine marmottan works 
although the transaction did not take place 
she said additional information was obtained through contacts 
with the yakuza or members of japans organized crime network 
some of the gangsters were approached by representatives of the 
thieves she said but refused to get involved 
balestrazzi provided few other details about the fiveyear 
investigation authorities said one man had been arrested in 
corsica and about a dozen other people had been questioned but 
they indicated that the thieves themselves remained at large 
the nine paintings from the marmottan along with an 
asyetunidentified 17th century painting were found tuesday in a 
villa in portovecchio in southern corsica 
balestrazzi said the theft was committed solely in hopes of 
profit and was in no way linked to any of corsicas militant 
separatist movements 
she said the works were in good condition although a few had 
suffered slightly from humidity experts were to conduct a thorough 
examination to assess their condition 
five armed masked men carried out the theft on a sunday morning 
in october 1985 getting away easily because the marmottans alarm 
system had been disconnected the previous night 
about 30 visitors and nine guards were held at bay by the 
gunmen they were in the museum for only about 10 minutes and 
drove away after putting the paintings in the trunk of a car 
the stolen paintings included five monets two by pierre auguste 
renoir and one by berthe morisot as well as a portrait of monet 
their total value was estimated at the time at 12 million but one 
official described impression sunrise as priceless 
the 1872 work shows the port at le havre in a mixture of blues 
and browns with an orange sun shining through the morning fog it 
was first displayed in 1874 and derisive critics dismissed it as 
impressionist

the trustees of american university voted 
unanimously thursday to rescind its controversial offer to pay 
nearly 1 million to buy out the contract of former president 
richard berendzen who pleaded guilty to making obscene telephone 
calls 
berendzen had asked the trustees to withdraw the offer after he 
was offered a chance to return as a full professor on the physics 
faculty in the spring of 1992 
that agreement puts berendzen 51 on administrative leave with 
pay at his faculty salary for the 199091 academic year and the 
fall 1991 semester his annual salary would be in the range of 
70000 officials said 
he has continued to draw his annual salary of about 140000 
since resigning as president in april 
berendzen named president in 1980 pleaded guilty to making 
obscene telephone calls to a woman from his office two 30day jail 
terms were suspended in lieu of psychiatric treatment 
students faculty and staff members representing various groups 
were harshly critical of the proposed 1 million settlement 
although edward carr chairman of the trustees declined to 
discuss specifics the initial buyout offer reportedly would have 
reached 1 million including more than 600000 in appreciation 
for berendzens contributions in raising the schools image and 
prestige 
carr said that agreement would not affect severance payments to 
berendzen provided for in his presidential contract carr estimated 
the amount at slightly less than 400000 
carr said the trustees supported the agreement allowing 
berendzen to return to teaching 
gayle abbott president of the schools alumni association said 
her group felt that the best interests of american university 
mandate that au sever all ties with berendzen 
abbott urged that berendzen not be allowed to return as a member 
of the faculty 
betty bennett dean of the college of arts and sciences said 
originally the deans did not support berendzen returning to teach 
if he does decide to return then we will welcome him back 
and we would take it from there she said

voters in the nations eighth largest city are 
divided over a referendum designed to help minorities win seats on 
the city council 
supporters of the proposal to create singlemember districts say 
the plan would help ease racial inequities that make it difficult 
for minorites to get elected 
opponents say the referendum would actually resegregate dallas 
they back a plan voters approved last year that called for some 
candidates to be elected by district others by region and one at 
large for the 11member council 
the referendum up for vote saturday has heightened existing 
racial tension in the ethnically diverse city community leaders 
said 
to some this election represents the last chance for peace in 
dallas said roy williams one of two former city council 
candidates who sued the city over its election system saying it 
was discriminatory 
it would be a serious mistake for the city to ignore the 
warning signs widespread frustrations and cynicism in the 
community williams said 
under the existing system instituted in 1975 eight council 
members are elected in individual districts and another three 
including the mayor are elected by voters citywide 
the system voters approved by a 21 margin in august 1989 called 
for 10 candidates to be chosen by district four by region and one 
at large that system was never implemented because a federal judge 
suggested he would rule it unconstitutional 
the system proposed in the referendum calls for the creation of 
14 singlemember districts with a mayor elected at large 
the referendum is being held as part of the settlement of the 
1988 federal lawsuit brought by williams and marvin crenshaw who 
failed in their atlarge council bids 
the men who are both black charged the existing election 
system made it difficult for minorities to win election 
black and hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that 
atlarge elections dilute minority candidates political power and 
make it difficult for them to win office 
they maintain minorities have a better chance of winning office 
under a political system in which candidates are elected by 
individual districts 
the city proposed the referendum on the newest plan when it 
reached a settlement with williams and crenshaw in august 
although minorities are estimated to make up more than half the 
citys population only two of 11 city council members are black 
and there are no hispanics only one minority a hispanic who no 
longer serves on the council has won an atlarge city council 
election 
if a simple majority of voters approve the plan a commission 
will be set up to draw new district lines next year using 1990 
census figures almost 17000 of the citys 451411 registered 
voters cast absentee ballots as of thursday 
former dallas cowboy quarterback roger staubach is among those 
who support the change youve got to look at where dallas has 
come and how it has treated the representation of minorities 
staubach said it has not been fair 
opponents include city councilman glenn box who said the plan 
is a token quota system that resegregates the city 
we dont become an integrated city with 141 box said 
a poll the dallas morning news published last weekend indicated 
voters were not unified on the issue 
half of the likely voters the newspaper contacted said they 
would support the measure another 30 percent said they would vote 
no and 20 percent were undecided 
there have been no formal estimates of the citys racial makeup 
since the 1980 census when dallas 904078 population was 61 
percent white 26 percent black and 12 hispanic 
the racial breakdown of the 1990 census count of 982250 people 
is expected to show a majority black and hispanic population

leftist radical laura whitehorn received a 
20year sentence thursday for bombing the us capitol and 
conspiring to set off seven other explosions that a prosecutor 
called acts of terrorism 
whitehorn was sentenced along with codefendant linda sue evans 
who was ordered to serve five years for her role in the bombing 
conspiracy after completing a 35year term she is already serving 
for illegally buying firearms 
the two women who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain sept 7 
were sentenced by us district judge harold h greene at a 
proceeding punctuated by the cheers and applause of supporters who 
packed the courtroom 
you have committed acts of violence which are not excused by 
good purposes or political purposes greene said the effect of 
these kinds of violence are just as devastating to the victims and 
to society at large as if they were motivated by greed 
the defendants linda evans and laura whitehorn are 
terrorists assistant us attorney margaret ellen told the 
judge they are people who by their actions have sought to coerce 
others by means of threats or violence 
the nov 7 1983 bonb blast that blew a hole in the wall outside 
the senate chamber and the explosions at seven other locations in 
washington and new york city were not symbolic gestures they 
were distinct acts of terrorism ellen said 
only chance prevented serious harm to people she said 
over boos of the defendants supporters she said the 
government has not and does not view these actions as political 
crimes 
evans involvement in the bombing conspiracy was part of a 
pattern of escalating violence that includes a 1987 conviction 
for buying firearms and ammunition ellen said 
fbi agents who raided a baltimore apartment where whitehorn and 
evans 43 lived found components for more bombs and written plans 
to set off explosives at other locations 
whitehorn 45 who raised her right fist to greet supporters as 
she entered the courtroom described her involvment in what she 
called a radical struggle against racism militarism and oppression 
of poor people 
this government put us in a difficult position of choosing 
between morality and the law whitehorn 
how did martin luther king achieve progress without 
violence greene asked at one point during the proceeding 
the struggle of martin luther king is not divorced from other 
struggles that because of necessity had incorporated violence 
said defense attorney nkechi taifi this whole country is built 
upon violence the lawyer said evoking cheers and applause from 
the crowd 
whitehorn received the maximum term for each of three charges to 
which she pleaded guilty conspiracy malicious destruction of 
government property and possession of equipment to make false 
documents 
in sentencing evans greene said he was taking into account the 
fact that she was already serving a 35year prison term 
greene dismissed all charges against susan rosenberg and timothy 
blunk who are both serving 58 years for possession of explosives 
as part of the plea bargain a supreme court ruling on double 
jeopardy precluded their prosecution 
charges against alan berkman who is undergoing chemotherapy for 
hodgkins disease will be dismissed at another unscheduled 
proceeding 
another defendant marilyn buck was given a 10year prison term 
on nov 16 to run concurrently with a 60year term she is serving 
for other crimes

elizabeth taylor and an exbeau reached an 
outofcourt settlement thursday in a battle over passoon perfume 
profits ending what promised to be a revealing peek into the 
stars personal life 
both sides agreed to drop their lawsuits in the middle of jury 
selection the judge announced the actress and former boyfriend 
henry wynberg reached a settlement that leaves miss taylor in 
control of the perfume line 
wynberg sued miss taylor for a share of 70 million in profits 
claiming she breached a contract with him to market the highly 
popular fragrance 
she had countered wynbergs lawsuit with claims that his 
criminal record led her to abandon their planned business deal and 
turn to a major cosmetics company that began marketing passion 
miss taylor won permission to tell jurors about wynbergs statutory 
rape conviction 
miss taylors lawyer neil papiano said no money would change 
hands and each arty would pay its own legal expenses 
it means im vindicated and it proves the perfume passion is 
something i worked for a year and a half for it has nothing to 
do with henry wynberg miss taylor said afterward 
miss taylor said she didnt relish the idea of being on the 
witness stand but didnt say that was the reason for reaching the 
settlement 
its not like on television its not over in an hour its 
not something i was looking forward to but i was willing to fight 
as long as i had to she said 
wynberg said im pleased its all over with 
he said his decision wasnt based on fear a trial would reveal 
too much about his criminal past 
that turns out to be a twoway street anything they wanted to 
ask of me we could have asked also of elizabeth wynberg said 
his lawyer quentin kopp refused to discuss how the settlement 
came about or any details they also refused to acknowledge that 
wynberg wouldnt receive any money 
attorneys had been negotiating for some time but were unable to 
reach agreement until thursday papiano said 
jury selection had been under way for a day and a half 
highlighted thursday by a prospective panelists assertion that he 
had seen most of the 58yearold stars silent films provoking 
laughter in the packed courtroom 
under questioning by attorneys a majority of potential 
panelists said they have only vague memories of miss taylor as an 
actress 
most said they best remember miss taylor as the child star of 
national velvet two said they had never seen the academy 
awardwinning actress on film and one associated her with the 
silentfilm era which predates her career 
i go back to the silent movies so ive seen most of her 
films the prospective panelist said when asked if he had ever 
seen her on the screen 
miss taylor wearing a black dress and a thick gold necklace 
bracelet and earrings reacted with a mock expression of horror 
then laughed along with others in the courtroom 
prospective jurors were asked about alcoholism aids what kind 
of perfume they wear and their taste in television and movie 
viewing habits 
miss taylors past bout with alcoholism was raised because 
wynberg claims her alcoholism and related weight gain destroyed the 
glamorous image he counted on to market cosmetics under her name 
the entire jury pool said they werent biased by miss taylors 
work raising money for aids research 
wynberg is a former used car salesman who courted miss taylor 
between her two marriages to richard burton in the 1970s 
wynberg and miss taylor said they had been hurt deeply by 
personal attacks during the litigation but wynberg said they left 
the courtroom as good friends 
its just like old times he said

president bush unfazed by a spate of 
bombing incidents that greeted his arrival here thursday hailed 
chiles peaceful transition to democracy and its progrowth 
economic policies 
bush received a generally friendly welcome on the first visit by 
an american president in 30 years he hailed chiles democratic 
renaissance and said chiles return to the ranks of the worlds 
democracies is cause for pride and celebration 
but the bombings and other antiamerican incidents were a 
reminder that chile has not yet escaped its fractious political 
past 
before bush arrived leftist guerrillas exploded a halfdozen 
bombs overnight at sites with us ties including four mormon 
chapels a new mcdonalds restaurant and a downtown park outside a 
hotel where some officials in bushs advance party were staying 
the incidents however seemed designed more to make a political 
statement than to cause harm police reported no injuries 
the presidents limousine was also hit by an egg thrown from the 
crowd as his motorcade passed through santiago streets 
police used tear gas and water cannon to scatter scores of 
university students who threw rocks at police and blocked traffic 
during a twohour antibush protest at a campus in the southern 
section of the city they burned at least two us flags and waved 
several cuban flags 
later shortly before bushs arrival for a dinner at the 
presidential palace police dispersed demonstrators who were 
shouting antiamerican slogans 
but generally the visit bushs fourth stop on a weeklong 
south american tour went smoothly at a colorful airport arrival 
ceremony at a news conference and at a speech to the national 
congress bush heaped praise on chile not only for its peaceful 
return to democracy but its ability to generate economic growth 
rates that are the envy of latin america 
many chileans have viewed the united states with suspicion and 
hostility for years because of suggestions that the united states 
subverted chiles democracy in 1973 paving the way for 17 years of 
military rule 
with the restoration of freedom and economic growth much of the 
passion against the united states has dissipated 
at the redcarpet welcome for air force one at the airport 
president patricio aylwin said mr president we welcome you 
with joy 
we value your presence in our land we share common ideals 
he said 
also on hand at the airport was former military ruler gen 
augusto pinochet who is still commander in chief of the army 
after shaking hands with bush the smiling pinochet told reporters 
i want to thank president bush because he recognized that the 
previous government encouraged free market policies 
it was the first time pinochet met a visiting head of state 
after handing over power last march 
in his speech to the congress in valparaiso bush said that 
chile has moved farther faster that any other nation in south 
america toward real market reform 
he said there has been an increase of 15 to 20 per cent in the 
value of exports in each of the last five years 
one issue dividing the united states and chile is a fourday 
grape embargo imposed by the us food and drug administration 
against chile last year inspectors reportedly found two grapes 
laced with cyanide in the hold of a ship in philadelphia chilean 
growers are demanding compensation for losses estimated at 330 
million 
the issue was taken up during thursdays talks here 
bush said the fda decision was based purely on health 
considerations and was not intended to punish chile 
the bush administration prefaced the visit by lifting sanctions 
imposed during the dictatorship of pinochet who ousted chiles 
leftist president salvador allende in 1973 
in late november washington allowed chile back into the general 
preferences system which grants tariff concessions to exports from 
many countries the move could mean a 100 million increase in 
chiles us exports according to finance minister alejandro 
foxley 
the reagan administration excluded chile from the tariff 
preference system in 1988 to protest pinochets repression of the 
chilean labor movement 
last weekend the administration lifted a ban on military aid 
and the sale of military equipment imposed in 1976 to protest 
alleged human rights violations in chile bilateral relations 
further deteriorated that year following the murder on a washington 
street of orlando letelier a chilean exile who was an arch foe of 
military rule in chile 
the united states has said that chilean security officers were 
responsible for the incident in which an associate of leteliers 
ronni moffitt also died 
aylwin speaking at the news conference with bush promised a 
full clarification of truth and justice in the case

a fugitive american linked to the 
irancontra scandal is building a new life in this provincial 
capital with the support of some powerful patrons and former rebel 
leaders 
hull fled neighboring costa rica in july 1989 after posting bail 
following his arrest on charges of drug trafficking and hostility 
to the security of the state of costa rica 
the last charge stems from his allegedly letting air strips at 
his farms near the nicaraguan border be used by the cia to resupply 
contra rebels inside nicaragua in 1984 and 1985 
the usborn hull has been identified by federal prosecutors as 
a point man in former national security council aide oliver norths 
efforts to funnel aid to nicaraguan rebels the program which 
turned into the irancontra scandal involved the selling of 
weapons to iran and the illegal diversion of proceeds to help 
nicaraguas contra rebels since his arrival five months ago hull 
who is about 70 has been living in modest rented homes in juigalpa 
with his adopted daughter emily 
former top contra leader israel galeano known as commander 
franklyn said hull is deciding whether to stay 
we have known him for a long time and he always has helped us 
when we were in our most difficult moments galeano is quoted as 
saying in barricada the official sandinista newspaper 
the contras abandoned their war after the leftist sandinistas 
were voted out of ofiice and replaced by a usbacked 
administration earlier this year 
hull avoids the press but in interviews with friends 
associates and neighbors a picture of his new life has emerged 
according to local officials hull intends to get involved in 
cattle ranching lumber exporting and citrus plantations 
nicaraguan officials say they have not received any extradition 
requests from costa rican and that there are no charges against him 
in nicaragua 
costa rica presented an extradition request to the united 
states where hull initially fled after jumping bail but hull 
vanished again later turning up in nicaragua 
in costa rica the foreign ministry has asked the supreme court 
to change the extradition request from the united states to 
nicaragua 
by pure chance i saw hull tuesday in managua he drove past 
me in his pickup truck said carlos aguilar costa ricas 
ambassador in managua 
juigalpa mayor isaac deleo says he did not realize who hull was 
when he first met him 
some little time ago he came here and he was introduced to me 
by a gentleman from the resistance who said that hull had 
protected the boys and given them food when they were in costa 
rica said deleo 
he said he wanted to buy a ranch in chontales and that he has 
a friend from california who wants to set up a shoe factory here 
in addition to his links to resupplying contras hull has been 
implicated in costa rica in the 1984 assassination attempt against 
former contra leader eden pastora 
a bomb at a news conference at pastoras jungle camp in la 
penca nicaragua killed five people including an american 
journalist 
he hull said to me i swear i had absolutely nothing to do 
with la penca deleo said 
hull is one of 29 people named in a civil suit in the united 
states filed over the bombing the suit claims the bomb was the 
work of the cia 
hes a very quiet man very well educated and of few words 
deleo said i have no commitments with mr hull i only have 
helped him look for housing 
hull has also reportedly sponsored humanitarian donations 
earning the gratitute of dr leonel rosales director of juigalpas 
hospital 
we all knew exactly who he was when he came here rosales 
said but im not interested in all that if the devil comes to 
donate medical materials of if god comes ill take it and dont 
ask questions 
in november hull introduced dr verne chaney president of the 
new yorkbased dooley foundation to rosales 
chaney was to bring two containers full of donations including 
xray and blood analysis machines for a contra clinic near the 
honduran border 
hull came back saying that he chaney did not think that 
place met the conditions for the machines to work rosales said 
then hull said the donations would instead be given to our 
hospital

a bensonhurst defendant whose first murder trial 
ended with a hung jury was acquitted thursday of murder and 
manslaughter in the racially motivated slaying of a black youth 
john vento 22 was found guilty only of riot he was the third 
defendant acquitted of major charges this week 
as the verdict was read the defendant banged his hands on the 
defense table and screamed yes yes yes vento crying then 
grabbed and hugged his lawyer before he was restrained by court 
officers 
the jury in state supreme court returned the verdict during the 
second full day of deliberations the riot conviction carries a 
maximum term of one and onethird to four years in prison 
he faced 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the murder 
charge 
its always hard to convict someone when he was not the 
triggerman said assistant district attorney paul burns this 
jury was a smart jury and i have absolutely no criticism of their 
verdict whatsoever 
all i will tell you is it was a very very difficult case and 
a very difficult decision said juror gay fallows reached by 
telephone 
the trial was the second for vento the former star prosecution 
witness turned defendant vento backed out of a deal to testify 
against his friends after he and his family received threats 
in july a jury convicted vento of unlawful imprisonment and 
menacing but acquitted him of the most serious charge he faced 
intentional murder the panel deadlocked on a second murder count 
and riot a few weeks later he was also indicted on seconddegree 
manslaughter 
he is serving a sentence of up to eight years in prison for the 
convictions 
prosecutors described vento as a major participant in the aug 
23 1989 slaying of yusuf hawkins in the bensonhurst section of 
brooklyn hawkins 16 was in the predominantly white neighborhood 
to look at a used car he was cornered by a gang of whites and 
fatally shot in the chest 
he was there he helped organize and recruit a mob 
assistant district attorney paul burns said of vento he was 
there when the mob armed itself and he was there as one of the 
leaders of the mob 
defense attorney gerald j dichiara defended vento as a young 
man drawn into what he thought would be a brawl to protect his 
friend keith mondello and to keep outsiders from his neighborhood 
kids fight kids who are 17 and up who hang out at 
luncheonettes and candy stores fight but theyre not murderers 
dichiara said 
he argued that joseph fama who has been convicted of murder in 
the case acted alone and that there was no evidence proving vento 
shared the killers mental culpability 
prosecutors did not say vento shot hawkins but maintained that 
in helping fama corner and then shoot the teenager he acted in 
concert with the shooter and was equally guilty of murder 
in the weeks following the shooting vento agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors in exchange for immunity and appeared before a 
grand jury 
he subsequently backed out of the deal and fled the city after 
the threats against his family dichiara said vento surrendered in 
ohio but opted to face a trial rather than resume his cooperation 
fama convicted of murder and other crimes is serving 32 and 
twothirds years to life mondello the organizer of the mob was 
acquitted of murder and manslaughter but was sentenced to up to 16 
years in prison for his conviction on several leser crimes 
three other defendants are scheduled to stand trial early next 
year for their alleged roles in the slaying

saddam hussein told his parliament thursday 
to free all foreign hostages in response to positive changes in 
the persian gulf crisis and he said iraq should apologize to the 
thousands who were held 
baghdad wants all the hostages released and home by christmas 
iraqs un ambassador said thursday 
definitely we would like to see everyone with his family by 
christmas because that is a very joyous and happy occasion and it 
is time for family reunions ambassador abdul amir alanbari said 
at the un headquarters 
there are an estimated 900 us hostages among the thousands 
held by the iraqis in iraq and kuwait in the aftermath of iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of the neighboring oilrich emirate 
their release could begin as early as saturday iraqi officials 
said late thursday though processing of visa applications and 
other papers could take days 
saddam said the reason for holding foreigners to deter an 
attack had diminished he also said iraqi troops had been given 
the time to become battle ready 
the iraqi leader also noted there had been growing opposition in 
the united states to president bushs efforts to form a consensus 
for military action to dislodge iraq from kuwait 
the 250seat national assembly which routinely backs the ruling 
baath party leader scheduled a meeting for 11 am friday 
if it approves saddams proposal as expected it would be the 
first time iraq has agreed to abide by a un security council 
resolution on the crisis sparked by iraqs invasion 
president bush welcomed the announcement but said saddam should 
not have taken people hostage in the first place and bush 
insisted the man must leave kuwait without reservation without 
condition before the standoff can end 
iraq holds thousands of foreigners whom it refers to as 
guests some 600 of them mainly americans britons and 
japanese have been moved to strategic military and industrial 
sites to serve as human shields to ward off military action 
saddam said the foreigners were people who do not want to 
fight and who got trapped in the space between the two 
trenches 
in all there are an estimated 950000 foreigners in iraq and 
occupiedkuwait but saddam earlier said most asians and arabs 
the majority of the foreigners were free to leave 
there was a spontaneous celebration thursday at the almansour 
melia hotel in downtown baghdad where several hostages were 
brought to meet with visiting family members 
we did it at last and now we can go home for christmas said 
susan dring who traveled to baghdad last week to try to win her 
husbands freedom 
michael dring stood behind her celebrating with a can of 
imported beer 
saddams decision coincided with a report that his foreign 
minister tariq aziz will meet with bush in washington on dec 17 
to discuss a possible settlement of the crisis 
bush had said he would receive aziz during the week of dec 10 
then dispatch secretary of state james a baker iii to baghdad 
the announcement also came as a source in paris said ambassadors 
of the five permanent members of the security council including 
the united states had agreed on a resolution seeking an 
international peace conference on the middle east 
since 10 days after the invasion saddam has stressed a linkage 
of other middle east problems particularly the israeli occupation 
of palestinian lands in the west bank and gaza strip to a 
withdrawal from kuwait 
the united states rejects such a linkage insisting that iraq 
withdraw from kuwait before the arabisraeli conflict is discussed 
in his letter to parliament speaker sadi mehdi saleh saddam 
said his decision was prompted by recent consultations with his 
arab brothers a reference to a meeting tuesday with king 
hussein of jordan plo chief yasser arafat and yemeni vice 
president ali salem albeidh 
saddam said the reason for which the foreigners were prevented 
from travel have diminished and has been replaced by something more 
powerful a change in the american public opinion which will 
impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions of the evil 
ones led by bush the enemy of god 
iraq stopped foreigners from leaving in response to a usled 
multinational troop buildup in saudi arabia and the gulf region 
which followed the occupation of kuwait 
about 400000 soldiers have been deployed in the multinational 
force the united states alone has 250000 and nearly 200000 more 
on their way 
the security council told saddam last week that he must leave 
kuwait by jan 15 or face a military onslaught that resolution 
the 12th against iraq since the crisis erupted also demanded that 
he free all hostages 
saddam told saleh the foreigners were interned to delay war 
and provide iraqi forces with enough time to prepare for a possible 
war over kuwait 
now that the iraqi military is battle ready saddam said the 
foreigners should regain their freedom to travel 
we deem it necessary that our national assembly convene to 
take a final and irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue 
he said 
he referred to his earlier offer to allow the foreigners to 
leave between dec 25 and march 25 which is the most likely period 
for an attack to drive iraq from kuwait 
he added that recent overtures prompted him to respond to 
positive changes 
among the positive changes he cited a drive within the united 
states to avert war and give sanctions imposed on iraq more time 
several witnesses appearing before congress this week have urged 
caution 
saddam referred briefly to bushs offer for talks with iraq 
bushs calls for dialogue are still concealing war intentions 
and we must be aware not to fall into such traps he said

prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel rejected 
thursday the idea of an international mideast peace conference and 
he vowed to ask washington about reports it is backing the idea at 
the united nations 
shamir labeled as rumors the reports that the united states 
will ask the un security council to consider convening the peace

in a speech at a joint israel appeal fundraising dinner shamir 
also reassured israels supporters that the country is ready to 
deal with threats by iraqs leader saddam hussein has said israel 
would be the first target in any persian gulf conflict 
saddam hussein must surely know that if he resorts to violent 
action against israel he will pay dearly for such action shamir 
said 
the days when people could attack defenseless jews with 
impunity are over this is what israel is all about 
about 6 million jews were killed in the nazi holocaust 
the israeli leader who is on nineday trip to britain and the 
united states noted that his country is not part of the 
multinational force opposing iraq in the gulf 
but by our very presence in that area thanks to our 
steadfastness and capacity we have been and continue to be a 
force for stability a barrier that has prevented many military 
adventures and muand in a civil clomplaint charged cartisano and his

while government officials squabbled thursday over 
who was to blame for moscows food shortages a soviet foreign 
ministry spokesman reported that humanitarian aid from abroad had 
topped 160 million 
but if western nations really want muscovites to have a happy 
holiday season they should send empty bottles a shortage of the 
glass containers threatens to leave the city without vodka wine 
and champagne to toast the new year 
in the latest round of fingerpointing over shortages in moscow 
that have raised fears of a hungry winter authorities from regions 
that supply the capital with meat milk and other foodstuffs denied 
they are withholding stocks 
there is no need to start a witchhunt where there are no 
witches said v syrovatko an official of the bryansk region 
southwest of moscow in an interview published in thursdays 
sovietskaya rossiya newspaper 
last month moscow deputy mayor sergei b stankevich accused the 
regions of bryansk penza and other areas of violating delivery 
contracts to the capital 
a kovlyagin executive committee chairman of the penza regional 
council said his region fulfilled its delivery plans by 97 percent 
the past 10 months he said penza supplied 18087 metric tons of 
meat of the contracted 19463 metric tons and either surpassed or 
nearly met all its dairy contracts the newspaper reported 
the neighboring tver region sent 347 metric tons o meat to 
moscow exceeding the state plan of 275 metric tons sovietskaya 
rossiya said 
kovlyagin blamed any shortages on moscow city officials for 
failing to establish contact with regional authorities it 
reported 
moscows milk supply is down 15 to 20 percent the last 11 
months soviet television reported thursday it said 20000 metric 
tons of powdered milk is being sent to the capital 
soviet officials say food production is no lower than last year 
including a record grain harvest this year many blame barren store 
shelves on a crumbling distribution system and panicked consumers 
many regions halted shipments of food and consumer goods to 
other areas to protest kremlin policies rather than obey central 
government demands for food deliveries to the cities at state 
prices they consider too low farmers are trading directly with 
factories and other consumers for other scarce supplies 
aid from abroad kept arriving thursday the second of two 
israeli jetliners filled with fruit vegetables medicine and 15 
metric tons of powdered milk arrived in moscow thursday night 
the powdered milk was trucked from the airport to khimkenskaya 
hospital in moscow and to soltikovsky childrens home outside the 
city officials said 
about 20 metric tons of food arrived thursday from the united 
states tass said without specifying who sent it leningrad 
received more than 12 metric tons and moscow 17 metric tons from 
germany tass said 
more shipments were announced from norway and germany on 
thursday officials in those countries said 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin told a briefing 160 
million worth of food has been sent to this country or is in the 
pipeline he said governments and charitable organizations from 21 
nations have promised or delivered aid 
tass said any information about distribution of foreign food aid 
may be directed to the government commission responsible for 
overseeing the shipments headed by deputy prime minister lev 
voronin 
by dec 15 more than 200000 food parcels each weighing 22 
pounds will start arriving here containing such items as milk 
macaroni meat vegetables and fruit churkin said 
churkin said spain italy france and canada offered financial 
aid for food purchases and negotiations are under way with 
austria britain australia greece south korea turkey saudi 
arabia and iran 
he praised tuesdays comments in britain by former president 
ronald reagan who called mikhail s gorbachev a friend in need 
and said the west must offer assistance 
but the newspaper moskovskaya pravda said moscows latest need 
is empty bottles halfliter containers preferably to hold 
holiday spirits 
the city faces a dry new year because consumers are not 
returning empties though stores now pay about 90 cents a bottle 
more than twice the usual price the newspaper did not say why 
people apparently are holding onto the bottles some stores wont 
sell a bottle of wine or vodka unless the buyer surrenders an 
empty 
one reason for the shortage is that bottle production was 
curtailed during gorbachevs antialcohol campaign three years ago 
although some enterprises will fill jars with wine or vodka 
moskovskaya pravda suggested the practice wont look nice on the 
holiday table

commitment to perform a musical play at the university of arizona 
a minister said 
the rev warren stewart of phoenix said yolanda king and 
attallah shabbazz will perform the play sunday 
arizona voters rejected a referendum that would have created a 
paid state holiday honoring king the nov 6 vote triggered a 
backlash against the state including a recommendation by national 
football league commissioner paul tagliabue to move the 1993 super 
bowl out of arizona 
the play stepping into tomorrow was booked months before 
the general election said jesse hargrove the universitys 
assistant dean of africanamerican student affairs 
stewart pastor of the first institutional baptist church said 
ms king called him monday to ask his advice 
some people were telling her to come and some were telling her 
to stay away and to boycott arizona she said she wanted to be a 
proactive force rather than a reactive force and i told her that 
coming at this time could contribute to the healing of the state 
stewart said 
ms king 34 would not discuss the controversy 
she wants to make a prepared statement sunday in order to be 
fair to everyone publicist jahna cole said wednesday

rescinded a paid king holiday declared by his predecessor bruce 
babbitt by executive order attorney general bob corbin had said 
babbitt lacked the authority to declare the holiday

thursday for more help transporting equipping and reinforcing the 
multinational force in the persian gulf officials said 
us defense secretary dick cheney was joined by tom king his 
british counterpart in welcoming the help given so far and urging 
the north atlantic treaty organization allies to provide still 
more 
the two officials made the appeals during the first day of a 
twoday session of nato defense ministers 
officials said cheney also told the ministers a postcold war 
nato should focus on four potential threats to its security the 
soviet union as europes largest military power political 
instability in eastern europe the spread of chemical arms and 
ballistic missiles in the middle east and threats to western 
supplies of energy 
king told reporters britain wants its allies to provide more 
ammunition medical equipment and staff chemical warfare gear and 
ships and planes to transport troops to the gulf 
a senior cheney aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the united states did not present a detailed list of its needs nor 
did it ask for an immediate response 
however the aide said cheney cited categories of assistance 
that other officials described as air and sealift help and 
protective gear for chemical warfare he also said the united 
states would welcome such additional support as the allies could 
supply including troops 
the aide said several nations indicated considerable ways in 
which they might offer additional support but there were no 
details 
the united states has almost 300000 troops in the gulf region 
about 100000 more us troops are now being sent and britain is 
bringing its deployment to 30000 over the next few weeks 
a nato official termed very good news an iraqi announcement 
thursday that president saddam hussein had called for releasing all 
foreign hostages the release could begin as early as saturday and 
is hoped to be completed by christmas iraqi officials said 
however the nato official speaking on condition of anonymity 
also said iraq must completely withdraw from kuwait and restore 
the legitimate government 
on other matters the defense ministers reviewed work on a new 
nato defense strategy to reflect the dramatic changes in eastwest 
relations 
the cheney aide said the defense secretary told the allies nato 
no longer faced a single threat but a combination of dangers 
especially from an unstable eastern europe and turbulent middle 
east 
quite clearly the scale and nature of the threat has changed 
but there are considerable instabilities remaining not least 
the rise of nationalism in eastern europe said king the british 
minister 
the new defense strategy to be adopted next year will stress 
greater reliance on smaller more flexible multinational forces it 
will also commit the nato allies to continue relying on a mix of 
conventional and nuclear arms and to maintain a us military 
presence in europe though at a sharply reduced level 
officials said discussions continued about whether nato should 
operate as an alliance outside its own territory a politically 
sensitive issue in many allied capitals 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said a consensus had 
emerged to rid europe of shortrange nuclear weapons 
however us officials were more cautious they stressed a need 
for negotiations with moscow on reducing not eliminating these 
weapons with a range of up to 310 miles

a former nurse accused of killing a 
nursing home patient with a tranquilizer told a cellmate he had 
killed 23 people pretrial documents show 
brian rosenfeld who has worked for at least 10 pinellas county 
nursing homes before his arrest in august said he selected victims 
who were about to die anyway said the cellmate whose testimony was 
inadvertently included in a packet of pretrial discovery material 
made public monday 
david allen greenway held at the pinellas county jail on a 
grand theft charge made the statements to sheriffs detective 
chuck vaughn 
after a st petersburg times reporter read an account of 
greenways statements and asked for a copy assistant state 
attorney marie king removed it from the packet the newspaper 
reported wednesday confessions are not supposed to be released 
she said and greenways statements had been included in the packet 
by mistake 
greenways testimony is crucial evidence linking rosenfeld to 
multiple deaths assistant state attorney fred schaub said tuesday 
greenway knows things about rosenfeld that werent in any news 
accounts schaub said 
for example greenway said rosenfeld told him the names of five 
or six of his alleged victims schaub confirmed those nursing home 
patients died while under rosenfelds care 
rosenfeld 32 was helit shows that the strategy is working and that 
saddam understands that his hostage policy has incurred the 
condemnation of the whole world the president said 
and weve got to continue to keep the pressure on said 
bush who has authorized the deployment of more than 400000 
americans to the gulf 
the pentagon said thursday that iraq had moved an additional 
30000 troops into kuwait and southern iraq and that 10000 us 
reinforcements had arrived in the persian gulf 
there are now more than 480000 iraqi troops in the region and 
more than 250000 american troops including at least 130000 us 
army soldiers in saudi arabia 
bush said his planned meeting with iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz and a meeting between baker and saddam would not be 
negotiating sessions in which concessions might be offered to iraq 
what i want to do is be sure by going this last extra step 
for peace that the iraqis know from me and aziz knows from me and 
saddam hussein knows directly from the secretary of state what is 
at stake in this matter and how supportive the united states is of 
the consolidated un position bush said and thats what its 
about 
on capitol hill baker also rejected iraqi demands that the 
talks include discussion of other mideast issues

a judge suspended a 300000 bail thursday for 
the man accused of killing extremist rabbi meir kahane and set new 
bail arguments for monday 
state supreme court justice alvin schlesinger set the bail 
wednesday for el sayyid nosair over manhattan district attorney 
robert morgenthaus objections 
we had asked that the defendant continue to be held without 
bail morgenthau said we pointed out to the court that he is 
accused of committing a number of exceptionally serious crimes 
including both the murder of rabbi kahane and the wounding of a 
federal police officer 
the judges suspension of nosairs bail means he would not be 
freed even if he came up with the money morgenthaus spokesman 
gerald mckelvey said 
schlesinger said the bail issue will go back to court monday 
morgenthau said bail should be revoked because the case against 
nosair is strong and because he has foreign contacts who could help 
him flee 
nosair 35 is accused of shooting the zionist radical through 
the neck nov 5 as kahane finished speaking to a jewish group in a 
midtown hotel he is also accused of wounding two other men and 
threatening a third as he allegedly tried to get away 
in a statement to police attached to a disclosure form filed in 
court nosair said he went to see kahanes lecture because he 
agrees with much of the rabbis antiarab rhetoric 
nosair also told police he believes kahane was shot by a jewish 
man he said he was wounded when he was caught in the crossfire 
between the killer and the us postal service police officer who 
fired a bullet into his neck 
the gun police recovered and accused him of using on kahane was 
placed next to him as he lay wounded in the street according to 
nosairs statement

portauprince haiti ap populist priest jeanbertrand 
aristide on thursday blamed the tonton macoutes the private 
militia that terrorized the people during the duvalier rule for 
killing seven people at a campaign rally 
fiftythree people were wounded in the wednesday night gun and 
bomb attack on his rally in petionville a suburb seven miles from 
the capital 
aristide considered frontrunner in the dec 16 presidential 
elections said he and the 10 other candidates would not let such 
violence derail the campaign 
the attack appeared intended to keep aristide supporters from 
the polls it was the first violence since campaigning began in 
october and came as haitians were optimistic they could hold the 
first democratic elections in the history of the former french 
colony 
take heart dry your tears hold one anothers hands 
aristide said in an emotional interview with radio antilles we 
are going to continue walking together because on the 16th of 
december whether they like it or not the macoutes will disappear 
from haiti 
aristide demanded the arrest of roger lafontant reputed leader 
of the tonton macoutes who returned from exile to run for 
president the independent electoral council however later 
disqualified his candidacy 
a warrant for lafontants arrest has never been served 
lafontant denied responsibility for wednesdays violence 
interior minister joseph maxi promised an investigation 
the capital was quiet thursday traffic was normal and people 
went to work 
radio reports said schools closed early for the christmas 
holidays because of the attack they were supposed to close dec 
19 
the attack came as the rally was breaking up starting with the 
explosion of a homemade bomb during a brief blackout men in a jeep 
then fired into the crowd 
most of the injured treated at portauprinces general hospital 
suffered burns and bullet shrapnel and shotgun pellet wounds some 
had limbs amputated 
too bad for those who want war and not peace we who defend 
the rules of democracy who refuse the language of violence will 
continue our struggle and go on with the electoral campaign as 
before said hubert de ronceray conservative candidate of the 
mobilization for national development party 
louis dejoie jr candidate of the moderate national 
agricultural and industrial party said we will not ee 
intimidated but will go ahead with our campaign to establish 
democracy is to honor the memory of the victims of dictatorship 
aristide visited the wounded at the hospital hundreds of 
cheering supporters greeted him later dejoie arrived and the two 
candidates embraced 
the united nations representative in haiti reinhardt helmke 
said he believed the elections would stay on track 
at this stage the electoral process is not compromised he 
said this is the type of thing that everybody was expecting 
would happen at some point 
ismael diallo spokesman for the un election verification 
mission said the elections would proceed because the electoral 
council the army and haitians are determined to go ahead and 
make a success of these elections 
the 37yearold roman catholic priest target of three previous 
assassination attempts had left the rally shortly before the 
attack 
he has been hailed as a prophet by many and has a huge 
following among the countrys poor the majority in this caribbean 
nation of 6 million people where violence and intimidation have 
traditionally pervaded politics 
after what happened its normal our blood is boiling 
aristide said in the radio broadcast it could have been 
prevented all they had to do was arrest roger lafontant we 
demand the immediate arrest of roger lafontant 
lafontant denied responsibility in an interview broadcast on 
radio lumiere he insinuated aristide was behind it saying the 
crime profits aristide apparently a reference to the public 
sympathy it will generate 
the tonton macoutes were formed under the late dictator francois 
duvalier in 1957 the family rule ended in 1986 when his son 
jeanclaude duvalier was forced into exile by a popular uprising 
this months elections will be the first democratic presidential 
vote since haitis slave population rose up and won independence 
from france 186 years ago 
more than 400 international observers including former 
president carter along with unarmed military security advisers 
have agreed to monitor the balloting

prospects for a january summit in moscow with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and sources said the meeting might slip to 
february 
the persian gulf crisis is one reason for the uncertain timing 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
its not an easy time to be traveling he said referring to 
the jan 15 deadline set in a un resolution authorizing force

next month were not totally abandoned asked if the trip were 
being canceled he replied not as far as im concerned

as a result its possible it could slip to february one 
source said speaking on condition of anonymity

has insisted that his trip be linked with the signing of a 
ussoviet treaty to slash longrange nuclear weapons 
a white house advance team was supposed to have left for moscow 
in middecember to begin planning for bushs visit but the trip 
was unexpectedly called off one source familiar with bushs 
schedule said it showed no foreign travel in january 
fitzwater said the advance trip was put off because of the lack 
of a date for bushs visit he said jan 6 had been mentioned as 
one possibility and that midjanuary had been another 
its all tied to the start nuclear arms negotiations 
treaty he said 
as president bush has held summits with gorbachev in

baghdad wants all the hostages it has been 
holding to be released and home by christmas iraqs un 
ambassador said thursday 
definitely we would like to see everyone with his family by 
christmas because that is a very joyous and happy occasion and it 
is time for family reunions said ambassador abdul amir 
alanbari 
foreigners may begin leaving as early as saturday iraq 
officials in baghdad said late thursday though visa processing may 
take days 
there are an estimated 900 us hostages among the thousands 
held by the iraqis in iraq and kuwait in the aftermath of iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of the neighboring oilrich emirate 
the iraqi ambassador said it might speed the release of the 
detainees if the united states sent planes to jordan to pick them 
up 
definitely they could send the planes to amman and from 
amman it would be a short flight alanbari said 
it is a matter of logistical things he said 
iraq president saddam hussein said thursday that all hostages 
would be released but he did not say when 
the united states applauded the announcement but said it still 
wants all iraqi occupation forces out of kuwait by jan 15 as 
spelled out in a un security council resolution passed last week 
if not multinational forces are authorized to take military 
action against iraq 
saddams dramatic announcement signaled the removal of a major 
obstacle to resolving the 4monthold persian gulf crisis 
the state department in a message for broadcast by the voice of 
america advised us citizens in iraq and kuwait it was making 
preparations for their evacuation as soon as they are permitted to 
leave 
several governments and relatives of hostages quickly welcomed 
saddams announcement which the iraqi leader called a response to 
the positive changes of recent diplomatic moves 
in all there are an estimated 950000 foreigners in iraq and 
occupied kuwait but saddam earlier said most asians and arabs 
the majority of the foreigners were free to leave 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states had 
received official notification in baghdad that the foreigners would 
be set free 
saddams announcement was made by the official iraqi news 
agency which published a letter from him instructing the national 
assembly to approve the release 
parliament routinely accepts his recommendations and the 
release was expected soon after the vote which could come as 
early as friday

a jury on thursday convicted two suspected ira 
members of planning a bombing campaign on the british mainland and 
they were sentenced to 30 years each in prison 
damien mccomb 22 and liam odhuibhir 28 gave clenchedfist 
salutes and shouted victory to the ira as they were taken away 
after sentencing 
judge simon brown told mccomb and odhuibhir they were 
ruthless dangerous merciless men intent on carnage 
there is no doubt whatever you are a pair of ira terrorists 
who were intent late last year upon a bombing campaign here on the 
mainland which would have wreaked death and destruction very 
probably singling out men of public service worth and honor as 
your victims he said 
earlier the jury of eight women and four men convicted the pair 
of conspiring with persons unknown to explode bombs in britain on 
various dates before dec 22 the men denied the charge 
police arrested mccomb and odhuibhir at gunpoint dec 21 last 
year as the pair removed weapons and explosives from hiding places 
on the welsh coast police said the mens hit list discovered 
later included the entire british cabinet 
at the start of the trial prosecutor john nutting said late in 
1989 the pair were in the preparatory stages of a british 
bombing campaign all the equipment seized with the men bore the 
hallmarks of provisional ira material he said 
the socalled provisionals now the only active irish republican 
army faction grew out of a 1969 split in the militant movement 
which has engaged in a bombing and shooting campaign to end british 
rule in northern ireland 
nutting said in november last year that police recovered 10 
guns more than 1300 rounds of ammunition 88 pounds of semtex 
explosive handgrenades and bomb timers and detonators at two 
hiding places at st brides bay in the southern welsh county of 
pembrokeshire 
they replaced the caches and staked out the hiding places until 
mccomb and odhuibhir returned dec 21 he said 
in a house in luton southern england where odhuibhir had 
rented a room police found ammunition radio equipment false 
identification documents and a list of people prominent in british 
public life including a full list of the cabinet and the names of 
a number of middleranking and junior ministers nutting said 
mccomb from belfast told the court he and odhuibhir had 
agreed to bring something back to ireland from britain for friends 
but had not realized it was arms and explosives until they got to 
wales 
dubliner odhuibhir who did not give evidence was jailed for 
five years in dublin in 1984 for attempted kidnapping illegal 
possession of arms and using a gun to resist arrest he was 
released in 1987 for good behavior

lech walesa said in an interview thursday 
that if he wins the presidency his challenger should be barred 
from leaving the country until he proves his campaign allegations 
or apologizes for abusing polands good name 
walesa told the governmentowned daily rzeczpospolita that 
recent charges by emigre businessman stanislaw tyminski cannot be 
overlooked even in the name of democracy 
the election will be held sunday walesa refused to hold a 
televised debate with tyminski on thursday night as requested by 
his opponent after tyminski backed out of a confrontation last 
week walesa showed up for that debate to find he faced only an 
empty chair 
tyminski said he wanted to face walesa thursday night to sum 
up the campaign but walesa accused him of plotting a lastminute 
smear to which he would not be able to respond because of the ban 
on campaigning after noon on friday 
the challenger has insinuated repeatedly that he has damaging 
material about walesa that would force the solidarity labor leader 
into exile walesa has demanded proof and says no such documents 
could exist 
at a news conference later thursday tyminski again refused to 
release the damaging material he claims to have there are many 
documents but i dont think it is in the best interest of the 
country to state them he said thursday night 
he later promised to reveal the information during his final 
campaign stop friday morning in szeczin but then said he had not 
made the political decision whether to do so 
at another point tyminski read from a magazine interview with 
walesa focusing on walesas contention that civil unrest will 
develop if tyminski failed as president to fulfill promises for 
speedy economic improvement tyminski said those were the words of 
a terrorist an assailant 
in his interview thursday walesa said tyminski must not be 
allowed out of the country 
he must account for everything that brought poland harm for 
abusing polands good name in the world 
in particular walesa said tyminski must apologize to prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki whom he accused of treason by creating 
economic chaos 
mazowiecki who was picked by walesa to be the east blocs first 
noncommunist government head and lead the countrys dramatic 
reforms resigned after tyminski defeated him in the first election 
round on nov 25 his governments resignation has not yet been 
accepted by parliament 
after a bitter firstround campaign battle with his former 
adviser walesa has appealed for mazowieckis government to stay on 
to stabilize the country and has asked the prime ministers 
supporters to vote for him sunday 
the polishborn tyminski also has passports from peru where he 
says he underwent a spiritual transformation during the early 
1980s and canada where he is the leader of the fringe libertarian 
party 
tyminski has refused to reveal his plans for after the election 
saying he is concentrating on winning 
interior minister krzysztof kozlowski said at a news conference 
thursday that no evidence has emerged for holding tyminski in the 
country if he loses 
but he added the ministry remains convinced after repeated 
checking of its passport records that tyminski was issued polish 
visas in libya seven times between 1980 and 1989 tyminski has 
denied ever being in libya 
tyminski won support from poles with his promises of a quick fix 
for polands shattered economy 
two polls on wednesday showed walesa widening his secondround 
lead however one conducted by the private demoskop agency put 
walesa ahead 61 percent to 20 percent while state television 
pollsters said he led 58 percent to 23 percent both surveys put 
the undecided at 19 percent 
tyminski has threatened a suit against state television which 
interviewed a canadian couple who said he abused his wife and 
denied his children food and medicine 
tyminski denied the allegations

space shuttle columbias stargazing 
mission suffered yet another major setback when the astronauts 
thursday lost their only working computer terminal for operating a 
150 million observatory 
observations already lagging far behind were halted as a 
frustrated nasa scrambled to devise a plan to control three of the 
telescopes from the ground 
weve got to bootstrap ourselves from ground zero said 
mission scientist ted gull 
controllers developed a procedure in which the telescopes and 
their pointing system could be guided by commands from the ground 
the astronauts aided by data from the ground could manually steer 
the telescopes toward desired targets with a joystick and 
television cameras 
using that process one telescope observed a supernova thursday 
night said mission manager jack jones scientists planned to 
attempt additional observations through the night with the other 
telescopes 
weve now got a way to operate jones said 
but jones could not say yet how well the new process would work 
or how many observations may be lost because of the latest problem 
it was the latest in a series of blows to the mission which was 
delayed six months by shuttle fuel leaks and suffered instrument 
failure within a few hours of columbias liftoff sunday the 
shuttle is to land tuesday 
im not sure whether to smile ear to ear or cry said 
william blair of johns hopkins university revealing data of a 
supernova remnant that the schools telescope made before being 
shut down 
the four astronomers aboard columbia were forced to halt 
observations thursday morning when a flight deck computer 
overheated and automatically turned off moments before they had 
smelled a burning odor similar to one that filled the cabin sunday 
when they lost the only other terminal for operating the 
observatory 
the astronauts had been managing the astro observatorys three 
ultraviolet telescopes with the one remaining terminal 
when the first failed computer was disassembled thursday its 
air vents were found to be clogged with lint the national 
aeronautics and space administration tried to bring that terminal 
back on line but the smell reappeared and astronaut jeffrey 
hoffman quickly turned the machine off 
no joy on the test power is off hoffman said 
mission controls james hartsfield said there was no large 
release of harmful fumes and the crews air was fine the 
astronauts had their breathing helmets ready just in case 
before thursdays computer failure the astronauts have had to 
manually steer the telescopes because of nagging problems with the 
automatic pointing system which was used sporadically 
as a result of the slower less precise manual method many 
stars were dropped from the observing schedule astro was supposed 
to have begun examining galaxies quasars and other highenergy 
objects late sunday 
scientists scrapped more targets thursday in light of the 
computer problem gull said he could not estimate how many of the 
planned 250 objects had been lost 
i would be lying if i said i wasnt frustrated i mean i am 
frustrated said mary jane taylor part of the university of 
wisconsin telescopes team 
but i dont think any of us thought that this was going to be 
error free she said i dont think anybody thought it was 
really going to go 100 percent smoothly 
to salvage the rest of the mission nasa planned to operate the 
telescopes via computer commands sent from the ground if neither 
flight deck terminal could be repaired the astronauts aided by 
the ground data would use a joystick and tv monitors to steer the 
instruments in the open cargo bay toward desired stars 
johnson space center in houston would control the instrument 
pointing system in bringing the telescopes back up one by one 
assisted by astronomers at marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala ground controllers practiced moving the 
observatory thursday afternoon 
acquisition is going to be difficult gull said its 
certainly going to be a close teamwork effort 
such a procedure was never practiced before the mission gull 
said 
we anticipated that an individual instrument might need to 
be controlled from the ground but we didnt anticipate that we 
might have to control all three instruments from the ground he 
said 
astros xray telescope was unaffected the instrument is 
operated by computer commands sent from goddard space flight center 
in greenbelt md and has its own pointing system 
the xray telescopes observing schedule was being revamped 
however to take advantage of the ultraviolet instruments idle 
time many of the targets were supposed to be viewed simultaneously 
by all four telescopes 
ultraviolet light and xrays are absorbed by the atmosphere and 
thus invisible from the ground astronomers had been counting on 
astros results 218 miles above earth to improve their 
understanding of objects that emit such radiation 
while waiting for observations to resume columbias sevenman 
crew photographed earth and relaxed 
were just sitting here you know enjoying the view doing a 
few other things said astronaut sam durrance 
the astronauts still planned to conduct a live science lesson 
friday for more than 40 middleschool students at two nasa centers 
the youngsters will be able to question two crew members

catherine bergeron looked up at the gray stormy 
skies from the steps of notredame basilica on thursday and 
recalled it was much the same kind of day as a year ago when her 
sister genevieve and 13 other women were shot to death 
the women 13 of them engineering students died and 13 were 
wounded when marc lepine stormed ecole polytechnique on dec 6 
1989 with a semiautomatic rifle he said his fight was against 
feminists his rampage ended when he turned the gun on himself 
the basilica memorial service was one of many commemorative 
events planned across canada to mark the anniversary of the 
massacre 
it is hard that it is the anniversary especially seeing that 
the weather is much the same as last year said 20yearold ms 
bergeron it is also good that it is the anniversary maybe it 
will be easier from now on 
dressed in a rustcolored coat her auburn hair tied behind her 
head she stood with friends under the massive arches of the 
basilica 
other family members and schoolmates of the victims streamed by 
to enter the service 
some wept more were solemn a few even managed to laugh but 
everyone talked in hushed tones 
friends hugged as they met on the steps 
a man carrying a bouquet of daisies and carnations walked up the 
steps 
at the door security guards checked identification cards and 
invitations a few seats were reserved for journalists but the 
service was intended to be private about 1000 people family and 
friends of victims students school employees and politicians 
filled the dimly lit ornate cathedral 
the hourlong mass led by msgr fernand lecavalier included 
unveiling of a replica of the plaque now on the schools west wall 
engraved with 14 names 
nathalie provost a former student who was wounded in the 
shooting unveiled the replica 
they will rest in our memories and in the memories of those 
who succeed us she said 
many students joined the fight for tighter guncontrol 
legislation after the tragedy 
it was early evening when lepine a baseball cap on his head 
walked into a classroom at the engineering school where students 
were presenting their projects before the christmas break 
he fired his rifle into the ceiling with attention now fixed on 
him he asked the men in the classroom to leave nine women 
remained 
do you know why youre here he asked 
no one answered 
im fighting against feminists he said and started 
shooting 
six of the women were killed three wounded 
then he roamed the halls firing at random finally he turned 
the rifle to his head and pulled the trigger kiling himself 
ms bergeron said people have learned much from the tragedy 
it has opened peoples eyes to the violence against women in 
our society she said 
we both men and women have to take a long look in the 
mirror it may be shocking at what we see but it has to be done

attention to japanese innovations until they arrive in america in 
the form of imports said dr william f finan a former commerce 
department official now engaged in private research and consulting 
as more and more of the major technological breakthroughs 
originate in japan the issue of gaining adequate access to 
japanese research establishments will only gain in importance 
finan testified to the joint economic committee 
he and other witnesses said technology transfer should be a 
twoway street but us industry seems passive about applying 
results of japanese research 
the burden of remedying any asymmetry in technology flow 
between our two countries falls largely to us finan said it 
is essential for the us government to continue to jawbone the 
us engineering and scientific establishment to recognize a 
national priority that we stay abreast of japan in key strategic 
technologies 
finan disputed the belief that japan only absorbs foreign 
knowhow but never supplies it in kind declaring that major 
japanese corporations such as toshiba nec fujitsu hitachi and 
mitsubishi have provided us literally with hours of time of their 
staffs at all levels 
the government should encourage young american engineers 
visiting japan to feel they are participating in a mission of 
national importance he said voicing hope that eventually our 
companies will value executives who have spent time in japan to the 
same degree that japanese executives see the path to the top 
requiring spending time in the us

a judge thursday ordered a 
newspaper reporter jailed because she refused to reveal all that 
she and a murder defendant discussed during interviews 
prosecutors want to enter as trial evidence articles written 
last month by libby averyt about jermarr arnold 32 but the 
reporter and her newspaper the corpus christi callertimes 
maintain anything unpublished is nobody elses business so state 
district judge eric brown held her in contempt 
arnold is accused in the 1983 slaying of jewelry store clerk 
christina marie sanchez in corpus christi 
the 26yearold reporter was expected to go to jail friday 
brown ordered her to remain behind bars until she agrees to answer 
questions about the interviews with arnold 
it will be the second jailing of a texas reporter this year 
san antonio television reporter brian karem was jailed for 13 
days for refusing to reveal who arranged an interview between him 
and a murder suspect 
twelve times during a hearing thursday ms averyt refused to 
answer questions on first amendment grounds she specifically 
refused to reveal any details that were not published 
i dont want to go to jail ms averyt said after the 
hearing but my desire to avoid jail is outweighed by my duty to 
stand up for what i believe in 
if reporters are allowed to be used as others resources a 
consequence may be that reporters will offer the public less and 
less information said larry rose the newspapers executive 
editor 
the newspapers lawyer jorge rangel said he planned to appeal 
to the texas court of criminal appeals in austin to keep the 
reporter free 
our position is that some of the questions call for disclosure 
of unpublished information rangel said wednesday we are 
asserting the reporters qualified privilege under the first 
amendment 
the articles quote arnold as saying that he shot jewelry store 
clerk christina marie sanchez 
defense attorneys dont want the articles admitted into 
evidence if they are allowed the lawyers want ms averyt to 
testify about the content of her interviews 
rangel says a reporters unpublished material is protected by 
the first amendment of the constitution and similar provisions in 
the texas constitution 
last week brown ordered ms averyt to testify the judge gave 
rangel until wednesday to seek a ruling from the 13th court of 
appeals on the case when the corpus christi appeals court refused 
to hear the case rangel took it to the criminal appeals court 
rangel wanted the appeals courts to direct brown to reverse his 
order requiring ms averyt to discuss the unpublished information 
under order from brown last week prosecution and defense 
attorneys submitted a list of potential questions they may ask ms 
averyt 
defense attorneys carl lewis and constance luedicke said last 
week they wanted to be able freely to crossexamine ms averyt 
about information arnold may have divulged that was not included in 
the articles 
district attorney grant jones said last week that the 
prosecution wants to enter the published articles into evidence 
because they contain information that arnold did not reveal to law 
enforcement officers

western governments welcomed saddam husseins 
announcement on thursday that he is freeing all hostages but said 
iraq must still quit kuwait 
president bush said in santiago chile that saddams 
announcement will not change my thinking on his need to comply 
100 percent without condition to the un resolutions calling 
for withdrawal 
british prime minister john major echoed the demand saddam 
hussein still has to withdraw totally and unconditionally from 
kuwait and the legitimate government must be restored he said in 
london 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said in new york 
it was very good news if confirmed but i always need the proper 
official information about it 
french foreign minister roland dumas said saddams decision was 
going in the right direction its a good sign now we have to 
wait for this decision to be executed 
a spontaneous celebration was held at the almansour melia hotel 
in downtown baghdad where several hostages were brought from 
strategic sites to meet with visiting family members 
we did it at last and now we can go home for christmas said 
susan dring who traveled to baghdad last week to try to win her 
husbands freedom 
michael dring stood behind her celebrating with a can of 
imported beer 
the reaction from hostage relatives around the world ranged from 
cautious optimism to uncontained joy 
im over the moon its what weve prayed and prayed for 
said sue dorrington whose british husband is being held in 
baghdad 
i have been in tears all morning since i heard the news i 
just hope it is true said linda grant part of a group of 30 
women related to british airways employees who planned to go to 
baghdad this weekend 
relatives of americans held in iraq expressed delight 
there were times i couldnt eat i couldnt sleep said 
doris whatley of shreveport la all of a sudden i am a changed 
person because my husband is coming home 
italys foreign minister gianni de michelis said the 
announcement caused deep satisfaction for the italian government 
and for me personally he said he hoped it was a first step 
toward full compliance with un resolutions demanding iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan said the crisis should be 
resolved fairly and peacefully based on complete implementation of 
the un resolutions i hope that this measure by iraq is the 
first step toward achieving that goal 
irish foreign affairs minister gerry collins said in dublin that 
he was very pleased by the report but we are somewhat cautious 
and will be so until such time as the news is confirmed 
britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said the embassy in 
baghdad was seeking details on how the release would be organized 
if president saddam hussein does not comply in full with the 
security council resolutions then he will be forced to do so if 
he does comply then he will not be attacked hurd said in the 
house of commons 
hurd said it was not known whether saddams announcement applied 
to 440 britons known to be in hiding in kuwait which iraq invaded 
aug 2 
there are nearly 1200 britons held in iraq and kuwait and 
about 250 irish citizens 
swiss foreign minister andrea reichlin said the government was 
reacting cautiously to the news switzerland has seven citizens 
detained in iraq 
at the london headquarters of the gulf support group which aids 
relatives of hostages spokesman andy charles said the families 
were cautiously optimistic and cautiously delighted but weve 
had a lot of similar announcements in the past which have not borne 
fruit

security council members thursday held 
private talks on a draft resolution that contemplates a peace 
conference on the palestinian problem one of iraqs key demands 
for solving the kuwait crisis 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein told his parliament 
to free all foreign hostages his announcement came just hours 
after the text of the draft resolution was leaked and widely 
reported and the releases may begin as early as saturday 
officials said 
saddam said he made his hostagerelease decision to respond to 
positive changes on the diplomatic front 
on friday president bush proposed diplomatic exchanges with 
iraq secretary of state james a baker iii will meet saddam in 
baghdad while iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz will come to 
washington to see bush 
saddam has also noted the us congressional hearings on the 
persian gulf crisis in which many senators and former us 
officials have challenged the wisdom of military action against 
iraq 
in its deliberations on the israelioccupied lands the un 
security council has been considering steps to protect 
palestinians a scheduled meeting set for thursday afternoon was 
suddenly postponed until friday and diplomats met in private and 
consulted with their capitals 
however on the eve of his arrival in the united states for an 
official visit israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said in 
london that israel rejects a possible un call for an 
international conference on peace in the middle east 
israel will not agree to any foreign body deciding its future 
and fate he said 
the bush administration meanwhile took pains to stress that is 
not pushing for any immediate peace conference 
bush visiting chile said thursday there is no linkage 
between an iraqi pullout from kuwait and israeli withdrawal from 
arab lands 
the united states will not give saddam some facesaving way 
out of something he shouldnt have gotten into in the first 
place bush told a news conference 
bushs spokesman said washington was making changes in the 
language of the un resolution us officials at the united 
nations confirmed that report but said the changes di not alter the 
basic thrust of the draft 
were trying to work out language that is acceptable that 
meets our policy obviously the un wants to speak to this 
issue said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater who was in 
chile with bush 
the release of all hostages is one of the key demands of the 
security council which also insists that iraq unconditionally 
withdraw its troops from kuwait and restore the government of the 
emir of kuwait 
a week ago the security council voted 122 with one 
abstention to authorize all necessary means including a 
military strike to force iraq to leave kuwait unless it complies 
by jan 15 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
britain soviet union france and china agreed in principle 
wednesday on a text that contemplates a future middle east peace 
conference 
the approved working paper would have the council say that 
it considers that the convening at an appropriate time of an 
international peace conference on the middle east properly 
structured with the participation of the parties concerned would 
facilitate the achievement of a comprehensive settlement and 
lasting peace in the middle east 
the problem of a homeland for the palestinians would be central 
to any such peace settlement 
it is the first time the united states has approved of the 
council taking up the issue of a middle east peace conference 
an earlier draft proposal offered by cuba yemen malaysia and 
colombia would have said the council welcomes the calls for 
convening a peace conference that language was diluted 
wednesday 
saddam proposed on aug 12 just 10 days after his troops 
conquered kuwait that a solution to the palestinian homeland 
question must be linked to any discussion of the withdrawal of his 
army from the emirate 
the text that the security council is considering however 
contains so many caveats that the proposed middle east peace 
conference could be years in the making if it happens at all 
the proposed resolution contains numerous loopholes that would 
allow israel to delay or abort the process the clause requiring 
the participation of the parties concerned gives israel virtual 
veto power over the conference 
with shamir due to arrive friday in the united states the leak 
of the councils working paper sent us officials into a 
flurry of denials that they were calling for a peace conference 
baker testified before congress on thursday saying this is 
certainly not the time for an international conference 
weve taken the position for a long time that an international 
conference properly structured at an appropriate time might be 
useful baker said 
baker also denied there was any linkage between the kuwait 
situation and the palestinian problem

prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
thursday he was going to the united states with several ideas 
for reviving the israeliarab peace process but added the gulf 
crisis must be resolved first 
shamir also thanked secretary of state james a baker iii for 
his pledge of american support in case of an iraqi attack on 
israel but said the jewish state must fight its own battles 
we welcome bakers remarks but we never rely on anyone 
even if he is the best friend of israel shamir told reporters at 
ben gurion international airport before leaving for a nineday trip 
to britain and the united states 
on tuesday shamir was scheduled to hold talks with president 
bush on the persian gulf crisis and the israeliarab conflict 
relations between the two leaders reportedly have been strained 
because of shamirs rejection of us compromises for starting 
peace talks us officials have demanded that shamir bring 
creative ideas to his talks with bush 
asked whether he had any new ideas shamir said concerning 
the effort that will have to be made i assume after the 
resolution of this gulf crisis in order to advance a settlement 
of the conflict between the arab world and israel i have 
several ideas on where to begin and how to continue and very much 
hope we will succeed in this discussion 
baker had proposed holding preliminary peace talks in cairo but 
shamir opposed the composition of the palestinian delegation 
saying it was an attempt to give the plo a role in negotiations 
concerning the gulf crisis shamir said the world had a special 
obligation toward israel israel is the most threatened perhaps 
among all the countries threatened by iraq he said 
asked whether a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis would 
leave israel to fight iraq alone he said i dont think we are 
facing such a situation but israel is ready for every possible 
situation and will have to act according to the conditions that 
arise

the maker of an expensive drug used to 
treat schizophrenia said it will study alternative ways of 
monitoring its use that could cut costs and make it available to 
more people 
the new york times reported thursday that the swissowned drug 
company sandoz pharmaceuticals folded to congressional and public 
pressure and agreed to reduce the cost of clozapine 
the drug costs 8944 in the united states for a years supply 
a significant portion of the cost is believed to come from a 
monitoring system required by sandoz that guards against 
potentially fatal side effects 
an official for the east hanoverbased company said wednesday 
the company agreed only to look for different ways to monitor the 
drug 
it could change the overall price structure but we dont know 
how much at this point in time said dr david l winter vice 
president of scientific and external affairs at sandoz 
the food and drug administration estimates 200000 severe 
schizophrenics in the united states could benefit from the drug 
but because of the cost only about 7000 people are taking it 
many veterans hospitals and state programs refuse to use the 
drug because of its expense they have said they could save 
millions of dollars by monitoring the drug themselves 
six states led by minnesota have threatened antitrust 
lawsuits and legislation has been introduced in congress to make 
the drug more affordable 
patients taking clozapine are monitored for agranulocytosis a 
potentially fatal side effect that reduces the level of 
infectionfighting white blood cells 
sandoz has a contract with caremark home services a national 
home health care firm to operate a monitoring system in which all 
patients taking the drug are given blood tests weekly 
the company withholds the following weeks dosage if a patients 
white blood cell count is down or if a blood test is not taken 
winter said

a rare autograph of shoeless joe jackson 
the illiterate banned baseball player whose legend has grown with 
the help of hollywood sold for 23100 thursday at auction 
it was the secondhighest price paid for a signature not 
attached to a document and it makes jacksons autograph worth more 
than babe ruths ty cobbs or even abraham lincolns experts 
said 
the shaky writing is on a 4inch by 1inch piece torn from a 
legal paper in 1936 said herman darvick who staged the auction 
the signature of button gwinnett a signer of the declaration of 
independence set the record for an unattached signature selling 
for about 56000 darvick said 
the signature like other jackson signatures made on legal 
documents in 1922 and 1937 is crude and belabored darvick said 
he said jacksons wife generally signed his autograph and the 
ballplayer signed only formal documents 
darvick originally estimated the signature would sell for 1500 
to 2000 he said it was obtained by a collector of baseball 
autographs about 25 years ago 
the collector who thought it might be worth about 100 had 
obtained it from jacksons family in greenville sc darvick 
said 
he had no idea of its value he said 
jackson was recently memorialized in two movies eight men 
out the story of how the chicago white sox sold the 1919 world 
series to gamblers and field of dreams in which jackson 
returns from the dead to play baseball in an iowa corn field

13year career that ended abruptly after the 1920 season when the 
commissioner of baseball banned him and seven others from the sport 
for life for accepting money to throw the 1919 series to 
cincinnati

iraq told the world on thursday that all foreign hostages would 
be freed some as early as this weekend but president bush said 
release of the thousands of hostages would not weaken us resolve 
to get iraqi troops out of kuwait 
in the united nations iraqs un ambassador said all the 
hostages including an estimated 900 americans held in iraq and 
kuwait since iraqi forces overran the oilrich emirate on aug 2 
would likely be home by christmas 
definitely we would like to see everyone with his family by 
christmas because that is a very joyous and happy occasion and it 
is time for family reunions un ambassador abdul amir alanbari 
said 
iraq officials late thursday said foreigners can begin leaving 
saturday and that those in baghdad the capital city can apply 
immediately for exit visas processing could take days though the 
officials said 
the state department said in washington that the voice of 
america was broadcasting a message thursday night meant for us 
citizens in iraq and kuwait saying we are making preparations 
to evacuate all us citizens as soon as they are permitted to 
leave 
saddam husseins dramatic announcement signaled the removal of a 
major obstacle to resolving the persian gulf crisis 
but bush said saddam should not have taken people hostage in the 
first place and insisted the man must leave kuwait without 
reservation without condition before the standoff can end 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said in a statement 
congress could take no credit for any release of hostages and 
it looks like saddam is finally hearing the administrations 
tough message loud and clear 
the news of saddams announcement sent oil prices plunging to 
their lowest level since august when iraq invaded its neighbor 
the initial drop was more than 2 a barrel but closed thursday 
on the new york mercantile exchange at 2640 a barrel an 89cent 
loss 
gold prices and the dollar historically considered safe ways to 
protect money during times of political and economic travail also 
ended with losses which some trading professionals attributed to 
the prospects of peace 
on the new york commodity exchange gold settled at 37170 an 
ounce off 250 from wednesday 
several governments and relatives of hostages quickly welcomed 
saddams announcement which the iraqi leader called a response to 
the positive changes of recent diplomatic moves 
its an answer to our prayers said rande vallekoop whose 
husband has been stranded at the us embassy in baghdad 
we have been praying him home for christmas and it looks 
like our answer is coming she said from minneapolis 
one american detained in baghdad was absolutely elated 
thilled at saddams decision a british hostage popped open a 
can of imported beer in celebration 
i feel delirious that i can leave said david farington a 
british worker stranded in baghdad by the iraqi invasion he became 
one of the foreigners saddam kept captive to deter an attack on 
iraq some were kept at strategic sites to serve as human shields 
against attack 
there are hundreds of thousands of foreigners in iraq and 
occupied kuwait but saddam earlier said most asians and arabs 
the majority of the foreigners were free to leave 
baker said the united states had received official notification 
in baghdad that the thousands of foreigners would be set free it 
was unclear when 
saddams announcement was made by the official iraqi news 
agency which published a letter from him instructing the national 
assembly to approve the release 
i invite you to take a just decision to end the travel ban 
imposed on foreigners and restore to all of them the freedom to 
travel we apologize to those who may have been harmed and from 
god we seek forgiveness the letter said 
saddam also said iraq had completed its deployment in kuwait 
and therefore the hostages were not longer needed to prevent an 
attack pentagon spokesman bob hall estimated thursday that more 
than 480000 iraqi troops now are in and around the conquered 
emirate facing a nearly 400000strong multinational force in the 
gulf that includes 250000 american troops 
saddam did not say when the foreigners would be freed but 
parliament routinely accepts his recommendations and the release 
was expected soon after the vote which could come as early as 
friday 
bush administration officials are trying to convince congress 
that trade sanctions against iraq will not force its withdrawal 
from kuwait and that the lawmakers should support a possible 
military strike on iraqi forces 
saddams announcement appeared to be an attempt to influence 
those deliberations and the direct usiraq talks scheduled in 
washington and baghdad for later this month 
bush stressed that no secret deal with saddam was in the works 
or would be considered 
the release of all hostages would be a very good thing but 
the problem is the aggression against kuwait and the man must 
leave kuwait without condition bush said of saddam 
no single hostage should have been taken in the first place 
and i hope saddam understands that his hostage policy has 
incurred the hostility of the whole world bush told a news 
conference in santiago chile his latest stop on a south american 
tour 
bush also discouraged efforts by several un nations to set up 
a mideast peace conference 
he said there is no linkage between an iraqi pullout from 
kuwait and israeli withdrawal from palestinian territories which 
saddam has demanded as a condition for withdrawal 
the united states will not give saddam hussein some 
facesaving way out of something he shouldnt have gotten into in 
the first place he said 
last week the un security council authorized force against 
iraq by jan 15 if it fails to withdraw from kuwait 
in washington baker was pressing ahead with efforts to win 
congressional support for using force against iraqi troops if they 
do not pull out of kuwait soon 
baker told congress that releasing the hostages does not 
lessen nor should it our determination that iraqs aggression 
against kuwait should be reversed 
britain spain and ireland welcomed saddams move and western 
hostages and their relatives were jubilant 
the wife of one detained american said her husband in baghdad 
was absolutely elated thrilled at saddams decision i feel 
a little free now for the first time in months said doris 
whatley of shreveport la whose husband donald called her from 
baghdad after the announcement 
mrs whatley said her husband an oil foreman held since the 
invasion hoped to hurry home to visit his critically ill father 
he told me he was just so happy because he would have a chance 
to see his daddy one last time mrs whatley said

thousands overran this tiny town thursday 
in a growing pilgrimage to a church where each day since 
thanksgiving an image many believe looks like the virgin mary has 
appeared on a wall 
about 5000 people waited in line for a look at the strange 
light 
i think its a miracle said marie cammarota 60 of 
sacramento after making her way through st dominics church 
the daily crush of visitors to the roman catholic church 
threatens to overwhelm this community of 1000 people in the 
foothills of the sierra nevada range 
the apparition appears each day for just one hour from about 
930 am to 1030 am 
many prayed as they filed through the church which seats 200 
people some wept and some were skeptical 
it was weird i think its what you want it to be if 
youre into religion then you see the virgin mary said tyler 
palacio 13 
everyone agreed they saw something it started as faint curved 
lines of red blue green purple and pink light the lines 
darkened and extended into a shape that looked like the top half of 
a figure then it faded away 
the image always appears above a statue of jesus on a wall 
facing the sun it might be explained as the optical effect of a 
light fixture hanging from the roof the fixture may be reflecting 
colored light coming through a stainedglass window and throwing it 
back onto the wall 
the reflection theory is discounted by those who said the image 
has appeared even on cloudy days 
bishop francis quinn of the sacramento diocese which includes 
colfax about 45 miles east of sacramento said if the image 
persists he will establish a commission to investigate it 
it could be the image of the blessed mary in a silhouette 
pose quinn said as he sees it she is holding the infant 
jesus in her arms to the left side 
police chief bill mintline said residents arent bothered by the 
fuss 
its not like a rock concert crowd mintline said

a year after sweeping to power 
eastern europes intellectuals face a dilemma how to mesh their 
old job of keeping the national identity with the new one of 
conducting practical politics 
for 40 years these men and women preserved the cultures of 
their nations in spite of communist repression and guarded 
individuality against collectivism 
intellectuals have played a similar role for at least 100 years 
in the region whose 19th century nationalist movements were 
founded by thinkers determined to find places for their nations 
apart from giant alien empires 
when the soviet empire suddenly crumbled last year politics 
fell in many cases to the dissidents and intellectuals the only 
figures sufficiently untainted by communism 
after a deluge of economl be swept out 
a senior aide to president vaclav havel said its fun when 
you can work on the intellectual concepts but its not when you 
get caught up in schedules and routine 
the aide speaking on condition of anonymity reflected a 
certain distaste for daytoday politics that some commentators and 
foreign observers see as a serious flaw 
its sad but theres almost no politician in sight said 
vladimir mlynar a former dissident who now is a journalist at the 
daily lidove noviny 
havel doesnt see this too well because his pet theory is that 
politicians have brought the world to ruin mlynar said 
his problem is that as a dissident he made up this theory of 
moral politics when he became president he found out you must 
behave differently because your opponents behave like politicians 
he would not admit this but hes learning 
the problem is perhaps most acute in czechoslovakia where havel 
and other dissidents went in mere weeks from the underground to the 
presidential castle that dominates pragues skyline 
in poland intellectuals were able to ally with the workers 10 
years ago in solidarity even after solidarity was suppressed real 
politics continued underground 
change also was more gradual in hungary where some dissident 
opposition was tolerated in 1985 the hungarians held partially 
free elections for a communistdominated parliament 
in bulgaria as in czechoslovakia everything seemed to happen 
at once the ouster in a politburo coup of todor zhivkov who had 
led the nation for 35 years caught both the opposition and much of 
the communist party by surprise 
the party had never articulated its internal split between 
reformers and stalinists and the opposition had just begun to 
organize they are still quarreling over who should rule 
only in romania did key intellectuals stand aloof from politics 
largely refusing to join either the technocratdominated national 
salvation front or the opposition 
their attempt to continue acting as the nations conscience 
however drowned in the emotion and intrigues of everyday politics 
one result of the sudden changes and the intellectuals new role 
is a dearth of cultural interest across the region 
we have lost our theme said alex koenigsmark a 
czechoslovak playwright dodging the censors and communist 
oppression used to unite spectators and artists in a kind of 
plot he said now we must search for new identity 
some intellectuals have been slow to abandon what koenigsmark 
called the stalinist warmth of the old system which lured 
artists into conformity by offering the material comforts of 
special holiday homes or guaranteed fees 
tens of thousands of other intellectuals eked out livings in 
undemanding jobs their reward was plenty of free time to read and 
debate existential problems in a fashion that exhilarated 
westerners absorbed in material gain 
financial needs also occupy eastern brains these days 
we have simply no time to read anymore said vasil 
atanassov a bulgarian translator now we have to make money 
this means east european societies are stripped of the very 
people who as mlynar put it should shove the mirror in 
politicians faces so they cannot move outside certain 
boundaries 
in western societies this role is played largely by the media 
free independent media are slow to emerge in eastern europe where 
most people know only totalitarianism 
especially in the balkans a torrent of emotional comment poses 
as free reporting 
even at lidove noviny which existed in the underground it 
often proves difficult for former dissidents to stand back from the 
petty intrigues of daily politics or to criticize friends in power 
collapsing economies add to the woes culture no longer enjoys 
heavy subsidies meaning soaring ticket and book prices that drive 
audiences away 
western pop and pornography long forbidden are touted 
blatantly throughout eastern europe the popular concept that 
freedom equals the absence of control makes it difficult to impose 
limits on such wares 
idealists who could sketch the new identities for which society 
might strive find such a climate unwelcoming 
its quite nice to have visions wrote jaroslav weiss a 
lidove noviny columnist but you have to have money for that

the institute of the arab world opened three years 
ago as a showcase of arab culture faces hard times as the persian 
gulf crisis chokes off donations from kuwait and other major 
benefactors 
the cultural center which attracts about 5000 visitors a day 
occupies a stunning building beside the seine it was created to 
promote western understanding but turmoil in the arab world has 
taken its toll 
france paid most of the 100 million cost of construction for 
the institute which contains a research center auditorium and 
exhibition halls it also has provided 60 percent of the 20 
million yearly operating budget or about 12 million last year 
under the institutes founding charter members of the arab 
league were to pay the remaining 40 percent edga pisani the 
institute director said only half a dozen of the 21 counties had 
paid their share resulting in an arab debt of 30 million 
accumulated since 1987 
pisani said france would not take over the institutes entire 
cost and operation 
to keep the center in operation he has eliminated jobs cut the 
budget for buying manuscripts and other materials and refused to 
accept exhibitions or cultural events unless outside parties pay 
for them in advance 
the newspaper le monde said onefourth of the institute staff 
about 50 people had been laid off 
lack of money has been a problem since president francois 
mitterrand inaugurated the institute in 1987 but things have grown 
worse since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
le monde reported that kuwait which once contributed 12 
million a year was paying nothing it said other major debtors 
included saudi arabia iraq egypt libya and the united arab 
emirates 
political arguments also have plagued the institute insiders 
accused its first director of hiring a disproportionate number of 
lebanese and not giving all member countries equal influence 
money is just a pretext whats 30 million to a rich gulf 
state said a lebanese researcher who regularly makes use of the 
institutes facilities the real problem is politics the 
relations among the arabs 
the institute has no leadership or direction and it is not the 
research center it was supposed to be he said on condition of 
anonymity other research facilities in paris have more arabic 
manuscripts than the institute he said 
others argue that because the institute depends on donors it 
cannot be an authentic showcase of arab culture 
if the library does not have a work which attacks algeria 
even indirectly if the film library does not have a certain movie 
that the saudis dont like then all is lost philippe gardenal 
wrote in liberation a leftist newspaper 
he said paris could end up with a sanitized view of the arab 
world just another stop on the itinerary of hurried tourists 
rushing from the department stores to the folies bergeres 
saudi arabia recently canceled an exhibition of photographs 
about the country without explanation iraq demanded the removal 
of a syrian caricature from an earlier display on grounds the 
caricature resembled president saddam hussein 
plans had been made for 1991 to be the year of morocco they 
were canceled when relations between france and morocco 
deteriorated because of a bestselling french biography critical of 
king hassan ii 
some commentators have suggested the institute focus on frances 
arab population about 5 million arabs live in the country and 
many are out of touch with their own culture 
jean nouvel of france designed the institute whose sleek 
metallic facade curves along a bend in the seine 
it has been described as one of the most daring and beautiful 
buildings in mitterrands ambitious statefinanced construction 
program other projects included the new bastille opera house and 
the louvre museums glass pyramid 
nouvel said he was inspired by traditional arab architecture 
space is defined by light and shadow sunlight filters 
dramatically through an interior facade composed of 25000 metal 
diaphragms reminiscent of the intricate wooden screens on 
traditional arab windows 
the institute offers temporary exhibits europes largest 
reference library on the arab world video facilities and 
electronic data banks a 500seat auditorium and a restaurant with 
a breathtaking view of the paris skyline and notre dame cathedral

whittaker said in a telephone interview from his home near seattle 
it was more of a climb to see if people of different cultures 
could get together to work for a common goal 
the message is of people doing things that are difficult for 
the good of the world 
the idea for the international peace climb came to whittaker six 
years ago in preglasnost days when relations between the 
superpowers were chillier 
whittaker a worldclass mountaineer in 1963 when he became the 
first american to stand atop everest assumed the role of 
globetrotting diplomat shuttling between beijing and moscow 
looking for a commitment to the climb 
when i was in china and approached the idea to the chinese 
they said we have not had soviets in our country in 30 years 
whittaker said 
and i said yes i understood that but you had come to our 
country with pingpong balls and pingpong paddles and wed like to 
come to your country with the soviets with ice axes and crampons 
the americans financed through whittakers lectures 
individual and corporate contributions and support from the outdoor 
industry supplied the cash and equipment to mount the 11 
million expedition to the top of everest located on the border of 
nepal and tibet 
still the soviets and the chinese were slow to agree for fear 
the other nation would back out they joined only after 
considerable negotiations 
for the 61yearold expedition leader the climb had another 
symbolic goal beyond goodwill among the three nations 
the mountaineers originally expected to be on the summit april 
22 the 20th anniversary of earth day a chance to highlight that 
we were going to clean the earth from the top down whittaker 
said 
severe cold and 100 mph winds delayed the summit attempt for 
more than a week but on may 7 the mountaineers awoke to perfect 
weather 
setting aside language differences and disputes over climbing 
styles six climbers two from each nation made it to the 
29028foot summit the top of the world 
during a remarkable fourday window of favorable weather 14 
more members of the expedition ascended no previous expedition had 
put 20 people on the summit in 1985 a norwegian group had 17 
reach the top 
whittaker who did not try for the summit knows his team made 
up of the best climbers from each country was lucky as well as 
skillful no one died and no one was seriously hurt 
in everest history for every two climbers who had been 
successful one has died in the attempt 
we ran into quite a bit of difficulty but it always seemed to 
work out whittaker said it seemed like the gods all said 
lets give these guys a tough time because we dont want it to be 
easy in the end though we had the good luck right when we 
needed it

in times like these a trenchant old question gnaws at 
consciences when should nations go to war and for what 
that is the moral issue troubling the nations churches and 
most are saying no not now not yet wait have patience seek 
talks negotiate pursue every just avenue to avoid the inevitable 
horrors of war 
that burning apprehensive note echoed through statements of 
protestant roman catholic and orthodox church leaders as the 
united nations backed by the united states authorized the use of 
force against iraq if that nation does not withdraw from kuwait by 
midjanuary 
the anxious restraining plea had not been noticeable in the 
immediate aftermath of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
in that period most churches strongly condemned the aggression 
the abuse of civilians and taking of hostages supporting the 
international embargo against iraq and the moves by the united 
states and others to defend saudi arabia 
mainly church voices still hold those positions but now 
indicate alarm at potential offensive tactics against iraq 
they want the united nations to take a principal role and 
remain hopeful that steady international pressure will bring a 
peaceful solution but they bridle at talk of a military offensive 
expressing fear the crisis is leading our nation steadily 
toward war heads of most of the countrys main protestant and 
eastern orthodox churches last week declared we are convinced 
that war as a means of settling international disputes is in 
conflict with the teachings of our faith 
the group of 15 church leaders including top episcopal 
lutheran orthodox american baptist presbyterian reformed 
united church and national council of churches officers said they 
want justice done in the area 
they also reiterated condemnation of iraqs aggression and 
support for the un sanctions but they urged the number of 
american troops there be reduced to those the united nations 
requires to maintain peace and security 
we believe that resorting to war to force a solution on the 
issue would be disastrous in its human and environnmental costs 
the leaders said 
their stand was similar to that expressed in midnovember by the 
national conference of catholic bishops although the bishops did 
not suggest a reduction of us forces in saudi arabia saying 
instead 
we understand that a strong military presence can give 
credibility to a vigorous pursuit of nonviolent solutions to the 
crisis 
however after a closed discussion in washington by the bishops 
their president archbishop daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati wrote 
to president bush urging him to stick to peaceful pressure and 
not resort to war 
noting that the churchs criteria for just war require that 
it be a last resort after all peace efforts fail that the goal 
outweigh the likely damage inflicted and that it minimize civilian 
casualties the letter said 
moving beyond the deployment of military forces to the 
undertaking of offensive military action could well violate these 
criteria especially the principles of proportionality and last 
resort 
the national council of churches including most major 
protestant and orthodox denominations called for a halt to the 
buildup of us forces in the region and also urged they be pared 
to those needed by the united nations 
the united states increasingly prepares for war a war that 
could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of lives and the 
devastation of the region the councils governing board said at 
a midnovember meeting in portland ore 
in the face of such reckless and imprudent behavior we 
have a moral responsibility publicly and unequivocally to oppose 
actions that could have such dire consequences the church 
representatives added 
in cleveland the rev paul h sherry president of the united 
church of christ sent a letter to bush saying 
the steady drumbeat of war messages from you and your 
administration have sent a shocking message 
we want you in turn to hear the clear message from the 
religious community do not lead the us into war with iraq war 
is not the solution to iraqs immoral invasion of kuwait and will 
lead to severe suffering for untold numbers of people 
the united methodist council of bishops urged bush as a 
manifestation of his faith in god as revealed in jesus christ to 
pursue every diplomatic avenue to solve the crisis rather than 
military action 
representatives of the three historic peace churches the 
brethren friends and mennonites want american troops withdrawn 
completely telling bush that our own hunch is that you are 
talking us toward war out of economic interests 
advocating simpler lifestyles to conserve energy and development 
of alternative energy sources the peace churches added 
we fear there will be a growing tendency to go to war in the 
coming years over resources such as petroleum if we do not find 
ways to curtail our dependency on them

only 4 million of this officially bilingual 
countrys 265 million people are officially bilingual and most of 
them are french canadians who learned english 
the main effort to remedy that situation and fulfill national 
policy is called french immersion which now involves 73 percent 
of all schoolchildren 
every weekday more than 250000 englishspeaking children troop 
to classrooms around the country and spend all or most of the day 
studying in french enrollment increases every year 
unlike french programs 20 years ago which graduated students 
who could not speak french sometimes after nine years of studying 
the language french immersion programs are producing functionally 
bilingual graduates said diberville fortier canadas 
commissioner of official languages 
herns pierrejerome head of french immersion at lawrence park 
high school in toronto added students in the program not only 
have an opportunity to master a language but in terms of learning 
they are open to other dimensions 
ever since the british sneaked up on the french at quebec in 
1759 and defeated them on the plains of abraham french speakers 
have been at a disadvantage they make up a quarter of canadas 
population but their minority thrives only in the province of 
quebec and in scattered pockets elsewhere 
english canada never troubled itself much with learning french 
then in 1969 prime minister pierre trudeau pushed through the 
official languages act it declared french and english to be the 
official languages of canada and obliged all federal institutions 
to provide services in both languages 
the law put bilingualism at a premium particularly for federal 
jobs and made the dual nature of canadian society official 
experiments with french immersion began in the 1960s programs 
blossomed in the 1970s and 1980s early fears that childrens 
english would suffer or that performance in other subjects would be 
affected have been allayed for the most part 
as an educational experiment its a resounding success 
said sharon lapkin a professor at the university of toronto and 
researcher at the modern language center of the ontario institute 
for studies in education 
french immersion has its opponents among them hector hammerly 
a professor of linguistics at simon fraser university in british 
columbia this is how he describes the problem 
its not really immersion they are not surrounded by french 
speakers they are surrounded by 25 other children who speak french 
as badly as they do 
hammerly cited a study indicating that 52 percent of simple 
sentences written by immersion students had one or more errors in 
grammar or vocabulary 
the immersion approach does not work and cannot work he 
said it forces children to communicate far beyond what they 
know they make far more errors than a teacher can correct 
effectively 
lori nash of ottawa head of a national group that favors a more 
traditional approach to learning french said they cant be 
taught they cant learn and they cant explore in a second 
language as well as in their mother tongue 
claims by others that the program is elitist bring a more mixed 
response 
is the system elitist ms lapkin asked yes should it 
be no does it have to be no are there places where it is less 
so yes 
pat brehaut of sherwood park alberta is president of canadian 
parents for french one of the main organizations supporting french 
immersion she agrees immersion may have been elitist in the 
beginning when many of the children came from bettereducated 
families of the professional and managerial class 
i think now if you look at children going into the program 
you see a balance of abilities and a balance of socioeconomic 
backgrounds she said 
demand continues to increase in some parts of the country 
parents line up to enroll their children in immersion programs 
they are still waiting in calgary and there always have been 
waiting lists in prince edward island mrs brehaut said 
it has been growing since the day it started she said a 
year ago cpf did a survey and we found that 69 percent of 
englishspeaking parents wanted their children to learn french 
even the most vocal proponents of the program acknowledge 
shortcomings 
according to fortier the federal languages commissioner major 
problems include low participation at the secondary school level 
teacher shortages that the program does not work for all school 
districts and that immersion graduates do not have real fluency 
how the success is evaluated depends on goals and definitions 
merrill swain head of the modern language center said the 
goals are to develop language skills better than those achieved by 
traditional french classes with no loss of mothertongue 
proficiency and no loss in general academic achievement 
she said immersion had achieved those goals 
does bilingualism mean speaking perfect french or just the 
ability to communicate effectively 
you cant expect an anglophone child to become a 
francophone said marieantoinette mantione assistant 
coordinator for french as a second language at the toronto board of 
education 
children working in totally english environments cannot be 
expected to become perfect speakers of french but experts agree 
the major achievement is functionally bilingual children who 
are able to communicate and be at ease when speaking french 
ms swain said immersion is probably the most studied program in 
the history of education surveys have shown there is no longterm 
detrimental effect on the students english academic achievement 
is comparable to students taught in english and students acquire a 
high level of confidence in their ability to handle french 
another benefit is that the young english canadians have a 
better understanding of their frenchspeaking compatriots from 
quebec and elsewhere 
these kids can speak french with an ease that is way beyond 
what could be done in a traditional program 20 years ago said 
roy harvey principal of lawrence park what has that contributed 
to a general understanding and tolerance in this country i would 
say a lot

if one sure thing emerged from the agriculture 
departments recent outlook conference it was a feeling that 
bankers and cooperative lenders arent hitting it off too well 
these days 
the latest sniping concerns a report released last month by the 
american bankers association showing that a liberalization of farm 
credit system lending policies 19 years ago led to a land boom in 
the 1970s and a bust in the 1980s 
congress created the fcs more than 70 years ago to provide 
farmers with a dependable source of credit at competitive rates 
today the system is a 60 billion network of farmerowned 
lending institutions which include federal land bank and 
production credit associations 
according to the bankerfinanced study by ely amp co inc of 
arlington va the fcs fueled a financially unsupportable 
farmland price boom after congress revised the farm credit act in 
1971 so the cooperatively owned system could liberalize its lending 
powers 
the 1971 law among other things raised the systems collateral 
limit to 85 percent of the market value of farmland from the 
previous standard of 65 percent of its agricultural 
incomeproducing value 
peter c myers president of the farm credit council the chiehing 
more 
powerful a change in the american public opionion which will 
impose restrictions on the decisions and intentions of the evil 
ones led by bush the enemy of god 
but despite this change he said the iraqi armed forces 
should maintain the highest degree of alert and vigilance because 
the forces of aggression remain on our sacred soil in saudi arabia 
fanning the flames of fire 
iraq banned foreigners from leaving in response to the allied 
troop buildup in saudi arabia the united states has contributed 
230000 troops and promised another 200000 iraq has deployed 
430000 troops in southern iraq and kuwait 
saddam said that when the travel ban was first announced iraqi 
forces had not completed their mobilization in kuwait to confront 
a potential military aggression 
now that the iraqi military is battle ready saddam said 
the foreigners should regain their freedom to travel 
we deem it necessary that our national assembly convene to 
take a final and irrevocable stand toward a humanitarian issue

gone are the goose step the old 
allies the pledge to protect communism from the evil forces of the 
other side gone too is the other side 
the east german soldiers who once stood on the cold war front 
find the front has moved to their flank what once was the enemy 
flag flies over their garrisons old foes are now commanders and 
comrades 
welcome to nato soldier your old mission with the warsaw pact 
is finished so is the warsaw pact 
once pointed defiantly westward the national peoples army now 
wears the uniform of a united german military a more benign entity 
pointed nowhere in particular 
without firing a shot the west german armed forces took over 
their eastern counterpart in a single day then fired most of the 
officers and cut the force almost in half in a matter of weeks 
what has been billed as a merger is essentially a purge the 
remaining soldiers must apply to stay if they are approved they 
will undergo a twoyear probation to determine whether they have 
the right ideological stuff to continue their careers 
for old soldiers like me the generals and commanders it was 
right to dismiss them theres a new command said gerhard 
seifert an ousted communist general who led an engineering corps 
but firing other professional soldiers i think they moved too 
quickly 
seifert lives in wildpark west a village of large homes hidden 
in a forest outside berlin and surrounded by a military complex 
once known as national peoples army defense district no 84 
before world war ii wildpark west was an exclusive resort for 
some of berlins wealthiest people after germany was divided it 
became home to top officers in the east german army 
now wildpark west is esentially a retirement community 
seifert who spent 38 years in the army warmly welcomed a 
visitor and displayed snapshots his wife took on oct 10 the day 
he relinquished his command 
one shows him on a couch in uniform drinking cognac with gen 
eckard jantzen the west german who took over the base outside 
potsdam 18 miles south of berlin 
for years we were painted a portrait of the western soldiers 
as the enemy seifert 59 said jovially but on that day we 
were all military men 
seifert who was 12 when he watched american planes bomb his 
native chemnitz during world war ii said he had no animosity 
toward the west and realized the necessity of his nations 
evolution 
he expressed disappointment however that professional east 
german military personnel were dismissed so quickly 
career soldiers too young for pensions and too old for new 
work face a difficult future seifert said 
the western army also is becoming smaller but has not shrunk so 
dramatically 
to get the four world war ii allies who conquered germany to 
agree to reunification the nation must reduce its total forces to 
370000 by 1994 
on oct 3 unification day west germany had 460000 soldiers 
and the east had 110000 
only 6000080000 now remain in eastern germany and the west 
has about 450000 defense department spokesman walter 
reichenmiller said 
many soldiers in the east have quit or were conscripts who had 
their tours of duty reduced about 25000 most of them officers 
were dismissed for being too close to old regime 
ultimately the goal is 50000 eastern troops and 320000 in the 
west reichenmiller said 
for the soldiers who remain the biggest challenge will be 
thinking differently 
east german soldiers promised to defend communism and were 
subject to rigid external discipline 
west germans in a reaction to nazi brutality have been 
schooled in innere fuehrung or moral leadership a philosophy 
that teaches a code of honor humanity selfdiscipline and 
responsibility 
one of our major concerns is to educate our eastern friends in 
the terms of how we think a military individual should relate to a 
community reichenmiller said 
its a formidable job certainly it wont work with 
everybody but there are enough people there who are young enough 
tolerant enough to learn 
klaus becher a security analyst with the german society for 
foreign politics in cologne said tensions had arisen because 
western officers know little about the men they now command 
its uneasy to say the least he said some of the 
western soldiers look down on their colleagues 
bjorn trauer a 19yearold native of potsdam drafted in 
september served one month in the national peoples army and now 
wears a western uniform 
the western officers are much friendlier he said but i 
think its a shame they had to fire so many of the old officers 
strangely the part of the old east german army with the darkest 
past still remains about 6000 border troops who had orders to 
shoot people fleeing the country remain on duty 
they are removing the border fortifications land mines 
watchtowers and electrical fencing they once monitored 
they will be dismissed once the job is done reichenmiller 
said they have of course a rather bad reputation 
for the east german soldier the last year has been a jarring 
experience 
markus nitschke a former soldier from potsdam was drafted in 
september 1989 just as protests against the old government were 
beginning he said soldiers were given training in riot control 
including how to use nightsticks 
soldiers were asked to sign pledges promising to support the 
police he and several others refused nitschke said and that 
caused problems initially but after honecker fell nobody cared 
any more 
communist party chief erich honecker was forced out in october 
1989 nitschke 20 now is a civil engineering student 
east germans elected a democratic government in march that made 
major changes including the remarkable decision to appoint a 
pacifist preacher rainer eppelmann as defense minister 
he cut the 3year tour of duty in half got rid of the goose 
step that had been the armys trademark and removed the inductees 
pledge to protect communism 
german unification eliminated the national peoples army 
altogether and is now causing the removal from german soil of its 
staunch ally the red army all 380000 soviet soldiers in eastern 
germany must leave within four years 
they are returning to an economically depressed ethnically 
polarized country whose very existence is in question 
there have been widespread reports of soviet soldiers deserting 
selling their guns and uniforms even committing suicide 
i worked with these men all my life seifert said i was 
trained in moscow its tragic whats happening to them

in an odd side effect of german unification nato 
pilots streak across the skies in perhaps the finest fighter plane 
ever produced by the warsaw pact 
the sleek and deadly mig29 is by far the most dazzling prize in 
the vast trove of weaponry that once belonged to the east german 
armed forces 
the 24 twinfinned soviet jets still are flown by eastern german 
pilots who now wear the uniforms of what was once west germany 
its absolutely unprecedented said walter reichenmiller 
spokesman for the defense ministry 
when the two german nations reunited on oct 3 the former west 
german military suddenly was handed a large and varied collection 
of soviet combat technology 
how valuable is it now that the soviet threat has abated 
the question of more immediate import may be will it give 
germanys close ally the united states a clearer strategic 
picture of iraq which has much of the same sovietbuilt hardware 
if there were some windfall it would not be very helpful to 
talk about it too much in the best interests of the united 
states reichenmiller said certainly some findings are 
very interesting 
he and independent defense experts say however that little can 
be gleaned from east germany weaponry that wasnt known already 
most of the equipment the east germans have has been around a 
long time said andrew duncan of the international center for 
strategic studies in london 
reichenmiller said the most advanced tank iraq and east germany 
had in common the t72 was 18 years old 
the mig29 is fairly new to both the iraqis and the east 
germans who got it in 1988 
iraq is believed to have only about 30 among its hundreds of 
fighters and they are so new the iraqis may not have mastered them 
yet duncan said 
klaus becher a security policy analyst at the german society 
for foreign politics in cologne said iraqs mig29s may be 
slightly different versions than east germany has with different 
electronics systems for example 
the mig29 mystique is diminished somewhat by the fact that the 
soviets have shopped the plane around to prospective buyers 
including israel 
presumably becher said they also are making information about 
its capabilities available he said the soviets even let a reporter 
from a western aviation magazine fly a mig29 
sure it is useful to take these things apart but the west 
always has had ways to do that becher said 
the jet has an advanced radar system some experts believe may 
give it an edge on the american f16 
its a pretty good aircraft reichenmiller said adding that 
germany routinely passes such information on to the united states 
right now the 24 migs are being kept for research purposes 
reichenmiller said no decision had been made on whether to put the 
migs into active service but that most of the east german arsenal 
hundreds of tanks older jet fighters helicopters guns and 
munitions would be destroyed 
the german armed forces must shrink to comply with the 
international terms of unification keeping much of the weaponry in 
service also probably would require germany to buy replacement 
parts from the soviets 
germany may keep the sovietmade transport planes reichenmiller 
said the government has offered some to the united states for use 
in the persian gulf 
he said soviet transport planes were even being used for a daily 
shuttle service carrying government and military personnel from 
bonn the seat of government to berlin the newly designated 
capital of the united country

according to vice president dan quayles sales 
pitch theres not much wrong with congress that couldnt be fixed 
by putting a 12year limit on house or senate service 
to that critics reply that some of the very ills quayle cited 
would only get worse in a congress populated by people who couldnt 
run again 
its a case neither side can prove in advance 
both sides agree that a constitutional amendment limiting terms 
would lead to more competitive congressional elections because it 
would force out incumbents and give newcomers a chance 
they also agree that it is not going to happen any time soon 
this is obviously going to come from outside the beltway 
quayle said the other day at a conference sponsored by the american 
enterprise institute it is not going to come through members 
of congress seeing the light all of a sudden 
he said it wasnt a partisan matter but term limits would do a 
lot more for the republican than for the democrats who have held 
control of the house for 36 years and have just extended it to 38 
forced retirements would open house seats and enhance gop chances 
in future congressional elections 
a term limit amendment was proposed in the last congress and 
will be introduced again next year but it wont get anywhere 
approval would take twothirds votes in each house advocates could 
get only 15 senators to sign on last time and two of them have 
since limited their own terms by retiring 
so the strategy of americans to limit congressional terms 
seeking to capitalize on the limits approved in three states this 
year is to build pressure for national limits by trying to get the 
voters to impose them on state legislatures 
they hope to get term limit measures on the ballots of at least 
15 states in the 1992 elections 
the group which calls itself a grassroots movement with more 
than 70000 members nationwide held its own conference this week 
to push its issue and plan the next campaign 
but first some of the limitation measures imposed this year 
will face challenges in the courts thats a sure thing in the case 
of the colorado limits which reach beyond state legislators and 
officeholders to cover senators and house members as well 
there also have been threats of court action against the state 
measure imposed in california and the city limits voted in kansas 
city 
president bush has endorsed congressional term limits but he 
hasnt pushed the issue quayle has as vice president and when he 
was in congress learned firsthand he says about the abuses that 
can go with seniority 
the longer one is in congress the more staff the more 
subcommittees you acquire and the more bureaucratic the government 
becomes quayle said 
critics countered that congressional newcomers lean more heavily 
on their staffs and are more susceptible to special interest 
influences 
well who do you think has the power right now quayle 
countered the special interest crowd likes the current 
system its comfortable they know the people 
he said the turnover produced by limiting terms would attract 
talent to congress lead people to vote with an eye on issues 
rather than on reelection and campaign fundraising strengthen 
party discipline encourage competition for committee 
chairmanships 
point by point critical questioners told him the result could 
as easily be the reverse arguing that those objectives can better 
be attained with election reform that would limit spending staffs 
free mailings and other advantages that make incumbents almost 
impossible to dislodge 
quayle said he doesnt look for real reform because incumbents 
would have to approve it adding that the prospect of term limits 
might give reformers the leverage to force action 
there is a voter revolt brewing he said

at marine corps headquarters in the shadow of 
the pentagon col russell appleton shuttles between two desks at 
one he works to cut the activeduty roster at the other he 
tracks callups of military reserves 
this seeming contradiction getting smaller and bigger at the 
same time points up one of the paradoxes lurking behind the 
scenes of the dramatic buildup in the persian gulf crisis 
the uniformed services and their civilian overseers are 
orchestrating the largest us military operation since vietnam 
while simultaneously carrying out congress order to shrink the 
military by 80000 people over the next 10 months 
can it be done 
the pentagon says yes but there are growing indications 
that military leaders may ask congress to set aside the troop cut 
goals 
appleton head of manpower policy and planning for the marines 
may have to tuck away his force reduction files because as he 
said in a recent interview putting 200000plus soldiers 
sailors marines and airmen on the other side of the world 
isnt business as usual 
even more unusual is the challenge of adding yet another 200000 
troops as reinforcements for the original deployment as ordered 
nov 8 by president bush to get iraq out f kuwait 
when the full contingency of perhaps 430000 personnel is in 
place nearly onequarter of the entire american armed forces will 
be committed more troops than the united states had in europe at 
any time during the cold war 
just a few months ago congress put the pentagon on a path 
toward reducing troops by up to 500000 over the next five years 
part of the nowaborted drive to gain a quick peace dividend 
from the collapse of communism 
even in the seemingly unlikely event that the gulf crisis is 
resolved peacefully and soon it may force congress and the bush 
administration to take a new look at how to restructure and reduce 
us forces in the postcold war era 
the pentagon could ask congress for permission to put off the 
troop reductions but pete williams the chief defense department 
spokesman said in a recent interview were still going to try to 
hit the targets set by congress in october 
the problem is seen most clearly in the colliding paths of 
reserve and active duty forces 
tens of thousands of reservists are being called out of their 
civilian jobs to join operation desert shield at the same time many 
active duty career officers are being forced to retire 
the military says it must cut officers and enlisted personnel to 
meet the forcereduction targets set by congress yet it cant 
prepare for a possible war against iraq without adding more than 
100000 reservists to the active duty force 
the reserves provide vital skills not available in the 
activeduty force such as certain medical transport water 
purification and construction services 
somewhere in the sands of saudi arabia the paradox takes on 
reallife meaning 
the fact is theres a reserve colonel standing out there next 
to a regular colonel facing a forced retirement and it can 
become a very very emotional issue appleton said 
the army which must absorb about half the 80000 personnel cuts 
for the total us armed forces by sept 30 has found a temporary 
solution to the conflicting demands presented by congress and the 
gulf crisis 
on nov 23 it froze all activeduty personnel in their 
positions in effect it acknowledged though not in so many words 
that it could not continue cutting the force while putting 
roughly 200000 army personnel in saudi arabia 
the other services might be forced to do the same if the gulf 
crisis erupts into war 
if we go to hostilities then all bets are off because you then 
have casualties that you have to replace appleton said it 
changes the calculus completely 
yet even now the marine corps while officially preventing some 
of its personnel deployed for desert shield from leaving the 
service is using retirement boards to decide which 100plus active 
duty officers will be forced out of uniform 
such boards are used by the services to meet their troopcut 
requirements 
the air force plans to convene a retirement board this month to 
force as many as 750 colonels and lieutenant colonels out of 
uniform 
the army decision to freeze its force made with the approval of 
defense secretary dick cheney meant that about 5500 personnel per 
month who otherwise would have chosen to leave the army will be 
kept in uniform indefinitely according to an army planner who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the army has not only stopped shrinking but also has grown as a 
result of adding more than 68000 national guard and reserve troops 
to its ranks as part of desert shield technically the reservists 
are not counted in the total force level that the army is legally 
required to reach by sept 30 
the complications are especially great for the army which also 
is trying to manage the huge task of withdrawing 30000 troops from 
western europe over the coming year deactivating some 
germanybased units and maintaining its other worldwide 
commitments including 40000 troops in korea and 50000 in japan 
its an unprecedented challenge said gen gordon sullivan 
the army vice chief of staff and a central figure in longterm 
planning for restructuring the army

his product tastes horrible the package is 
all wrong and the name sounds funny still greg blazic has 
managed to build fishermans friend into one of the leading coughlozenges 
in america 
i had commission sales reps who were terrified of the 
product balzic said id tell them you have to make the 
buyer taste the product and they say youre nuts i was just 
getting in the door 
but so many of these drugstore chains make decisions by 
committee and if a buyer went to committee with these and somebody 
else tasted it first he wouldnt have a comeback when they said 
this tastes lousy 
they look like flattened doggie treats and the powerful taste 
of menthol eucalyptus licorice and pepper can leave you rolling 
your eyes and gasping for breath 
but people keep buying their fishermans friends 
the reaction is it tastes terrible but its unique because 
its effective said john zarbatany president and ceo of peter 
p dennis inc a wholesale distributor in northwestern new jersey 
and eastern pennsylvania 
people either love it or hate it and the people who love it 
swear by it zarbatany said theyve built a nice trade out 
among the consumer public and they seem to be coming back from 
year to year theyve got a niche in the marketplace that theyre 
going to maintain 
in seven years since he started importing them blazic has 
managed to carve out increasing shares of the cough lozenge market 
ranking third behind sucrets and chloraseptic with a sales volume 
of more than 6 million 
the 125yearold formula first was sold to english cod fishermen 
trying to cope with colds caught in the north atlantic and hasnt 
been changed much since pharmacist james lofthouse developed it 
lofthouse sold the lozenges 19 at a time in littl paper 
envelopes still the way his family markets them the family takes 
an oldfashioned approach to the export market too appointing one 
distributor for each country they target 
two distributors failed to catch on in the us before him 
blazik said 
they tried to sell them as candy he said in the us 
market blazik thinks the strong taste and the oldfashioned 
packaging work for him 
when you were growing up wasnt it a belief of your 
grandmother that no medicine works unless it tastes bad i think 
theres a psychology about that for something to really work you 
have to pay your dues 
selling at 19 for 99 cents the lozenges are among the cheapest 
on the market 
so its a good value and its got a name that easy to 
remember you know the recall factor is tremendously high and 
anybody whos ever tasted one of these just forms an opinion and 
they always remember it 
blazik amp associates was incorporated in january 1983 after the 
conglomerate he worked for decided to sell off its candy companies 
he went into business with his savings and severance and an 
agreement from his wife 
shed support me for two years and by the third year if the 
company had a 5050 chance of making it shed give me another 
year but she wouldnt have anything to do with the business at 
all because it had to survive on its own 
surviving isnt easy in the world of big drug store chains 
blazik found out if a product isnt selling its taking up 
valuable space that could be used to stock something that will make 
money 
he had to convince some very tough buyers for drugstore chains 
i was thrown out of so many places in the early years it was 
incredible he said but the funny thing about this product is 
that nobody ever forgets 
you call up and you only get one shot a year with a buyer for 
a chain so id get shot down and id know i cant come back for a 
year so i call back a year later and the guy would say are you 
still trying to sell that stuff 
blazik started with a novel marketing idea put the packages in 
a plastic boat on a pedestal on the stores counter the gimmick 
worked although blazik admits people bought because of the boat 
not because of the product the boat was cute 
his company now has 14 employees but blazik estimates he still 
works 70 to 80 hours a week 
someday blaziks daughter may join the business on one 
condition 
she told me you know daddy when i get older i want to 
sell fishermans friends like you do but i dont have to eat them 
do i

driven by the environmental battle over the 
northern spotted owl the us forest service is developing a new 
approach to logging that demands looking at the forest not just 
the trees 
through the new perspectives program the forest service is 
looking harder look at what cutting down a tree means to wildlife 
plant life biological diversity erosion sedimentation of 
steelhead and salmon spawning beds and hiking and driving through 
the forest 
new perspectives is being showcased along shasta costa creek in 
the siskiyou national forest in southwestern oregon 
by careful management foresters hope to produce in 80 to 120 
years the kind of old growth forest that took nature more than 200 
years to create 
were looking beyond the trees said kurt wiedenmann 
program director for the project were looking at it from an 
ecological standpoint not just timber production 
shasta costa creek is a tributary of the rogue river in the area 
where the klamath mountains join with the coast range the 
watershed runs from an elevation of 200 feet at the creeks mouth 
o 5300 feet at brandy peak 
the watershed provides spawning grounds for salmon and 
steelhead and nesting and hunting grounds for the spotted owl 
which was listed as a threatened species this year it also is home 
to pine martens which have been proposed for federal protection 
pileated woodpeckers elk and deer 
only 2000 of the watersheds 23419 acres have been logged 
making it a potential battleground between environmentalists who 
want to preserve old growth forests and the timber industry which 
wants to keep mills rolling 
as a result the forest service has undertaken an environmental 
impact statement rather than the less demanding environmental 
assessment to plan how it will log the shasta costa it is to be 
finished this spring 
no two ways about it the spotted owl issue was the big driver 
in the new perspectives movement said john henshaw the program 
coordinator for the northwest new perspectives concepts offer a 
hope not a promise of an ability to continue both amenity and 
commoditybased production on the national forests 
in the past decade scientists such as jerry franklin professor 
of ecosystem analysis at the university of washington and chief 
plant ecologist for the forest service began questioning 
traditional forestry they decided nature had some valuable lessons 
to teach when it came to harvesting and replanting forests the 
concepts became known as new forestry 
what we see happening everywhere is an appreciation of the 
fact that a more structurally diverse managed forest probably can 
do a better job of providing other ecological values like wildlife 
habitat franklin said 
the concepts were embraced first at the grassroots level of the 
forest service and ran up to the top chief dale robertson thought 
they had merit but thought the term new forestry implied the old 
ways had been bad so new perspectives was born 
on the shasta costa new perspectives can be described as 
logging the forest the way a forest fire would in a mosaic of 
intensities that will grow back with the complex structure of old 
growth 
it includes debris left on the ground to decompose standing 
dead trees where birds can nest and find food and big green trees 
that will become the top of a multistoried canopy that shelters 
spotted owls from predators 
henshaw said the program is spreading quickly throughout the 
forest service but environmental groups and the timber industry 
arent sold on the concept 
i think new perspectives has its roots in the notion that we 
ought to be able to manage everything said andy stahl forester 
for the sierra club legal defense fund i would submit that there 
are some lands some things that nature does the best at and one 
of those is old growth forests i dont think the old growth they 
will grow in 80 years is going to compare with the old growth 
mother nature took 300 years to grow 
dennis hayward vice president of the north west timber 
association said new perspectives provides a way to manage lands 
that have been set aside from logging 
but where he had hoped to see 175 million board feet of timber 
come out of shasta costa in the next three years the forest 
service has proposed cutting 112 million board feet 
compared with what they started out with their preferred 
alternative is a sleight of hand hayward said they are using 
it politically to try to avoid a controversy for three years and 
that is wrong

alan bond the flamboyant businessman 
who bought a van gogh and bankrolled a stunning yachting upset was 
charged today in connection with a government investigation of a 
collapsed investment bank 
bond whose brewing and mining empire collapsed in a mountain of 
some 6 billion in debt joins a growing list of fallen australian 
highflyers now facing criminal charges 
he was accused of concealing information during an attempted 
1987 rescue of the investment bank rothwells ltd police in perth 
bonds hometown said bond was released on 77000 bail he was to 
appear in court on friday 
in a statement bond denied the allegations saying he is 
absolutely innocent 
bond was charged in an investigation by a special government 
task force set up rothwells collapsed in november 1988 with losses 
of about 200 million 
police last week charged former rothwells chief laurie connell 
and casino boss dallas dempster for alleged illegal stock trading 
three others face trial on charges of falsifying accounts to make 
it appear the bank was making substantial profits 
prosecutors allege that large undisclosed borrowing by connell 
of up to 385 million was the main cause of rothwells failure 
bond joins bankrupt hooker corp head george herscu and elders 
resources managing director geoff lord as prominent australian 
businessmen to face criminal charges 
herscu one of australias 10 richest men until hooker corp 
fell on hard times was convicted thursday of corruption charges 
for paying off a former state official on monday lord was charged 
with 37 similar offenses 
the charge against bond a britishborn former signpainter was 
the latest chapter in a long slide 
only three years ago bond bought vincent van goghs irises 
from the auction house sothebys for a thenrecord 539 million 
the same yeat he financed australias upset of the united states in 
the americass cup yacht race 
at its peak bond corp holdings ltd the company he founded 
included interests in brewing media resources and property it 
had a gold mine and telephone company holdings in chile and 
brewing and other mining interests in the united states 
australian prime minister bob hawke last year praised bond as 
a great australian 
bond rode out the 1987 stockmarket crash on strong cash flow 
from his beer assets but the man who built a fortune on borrowed 
funds continued to overextend and bond corp eventually ran up 
estimated debts of more than 6 billion 
a combination of heavy debts rising interest rates and bad 
business decisions alienated bankers and creditors put bonds 
australian brewing interests into receivership and forced him to 
sell assets ranging from a hong kong office development to a coal 
mine 
in march bond sold the van gogh for an undisclosed amount amid 
reports he had taken a loss 
in september he resigned under pressure as chairman and 
director of bond corp although he still holds a controlling 
interest through his private company dallhold investments two 
days after the resignation bond corp reported a loss of 172

bond was charged under the western australia state securities 
industry code with concealing an arrangement between rothwells and

rescue package aimed at keeping rothwells afloat after the october 
1987 stock market crash caused a run on its funds 
but bond allegedly did not tell other contributors he was to 
receive a 123 million fee for helping to organize the rescue 
the charge alleges that by concealing the arrangement bond 
induced perth businessman brian coppin to contribute to the rescue 
through an underwriting agreement with wardley australia securities

anything from brian coppin bonds statements said 
he said no fee was paid to me bond corp holdings ltd or 
any company associated with me in connection with the rothwells

charge will be strenuously defended

a controversial campaign urging 
citizens to avoid luxury goods has helped create south koreas 
worst trade frictions since seoul joined the ranks of the worlds 
top economies 
at stake are millions of dollars worth of services consumer 
goods and products from europe the united states and other nations 
that koreas most important trading partners claim have been 
blocked in the korean market 
foreign diplomats said that in the last year imports have been 
removed from stores consumers buying large items such as 
automobiles have been threatened with tax audits and some goods are 
being held at customs under obscure regulations 
goods as diverse as candycoated chocolates and luxury 
automobiles have been caught in the crossfire 
us ambassador donald p gregg said recently that rising trade 
friction threatens to undermine political and economic relations 
between washington and seoul the united states is south koreas 
largest trading partner and has been its chief ally for more than 
four deacades 
we dont like it particularly coming from korea us 
senator frank murkowski of alaska a frequent visitor to korea 
said he said there is a growing concern and support for the 
merits of retaliation 
korean officials maintain that the campaign is an earnest desire 
by citizens to restore frugality and austerity in koreas fast 
changing society government officials say they are hard put to 
stop it 
officials say the movement was not designed as a policy to 
discriminate against imports but they admit privately that in 
implementation some imports and koreas image as a fair trader have 
been hurt 
im not going to deny there was some misinterpretation said 
kim samhoon directorgeneral of the international trade bureau 
for the foreign ministry but we have many people who are 
spending excessively and wastefully 
the campaign is rife with cultural overtones western 
materialism and the right to sell to consumers vs a tightly knit 
homogeneous culture where conspicuous consumption is seen as moral 
decay 
the movement has been described as an antiimport campaign a 
consumers crusade an austerity campaign or a spiritual effort to 
restore basic confucian thrift 
western trading nations see the campaign as an antiimport 
drive secretly backed by the government and aimed at restricting 
access to foreign goods and services luxury koreanmade goods have 
not been targeted 
the american chamber of commerce which said the movement was 
targeted at imports was attacked by a band of radical students and 
remains under guard by plainclothes riot police 
the chamber said the campaign effectively reinstated a number 
of barriers to the importation of consumer goods and equated 
imported consumer goods with luxury goods it said korean 
consumers would benefit from more choices 
at no time did we challenge other aspects of the campaign 
frugality austerity cultural values confucian ethics a letter 
to chamber members said 
koreans feel foreigners do not appreciate the campaign as an 
extension of koreas confucian culture stressing fruguality and 
moderation they are offended by consumptionoriented western 
societies they feel destroy harmony by allowing the rich to be 
different 
the driving force behind this campaign is social discontent 
over the extravagant consumption of the rich deputy prime 
minister lee seungyun said 
he said misunderstandings have evolved because the campaign 
discourages buying unnecessary imports the reasonable 
consumption of foreign goods with regard to quality and price 
should not be criticized he said 
newspapers have warned that antiamericanism will increase if 
the trade war continues 
radicals farmers and dissidents have staged violent protests 
against imports and demanded an end to us pressure to open 
markets they say foreign goods and farm products will adversely 
affect the livelihood of korean workers 
british ambassador david wright said advertisements for foreign 
goods have been defaced he said regulations hamstring banks and 
security companies that operate freely in other foreign markets 
most significant he said the seoul government is showing signs 
of retrenching in its recent promises to liberalize its markets

in a key case in the nations biggest worker 
health saga eaglepicher industries inc wants to provide up to 
80 million over 20 years to compensate asbestos disease victims 
and avoid declaring bankruptcy 
eaglepicher is widely viewed as a test case for dozens of 
companies saddled with huge liabilities stemming from the 
production and use of asbestos the insulation material that causes 
lung cancer and other respiratory diseases 
two attorneys representing asbestos plaintiffs wednesday 
proposed creating a trust that would begin making payments in 
november 1993 the trust would be funded with annual cash payments 
by eaglepicher and company stock 
under the plan eaglepicher would pay 460 million into the 
trust over 20 years 45 million for claims already negotiated and 
an estimated 178 million in proceeds from cash flow in company 
operations 
the attorneys said eaglepicher a cincinnatibased industrial 
and auto parts manufacturer needs to resolve the fate of more than 
65000 asbestos claims quickly or face a financial crisis and 
possible chapter 11 filing 
eaglepicher appears to be on the brink of bankruptcy unless 
its asbestosrelated liabilities are promptly settled attorneys 
stanley chesley and david i shapiro wrote in a 22page 
recommendation to us district judge jack b weinstein 
the evidence we have seen indicates that eaglepicher cannot 
generate enough cash from operations to pay its obligations as they 
mature the lawyers wrote 
but two other attorneys appointed by weinstein to negotiate with 
eaglepicher are opposing the plan saying it provides too little 
money to resolve existing claims and untold thousands of future 
claims 
the obligations of the company are minimal in relation to the 
number of persons who have sustained serious injury by way of 
occupational exposure to its products plaintiffs lawyer peter 
angelos of baltimore said 
a hearing was scheduled for friday on eaglepichers request 
that weinstein declare a classaction to resolve the claims on 
grounds the company cannot meet its asbestos liabilities 
a similar request has been made by the manville trust fund the 
nations largest asbestos resolution facility which faces about 
130000 claims but has run out of cash to pay new claims a 
proposal to restructure the trust is pending 
dozens of other former asbestos makers are watching the cases 
closely and judges nationwide are hopeful for model plan to clear 
a backlog of 90000 cases in state and federal courts payments to 
victims in some instances have been delayed for years and many 
workers have died before receiving compensation 
weinstein and asbestos defendants support converting companys 
claims into single class actions to reduce legal fees they say are 
exhausting assets that could be used to compensate victims 
eaglepicher has paid about 540 million in asbestos claims in 
the last five years court documents said the company no longer can 
sell assets issue common stock and debt or use tax refunds and 
insurance claims to meet its liabilities 
under the settlement plan eaglepicher would create an 
independent trust to resolve claims the company would contribute 
30 million in the first year 20 million per year for the next 
nine years and 25 million per year in the following 10 years for 
a total of 460 million 
in addition the trust after five years would receive 25 percent 
of eaglepicher common stock if the companys meets the payment 
plan and 50 percent if it does not 
eaglepicher would set aside 675 percent of its net sales each 
year to provide for basic operations the companys remaining cash 
flow would be split with the trust for a estimated 178 million 
about 45 million in claims already settled but held up by 
weinstein would be paid within 18 months 
shapiro and chesley said in the court papers that victims stand 
to receive more money faster if the company remains an operating 
entity than if it is forced seeks bankruptcy court protection 
eaglepichers claims stem from worker exposure to an 
asbestosbased pipe sealant the company made primarily for us 
government ships from 1934 to 1971

readers digest a symbol of traditional 
american values for decades will compete for a place near russian 
hearths next year 
readers digest association inc announced plans wednesday for a 
twoyear test of a russianlanguage edition of its flagship 
magazine to be published in the soviet union beginning in august 
1991 
the monthly which is already published in 15 languages in 39 
countries joins a growing list of american publications scrambling 
to gain a foothold in the largely untapped soviet market 
business week magazine launched a russianlanguage edition this 
past summer the ladies home journal put a 32page russianlanguage 
insert in about 10000 copies of its november issue that it sent to 
the soviet union 
rodale press has announced plans to publish a magazine there in 
russian called the new farmer the journal of commerce plans a 
monthly tabloid in russian starting in january the trade publisher 
international data group is producing a pair of russianlanguage 
magazines pc worldussr and manager 
officials of the magazine publishers of america said scientific 
american and the inspirational magazine guideposts are also 
planning russian editions 
russell j melvin an executive at the mpa who tracks 
international publishing developments said these efforts hinge 
on hope that changes in the soviet economic system will open the 
country to western products and ideas 
in the meantime publishing ventures face nothing but problems 
in the short term in getting into the soviet union 
paper is in short supply printing operations are not up to 
western standards distribution systems are questionable the 
soviet ruble can not yet be converted into other currencies 
but melvin said the soviet union is proving a powerful lure to 
publishers with its 300 million consumers who have been 
economically isolated for years 
they have a great desire for the printed word virtually every 
magazine that is printed is gobbled up melvin said 
publishers who get in now will be ready to give advertisers a 
way to reach those readers once their products become available 
there he said 
george grune chairman of readers digest said the company has 
been studying the market and talking with soviet officials for two 
years he said the magazine has been assured complete editorial 
freedom and that there would be no censorship 
the magazine will be published monthly with an initial 
distribution primarily on newsstands of 50000 rising to 100000 
within two years 
following the format followed with other international editions 
the cover will carry the title readers digest in both english and 
cyrillic 
a typical edition will contain articles translated from the us 
edition of readers digest the company is sending an editor not 
yet selected to moscow to oversee the operation 
the cover price which will be in rubles has not been 
determined subscriptions will also be sold 
each issue will be about 160 pages which is about average for 
inrternational editions of the magazine and will carry 
advertising the charge for a fourcolor twopage spread in all 12 
issues is 35000 
the rate for a single page in four colors in the us edition of 
readers digest which has a circulation of 1625 million is 
131000 
grune said that after the test period the company will evaluate 
soviet interest in the magazine and decide whether to continue 
doing business there 
in the meantime spokesman bruce trachtenberg said the company 
will bank the proceeds from its sales part of the money will be 
used to pay for translating producting and distributing the 
magazine 
if the test is successful trachtenberg said the company hopes 
to proceed with other publishing ventures in the soviet union 
readers digest celebrates the power of the individual it 
gives people tools to live productive daily lives those are 
universal themes he said

eastern europe may not be the boundless market 
for us products that may manufacturers envision a new study 
suggests 
consumers in the region want us fast food and japanese 
electronics but hope to purchase most other goods from western 
european producers according to a survey of 600 people in 
czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland the soviet union and 
yugoslavia 
the study conducted by mai a londonbased market researcher 
contradicts a widespread notion that eastern europeans are eager to 
buy almost anything made in america an official for the research 
firm said wednesday 
the point is that people there are not just sitting with bated 
breath waiting for products from us sources said robert kaden 
president of mais goldring amp co division in chicago 
it will be necessary for most us brands to build both 
goodwill and awareness before they begin selling 
some international trade experts said the mai study reflects an 
overly simplistic view of the paneuropean market but they 
generally agreed with its conclusion that us companies should 
look closely before leaping into eastern europe 
its very much a niche market said management professor 
michael radnor executive director of northwestern universitys 
international business development program 
there are opportunities there but you have to really have done 
your homework to see where there are possibilities 
experts also pointed out that some us makers of consumer goods 
are positioned for doing business in eastern europe through 
subsidiaries or joint ventures 
for example whirlpool corp the michiganbased manufacturer of 
dishwashers refrigerators and other home appliances owns 57 
percent of the largeappliance division of philips nv a dutch 
company that is well known in europe 
if this survey shows that eastern europeans want to buy 
appliances from western european producers we would say bravo 
that would be ideal for whirlpool said spokesman tr reid 
the mai survey quizzed people on brand name recognition and 
product preferences 
kaden said pepsi cola and cocacola were the most recognized 
brands at 99 percent and 97 percent respectively levi jeans 
mcdonalds hamburgers and the gillette and palmolive brands also 
were widely recognized he said 
but when asked which of the following types of consumer 
products would you like to see more of in the shops and where would 
you like them to have been produced north america dominated only 
in the fastfood category kaden said 
soft drinks were not included in the section of the survey on 
desired products nor were russians polled on product desires 
because they need everything kaden said 
when asked where they would prefer to have their cars produced 
western europe was the top choice of all countries except 
yugoslavia where western europe tied with japan kaden said 
people in all five countries indicated they would prefer major 
home appliances washers dryers and dishwashers from western 
europe 
western europe also was the unanimous top choice as a source of 
clothing and as a producer of small home appliances although 
polish subjects indicated an equal preference for polishmade small 
appliances 
douglas lamont author of the recently published book winning 
worldwide strategies for dominating global markets said he was 
not surprised by the findings since west germany has been a 
favorite trading partner of eastern europe and the people are also 
familiar with french and dutchmade products 
in this country there is a notion we can sell our products 
into eastern europe but i think that notion is mistaken lamont 
said in an interview from his office in north suburban evanston 
i think it will take substantive change on the part of eastern 
europeans to consider american products first on the list he 
said

car and truck production cuts nosediving sales 
and the specter of fourthquarter financial losses suggest the auto 
industry is in a recession 
if worstcase forecasts come true the industry next month could 
be looking at a financial picture reminiscent of the dark days of 
the early 1980s analysts said wednesday 
on tuesday the big three automakers reported sharp downturns in 
latenovember car and truck sales 
i think we have established a new lower level of car sales for 
a while analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new 
york said 
i think it is going to go into and probably through the first 
quarter of 1991 unless we get a real break in interest rates 
he said 
there is a lot of caution out there laughlin said of 
potential buyers it does look like at least for the auto 
industry it is a recession 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp which 
together held 682 percent of the total vehicle market in november 
said sales of their north americanmade cars and light trucks 
during the nov 2130 period this year were 24 percent lower than 
the same time last year 
that paints a gloomy picture when coupled with recent 
announcements of production cuts forecasts for financial losses in 
the fourthquarter the general softening of the economy and the 
threat of war in the middle east analysts said 
gm chairman robert stempel said in a speech last week in fort 
wayne ind that the largest automaker in the world had cut its 
december production schedule by 40 percent to 144000 vehicles 
coincidentally ford announced new temporary plant idlings for 
december chrysler declined to release fourthquarter production 
adjustments in production are common in the industry but the 
size of the gm reduction was significant especially coming so late 
in the quarter 
as a result of the cut stempel said the company expected its 
fourthquarter financial results will decline significantly 
relative to our thirdquarter results 
in the third quarter gm said it earned 109 million however 
it took a 21 billion onetime charge for closing some of its 
factories resulting in a 2 billion loss for the period 
wall street analysts forecast that gm would lose somewhere in 
the neighborhood of 450 million during the final quarter of this 
year 
meantime ford motor co finance vice president and treasurer 
david mccammon said in an interview published wednesday in the wall 
street journal that the no 2 automaker would lose money in the 
octoberdecember period also 
analysts estimated that ford would lose around 230 million 
during the period and financially struggling chrysler corp would 
lose about 35 million in the quarter 
if those forecasts which are subject to change come true the 
fourth quarter of this year would be the first that each of the big 
three have lost money since mid1981 when the industry was 
affected by the national recession 
but there are differences between then and now analysts said 
the magnitude of these production cuts would appear to be 
something in excess of the current selling rate laughlin said 
there is a sincere effort here to avoid an inventory buildup 
high inventories inspire big incentives which slice directly 
into profits 
the action appears to be preventative rather than 
reactionary laughlin said 
he and other analysts said tuesdays sales report gives a better 
picture of the industrys health than other recent 10day reports 
which showed a much less radical swing in this years selling rate 
compared with a year ago 
those earlier reports analysts have said included large 
numbers of fleet sales to rental car companies and large 
corporations stripped of those figures the retail sales rate is 
weak they said 
we dont know how many fleet sales are in the numbers said 
analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
clearly people are taking a waitandsee attitude toward a 
perceived economic crisis and a perceived mideast military 
crisis 
its very hard to buy a car in this atmosphere

an environmental protection agency 
committee concludes that cigarette smoke causes cancer in 
nonsmokers and may be an important cause of bronchitis pneumonia 
and asthma in children 
the effect of passive smoking on children might have a greater 
public health impact than the increase in cancer morton lippmann 
of new york university chairman of the advisory panel said 
wednesday 
the tobacco industry criticized the reports conclusions and the 
panels deliberations 
but the coalition on smoking or health embraced the panels 
conclusions 
the committee action is a big win for the american people 
said fran du melle head of the coalition and deputy director of 
the american lung associations washington office 
given what we know about smoking and lung cancer there should 
be no question that passive smoking can cause lung cancer in 
innocent bystanders du melle said in a statement the coalition 
is made up of the american lung association the american heart 
association and the american cancer society 
the epa panels acceptance of findings that had been reached in 
a draft report on passive smoking assures that those conclusions 
will survive in the final version of the report agency officials 
said 
the report will likely prompt the occupational safety and health 
administration to take steps toward possible adoption of 
restrictions on smoking in the workplace said roy clason jr 
oshas policy director 
the findings of this report are very important in the future 
direction osha will take he said 
osha has been planning for some time to establish rules on 
indoor air quality in which we would place a very high emphasis 
on the issue of smoking clason said 
the draft epa report was released on june 25 it concluded that 
tobacco smoke should be designated a class a carcinogen a known 
cause of human cancer 
it also estimated that passive smoking kills 3700 americans 
each year and it found a link between passive smoking and 
increased incidence of bronchitis pneumonia wheezing and middle 
ear disease in children 
the report concluded that the children of women who smoke also 
have impaired lung growth and development 
but brennan dawson a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute 
said the human evidence did not support the classification of 
tobacco smoke as a class a carcinogen 
she said she expected that antismokers will continue to use 
the document in its draft form to push for restrictions on 
smoking 
the expert panel accepted the draft reports conclusion that 
environmental tobacco smoke or ets causes lung cancer 
lippmann said 
we are persuaded that the evidence exists for considering 
that ets does cause lung cancer in nonsmokers he said 
but the panel raised questions about the reports estimate of 
3700 cases per year 
lippmann said that number would probably change by the time the 
report is revised in accordance with the panels recommendations 
he said he did not know whether the estimate would increase or 
decrease 
robert axelrad director of the epas indoor air division said 
the panels comments had been useful 
these are all wellknown and respected scientists their 
criticism will ultimately result in a stronger and better 
document he said 
gary giovino of the federal office on smoking and health which 
prepares the surgeon generals reports on smoking said the epa 
report validates conclusions reached in earlier studies by the 
national research council and the surgeon general 
theyve come to the conclusion that previous scientific bodies 
have with more data said giovino 
the epas report is a review and analysis of available research 
on the health risks of passive smoking

the nations largest accounting firm could be 
banned from doing business in california because of its audit work 
for charles h keating jrs lincoln savings 
karen j scott executive officer of the state board of 
accountancy asked the panel to bar ernst amp young from doing audits 
in california 
a panel review concluded the companys audits of lincoln and its 
parent american continental corp were grossly negligent 
according to a board complaint filed last month 
scotts nov 16 request and the complaint were disclosed this 
week 
steve miller an attorney for ernst amp young said wednesday the 
company stands by its audit and will contest the case at hearings 
before the board of accountancy 
experts say lincolns collapse will cost taxpayers 2 billion 
the biggest thrift failure ever investigations have focused on how 
the sampls finances could have been allowed to deteriorate so badly 
before it was seized in 1989 
a year before the seizure ernst amp youngs predecessor company 
arthur young amp co issued an unqualified opinion that lincolns 
upbeat financial statements for 1987 fairly represented its 
financial condition 
a month later the chief arthur young partner on the account was 
hired by american continental which tripled his salary 
the accountancy board can clear ernst amp young or impose 
probation temporary suspension or a permanent ban said deputy 
attorney general michael granen who is handling the case for the 
board 
central to the case are eight arizona desert land deals traded 
by lincoln the accounting board contends the deals shouldnt have 
qualified as profits because the buyers and sellers were related 
through complex business ties 
ernst amp young also is the target of a negligence lawsuit filed 
in june by state attorney general john van de kamp the lawsuit 
seeks to recover the losses of investors who purchased 250 million 
in nowworthless american continental junk bonds at lincoln 
branches 
if investors had known the truth no one would have invested a 
dime in these bonds van de kamp said in announcing the lawsuit 
but with arthur young standing behind them their bonds sold 
easily 
eugene r erbstoesser ernst amp youngs associate general 
counsel questioned the timing of the attempt to revoke the firms 
license he speculated the attorney general could be trying to 
pressure the company to settle the earlier lawsuit 
i believe this whole thing is totally unnecessary 
erbstoesser said all of this is just making the firms resolve 
more determined to clear its name

general development corp looked ahead toward 
reorganization as federal prosecutors looked back at business 
practices that got the bigtime developer into trouble 
a consultant hired by the developer filed a reorganization 
outline in us bankruptcy court on wednesday hours after a 
federal grand jury added two former executives and dozens of new 
charges in issuing a new indictment in the case that supersedes an 
earlier indictment 
the palmieri co proposed placing the assets of the public 
company in a private trust which would sell general developments 
90000 acres utilities and other assets over eight to 10 years for 
the benefit of creditors 
conceding the difficulty of a shortterm selloff the 
consultant said the real estate market the general economy 
absorption rates and other factors require a relatively longterm 
horizon to maximize values 
the consultant estimates general developments assets could be 
sold now for 861 million to 986 million for a return of less than 
40 cents on the dollar for unsecured creditors 
palmieri believes general development which settled its 
criminal fraud case with a plea bargain last week could emerge 
from chapter 11 proceedings with an approved reorganization plan by 
june 1 
meanwhile arraignment was set for today for tore debella 
former gdc senior vice president of marketing and richard reizen 
former vice president of marketing 
they joined exchairman david brown and expresident robert 
ehrling as defendants in the criminal case against company 
executives all four resigned last march within days of the 
original indictment 
the increased number of counts it seems to me is a case of 
thats what you get for not pleading guilty pal said joel 
hirschhorn ehrlings attorney its what lawyers call 
prosecutorial vindictiveness 
reizen said im not guilty of anything that the indictment 
charges my attorney and i will prove that at trial 
the first 16count indictment named the company brown and 
ehrling but the new one grew to 74 counts added the two former 
sales executives and dropped the company because of its guilty plea 
to fraud conspiracy 
the four are accused institutionalizing fraudulent and deceptive 
sales tactics that resulted in the sale of more than 10000 homes 
at inflated prices from 1983 to 1989 
twentythree charges claim the executives brought people to 
florida to further the fraud by promoting southward ho trips 
to induce purchases at general developments nine planned 
communities the defendants face possible 250000 fines and 
10year prison terms on each count 
the superseding indictment also includes one fraud conspiracy 
count and 50 mail fraud counts carrying a maximum fiveyear term on 
each charge 
general development was accused of routinely rigging appraisals 
and using deceptive ploys to entice people into buying and to keep 
them from finding out their new property wasnt worth what they 
paid 
us district judge lenore nesbitt accepted the companys third 
plea offer last thursday with a guilty plea to one count of fraud 
conspiracy 
sentencing required a 1 million letter of credit to cover 
administration of a 160 million restitution plan for the 
victimized homeowners 10 years of court supervision and five years 
probation 
the company which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
april has halted sales and stock trading

miller brewing co has received 22000 
applications for jobs at a brewery that wont open until next month 
and isnt expected to have more than 1500 employees 
miller began advertising to fill the jobs a week ago 
i think weve exceeded our expectations so far brewery 
spokeswoman sandra lewis said we knew wed get several thousand 
based on whats happened in the past but maybe not quite this 
many 
miller expects to start production at the 411 million brewery 
in july the company has advertised in newspapers in cincinnati 
dayton hamilton and middletown for secretarial and clerical 
workers and for production workers 
applications came from ohio kentucky and indiana ms lewis 
said she said miller is not accepting applications by telephone or 
in person to avoid being mobbed by job seekers 
ms lewis said production would be phased in starting with only 
the workers necessary to start up the plant 
when the brewery reaches full capacity of 10 million barrels a 
year it could employ up to 1500 workers the company has said 
miller has not said what the jobs will pay there have been 
newspaper advertisements by union organizers who want to represent 
employees 
the brewery was completed in 1981 but milwaukeebased miller 
never opened it saying the production capacity was unnecessary 
because of declining sales

the new zealand government said 
thursday it will allow foreign companies to increase their stake in 
radio and television companies 
communications minister maurice williamson said legislation 
providing for up to 499 percent shareholding by foreign companies 
in new zealand broadcasters will be introduced to parliament before 
the end of the month 
the current ratios are a maximum of 15 percent foreign ownership 
in television and up to 25 percent for radio 
the main beneficiary of the move is expected to be the 
financially troubled private tv3 network now operating in 
receivership 
the network launched just over a year ago as the first private 
competition to the two stations run by stateowned television new 
zealand attracts an average 15 percent viewing audience 
the national broadcasting co of the united states owns 75 
percent of tv3 after reducing its stake from 15 per cent 
tv3 reported a 28 million million loss for the year ending 
march 31 
williamson told a news conference that tv3s current financial 
predicament had given urgency to the matter 
williamson said consideration had been given to a 20 percent 
ratio as in australia or the united states figure of 25 percent 
but neither would have been satisfactory 
the existing overseas investment restrictions are now a 
serious impediment to the development of the broadcasting industry 
most large new zealand companies and institutions have significant 
overseas shareholding and it is proving impossible for such 
companies to have a worthwhile shareholding in broadcasting 
enterprises he said 
the 499 percent figure will allow new zealand broadcasters to 
seek equity partners overseas and along with the equity they will 
be able to seek expertise which is probably just as important 
he said

entertainment giant mca inc rejected a 
request by interior secretary manuel lujan jr to donate its 
concession at yosemite national park to the government before its 
buyout by a japanese firm is completed 
instead the yosemite park amp curry co will be sold within a 
year to an american buyer as a result of matsushita electric 
industrial cos 66 billion buyout of mca 
we had hoped for better news said national park service 
spokesman george berklacy 
mca chairman lew r wasserman said the decision was in the best 
interests of shareholders as well as park visitors mca agreed to 
terms of the buyout by matsushita last week 
lujan asked for the donation in a letter to wasserman and 
matsushita executive vice president masahiko hirata on tuesday 
but james ridenour director of the park service said wednesday 
that mca and matsushita attorneys told him that curry co assets 
were made part of the deal with matsushita and could not be 
given away 
because of concern toward a foreign firm owning a concession in 
a national park mca and matsushita agreed last month to place the 
curry co in escrow until a us buyer could be found in the 
meantime curry co profits will be donated to the national park 
foundation a group that channels private money to the park 
service 
we believe this is a generous gift which will further the work 
of the national park service wasserman said in a written reply 
to lujan on wednesday 
the company owns about half the restaurants stores and lodgings 
in yosemite valley the national park service must approve any 
buyer of curry co 
in his letter lujan asked the corporations to give the 
concession to the american people 
such a dramatic gesture would be recognized as a remarkably 
generous and publicspirited demonstration of the mcamei 
commitment to the values of yosemite national park and what they 
stand for in the minds of the american people he wrote 
the curry cos contract with the park service expires in 1993

the moscow international stock exchange hopes to 
begin trading in a limited number of government bonds in january 
russian finance minister boris fyodorov said today 
the government of russia the largest and richest of the 15 
soviet republics was among 20 organizations and individuals which 
founded the exchange last month 
we would like to take in the first place a very primitive 
step fyodorov said of the decision to start by trading bonds 
before gradually introducing securities he spoke at a seminar on 
russias economic future 
president mikhail s gorbachev issued sweeping decrees in 
october permitting individual soviets to buy stocks bonds and 
other securities for the first time in 73 years 
trading in shares was outlawed following the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution and allowed only a brief revival during the 1920s before 
being abolished by josef stalin 
the russiansupported exchange is smaller and separate from the 
moscow stock exchange founded in november by 187 companies the 
moscow stock exchange has not yet set an opening date but has 
ambitious plans to open offices in the new york frankfurt tokyo 
and singapore stock exchanges 
fyodorov said the moscow international stock exchange has only 
10 million rubles or about 55 million in capital compared with 
615 million rubles or about 341 million for the moscow stock 
exchange 
we hope that the first session will be in the beginning of 
january with the state bonds he said 
bonds usually issued by governments are considered less risky 
than stocks because they pay the buyer a fixed annual interest rate 
and mature at a specified future date 
western advisers helping the soviet government revive trading 
say bonds will also be easier for inexperienced investors to 
understand

american telephone amp telegraph co is appealing 
directly to ncr corp shareholders to accept its 6 billion 
takeover bid for the nations fifthlargest computer company 
but ncr said wednesday it would fight the 90ashare cash 
tender offer unless the phone giant raised the price by 25 
billion 
atampt made its direct offer to ncr shareholders after ncrs 
directors who faced a 5 pm est deadline to respond to the bid 
rejected the offer as grossly inadequate but almost 
simultaneously ncr said it would enter into merger talks with atampt 
if the phone company increased its offer to 125 a share for a 
total of about 85 billion 
atampt disclosed that its chairman robert e allen and ncr 
chairman charles e exley jr met wednesday afternoon in new york 
at exleys request during the meeting exley presented the 
125ashare counterproposal 
allen in a letter to exley released by atampt rejected ncrs 
offer 
we do not understand how you can maintain that a merger at 
125 in atampt stock would work continue ncrs success and be a good 
deal for your shareholders but a merger at 90 would be a 
strategic disaster allen wrote 
chuck all we have is a difference of opinion on price he 
continued we should let your shareholders decide we believe 
that we are offering a full and fair price 
atampt in a later statement called the 125ashare proposal 
outrageous and totally unjstified 
the atampt tender offer would provide ncr shareholders 90 in cash 
for each share while atampts earlier offer to the companys board 
would have involved exchanging atampt stock worth 90 for each ncr 
share the tender offer is effective today and runs until midnight 
jan 4 
as part of its offer to enter merger talks with atampt at 125 a 
share ncr also said the phone company must agree to enter into a 
confidentialty agreement and to refrain from further action on a 
takeover while the talks proceed 
please understand that if you cannot offer ncr shareholders 
this fair value we will use every means at our disposal to protect 
our shareholders and other stakeholders against your attempt to 
deny them the inherent values of ncr exley said in a letter to 
allen released by ncr 
last week the board rejected an earlier atampt offer of 85 a 
share 
daton ohiobased ncr said its board bolstered ncrs takeover 
defenses by lowering the threshold for a shareholders rights plan 
to take effect under the change the right of existing 
stockholders to buy special shares in ncr can be exercised after a 
company acquires 15 percent of ncr down from 20 percent the 
special shares are intended to make a takeover more difficult 
exley has said he is opposed to atampts bid on the grounds it 
would not make sense to combine ncrs wellregarded computer line 
with atampts disappointing computer business he said he would quit 
ncr if atampts bid suceeded 
this morning ncrs shares began trading at 9225 up 550 
after a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the new york 
stock exchange on wednesday ncr shares rose 312 to close at 
8662 in heavy trading news of atampts tender offer came after 
the close of the markets 
atampt shares rose 12 cents in early trading to 3025 on 
wednesday atampt stock fell 25 cents as more than 5 million shares 
changed hands topping the mostactive list on the nyse 
many industry analysts believed exleys opposition to the 
takeover bid was just posturing and that he was holding out in 
order to push up atampts offering price others believe exley 
geniunely wants to fight to keep ncr independent 
to battle atampts tender offer exley has several options 
including seeking another merger partner taking ncr private by 
buying its shares with borrowed money or arranging a large payout 
to stockholders again through borrowed cash 
but analysts said the last two options seem unlikely in the 
current climate on wall street where bank credit and bond 
financing for such deals have all but dried up 
that leaves finding another merger partner the most likely 
course should ncr try to block atampts bid experts say such a 
partner may offer more favorable terms than atampt

the weak economy and the mammoth costs of 
helping the savings and loan industry will soon push the federal 
deficit to records surpassing 300 billion per year a 
congressional study said today 
but by 1993 the newly enacted deficitreduction law and an 
improving economy should begin shrinking the federal shortfall the 
congressional budget office said in a report presented to the house 
budget committee 
the economy appears to be near a turning point a time when 
predicting its course is particularly difficult said robert 
reischauer director of the congressional budget office 
the calculations are the first showing how the fiveyear 496 
billion deficitcutting law will affect the federal budget over the 
next several years the bush administration is not expected to 
release its own figures until february 
the report obtained by the associated press in advance of the 
hearing said that in fiscal 1992 for which the administration is 
planning its budget the shortfall will be at least 337 billion 
easily the highest ever fiscal 1992 begins next oct 1 
but by the following year the cbo expects the red ink to shrink 
to 252 billion and reach 143 billion by 1995 the last year for 
which the study contains projections 
the report cautioned however that economic conditions have 
worsened since october when the cbo made its calculations oil 
prices have remained high the real estate market has been weak and 
many banks and corporations have had financial problems it noted 
unless these factors are offset by other developments a more 
pessimistic economic outlook will worsen the budget projections 
the authors wrote 
the budget office said it expects the government to spend 91 
billion in fiscal 1991 which runs through next sept 30 bailing 
out the nations savings and loan institutions that figure will 
peak at 107 billion in 1992 
but then as the government begins selling sampl assets it has 
taken over it will recoup some of its losses actually earning 44 
billion in 1994 the report said 
the economy will also take its toll on the budget as a rule of 
thumb a weak economy means lower federal revenues and higher 
spending and thus a bigger budget gap 
many of the cbos expectations for economic performance have 
deteriorated since it released its last projections last summer 
the budget office now expects the economy to grow at a weak 06 
percent in 1991 down from its 25 percent estimate in july the 
bush administration is calling for economic growth at around 08 
percent 
the report also projected that inflation will increase by 53 
percent in 1991 11 percent higher than the cbo called for in 
july and it forecast unemployment to be 64 percent in 1991 up 
from the 54 percent projected earlier 
this years budget gap should be 320 billion the cbo said the 
deficit for fiscal 1990 was 220 billion just below the record 
221 billion shortfall in 1986 
but those figures cannot be directly compared with the 320 
billion projection for next year because they include the huge and 
growing social security surplus expected to reach 66 billion this 
year 
under new budget rules that surplus is no longer included in 
federal deficit calculations the fiscal 1990 budget gap would have 
been 277 billion had the social security surplus not been included 
in the deficit figures 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law sets new deficit ceilings 
for each of the next few years if those targets are surpassed 
automatic spending cuts can be triggered 
but under the new procedures the administration adjusts those 
targets to reflect changing economic conditions so there is little 
threat they will cause the automatic spending slashes to occur 
the cbos numbers are advisory and are not officially used to 
measure the deficit that task falls to the white houses office of 
management and budget nonetheless the cbo figures are widely 
respected on capitol hill

oil futures prices tumbled even lower today to 
levels not seen since august after iraqi president saddam hussein 
said all of his foreign hostages should be released 
light sweet crude oil was down 179 per barrel to 2550 at the 
new york mercantile exchange this morning on contracts for delivery 
in january crude for nextmonth delivery last settled below 26 
per barrel on aug 29 when it was at 2592 the exchange said 
unleaded gasoline for nextmonth delivery was down 334 cents at 
6550 cents a gallon by late this morning it fell at one point to 
within less than a penny of the price it commanded on aug 1 the 
day before iraq invaded kuwait 
home heating oil was trading at 7770 cents a gallon down 344 
cents on contracts for delivery in january 
the rapid plunge today followed crudes drop of 337 per barrel 
on wednesday which came amid speculation of peace in the persian 
gulf 
word came out that hussein is releasing the hostages and it 
fell 150 just like that said annlouise hittle a senior oil 
analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc were seeing an 
erosion of the war premium 
during the wild downturn that began on wednesday all of the 
petroleum futures hit levels they had not seen since the month of 
the invasion 
it almost feels like were reversing course hittle said 
were back in a period of uncertainty again 
oil for nextmonth delivery had not closed below 28 per barrel 
since aug 31 when it closed at 2732 the exchange said 
wednesdays close for gasoline was the lowest since aug 2 and the 
close for heating oil was the lowest since aug 31 
prices also skidded today in frantic activity in london on the 
news of saddams statement on the hostages 
january contracts for north sea brent blend the most widely 
traded international crude oil fell to 2560 a barrel from 2735 
late wednesday 
in the four months since iraq seized kuwait speculation about a 
warinduced oil crisis has pushed prices as high as the 41 a 
barrel level many oil strategists have said the market will 
continue to act unpredictably until the crisis shows decisive signs 
of ending 
the market swung wildly on headlines wednesday a brief rally 
led by saberrattling from secretary of state james a baker iii 
failed to sustain any buying momentum prospects of peace soon took 
control and pushed prices down 
the final shove came in the afternoon when the us government 
announced iraq had agreed to toplevel diplomatic meetings to 
discuss the desert standoff 
although the rhetoric from bush and baker is still pretty 
tough at least now theres going to be some kind of discussion 
between the two parties and the ground rules are becoming 
clearer said christian gohler a broker at merrill lynch energy 
futures

trading in crude oil futures would be 
temporarily suspended in response to large price swings under a 
plan approved today by the new york mercantile exchange 
for the first time the exchange will be imposing trade 
cessations as circuitbreakers president r patrick thompson 
said the proposed changes would allow crude oil futures to rise or 
fall by up to 15 per barrel each day far more than they have ever 
moved 
exchange officials said they are not trying to predict movements 
that big but rather setting up rules that will keep trading 
orderly through a crisis 
the exchange also offers futures contracts for two refined 
petroleum products unleaded gasoline and home heating oil that 
will be affected 
the possibility that war or peace in the persian gulf could lead 
to huge movements in oil prices has prompted some calls for tighter 
controls on the exchange 
but exchange officials said in a news conference this morning 
that the proposed rules changes which they expect to be approved 
by the commodity futures trading commission next week were 
selfimposed the exchange has nonetheless discussed the rule 
changes with the cftc ahead of time 
we were not goaded into this by any federal agency chairman 
z lou guttman said we felt that this was a very responsible and 
necessary precautionary measure 
under the new rules if oil prices swing 750 in either 
direction during a single trading session and stay at that level 
for five minutes oil brokers will be told that trading will be 
halted in two minutes after the market is stopped for an hour 
trading will resume with the swing in prices limited to 15 for 
the spot month and the month after that 
if futures for unleaded gasoline and home heating oil move 20 
cents a gallon their trading would be stopped and then resumed 
with a 40centagallon limit on moves for the rest of the session 
prices have never swung as wildly as the new limits would allow 
them to swing and exchange officials emphasized they are not 
trying to predict the size of the swings that would be possible 
during a sudden oil emergency 
the exchange came up with the price limits by figuring out what 
kind of swings the market could withstand while keeping trading 
orderly and fair the officials said 
exchange officials said the hours break in trading would give 
futures players time to take a closer look at world events that are 
pushing the price of crude

government regulators do not have an effective 
system to manage the consultants hired to sell real estate 
inherited from failed savings and loans the head of the general 
accounting office said today 
one of our key concerns is that the rtc resolution trust 
corp does not have an effective contractor oversight program 
charles a bowsher head of the congressional investigative agency 
told the house banking committee 
because of the large dollar value of assets to be placed under 
contractor control we believe it is essential that an effective 
system be put in place as quickly as possible to assure proper 
contract management and oversight and minimize rtcs vulnerability 
to fraud waste and mismangement he said 
bowshers testimony came a day after the democratic staff of the 
committee issued a report charging that rtc red tape is tangling 
the sale of sampl assets and costing taxpayers millions of dollars 
investors and wouldbe homeowners have encountered innumerable 
stumbling blocks in their attempts to negotiate purchases of 
rtcheld assets said the report released wednesday an rtc 
spokesman called the findings nonsense 
the report conceded that the 16monthold rtc has been 
assigned a difficult task in cleaning up the largest financial 
crisis in the nations history but it said the agency must 
develop a better sales effort if it is to succeed 
uncooperative property managers difficulties in obtaining 
current and accurate appraisals delays in contract negotiations 
deteriorating condition of assets and a simple inability between 
rtc and many potential buyers to effectively communicate have 
delayed or prevented the closing of countless transactions costing 
the federal government millions of dollars in carrying costs while 
billions of dollars worth of unsold properties continue to 
deteriorate the report said 
congressional offices have been inundated with letters from 
frustrated investors brokers and homebuyers who have found that 
purchasing property from the rtc is not a simple case of arriving 
at mutually acceptable terms of sale but rather involves hours of 
sifting through paperwork and bureaucratic red tape often leading 
to frustration and disappointment it said 
rtc spokesman stephen katsanos called the report nonsense 
from the rtcs creation in august 1989 through sept 30 it has 
taken over 493 sampls with 251 billion in assets he said at the 
end of the period it was left with 207 institutions and 142 
billion in assets 
weve moved assets roughly the size of citicorp back into the 
private sector katsanos said i think its been a pretty 
productive year 
he said some buyers may be frustrated because they want to 
privately negotiate a purchase at a bargainbasement price rather 
than compete against other bidders 
thats not what congress asked for in the legislation the 
spokesman said there are a lot of complainers out there but 
there also are a lot of happy people who have bought stuff 
however richard buerkle an arlington texas real estate 
executive told the committee that lowerlevel rtc staff actually 
doing the agencys work complain they do not have enough authority 
to make decisions on properties that too much paperwork is 
required and that top officials have little knowledge about how to 
sell real estate 
attempts by top policymakers to improve the sales effort are 
bureaucratic more control more documentation he said 
bertram lewis a real estate executive who teaches at columbia 
universitys graduate school of business said rtc account officers 
who deal with sour loans and real estate on a daytoday basis are 
either exregulators or former lowlevel bankers who seem to lack 
the experience confidence incentive authority and temperament to 
make a deal 
the agency has hired outside consultants who are dealmakers 
lewis said unfortunately they cannot make decisions only 
recommendations which are then subjected to the red tape and 
timeconsuming review of the bureaucracy

grand metropolitan plc the british food and 
liquor company said thursday its annual net profit jumped 25 
percent helped by the inclusion of pillsbury co and burger kings 
fullyear results for the first time 
grand met said net profit for the year ended sept 30 came to 
634 million pounds or 107 billion compared with 508 million 
pounds or 859 million in the same period a year ago 
pretax profit rose 26 percent to 919 million pounds or 155 
billion from 732 million pounds or 124 billion 
revenue rose only 1 percent however to 9394 billion pounds 
or 159 billion from 9298 billion or 157 billion 
grand met blamed the small revenue gain on asset disposals 
notably its retail betting and berni restaurant operations revenue 
from its continuing businesses was up 19 percent it said 
the company did not report results for the latest quarter or 
second half of the year it isnt required to under british law 
grand met said part of the earnings gain for 1990 reflected the 
inclusion of fullyear results from pillsbury and burger king an 
increase from nine months of results included in 1989 grand met 
acquired pillsbury which owned burger king for 57 billion in 
early 1989 
profit before tax and other considerations for grand mets food 
operations rose 26 percent to 309 million pounds or 522 million 
in 1990 
pillsbury alone increased its contribution to 183 million 
pounds or 309 million from 117 million pounds or 198 million 
trading profit from grand mets liquor division rose 22 percent 
to 473 million pounds or 799 million while the retailing 
division posted the fastest growth the 29 percent rise to 278 
million pounds or 470 million included a 64 percent jump in 
profit by burger king to 125 million pounds or 211 million due 
partly to lower overhead costs and improved operating efficiency 
all figures were converted at a companyprovided exchange rate 
of 169 to the pound 
the group has had another successful year all sectors have 
overcome adverse economic conditions to report good growth said 
grand met chairman sir allen sheppard 
he noted that pillsbury including burger king had positive 
earnings in its first full year in the group and said it continues 
to perform excellently 
sheppard said the company expects further earnings improvements 
in 1991 although he said it will be potentially a difficult 
year with the translation impact of a weak dollar on our 
considerable us earnings fewer property disposals and an 
increased tax charge

saddam husseins call for the release of foreign 
hostages touched off an early rally in stocks and a decline in oil 
prices today but the moves fizzled quickly as traders awaited more 
news on the persian gulf 
president bush told a news conference during a visit to 
santiago chile that he viewed the hostage report as a hopeful 
sign but he said the united states had to keep the pressure on 
saddam to withdraw from kuwait as well as release the hostages 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip 
stocks leaped more than 30 points in the first 15 minutes of 
trading then fell back to the 2613 level by noon est up about 3 
points from wednesday 
volume exceeded 1633 million shares by midmorning in heavy 
trading 
oil prices plunged by more than 2 per barrel in early trading 
on the new york mercantile exchange but edged back by noon to 
2630 per barrel for january delivery down 99 cents from 
wednesdays close 
gold which had been a safe haven for some nervous investors 
also fell by more than 4 per ounce to around 370 and the dollar 
was lower in foreign exchange dealings 
bond prices rose strongly with the treasurys 30year bond 
moving up about 375 per 1000 face amount in the early going 
but by noon the advance was cut to less than 125 per 1000 the 
yield on the bond which moves in the opposite direction from its 
price fell to 830 percent from 831 percent late wednesday 
saddams initiative heightened the markets expectations for 
peace in the persian gulf which has been in turmoil since iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
the market movesbegan earlier this week after bush set a process 
in motion for talks with iraqi leaders 
saddam called today for the release of all hostages saying 
recent diplomatic moves had prompted him to respond to positive 
changes according to the iraqi news agency 
saddam also said the hostages presence was no longer needed to 
deter an attack because his forces were now fully deployed in 
kuwait 
there are thousands of western hostages in iraq and kuwait 
including about 900 americans 
speculation about peace had sent oil futures to their lowest 
levels since august on wednesday with crude for january delivery 
falling 337 per barrel to settle at 2729 on the mercantile 
exchange the dow jones average climbed 3070 points on wednesday 
to the highest point in 12 weeks

an ambitious program of world trade 
talks was rescued from the brink of collapse today after the 
european community showed a willingness to discuss greater cuts in 
farm subsidies 
officials attending the uruguay round of negotiations decided to 
continue their talks rather than suspending them immediately 
because of a bitter dispute between the community and the united 
states over the subsidies 
the meeting decided we should go to work that we should 
continue the negotiations frans andriessen the communitys top 
trade official said after an hourlong session of negotiators 
he said the 12nation trading bloc made some movement and it 
was sufficient for the bargaining to continue 
the talks appeared near collapse earlier in the day because of 
the deadlock between the united states and european nations over 
farm issues 
i definitely think a coolingoff period might help the 
european community achieve a mandate us trade representative 
carla hills said after a round of morning sessions 
there was a stalemate in agricultural issues she said and it 
would be very constructive if we had a quiet period 
but the europeans promised to show new flexibility and rejected 
the drift toward suspending the current uruguay round of world 
trade talks 
while details on the europeans new offer were sketchy it 
appeared they were offering to discuss a us demand for 
acrosstheboard reductions in subsidies 
the impasse was broken said david woods spokesman for the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the organization conducting 
the negotiations 
canadian trade minister john crosbie who earlier in the day had 
said chances for successfully concluding the talks appeared all but 
doomed said its not a breakthrough its a reprieve 
canada is a member of the cairns group of 14 major exporting 
countries who along with the united states have been pushing the 
europeans to agree to major cuts in subsidies 
australian trade minister neal blewett said the european 
proposal offered a glimmer of hope things are no longer 
terminal 
the announcement that after four days of stalemate the talks had 
gained new life came suddenly following a closeddoor session of 
the trade negotiators held to determine whether there was any use 
of proceeding further 
the europeans have offered to cut 30 percent from subsidies on 
major crops over 10 years starting retroactively in 1986 in order 
to reduce their farmers advantage over foreign producers and make 
imports more competitive 
the united states demand is for subsidy cuts of 75 percent to 
90 percent over the next decade 
at stake in the talks convened by the 107nation conference of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt are more 
access to world markets for poor and newly democratizing countries 
protection against copyright theft and extension of fairtrade 
rulesto agriculture banking and textiles 
by washingtons calculation agreement could lead to a doubling 
of world trade by the end of the decade trade now amounts to 38 
trillion annually 
but in the corridors of the heysel palaces where the talks are 
being held delegates argued fiercely late wednesday over who was 
responsible for the slide toward a collapse or suspension of gatt 
more than 1500 delegates many of them cabinet members 
including four from washington attended the conference that 
started monday and was to end friday 
the talks are named the uruguay round after the country where 
they started in 1986 with the goal of liberalizing trade in 15 
areas 
backed by agriculturedependent countries in the third world 
the united states canada argentina brazil australia and others 
want the ec to make deep cuts in subsidies that have made the ecs 
10 million farmers into potent exporters the subsidies distort 
world farm trade reformers argue 
gatt was established in 1947 as a forum for promoting free 
trade the current round of talks the eighth since world war ii 
aims to extend free trade rules to areas not under current gatt 
rules such as farm products textiles and services such as 
financial services and construction

a new soviet stock exchange founded with the help 
of the russian republic hopes to start trading bonds in january 
russian finance minister boris fyodorov said thursday 
the moscow international stock exchange is separate from a 
larger stock exchange founded in november the two possibly 
competing exchanges are the first to operate in the soviet union 
since dictator josef stalin banned them in the 1920s 
the reformminded russian government was joined by 19 other 
organizations and individuals to found the newest exchange last 
month fyodorov told a seminar on economic reforms in russia the 
largest and richest soviet republic 
the exchange will start with bonds and later will begin trading 
shares fyodorov said 
we would like to take in the first place a very primitive 
step fyodorov said we hope that the first session will be in 
the beginning of january with the state bonds 
many western experts advising the soviet union on how to revive 
and operate stock exchanges have recommended they start with bonds 
rather than equities to give the national and republic governments 
time to privatize factories and other means of production 
bonds issued by governments and corporations are considered 
less risky than stocks because they pay the buyer a fixed interest 
rate and can be redeemed at a specified future date 
david darbyshire a partner in arthur andersen the 
international services company that sponsored the seminar said 
bonds are also easy to understand 
he said the fledgling soviet markets need some early successes 
to encourage confidence and investor interest 
in the early stages of the exchange it will be critical that 
only those companies which have a fair chance of success should be 
allowed onto the marketplace he said 
among those most frequently mentioned are the state airline 
aeroflot the intourist travel agency and the oil and gas 
industries 
trading in stocks and bonds was outlawed following the 1917 
bolshevik revolution forcing the closure of an active 
200yearold exchange in st petersburg a moscow stock exchange 
and commodity exchanges were allowed a brief revival during the 
1920s before being abolished 
in october president mikhail s gorbachev issued sweeping 
decrees restoring soviets rights to buy stocks bonds and other 
securities 
the moscow stock exchange was founded in november by 187 
independent companies and without any government body that 
exchange said it would hold a trial bidding session in the spring 
it has has 615 million rubles or 341 million in capital 
by comparison fyodorov said the moscow international stock 
exchange has 10 million rubles or about 55 million in capital 
russias role in forming the moscow international stock exchange 
appeared to reflect the divergent economic agendas of the 
independentminded republics 
latvia on thursday passed its own law legalizing shareholder 
societies something other republics also have done latvian 
lawmakers warned investors to adhere to latvian rather than 
soviet law according to the independent news agency interfax 
meanwhile the new moscow commodity exchange said this week it 
has hired an american grain expert to develop its grain and 
agricultural commodities section 
it said myron laserson former president of the north american 
export grain association will head a sovietamerican team to 
develop and implement an efficient trading mechanism 
a russian commodity exchange begn trading in moscow this week 
and plans are in the works for both stock and commodity exchanges 
in leningrad

miners are fighting congressional 
efforts to reform an 1872 law allowing them to claim public land 
for 250 an acre opponents say its a relic of the old west that 
makes modern landgrabbing easy 
supporters argue that changing the law could put thousands of 
miners out of work and cripple one of the nations basic 
industries 
the mining industry is in trouble its in deep trouble in the 
congress of the united states said bill grannell executive 
director of the western states public lands coalition in pueblo 
colo 
the coalition of miners logging interests and ranchers who use 
federal land mostly in the west has launched a petition drive to 
preserve the mining law of 1872 
the law allows hardrock miners to stake claims on public land 
pay no royalties on extracted minerals and obtain title to claims 
for as little as 250 an acre 
hardrock minerals include gold silver uranium copper lead 
and zinc the us bureau of mines says there are about 130000 
active hardrock miners nationwide 
the law was designed to promote mineral exploration and 
development on federal land which covers 724 million acres mostly 
in 11 western states and alaska it applies to everyone from lone 
prospectors to major mining companies 
reform proponents say they will introduce legislation in 
congress to make miners pay royalties similar to those paid by 
companies that lease land from the government to extract oil coal 
and natural gas 
sen dale bumpers dark will submit a bill like one he pushed 
last session and rep nick rahall dwva will bring a similar 
bill to the house aides said 
the bills would end the socalled patent provision that allows 
miners to work the land and eventually obtain title to it at 1872 
prices 250 to 500 an acre 
under the current law prospectors need to have spent 500 on a 
claim to qualify for a land patent critics of patenting cite a 
1989 general accounting office report that cited abuses and huge 
private and corporate profits 
in one example holders of the title to 17000 acres near grand 
junction colo several years ago paid the government 42500 for 
the land then turned around weeks later and sold it to major oil 
companies for 37 million 
the gao said one 40acre site near mesa ariz patented in 1983 
for 100 is now valued at 400000 
the bumpers bill also would charge miners royalty fees and 
require them to post large bonds to guarantee their ability to 
repair any environmental damage 
miners say boosting their costs that much would force many out 
of business 
in 118 years more than 6 million mining claims have been filed 
with the government and 12 million are still active nevada has 
the most 370000 arizona has 143000 utah 113000 colorado 
80255 and alaska 32000 
miners have obtained title to 84000 acres in colorado mostly 
in oil shale deposits they gained title to 11158 acres in nevada 
14475 in montana 16796 in wyoming and 8406 in alaska 
mining is destroying a lot of public land in this country 
said laura lapins of the mineral policy center in washington which 
is pushing for reforms 
the law enacted during the presidency of ulysses s grant 
doesnt fit in a modern world where the wilderness is disappearing 
and environmental damage is mounting said dave alberswerth of the 
national wildlife federation 
that law is simply an anachronism in this day and age he 
said it is the last remaining land disposal act on the books

navistar international corp said thursday it 
lost 7 million in the fourth quarter and reported a loss for the 
year due to reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks 
the chicagobased truck maker said it lost 6 cents a share in 
the quarter ended oct 31 compared to a loss of 13 million or 8 
cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1989 
revenues fell 4 percent to 971 million vs 101 billion 
for the year navistar lost 11 million or 16 cents a share 
compared with net income of 87 million or 23 cents per share for 
fiscal 1989 revenues were 385 billion down 9 percent from 424 
billion the previous year 
james c cotting navistars chairman and chief executive 
officer said the principal factor behind both the lower demand for 
trucks and the companys losses was a slower us economy 
during the fiscal year medium and heavy truck sales in north 
america totaled 281800 units down 15 percent from 331500 units 
in 1989 
navistar said shipments of midrange diesel engines to original 
equipment manufacturers totalled 100700 engines for the year down 
6 percent from the 106700 engines shipped in 1989 
despite the decline in sales cotting said navistar was able to 
increase its industryleading share of the medium and heavytruck 
market from 274 percent to 279 percent 
he said the companys projections for 1991 anticipate continued 
weakness in demand for medium and heavy trucks he said the company 
has adjusted its production schedules to the lower demand outlook 
and will move to reduce costs to lower the companys breakeven 
point

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in 
light trading thursday on the chicago board of trade on 
expectations credits soon will be extended to the soviet union to 
buy us grains 
hearings wednesday by a us house agriculture subcommittee 
indicated the soviets could be offered credits of about 125 
billion 
william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
said those reports as well as rumors of increased bookings of 
ocean vessels for exports helped fuel the gains in the market 
biedermann said the strong ocean vessel market was an indication 
the soviets may be pricing grains for purchase 
also boosting the market was the improved tone in the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade talks taking place in brussels 
the european community showed a willingness to discuss greater 
cuts in farm subsidies and officials attending the negotiations 
decided to continue their talks rather than suspend them 
at stake in the talks are more access to world markets for poor 
and newly democratizing countries protection against copyright 
theft and extension of fairtrade rules to agriculture banking 
and textiles 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 246 a bushel corn was a

foreign hostages stranded by the invasion of kuwait last summer to

the worlds leading industrial nations with 
the exception of germany are expected to suffer economic declines 
in 1991 as credit tightens around the globe and trade subsides the 
conference board said thursday 
the latest data show the leading economic indicators are flat or 
declining in nine of the worlds top 11 industrial nations the 
board said 
while germany is the only country that seems immune from the 
current rash of pessimism conference board chief economist gail 
fosler noted that the unification euphoria will wear off once tax 
increases are announced to fund the rapidly escalating cost of east 
german econonic development 
fosler predicted growth in japan will be about 35 percent next 
year well off from initial estimates of 5 percent in france 
growth is expected to be as little as 225 percent she said 
in a release 
canada and australia are expected to register economic declines 
in the latter half of this year while the verdict on britain is 
still out after a thirdquarter decline 
among the factors influencing the decline overseas are slowing 
investment growth and consumer spending in europe high interest 
rates and a falling stock market in japan banking finance and 
real estate problems in many major countries and a downturn in 
world trade 
interest rates must come down substantially outside the us 
in order to preserve growth in world trade she said

the dollar fell on world currency markets 
thursday as the prospects for war dimmed following iraqi president 
saddam husseins offer to release western hostages 
gold prices also fell on the new york commodity exchange gold 
settled at 37170 a troy ounce off 250 from wednesday later 
republic national bank quoted a late bid for gold at 371 off 
175 
the market interpreted husseins offer as a sign war tensions 
were easing and the dollar fell sharply said marc chandler an 
analyst with the firm idea the dollar typically is viewed as a 
safehaven currency during times of world turmoil 
but as the session wore on chandler said it became more clear 
to traders that hussein was actually prepared for war and made the 
offer because his troops are now fully deployed in kuwait that 
assessment helped the dollar firm a bit around midday but it then 
languished for the remainder of the session 
the market was supporting the dollar on a war premium and took 
it down on a peace premium said michael malpede a senior 
analyst at refco group ltd in chicago 
also pressuring the dollar was anticipation over the release 
friday of november unemployment data analysts expect the labor 
department report will show an increase in initial jobless claims 
and a higher overall unemployment rate for the month 
that will further confirm the slowdown of the us economy and 
add pressure on the federal reserve to ease interest rates 
chandler said lower interest rates erode the value of 
dollardenominated securities and therefore decrease investors 
need for the us currency 
in tokyo the dollar rose to a closing 13405 japanese yen from 
13342 yen on wednesday later in london it fell to 13235 yen in

assets of the nations 533 money market mutual 
funds rose by 102 billion in the latest week to an alltime high 
of 42489 billion the investment company institute said thursday 
the rise in the sevenday period ended wednesday came despite an 
easing of interest rates that generally tend to make moneymarket 
fund investments less attractive relative to stocks and bonds 
the fundasset total broke the record set the previous week 
when the figure reached 42387 billion that total originally was 
reported as 42376 billion but the institute subsequently revised 
it upward 
despite further moderate easing of yields offered by money 
market funds their assets continued to climb said jacob dreyer 
vice president and chief economist of the institute a 
washingtonbased mutual fund trade group 
so far neither rising stock and bond prices nor the 
anticipation of future decliens in shortterm interest rates had a 
discernible inhibiting effect on flows of assets into money market 
funds he said 
the institute said that in the latest week assets of 265 
general purpose funds rose by 3038 million to 15032 billion 
assets of 104 brokerdealer funds rose by 1473 million to 16653 
billion and assets of 164 institutional funds rose by 5708 
million to 10804 billion the sevenday average yield on money market 
mutual funds in the 
week ended tuesday was 727 percent unchanged from the previous 
week said donoghues money fund report a trade journal based in 
holliston mass 
the 30day average yield fell to 731 percent from 734 percent 
donoghues said 
the average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 
52 days up from 50 days donoghues said 
the newsletter bank rate monitor said its survey of 100 leading 
commercial banks savings and loan associations and savings banks

trading in crude oil futures would be 
temporarily suspended in response to large price swings under a 
plan approved thursday by the new york mercantile exchange 
the plan to be considered by federal regulators would also 
limit the amount oil could rise or fall each day to 15 per barrel 
and the amount gasoline or home heating oil could rise or fall to 
40 cents a gallon each day 
exchange officials told a news conference that the plan was 
developed to ensure orderly trading in volatile situations such as 
a war in the persian gulf which could push prices higher or a 
sudden outbreak of peace which could send prices into a steep 
decline 
the officials denied bowing to any pressure from regulators or 
criticism that speculators were profiteering from wide swings in 
the futures market 
we were not goaded into this by any federal agency said 
merc chairman z lou guttman said we felt that this was a very 
responsible and necessary precautionary measure 
but oil market traders said the plan was aimed at heading off 
tighter regulation by the commodity futures trading commission 
rather than have the cftc close the exchange during war we 
could claim there are circuitbreakers said christian gohler a 
broker at merrill lynch energy futures thats the only redeeming 
quality 
david geary a cftc spokesman said the commission had not yet 
received the complete proposal from the exchange but he said the 
matter would be considered quickly exchange officials said they 
expected the plan to be approved by next wednesday 
a prominent critic of oil pricing sen joseph i lieberman 
dconn said the exchanges plan was a small step in the right 
direction but he said he would favor a government shutdown of the 
oil market if war broke out 
a 15abarrel increase in one day is still huge and 
unacceptable lieberman said in a telephone interview but 
lieberman praised the exchange officials for acknowledging they 
have some obligation to try to limit the increases in the price of 
oil due to panic 
oil traders pointed out that any limits at the exchange would 
not stop a big move by crude because there are no limits at the 
futures markets in london and singapore or in the spot market where 
buyers pay cash for oil at loading docks 
many doubt the exchanges limits would ever come into play 
because they are so wide 
its going to be in effect limitless trading which is the way 
the free markets are supposed to operate said brian tagler an 
oil broker at shearson lehman brothers inc 
the largest oneday move oil futures have made in new york 
occurred on oct 22 when crude dropped 541 per barrel largely 
in response to a rumor that iraqi president saddam hussein had a 
dream in which a prophet told him his missiles were pointed the 
wrong way the oil market took that to be a sign of peace in the 
middle east 
exchange officials said they were not trying to predict oil 
prices would move 15 daily after a war broke out they said the 
figure set conservative limits for the normal functioning of the 
market beyond those limits market participants might be unable to 
meet their obligations as buyers and sellers 
under the new rules if oil prices swing 750 in either 
direction during a single trading session and stay at that level 
for five minutes oil brokers would be told that trading would be 
halted in two minutes after a trading halt of one hour trading 
would resume with the swing in prices limited to another 750 for 
a total of 15 the limits would affect contracts for the two 
nearest delivery months 
trading of unleaded gasoline and home heating oil futures would 
follow a similar pattern with a maximum move of 40 cents a gallon 
in either direction on the two nearest months 
the exchange currently has no limits on moves made by contracts 
for nextmonth delivery of oil although there are limits on outer 
months 
exchange officials said the hours break in trading would give 
futures players time to take a closer look at world events that are 
pushing the price of crude

american general corps board of directors on 
thursday rejected two bids for its home service insurance 
subsidiaries and took the units off the sales block 
the board also authorized the resumption of its stock repurchase 
program suspended since talk of a possible sale began last may 
harold s hook chairman and chief executive of the 
houstonbased financial services company said the higher of the 
two bids opened tuesday was 365 billion of which 18 billion 
would cover the assumption of corporate debt 
under this proposal american general shareholders would have 
received about 15 per share in a combination of cash and 
securities of the acquiring company hook said the board 
concluded that this proposal fell short of the value of these 
operations

a whole american general set a dec 3 deadline for bids for part 
of the company as well as the company as a whole but by tuesday it 
had received only two bids for the home service subsidiaries and 
none for the whole company 
hooks said after considering the proposals and the companys 
future the board agreed that continuing the sale process is not 
likely to be productive and instead would be detrimental to the 
business of the company

20 percent of its stock outstanding as of april 1 1987 when it 
initiated its repurchasing plan the plan was suspended last may

the markets yearend rally picked up fresh momentum wednesday 
after word came from the state department that iraq had agreed to 
hold talks with president bush on the crisis in the persian gulf 
on thursday traders arriving at work were greeted by news that 
saddam hussein iraqs president had urged his parliament to 
permit all foreign hostages stranded by the invasion of kuwait last 
summer to leave 
those developments pushed oil prices lower and interest rates 
fell in the credit markets 
brokers said stocks benefited in particular from hopes that 
efforts to pull the us economy out of recession could proceed 
without the disrupting influence of the threat of war with iraq

oil prices fell for a second straight session 
thursday to levels not seen for months with the plunge based on 
iraqi president saddam husseins promise to free all hostages 
light sweet crude oil dropped 89 cents to 2640 per barrel at 
the new york mercantile exchange on contracts for delivery in 
january oil for nextmonth delivery had not been that cheap on the 
exchange since late august 
unleaded gasoline futures fell 224 cents to 6660 cents a 
gallon for january delivery at one point gasoline was below 65 
cents a gallon within a fraction of a penny of the price it 
commanded on aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait 
home heating oil was down 143 cents to 7191 cents a gallon 
a day earlier all of the futures contracts dropped to levels 
they had not traded for since the month of the invasion they kept 
falling thursday though not as sharply 
were seeing an erosion of the war premium said annlouise 
hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc i 
think the market is just registering this change in the situation 
and trying to establish a new base 
oil had fallen even farther in early trading thursday but it 
regained some ground during the afternoon traders were responding 
in part to continued harsh rhetoric from us officials but some 
began buying oil again when they decided crude must have hit 
bottom at least for the time being 
the oil market has been overwhelmingly bearish since last 
friday when president bush offered to hold diplomatic meetings 
with ranking iraqis in an effort to convince saddam that he must 
get his troops out of kuwait 
analysts have said the demise of much of the war premium has 
been accentuated by increased oil production that has some 
countries stuck with millions of barrels of crude they cannot 
immediately sell 
but the threat of war still carried some weight in the oil pits 
crude had been down more than 2 a barrel before president bush 
held a news conference in santiago chile that was construed as 
bullish bush said release of the thousands of hostages would not 
weaken american resolve to get iraqi troops out of kuwait 
that sparked a rally but it was unable to pull oil all the way 
back up 
natural gas which is not directly affected by the turmoil in 
the middle east also dropped thursday it closed down 51 cents at 
2351 per 1000 cubic feet on contracts for january delivery

developments in the persian gulf crisis continued to control the 
direction of the precious metals and energy markets thursday they 
both lost ground as the rhetoric by world leaders waxed both 
conciliatory and bellicose 
gold futures for february delivery plunged 410 a troy ounce in 
early trading before recovering somewhat while energy futures 
followed the same pattern 
on other markets livestock and pork futures were mixed and 
grains and soybeans were higher 
gold on new yorks commodity exchange opened sharply lower on 
word the iraqis will release foreign hostages held since the 
occupation of kuwait said william oneill an analyst with merrill 
lynch futures inc in new york 
oneill said gold futures began to show improvement after 
president bushs comments that iraq must leave kuwait without 
reservation without conditions before the gulf crisis can end 
gold settled 230 to 260 lower with the contract for delivery 
in february at 37320 a troy ounce silver was 27 cents to 35 
cents lower with january at 4136 a troy ounce 
brian tagler of shearson lehman brothers inc in new york said 
the energy market mirrored golds movement 
the market was counting on bush to be unbending and figured 
that would send the market back up and he was he said 
tagler said that while the persian gulf crisis is primarily 
controlling the movement of energy prices he noted that there is 
an underlining bearish tone to the market 
he noted that saudi arabia and other gulf states have more than 
made up for the loss of kuwaiti and iraqi oil production 
there is a lot of crude out there and demand is soft 
tagler said adding that in the long term energy futures will 
continue to be pressured 
light sweet crude was 23 cents to 94 cents lower with january at 
2640 a barrel heating oil was 116 cents to 355 cents lower 
with january at 7971 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 180 
cents to 313 cents lower with january at 6650 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in light trading 
on the chicago board of trade on expectations that credits soon 
will be extended to the soviet union to buy us grains 
hearings wednesday by a us house agriculture subcommittee 
indicated the soviets could be offered credits of about 125 
billion 
william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
said those reports as well as rumors of increased bookings of 
ocean vessels for exports helped fuel the gains in the market 
biedermann said the strong ocean vessel market was an indication 
the soviets may be pricing grains for purchase 
also boosting the market was an improved tone early on at world 
trade talks in brussels the european community had shown a 
willingness to discuss greater cuts in farm subsidies and 
officials attending the negotiations decided to continue their 
talks rather than suspend them 
later on however after the markets closed the ec rejected a 
lastminute compromise proposal to make significant subsidy cuts 
and the talks were close to collapse 
at stake in the talks are more access to world markets for poor 
and newly democratizing countries protection against copyright 
theft and extension of fairtrade rules to agriculture banking 
and textiles 
wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with december at 247 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 
225 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december 
at 111 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in january at 597 a bushel 
livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly lower on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle futures were boosted by high cash prices which are 
trading at a premium to futures said charles levitt an analyst 
with shearson lehman brothers inc in chicago 
pork futures were pressured by the steady marketing of hogs by 
farmers and the heavier than normal weight of hogs being 
slaughtered the heavier hogs mean more pork is available to the 
market than normally is the case levitt said 
live cattle were 02 cent to 30 cent higher with december at 
7927 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 50 cent 
higher with january at 8822 cents a pound live hogs were 62 cent 
lower to 12 cent higher with december at 49 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 102 cents to 125 cents lower with february at 
6285 cents a pound

nec corp said thursday it will create new sales 
divisions in germany and japan to boost its overseas marketing of 
supercomputers 
while nec and two other japanese supercomputer makers fujitsu 
and hitachi together have sold more than 200 supercomputers the 
vast majority have been ordered in japan 
necs new european supercomputer division based in cologne 
germany hopes to sell 30 of the companys new sx3 supercomputers 
over the next four years company officials said that would 
approximately double the number of japanese supercomputers in place 
overseas 
nec says the sx3 which it recently began shipping is the 
worlds fastest computer in some benchmark tests it plans to sell 
120 of the multimillion dollar machines worldwide including 40 
outside japan 
nec has sold only one supercomputer in the united states and 
some officials charge that japanese machines have been unfairly 
excluded from us government procurement programs 
a us trade official negotiating access for us supercomputers 
to japanese procurement programs said earlier this year that japan 
should do as we say not as we do regarding open government 
purchasing he also said us supercomputers made primarily by 
cray research inc still had an overall performance advantage 
but many industry analysts believe that gap has greatly 
narrowed and some believe it has disappeared 
in the united states nec will continue to market its 
supercomputers through its hnsx supercomputers sales subsidiary 
the official said 
the new marketing division in tokyo will provide worldwide sales 
and technical support nec said 
supercomputers are highspeed computers designed to handle large 
numbers of repetitive scientific calculations in areas such as car 
design weather forecasting aerospace and defense

the 66 billion buyout of mca inc by a 
giant japanese electronics company is being challenged in an 
antitrust lawsuit by a small arizona manufacturer of a dualdeck 
videocassette recorder 
govideo inc of scottsdale contends matsushita electric 
industrial cos pending deal is part of a conspiracy with sony 
corp and oher japanese companies to monopolize the world market 
for electronics hardware vcrs televisions and audio gear 
the lawsuit filed thursday asks the federal court in phoenix 
to block the buyout on grounds it violates us laws designed to 
encourage competition 
the action grows out of earlier lawsuits by govideo which is 
counting on sales of its patented dualdeck vcr2 for survival it 
began selling the machine billed as the worlds first such device 
last july 
the lawsuit touches on the sensitive issue of how japan has 
taken control of the consumer electronics business from the united 
states 
the primary objective of the japanese companies is to dominate 
the yettoemerge highdefinition television market said joseph m 
alioto a lawyer for govideo 
these guys are looking 20 years down the road alioto said 
in a telephone interview from san francisco 
matsushita spokeswoman joele frank declined immediate comment 
saying the companys lawyers hadnt finished reviewing the lawsuit 
mca spokeswoman christine hanson said the company never comments on 
lawsuits 
much has been made of the fact that the purchase of mca the 
parent of universal studios would give matsushita movies 
television shows and recordings to complement its consumer 
electronics products 
sony corp used the strategy last year in purchasing columbia 
pictures for 34 billion the korean electronics giant samsung 
group was reported thursday to be interested in a similar purchase 
of orion pictures 
alioto said the japanese companies intend to use their 
domination of both sides of the entertainment business to ensure 
that govideos products will not play their software and 
anybody else outside japan who makes hdtv wont either 
govideo already is pursuing its conspiracy claim in an earlier 
lawsuit against matsushita and its panasonic division victor co 
of japan ltd and its jvc corp subsidiary sanyo electric co 
ltd sony and nec corp 
govideo contends the companies have formed a cartel to control 
the consumerelectronics market 
in an unrelated development mca said it would sell its yosemite 
park amp curry co to an american buyer rather than give the national 
park concession to the us government before the buyout by 
matsushita 
mca chairman lew r wasserman turned down a request by interior 
secretary manuel lujan jr for donation of the company which has 
the concession contract at yosemite national park until 1993 and 
owns about half of the restaurants stores and lodgings in yosemite 
valley 
james ridenour director of the park service said wednesday he 
had been told that curry co assets were made part of the deal 
with matsushita and could not be given away 
because of the foreign ownership issue mca and matsushita 
agreed last month to place the curry co in escrow until a us 
buyer could be found in the meantime curry co profits will be 
donated to the national park foundation a group that channels 
private money to the park service 
we believe this is a generous gift which will further the work 
of the national park service wasserman wrote to lujan

members of the united food and commercial workers 
union rallied in seattle and other cities thursday to protest what 
they called labor abuses by the retailer nordstrom inc 
about 90 union members and supporters gathered at a downtown 
seattle park before marching six blocks to hand out leaflets in 
front of the clothing retailers flagship store 
ufcw local 1001 president joe peterson whose union has been 
battling nordstrom for more than a year and a half told the 
gathering were here today to let nordstrom employees know were 
fighting for their right to earn a living under decent working 
conditions 
few current nordstrom workers attended the seattle rally 
peterson said nordstrom employees didnt turn out because they are 
afraid of being harassed by the company 
peterson outlined what he said were past and present abuses by 
the company the allegations include forcing employees to perform 
services without pay discriminating against workers over 40 
pregnant women and blacks trying to deny unemployment benefits to 
former workers and seeking to limit information to employees and 
the news media about its treatment of workers 
nordstrom spokesman tim doke called the unions allegations 
nonsense 
doke said union rallies were reported in los angeles san 
francisco portland ore and in tysons corner va near 
washington dc 
local 1001 represents about 1700 workers at six seattlearea 
stores nordstrom employs more than 30000 people at 62 stores in 
washington oregon alaska utah california virginia and new 
jersey 
two nordstrom workers who attended the rally in seattle were 
diane aldrich who works at the seattle northgate mall store and 
kathleen sargent from the downtown seattle store both said they 
are members of nordstrom employees opposed to union representation 
an employee group seeking a vote to decertify ufcw representation 
aldrich said most of the allegations mentioned by the union had 
been settled 
i couldnt be upset with what i heard today because its all 
old news she said 
aldrich said she didnt understand the unions allegations about 
discrimination she said she works with blacks and pregnant women 
at northgate and that im 44 and ive only worked there a 
year 
last month the national labor relations board rejected appeals 
by local 1001 to overturn settlements reached by nordstrom and the 
federal agency 
in the settlements nordstrom agreed to post notices promising 
not to penalize employees for union activity not to bargain with 
workers directly and not to withhold information sought by the 
union for negotiations 
after the notices have been posted 60 days nordstrom may be 
found in compliance with the settlement the nlrb said at that 
point employees could start circulating petitions for an election 
on whether to retain the union peterson however has said the 
decertification effort would be blocked by the filing of new unfair 
labor practice charges 
action on petitions to decertify a union are barred while any 
unfair labor practice charges are pending 
peterson has said that fewer than half the workers represented 
by his local are union members 
local 1001s contract with nordstrom expired july 31 1989 
after company negotiators refused to accept renewal of a provision 
requiring employees covered by the contract to belong to the union 
last winter the union filed suit seeking more than 300 million 
in back pay for nordstrom employees nationwide 
a separate but similar union complaint resulted in a state 
department of labor and industries ruling in february that 
nordstrom failed to pay some workers for attending company 
meetings writing thankyou notes to customers making deliveries 
and performing other functions on their own time

saddam husseins offer to free foreign hostages 
jolted financial markets thursday inciting a brief rally on wall 
street and a drop in oil prices on hunches of a breakthrough in the 
4monthold persian gulf crisis 
but president bushs skeptical response and insistence that the 
iraqi leaders troops vacate kuwait doused the initial enthusiasm 
many strategists said it was premature to conclude war had become a 
remote possibility 
i think the market feels were taking a step closer to 
peace said gary n ross president of consulting activities at 
petroleum industry research associates in new york nonetheless he 
said youve got to expect the market is going to continue to be 
volatile peace isnt necessarily at hand 
the iraqi leader said all foreign hostages would be freed 
because of what he called diplomatic advances in resolving the 
crisis that began after he seized kuwait aug 2 that invasion led 
to united nations sanctions and a major us military deployment 
that has threatened to escalate into war 
bush at a news conference during a trip to santiago chile 
said saddam should never have taken hostages and that he must 
withdraw from kuwait unconditionally before the crisis can end 
by the end of the day the price of oil which initially plunged 
more than 2 a barrel on the hostagefreedom offer ended with an 
89 cent loss at 2640 a barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks the bestknown 
barometer of wall street finished down 792 points to 260248 
the average had been up over 30 points in the first 15 minutes of 
trading 
i was sort of stunned that we ended down 40 points 
essentially said john eberley a stock trader at the chicago 
corp investment company my guess is that bushs posture 
nothing less than absolutely withdrawal spooked some people 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of interest rates and 
the economys direction the key 30year treasury bond also ended 
with loss after rising sharply on the iraqi hostage announcement 
gold prices and the dollar historically considered safe ways to 
protect money during times of political and economic travail also 
ended with losses which some trading professionals attributed to 
the prospects of peace 
the dollars advantage as a safe haven currency is the reason 
for its unfortunate demise at least temporarily said zlatko 
glamuzina chief currency dealer at the new york branch of the 
banco di sicilia 
the war premium is down glamuzina said if i am an 
investor the dollar is not the greatest currency to park my 
money 
in the precious metals market gold prices which lately have 
been following the behavior of the oil market fell about 250 a 
troy ounce to about 372 but that is considered an insignificant 
drop 
some strategists said the decline in gold would have been 
greater if the iraqi leader had begun freeing hostages instead of 
simply suggesting they would be released at an unspecified time 
if he does the release the hostages he loses a major chip 
said nelson colton president of the precious metals group at 
amark precious metals a leading wholesaler based in los angeles 
the general opinion is when he does it well believe it 
others said the financial market behavior reflected other 
influences particularly signs of weakness of the american economy 
that is discouraging us investments 
people are using any opportunity any good news out of the 
persian gulf to lighten up said john hickey treasurer at the 
new york branch of kansallisosakepankki a finnish banking 
company

order pauls attorneys responded by asking for a stay of the 
ruling and filing notice of appeal late thursday which could 
eventually put the case before the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta 
since we expect the government to do whatever it can to hurt 
david paul contempt or whatever we are trying to get the ruling

contaminated waste according to a civil lawsuit brought by the 
securities and exchange commission 
in the lawsuit filed at federal court in houston the sec 
accused fmf corp and three top officers of fraud scheme in which 
they either deliberately misled investors or recklessly disregarded 
whether the information they supplied was true or false 
under the recently passed securities enforcement remedies and 
penny stock reform act the stock market watchdog agency is seeking 
a court order to freeze the defendants assets and make them pay 
restitution to investors and fines to the government 
william mclucas head of the secs enforcement division said 
the action was the first brought by the agency under the new law 
which empowers the sec to seek fines for securities crimes other 
than insider trading 
he said the law allows the sec to seek up to 500000 in fines 
from a company for each alleged violation although the agency has 
not quantified how many violations allegedly occurred 
named as defendants in the suit in addition to the company were 
fmfs chairman abraham a greenspan and its president bf 
winborn both of houston and the companys vice president of 
operations charles w brandes of sealy texas

the united states had a treaty with equitorial guinea allowing 
the storage of lowlevel radioactive waste in the west african 
nation when no such treaty exists 
fmf had a concession from equitorial guinea to bury up to 2 
million tons of radon gas impregnated waste within its borders 
when equitorial guinea has not given that permission to anyone 
fmf had a contract with indianapolisbased eli lilly amp co to 
dispose of 30000 tons of contaminated material in africa when 
lilly has never done business with fmf 
it is our belief and our allegations that they never engaged 
in this business at all this appears to be a total sham to us 
said therese d pritchard an sec attorney handling the case 
sec officials said the case was referred to them by the nuclear 
regulatory commission 
the sec also charged that fmf did not tell investors as 
required under securities law disclosure rules that greenspan the 
fmf chairman was barred from practicing law in texas in 1980 was 
convicted of fraudulently obtaining a 1 million bank loan in 1989 
and filed for personal bankruptcy in 1988

talks among 107 nations trying to draft 
an ambitious global trade pact neared collapse thursday night after 
the european community rejected a lastminute compromise making 
significant cuts in farm subsidies 
trade ministers suggested the ecs action virtually dooms any 
chances for reaching a trade agreement this week in brussels 
however many said they will campaign friday for holding more 
discussions after a coolingoff period 
however such a strategy runs a high risk of failure given 
tight deadlines imposed by the us congress for approving any 
final outcome under socalled fasttrack authority 
the battle between the united states and its trade allies on one 
side and the 12nation european community on the other turned out 
to be the biggest stumbling block to getting an overall agreement 
in the trade talks 
in a lastditch attempt to rescue the negotiations swedish 
agriculture minister mats hellstrom chairman of the farm 
negotiating panel put forward a proposal that represented a 
compromise between the drastic cuts in farm subsidies being sought 
by the united states and the minimal offer of the ec which was 
trying to protect its 10 million mainly small farmers 
the talks known as the uruguay round for the country where they 
began in 1986 had stalled in what was to have been the final week 
of bargaining 
the talks are being held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade also known as gatt 
hellstrom suggested acrosstheboard cuts of 30 percent in 
internal farm supports export subsidies and market barriers over a 
fiveyear period 
but the hellstrom proposal brought strong objections almost 
immediately from community officials 
other countries who objected the proposal were south korea and 
japan which would have been forced to open its closed rice market 
to foreign imports under the proposal 
you will find that among ministers opinion strays from 
monstrous proposal shocking paper twice what the community 
has agreed to said ec agricultural commissioner ray macsharry 
talking to reporters he refused to be specific about what other 
cuts the ec was willing to make 
us negotiators are pushing for cuts of 75 percent in internal 
price supports and market barriers and 90 percent reductions in 
export subsidies over a 10year period 
us trade representative carla hills suggested the united 
states would be willing to accept smaller percentage reductions as 
long as it obtained binding commitments from the ec to make 
reductions in all three areas 
the united states and some other major exporting countries 
including canada have been pushing the europeans to relent and 
agree to major cuts in subsidies 
without movement on agriculture it is likely the trade talks 
will be suspended perhaps for up to a month 
neal blewett the australian trade minister said it is now time 
for the countries to turn their attention to trying to rescue the 
overall trade package by setting up a fallback meeting possibly 
in january 
the united states had insisted such a strategy was risky given 
a march 1 deadline imposed by congress for submitting a complete 
deal and the necessary time to put the nearly 300page document in 
shape 
the reduction in farm subsidies is being pushed hard by the bush 
administration washington sees the change as a boost to american 
farm exports as well as those of many farmbased third world 
nations which cannot compete with the huge subisidies offered by 
the developed world 
more than 1500 delegates including four members of bushs 
cabinet have been taking part in the negotiations which began on 
monday and were scheduled to end on friday 
gatt was established in 1947 as a forum for promoting free 
trade the current round of talks is the eighth since world war ii

continental airlines officials made misleading 
comments about the troubled carriers plans to seek bankruptcy 
protection in an effort to prop up its stock value according to a 
lawsuit filed thursday 
former chairman frank lorenzo and others artificially inflated 
the market price of continental stock by denying in interviews with 
the news media that the nations fifthlargest airline was 
considering filing for bankruptcy protection according to the 
lawsuit filed on behalf of shareholders 
continental disputed the allegations 
as far as this airline is concerned that suit is utterly 
without merit spokesman art kent said from houston in no way 
were our shareholders or the public misled by any statements that 
were made at the time those statements were made we had no intent 
to file for protection under chapter 11 
continental filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors on 
monday saying it was forced into bankruptcy court by soaring fuel 
costs and mounting interest payments on its 62 billion debt 
the shareholders lawsuit a class action filed in us district 
court was brought on behalf of investors who purchased continental 
stock between oct 24 and the airlines bankruptcy filing 
the shareholders said that during this time period airline 
officials publicly denied their intention to seek bankruptcy 
protection even though such action was continually under 
consideration as a solution to continentals worsening liquidity 
and other financial problems 
the lawsuit accuses the airline officials of violating 
securities laws and seeks unspecified damages because of losses on 
investments 
according to the lawsuit continental stock fell from 362 per 
share to 2 per share after the bankruptcy filing 
in addition to lorenzo the lawsuit names jan carlzon chairman 
of scandinavian airlines system continentals largest shareholder 
continental chairman carl r pohlad and hollis harris president

american telephone and telegraph co has filed 
federal lawsuits in maryland and ohio seeking to block ncr corp 
from fighting a hostile 61 billion takeover attempt by the 
telephone giant 
atampt spokeswoman paula horii said the lawsuit filed thursday in 
us district court in columbus ohio seeks to prevent ncr from 
stalling atampt with requests for information 
the baltimore action filed late wednesday in us district 
court also names ncr which is chartered in maryland and maryland 
attorney general j joseph curran who has opposed corporate 
takeovers 
atampt asked a federal judge to bar ncr and curran from using the 
maryland business combination act or other state laws to stop atampt 
from acquiring enough ncr stock or shareholder proxies to take 
over the dayon ohiobased computer maker 
the maryland law would impose a fiveyear moratorium on 
acquiring enough stock or proxies to force a takeover 
atampt has issued a tender offer of 90 per share for ncr common 
stock which the lawsuit said is a premium of nearly 90 percent 
over the market price of ncrs common shares 
ncr chairman charles e exley has told atampt his company would 
not consider a tender offer of less than 125 per share 
ncr spokeswoman connie olasz said the company has not yet seen 
the lawsuits and could not comment on them 
olasz said ncrs board of directors on wednesday voted to opt 
out of a maryland state law in an attempt to block atampt from 
calling a special meeting of ncr shareholders to vote on the tender 
offer

faced with rising local wages and 
other problems foreign corporate investors withdrew 110 million 
from south korea in the first nine months of 1990 the finance 
ministry said friday 
approvals on new foreign capital investment in south korea from 
january to september totaled 632 million down 269 percent from 
the same period last year ministry officials said 
the total amount of foreign capital investment remaining in 
south korea was listed at 566 billion at the end of september 
withdrawals of direct foreign investment from the country 
totaled 75 million in 1989 and 48 million in 1988 it was not 
known how many foreign businesses were involved in the capital 
withdrawals in the past three years 
the declines were attributed to worsening investment conditions 
such as steep local wage hikes labor unrest and a slowdown in 
local economic growth 
even many korean businesses in recent years have relocated 
manufacturing and other operations to other countries where labor 
is available at lower cost without unrest

wheelingpittsburgh steel corp on thursday 
asked a federal judge to confirm a reorganization plan to keep the 
company in business by giving 600 million in cash to creditors 
executives of the nations 10thlargest steelmaker said at a 
hearing before us bankruptcy judge warren bentz the plan will 
allow the company the remain competitive with other steel 
companies 
under the proposed reorganization unsecured creditors would be 
paid 72 cents per 1 of debt 
the remaining challenger to the plan is a joint interest of the 
us farmers home administration and equibank which is owed 44 
million 
bentz on thursday dismissed a claim by the us environmental 
protection agency which sought to force wheelingpittsburgh to 
place pollutioncontrol devices on its mills 
the agency wanted wheelingpittsburgh to place cash in an escrow 
account for the machinery but bentz said the agency would have to 
sue in another court for such an order 
the plan before the judge would create two corporations a 
holding company wheelingpittsburgh corp chaired by new york 
investor ronald lebow who purchased 86 percent of secured debt 
and an operating company wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 
liquidating the companys assets would be unsound said james t 
gibbons wheeling pittsburghs director of reorganization and 
planning 
gibbons estimated the value of a liquidated wheelingpittsburgh 
at 860 million to 870 million in contrast the reorganized 
company would be worth at least 11 billion he said 
gibbons told bentz that wheelingpittsburgh is a leaner more 
competitive company than the one that filed for protection from its 
creditors in 1985 
a major step toward recovery was the closing of the monessen 
steel mill which was operating at 30 percent capacity gibbons 
said the mill was sold in 1988 to other steel makers 
wheelingpittsburgh employs 7100 people in ohio west virginia 
and pennsylvania
