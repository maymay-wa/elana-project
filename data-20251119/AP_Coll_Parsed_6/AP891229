attorney general dick thornburgh said friday 
he has decided against prosecution or disciplinary action over a 
news leak about a pennsylvania congressman because the department 
cant identify the leaker 
in a letter to sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee thornburgh said investigators had been 
unable to identify with certainy the original source of 
unauthorized disclosures to cbs reporter rita braver about the 
office of rep william h gray iii dpa 
thornburgh said the investigators also told him that the 
nature of the confirmations alleged to have been forthcoming to ms 
braver were uncertain 
consequently he said the investigators told him that it 
would be futile and impossible to pursue a prosecution based on the 
available evidence 
therefore i have accepted the recommendation of the 
investigators and prosecutors that this matter be closed without 
prosecution the attorney general said 
furthermore since the investigation has not produced 
sufficient evidence to enable me to ascertain that any present 
employees of the department of justice was responsible for the 
disclosure i have determined that no termination of employment or 
other disciplinary action is justified in this matter at this 
time 
the leak occurred while gray was seeking election in the house 
as majority whip prompting accusations from democratic lawmakers 
that thornburghs aides were the source of a political leak 
two weeks after ms bravers broadcast that grays office was 
being investigated the justice department stated that gray was not 
a target of the investigation and was cooperating with the probe 
gray who was elected whip said the day after the broadcast he 
had been told by fbi agents from the philadelphia office in a 
memorial day interview that he was not a target and that they were 
looking into the possibility that one of his employees held a 
noshow job nothing more has been heard of that investigation 
thornburgh said he wrote to biden because the judiciary 
chairman at a committee hearing june 2 at which thornburgh 
testified raised questions with regard to my concerns over 
unauthorized disclosure of information 
biden said in a statement that thornburgh wrote him that the 
departments office of professional responsibility concurred with 
all conclusions and recommendations of the criminal division in the 
matter but the senator said committee staff members had checked 
with the office of professional responsibility and though that 
office had been consulted it has never seen the criminal 
division report or any of its conclusions and therefore could not 
have an has not concurred in those conclusions 
normally the office of professional responsibility would be 
responsible for recommending disciplinary action against department 
employees 
thornburghs spokesman david runkel said i dont know whom 
sen biden or his staff has been talking to but that statement is 
clearly at odds with what the attorney general was told by the 
criminal division 
the head of the office of professional responsibility michael 
e shaheen does not have a listed telephone number 
thornburgh told the senator that 11 fbi agents devoted 
approximately 385 days to the investigation interviewing members 
of the us attorneys office in philadelphia the philadelphia 
division of the fbi fbi headquarters the criminal division of the 
justice department and the attorney generals office 
he said about 30 other persons were also interviewed including 
members of congress aides to gray confidential sources and 
several reporters ms braver declined to be interviewed or 
otherwise cooperate with this investigation he said 
gray said in a statement from philadelphia the failure of 
this investigation raises the white flag of surrender to those in 
the department of justice who use false leaks to defame innocent 
citizens the leaks in this case were designed to harm me but 
their real victim was the integrity of our criminal justice 
system 
cbs said ms braver was on vacation

in the passion that fueled romanias 
revolution freedom was spoken again and again but to a people 
forced to register even their typewriters the full meaning of the 
exotic word was difficult to grasp 
what is it to live free to travel free to speak freely 
mused ioana popescu a 21yearold medical student we have only 
seen dark and silence 
over the moans of the wounded in a crowded hospital ward she 
and some fellow volunteers considered what the term freedom 
meant 
we cant realize what freedom is said anda preda also 21 
to an american reporter you grew up in freedom and you do not 
realize what this means to us 
she paused and frowned and apologized for her poor english 
im sorry she said ive learned english 11 years and 
this is the first time i speak it 
until young romanians such as herself helped overthrow nicolae 
ceausescu every such contact with a foreigner would have to be 
reported to the despised secret police the securitate people 
could leave romania only in the rarest of circumstances 
ceausescus ears were everywhere people spoke in whispers 
trusting only the closest of friends an indiscreet word even the 
wrong gesture in delicate moments could alter an entire life 
for young romanians it had been that way all of their lives 
most of their parents were born under stalinism and their 
grandparents lived through a world war 
suddenly it was all over or was it 
even now it is like a dream said ms popescu days after 
ceausescu was toppled maybe i will wake up and it is gone 
bogdan lazarae did not expect freedom to go away but he was not 
sure what it was at 21 he is an engineering student with a 
searching soul he has been helping doctors until nightfall and 
then manning a subway checkpoint until morning 
we dont know what this means freedom he said 
we dont know what to do with freedom we have no experience 
no model no idea 
in his first free moments lazarae worked as a translator for 
reporters trying to understand romania at times he is just as 
confused as the outsiders 
i am afraid people will ask me what i am doing with 
foreigners but no one asks thats a little bit of freedom i am 
afraid to speak the name of ceausescu in the street maybe someone 
will tell me im an enemy but they dont thats a little bit of 
freedom 
mainly he said to be free is to talk free to say what you 
want it is very bad to hide what you are thinking it is not 
healthy it is not dignified 
all over romania people are experimenting with the elusive 
concept they fought so hard to obtain 
at the university of bucharest historian stephan andrescu 
described freedom as a lost treasure enjoyed by romanians for most 
of the time between 1865 and the tumult of the world war ii 
at the national library where 10 percent of the books were 
shown only to people with clearance from the secret police freedom 
has a specific meaning 
what is essential is freedom of the mind said angela 
brodiceni library director we will face many problems many 
trials but now our minds are free 
at the hilltop metropolitan cathedral ionita victoria thanks 
god for freedom of worship she was afraid to go to church in a 
country where police noted names of the religious but she braved 
sniper fire when those police lost their power 
at the agerpres news agency an editor who is still reluctant to 
be quoted by name is grateful for the freedom to report without 
hiding most of the truth he wept out of control as he tried to 
purge his guilt for not resisting earlier on his own 
the concept of freedom takes different shapes depending upon the 
surroundings at the bucharest emergency hospital it hits hard 
ms popescu looked at the casualties lying on stretchers in the 
narrow hallway 
you have to respect this thing freedom when you think of the 
price it carries she said 
but it takes its broadest meaning on street corners where for 
the first time in 45 years people can shout out their opinions to 
foreigners 
near the bombedout communist party central committee building 
a small group of people waited their turn to speak to american 
reporters about what they felt they had won 
not one could finish his piece with dry eyes 
toma cornelia called out that he had a sister in loveland 
colo named ilie botezatu she went to the united states to flee 
ceausescus romania 
you tell her we are starting a new life he said tell her 
we are waiting for her

a thunderous roar and a huge light 
filled the sky at the panamanian base in rio hato the building 
rattled and shook 
pedro who thought he had too much to drink later found out he 
was on the receiving end of the first attack by a us stealth 
fighter jet 
i was sleeping with this bottle of dry rum said pedro a 
civilian contractor with the panamanian defense forces i woke 
trying to figure out what was causing the commotion the rum or 
something else 
everybody was running around nobody seemed to know what to do 
which was kind of strange for a bunch of soldiers who supposedly 
were expecting a us invasion 
it was dec 20 just before 1 am and pedro was spending the 
night at the base in rio hato 80 miles southwest of panama city 
what he saw was part of a coordinated attack to dismantle the 
regime of military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
a unit of the us army 82nd airborne division was dropping in 
to capture the panamanian base and the new supersonic stealth 
f117 had dropped two 2000pound bombs nearby in an effort to stun 
the bases defenders 
the building where he was sleeping shook and it felt like the 
plane was passing just over the building said pedro who was 
later captured by the invading us troops 
he was released within a few days and spoke to the associated 
press on thursday on the condition he not be further identified for 
fear of reprisals 
secretary of defense dick cheney acknowledged last week the use 
of the stealth fighters in the panama invasion the us military 
said the f117 was used because it can bomb accurately and that 
2000pound weapons were dropped to stun and disorient 
they did 
they were experimenting with us i guess pedro laughed 
we were disoriented i looked outside it was almost a full 
moon and i could see the shapes of the paratroopers coming down 
then the sky lit up and the helicopters started shooting up the 
place 
we grabbed weapons and went out toward the woods we saw the 
cobra helicopters firing and flying over the area then the 
soldiers would come in and use loudspeakers to ask people to 
surrender 
we came back closer to the barracks and all of a sudden i 
heard americans saying we were there they must have spotted us 
somehow 
i was between the commander and the sergeant and the soldiers 
i started moving and all of a sudden i was almost face to face with 
a soldier i told him i give up dont kill me i am a civilian 
 
then they tied me up i spent the next 12 hours with the other 
prisoners then they moved us to howard air base in panama and 
the civilians were separated and we were treated a lot better 
i cannot complain he ended they even gave me some oxygen 
when i suffered an emphysema attack

an unknown group has claimed responsibility for 
mail bombs that killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer 
and has threatened future assassinations anytime a black man 
rapes a white woman authorities said thursday 
the claim was made in a letter received wednesday by wagatv in 
atlanta from a group calling itself americans for a competent 
federal judicial system said al adams a spokesman for the postal 
inspection service in atlanta 
the letter was postmarked dec 21 in atlanta an naacp official 
said his organization received a similar letter on dec 22 
in its 6 pm news broadcast wagatv released excerpts of the 
letter from the group which claimed it assassinated judge robert 
s vance and attorney robert robinson in reprisal for atrocities 
committed on julie love a white woman who was robbed raped and 
murdered in atlanta in 1988 
two more prominent members of the naacp shall be assassinated 
using more sophisticated means as part of the same reprisal the 
letter said 
william l hinshaw special agent in charge of the fbi 
investigation in atlanta said in a statement thursday evening that 
none of the agencies investigating the mail bombings was familiar 
with the group 
we believe that the letter received by waga is authentic 
because it contained information which has not been made known to 
the public and which is known only to someone closely associated 
with the construction and mailing of the bombs and to law 
enforcement hinshaw said 
he said the letter made a threat against the television station 
if it did not air portions of the letter 
because the letter indicated that additional attacks might be 
forthcoming if the tv station did not comply with the stated demand 
to read a portion of the letter we encouraged waga to broadcast 
that portion of the letter and distribute this information to other 
news organizations hinshaw said 
waga reported at 11 pm that the letter told of a secret 
meeting the group held dec 19 in montgomery ala after the two 
fatal bombings the station said members from georgia florida and 
alabama gathered to draft new orders and to go public with 
their mission 
investigators have confirmed to officials of wagatv that the 
document may be authentic and related to the recent bombing 
attacks hinshaw said 
authorities have been investigating a series of mail bombs that 
killed vance an 11th us circuit court of appeals judge at his 
home near birmingham ala on dec 16 and robinson a savannah 
ga lawyer two days later 
the bomb that killed vance was mailed to his home in mountain 
brook ala the same suburb where ms love grew up 
anytime a black man rapes a white woman in alabama florida or 
georgia in the future americans for a competent federal judicial 
system shall assassinate one federal judge one attorney and one 
officer of the naacp the letter said 
the group criticized the 11th circuit on which vance served for 
what it called reluctance to stress the importance of blacks to 
demonstrate civil responsibility 
this failure created a climate that has spawned an alarming 
number of savage acts of violence by black men against white 
women the letter said 
it cited the slaying of ms love 27 a preschool fitness 
teacher who disappeared july 11 1988 after her car ran out of 
gas her remains were found a little over a year later in a wooded 
lot near an innercity neighborhood 
two young black men emmanuel fitzgerald hammond 24 and 
william maurice porter 20 have been charged in the slaying 
porter pleaded guilty in november and is expected to testify 
against hammond in his forthcoming trial 
sources close to the bomb investigation said last week that 
followup threatening letters received by targets of the mail bombs 
contained references to americans for a competent judiciary at 
the time the fbi said it did not know the significance of the 
references 
two other bombs were safely removed from the 11th circuit 
building in atlanta and naacp headquarters in jacksonville fla 
investigators believe the attacks may have been carried out by 
white racists 
earl shinhoster southeastern regional director for the naacp 
said security precautions were being taken by naacp workers at the 
600 southeastern branches 130 of which are in georgia 
shinhoster said he received an unsigned letter at his office 
dec 22 that used similar language as that in the letter sent to 
waga but the television stations letter shinhoster said is 
much more specific 
the typewritten letter to the naacp also postmarked in atlanta 
also mentioned the americans for a competent federal judicial 
system 
before being appointed to the federal bench vance preached 
moderation on racial issues while chairman of the alabama 
democratic party robinson a savannah city alderman was black and 
did legal work for the naacp 
a hagerstown md judge was wounded by a bomb last week but 
investigators said they have all but ruled out a connection to the 
other attacks 
on aug 21 an anonymous letter was sent to jackson miss tv 
station wapt declaring war on the 11th circuit authorities said 
the next day a tear gas canister exploded at the atlanta office of 
the atlanta naacp injuring eight people 
vickie taylor assignment editor at wapt said thursday that the 
august letter was not signed by any group in particular but that 
it too complained in similar language about partiality in the 
judiciary 
ms taylor said her station has not received any followup 
letters recently

the cable television industry is firing back 
at critics who claim sports on free television are becoming 
extinct saying there is more sports programming on tv than ever 
total broadcast network sports programming rose to a record 
1753 hours in 1988 an olympics year according to a study 
released thursday by the national cable television association 
at the same time the study said 
local broadcast stations increased their coverage of major 
league baseball games to 1647 games in the 1989 season up from 
1536 in 1985 
abc cbs and nbc increased their college football coverage by 
52 percent from 27 regular season games in 1987 to 41 games in 
1989 
national network broadcast coverage of both national collegiate 
athletic association regular and postseason games grew by 21 
percent over the past four years from 86 games in the 198687 
season to 104 games in the current 198990 season 
the cable group acknowledged the huge growth of cable tv sports 
programming during the 1980s but said it had been achieved 
without depleting broadcast television sports coverage 
the growth of cable has expanded viewers sports programming 
options by providing coverage of games and sports which have either 
never been available to broadcasters or which have been ignored by 
broadcast tv ncta said in the study fair games broadcast and 
cable coverage of televised sports 
the study comes at a time when critics in congress and 
broadcasting are saying cable is siphoning sports away from 
socalled free television at hearings in november sens howard 
metzenbaum dohio and arlen specter rpa said sports such as 
professional baseball and football could lose their antitrust 
exemptions if they reduce the amount of free sports programming 
lawmakers have been particularly concerned about two recent 
cable sports deals a 12year 550 million agreement by the new 
york yankees giving all tv rights to the madison square garden 
cable network beginning in 1991 and major league baseballs 
12year 400 million contract with the espn cable network to show 
175 baseball games a year beginning next season 
madison square garden has been negotiating with a local 
broadcaster in new york wpix to provide 40 to 50 yankees games a 
season wpix previously has carried yankees games 
under espns contract the national cable network will be able 
to black out all other baseball coverage on wednesday nights 
national football league executive art modell told the senate 
hearings there was a good chance the nfl will increase the 
number of regular season games on cable next year to 16 up from 
eight 
metzenbaum worried aloud that cables ability to generate income 
both through advertising and subscriptions gives it an advantage in 
negotiating for sports programming 
however nbc recently agreed to a fouryear contract that will 
increase the number of nationally televised national basketball 
association games 
but the cable organizations study showed that regional cable 
coverage of nba games will surpass local broadcast station coverage 
for the first time in the 198990 season 790 games to 716 games 
regional cable carried 638 games last season compared with 679 
games on local broadcast stations 
the vast majority of cables sports programming does not 
consist of events or games which have migrated from overtheair 
television the study said cables increased presence in 
sports programming has served to expand viewers access to sporting 
events without depleting broadcast television sports coverage

on the surface panamas manuel antonio 
noriega and romanias nicolae ceausescu had little in common aside 
from the heavyhanded way in which they ran their respective 
countries 
one was a tropical tyrant for whom ideology meant nothing the 
other irreverently described as the butcher of bucharest 
viewed the world in terms of the marxist philosophy he had embraced 
as a teenager 
but there are some eerie parallels between the two not the 
least of which was the way the ups and downs in their relations 
with the united states reflected the fluctuations of us policy 
between expediency and morality 
one historical oddity was that both ceausescu and noriega had 
their definitive falling out with the united states on the same day 
feb 26 1988 last week their tyrannical rules ended within two 
days of each other 
when both were riding high there were periods in which the 
united states overlooked their more disreputable qualities in 
pursuit of its antisoviet policies in the end once their 
usefulness had been squandered both were widely reviled in 
washington for the way in which they had brutalized their 
respective peoples 
ceausescu had been an admired figure in washington during the 
1970s president nixon visited bucharest early in his first term 
and ceausescu was given a red carpet welcome by president carter at 
the white house in 1978 
all this was washingtons way of showing gratitude to a man 
viewed as a maverick in the warsaw pact for his willingness to 
adopt stands independent of the soviet union 
he denounced the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia maintained 
normal ties with israel at a time when no other pact member did 
refused to take part in alliance military maneuvers and extended 
the hand of friendship to china when moscow and beijing were at 
loggerheads 
the united states offered romania trade concessions and export 
credits as part of a strategy to encourage other alliance members 
to show independence from moscow ceausescus stalinist internal 
policies were a secondary consideration 
noriega meanwhile also was being cultivated by the united 
states during the latter part of the 1970s when he was panamas 
chief of military intelligence 
he was viewed as an intelligence asset providing the united 
states with information on cuban activities in central america in 
the 1980s noriega was considered a potential asset for the reagan 
administration in its effort to topple nicaraguas leftist 
government how much assistance he actually provided is not clear 
us officials were aware that noriega was involved in 
drugsmuggling activities but felt he was minor figure before 
becoming head of the defense forces in august 1983 in that same 
year thenvice president george bush met with noriega during a 
visit to panama 
the deterioration in relations with panama accelerated after 
noriegas indictment by two florida grand juries on drug smuggling 
charges in early february 1988 the definitive break occurred feb 
26 when his allies in the panamanian legislature impeached 
president eric arturo delvalle just hours after he attempted to 
fire noriega as defense chief 
hours later on that same day the state department disclosed 
that ceausescu had unilaterally renounced the trade privileges 
romania had had for more than a decade if ceausescu had not taken 
the action congress would have done so primarily based on 
romanias tight restrictions on emigration 
in any case romanias usefulness as a warsaw pact maverick had 
steadily diminished with rise of mikhail gorbachev in the soviet 
union and the waning of the cold war when ceausescu fled last 
friday on the morning following the calendars longest night of 
the year he was increasingly looked on as an anachronism 
a final parallel between ceausescu and noriega at the precise 
moment ceausescu was fleeing the presidential palace across the 
atlantic the organization of american states after an allnight 
session was expressing regret by an overwhelming vote over the 
us decision to oust noriega by force

texan brad johnson a former professional rodeo 
competitor says life experiences were more important than 
formal training in his acting career

the author of a law that discriminates against 
trade with communist countries is asking president bush to remove 
all tariff restrictions from the revitalized nation of 
czechoslovakia 
charles a vanik wrote bush this week saying the official 
decrees published by the prodemocracy reformists running 
czechoslovakia have clearly met all conditions of the law he 
cosponsored with the late senator henry jackson in 1974 
the jacksonvanik amendment which in essence imposes high 
tariffs on countries that forbid free emigration was designed to 
pressure the communist bloc into allowing jews and other minorities 
to emigrate it forbids granting such countries most favored nation 
trade status that significantly reduces tariffs on imports into the 
united states 
czechoslovakia has been actively seeking most favored nation 
status since early this year but was told by the administration 
that dramatic improvements would have to be made in its human 
rights record 
a state department official said thursday that consideration is 
being given to granting czechoslovakias wish in light of the 
fastpaced reforms away from totalitarian communist rule 
the two new czechoslovak leaders vaclav havel and alexander 
dubcek were subjected to severe human rights violations under the 
communists who ran the country until two months ago vanik said 
dubcek was elected speaker of parliament on thursday and havel was 
scheduled for swearingin as president today new elections are 
expected next year 
the new leadership has amended czechoslovakias constitution to 
remove the communist partys monopoly on power and the predominance 
of marxistleninist teachings in the school system in addition 
lawmakers voted thursday to amend the presidential oath to be taken 
by havel to eliminate the pledge of allegiance to socialism 
the most important thing america can do is provide an 
immediate fair and equal access to our markets said vanik a 
lawyer in private practice here who was a democrat representing an 
ohio district when the law was passed 
i urge that you declare this revitalized nation eligible for 
most favored nation status and the same tariff benefits we extend

in 1983 during a time of tension in the 
caribbean a hysterical cuban president fidel castro developed 
a contingency plan to launch an air strike against a nuclear power 
facility in south florida according to a cuban defector 
gen rafael del pino who defected to the united states in 1986 
said castro was worried about a possible us blockade of cuba at 
the time of the usled invasion of grenada in october 1983 
del pino said castro summoned the high military command and 
ordered them as a contingency to have the computers aboard mig23 
fighter planes programmed to fly to a nuclear energy plant in south 
florida 
an air strike was to have been ordered if there were some type 
of blockade of cuba some type of reaction on the part of the 
united states a product of the situation in grenada he said 
the spokesman at the cuban diplomatic mission in washington was 
unavailable for comment thursday on del pinos allegations 
the invasion of grenada generated anxiety in cuba because the 
two governments had established close political and military ties 
cuban officials were concerned that cuba might be the next target 
of the reagan administration but no action was taken 
del pino said castro has a holocaust temperament that 
emerges during difficult periods at the time of grenada he said 
castro was hysterical 
del pino the highest ranking cuban ever to defect commented in 
an interview with radio marti the voice of america broadcast 
operation to cuba a transcript was made available thursday 
the installation del pino was referring to apparently was turkey 
point about 24 miles south of miami where two nuclear generators 
are located the facility is operated by florida power amp light co 
and is adjacent to homestead air force base which closely monitors 
all incoming flights in the area 
according to del pino the cuban migs are equipped with 
conventional as opposed to nuclear bombs 
nonetheless he said castro doesnt realize that if this 
plant is destroyed it would not only annihilate all the cubans in 
miami but would also be much worse than chernobyl because the 
radioactivity would fall on cuba in other words 90 miles away 
the cuban people would be affected because of the absurd reaction 
of that man castro 
chernobyl is the site in the soviet union where a major accident 
occurred at a nuclear power facility in 1986 
unlike the chernobyl plant all active commercial us nuclear 
reactors are surrounded by steelreinforced concrete shells to 
prevent the release of radioactivity in an accident but the shells 
are not meant to shield the reactor against bombs according to 
frank ingraham a nuclear regulatory commission spokesman 
dale thomas a spokesman at florida power amp light declined 
comment when asked if the firm has taken into account the 
possibility of an attack by cuban planes 
he said the companys security precautions are not public 
information for the most part he added that the company does have 
an emergency planning zone extending 10 miles from the turkey point 
installations among other steps the plan includes procedures for 
evacuating all residents within the zone

is little salt rock too small for two 
shirley bledsoes 
shirley jean thinks so shirley rae thinks not and the west 
virginia supreme court doesnt want to get involved 
the feud has gone on for 12 years and i think its about time 
for it to end shirley rae bledsoe 47 said thursday from her 
home in the cabell county community of 900 in the western part of 
the state 
the two shirleys have been at odds with each other since the 
1977 death of lloyd bledsoe who was shirley raes commonlaw 
husband and shirley jeans brother shirley rae continued using 
lloyds surname on her credit cards and drivers license 
the feud intensified in may when shirley rae then shirley rae 
lambert went to circuit court to legally take lloyds name 
shirley rae said she had lived with lloyd bledsoe for 20 years and 
that he was the father of two of her children 
the court allowed her to change her name to bledsoe 
shirley jean who says the similar names have resulted in mail 
problems then appealed the lower courts ruling to the state 
supreme court which refused in a 41 ruling to hear the case 
earlier this month 
im not the one thats caused the confusion she is shirley 
rae said she had been told by the post office a long time ago to 
put her middle initial or her box office number on her mail but 
she bulled up and wouldnt do it 
shirley rae said any problems with the name change have been 
strictly shirley jeans 
i know i wasnt in the wrong and everybody else around salt 
rock knows it too she said you can change your name to 
anything you want as long as you dont hurt anybody and i wasnt 
hurting her 
shirley jean refused to comment on the matter 
i dont want to get involved shirley jean said thursday 
the towns postmaster isnt taking sides but said mail delivery 
hasnt been a hassle with the bledsoes or any of the towns other 
six people who have similar names 
weve had both of them ever since ive been here and weve 
never had any problem said leah gill salt rocks postmaster for 
19 years if its addressed correctly then they get it 
and while names of a different sort continue to be exchanged 
between the two bledsoes most of the town refuses to take sides 
leonard bledsoe said he may be distantly related to one of the 
shirley bledsoes but he wont get in the middle of their feud 
thats their problem he said theyll just have to fight 
it out

beef continues to be no 1 with american 
consumers over chicken but that is only when the agriculture 
department doesnt count bones 
the usda estimates per capita meat and poultry consumption in 
several ways including the retail weight sold at grocery counters 
and on a retail weight basis without bones 
if its the national cattlemens association on an 
endoftheyear campaign to boost beef the nobone way is favored 
regardless the association said thursday that demand for beef 
is stabilizing after declining for years and part of the reason is 
that farmers and ranchers have responded to consumer tastes by 
producing leaner cuts 
looking ahead to 1990 industry leaders said little change is 
expected in average per capita beef supplies and average consumer 
prices in the coming year 
according to usda economists total beef output may increase 
slightly next year but still will remain below production levels in 
the 198388 period however consumer prices are expected to edge 
higher by only 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990 compared with 5 
percent gains in 1988 and 1989 
the usda has figures to prove americans eat more poultry than 
beef and other figures to prove they eat more beef than poultry 
using the method based on bonein retail weights usda says the 
per capita consumption of beef in 1990 may drop slightly to an 
average of 678 pounds from 686 pounds in 1989 721 pounds in 
1988 and 734 pounds in 1987 the peak was 94 pounds in 1976 
total poultry which includes broilers baking hens and turkeys 
has been setting records annually and is forecast to average 894 
pounds in 1990 up from 844 in 1989 806 in 1988 and 778 in 
1987 the year when poultry first nudged ahead of beef 
but the cattle industry said that if you take away the bones 
beef is still way ahead of poultry and richard stillman of usdas 
economic research service agreed 
stillman said that on a boneless basis 1989 per capita beef 
consumption may average 671 pounds down from 682 in 1988 a 
further slight decline is expected in 1990 
on the same boneless basis he said 1989 poultry consumption 
may average 599 pounds up from 572 pounds in 1988 with another 
gain in the works next year 
cattle industry leader john lacey of paso robles calif 
presidentelect of the national cattlemens association said the 
practice of cutting away fat from retail cuts has helped improve 
beefs image he also cited breeding and feeding advances as 
further boosts for the industry 
topper thorpe general manager of cattlefax a market 
information service said no dramatic changes are expected in the 
nations cattle herd or in us beef production in 1990 
but todays total cattle herd of about 100 million head 
including dairy animals is producing almost as much beef as the 
much larger herds of the 1970s thorpe told a yearend news 
conference 
cattle herds peaked at about 132 million head in the mid1970s 
and generally have trended downward because of oversupply rising 
production costs drought and other factors thorpe said the herd 
liquidation has ended and a modest expansion has begun 
efficient cowcalf operators have made profits during the past 
few years thorpe said now if weather is favorable and if 
financing becomes cheaper more producers may hold back heifers and 
expand their breeding herds however we do not see foresee rapid 
expansion 
stillman said in a telephone interview part of the reason 
beef has been declining the last several years was that weve 
corrected the statistics to allow for a closer trim on retail 
cuts 
the main reason that todays smaller cattle herd produces almost 
as much beef is due to a number of factors he said 
genetically you bred a larger animal stillman said its 
true in hogs sheep and lambs basically its feeding an 
increase in average weights 
at last months usda outlook conference economist steve reed 
said consumer beef prices have set new records each year since 
1987 but competition from pork and poultry will have an effect 
with per capita beef supplies beginning to stabilize in 1990 
the higher price of beef compared to competing meats could become a 
bigger issue in the coming months reed said these large 
poultry supplies and continued large pork supplies could hold down 
beef price gains

the government making its annual forecast of 
winners and losers in american business says jet aircraft and 
other hightechnology areas will be strong in 1990 but automakers 
and construction firms will not fare as well 
the commerce department assessed the prospects of 350 us 
industries for its 31st edition of the us industrial outlook 
on the industrial side it predicted that threefourths of the 
193 manufacturing firms it reviewed should enjoy rising shipments 
next year while 18 percent will suffer declines and the rest will 
have stagnant shipments 
it predicted a median growth rate in manufacturing shipments of 
2 percent next year after removing the effects of inflation that 
would compare with estimated growth of 22 percent this year and 
25 percent in 1988 
the department predicted that service industries especially 
those providing information and health care would outperform the 
manufacturing sector 
commerce undersecretary j michael farren briefing reporters on 
the forecast thursday said the united states is evolving steadily 
into an information economy 
industries involved in the collection processing and 
communication of information are among the fastest growing he 
said 
for 1990 the government projected the fastest growth in 
services would be in satellite communication and electronic 
information services both forecast to enjoy revenue gains of 20 
percent next year 
computer software data processing management consulting 
medical services and the cable television industry all were 
projected to have growth rates of 10 percent or higher 
in manufacturing the big winners in 1990 were expected to be 
the makers of surgical and medical instruments with a projected 10 
percent rise in shipments followed by makers of surgical supplies 
with shipments forecast to be up by 9 percent 
the biggest loser in manufacturing was forecast to be makers of 
household washers and dryers where shipments were projected to 
decline by 5 percent followed by glass makers facing a forecasted 
49 percent drop in shipments 
both of those industries are tied closely to housing 
construction which is expected to be lackluster next year 
overall construction was expected to show no gains as a modest 
increase in housing construction will be offset by a decline in 
nonresidential construction reflecting expected declines in 
office and hotel construction two sectors with high vacancy rates 
another key sector likely to perform poorly next year is autos 
car sales were projected to drop another 1 percent to 99 million 
units in 1990 following a 5 percent fall in 1989 
many of the industries that are not expected to do well in 1990 
are closely tied to the auto or construction sectors including 
producers of construction materials bigticket household 
appliances and steel 
steel shipments should drop by 4 percent in 1990 down to a 
level of 78 million tons while that would be the lowest level 
since 1987 it still would be above the depressed sales recorded 
from 1982 through 1986 
farren said that us export sales which have been one of the 
economys main supports over the past two years will continue to 
rise next year although the trade deficit will show only a small 
improvement in part because us demand for imports remains high 
among the exporting industries expected to do the best are 
aircraft makers chemical producers and businesses catering to 
foreign tourists 
for the first time receipts from foreigners traveling in the 
united states will exceed expenditures by americans traveling 
abroad farren said forecasting that the surplus in travel will 
lower the us trade deficit by about 1 billion next year 
in 1989 shipments of civilian aircraft surpassed military 
aircraft shipments for the first time since 1981 and the government 
forecast that trend will continue based on record orders already 
received the department predicted approximately 512 deliveries of 
commercial jetliners in 1990 more than three times the level of 
commercial shipments just six years ago 
chemicals the leading us export industry will see moderate 
growth in 1990 with export sales topping 38 billion enough to 
generate a 16 billion surplus over the amount of chemical products 
expected to be imported into the united states

ray and faye copeland had been charged previously by livingston 
county prosecutors with three counts of firstdegree murder the 
indictment handed up thursday includes those three victims and two 
others 
officials said they sought indictments by the county grand jury 
to avert a costly preliminary hearing cases considered by a grand 
jury arent taken to preliminary hearing in which a judge 
determines if the evidence is sufficient to send a case to trial 
prosecuting attorney doug roberts said he expected the 
copelands who are being held in the county jail to stand trial in 
the second half of 1990 at the earliest arraignment was scheduled 
for jan 2

was filed he was wayne warner but his hometown and age werent 
immediately known 
ray copeland 75 and faye copeland 68 have been held since 
their arrest in october on charges they conspired to steal cattle 
those charges have since been dropped 
each of the victims had been shot in the head and the bodies 
were found on farms where ray copeland had done odd jobs four of 
the bodies were found in shallow graves and one was found weighted 
down in a well 
the copelands were charged oct 9 with conspiracy to steal 
cattle with bad checks from an account set up in august for an 
employee 
prosecutors allege the couple used the men to write bad checks 
in the cattle scheme then killed them to keep them from talking 
prosecutors said previously they would seek the death penalty on 
the first three murder charges and state attorney general william 
webster said that was still planned 
bail had been set at 500000 each with the indictment that 
was changed so the couple cant be freed on bail webster said in a

the us effort to recruit aid for panamas 
damaged economy is targeting japan which has a strong vested 
interest in the panama canal a japanese embassy official says 
the request which went out in recent days is part of a 
governmentwide mobilization to help panama rebuild an economy 
shattered by two years of us sanctions against deposed dictator 
manuel antonio noriega and by last weeks invasion by us troops 
in talks both before and after the invasion the united states 
urged japan to help panama regain the economic standing it enjoyed 
before noriegas 1988 indictments in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges the indictments shook investors confidence in 
panama 
japan ships many of its exports to the united states through the 
panama canal and has provided more than 5 million in annual 
technical aid to support the governments stability 
the us expects japan to play a significant role said a 
japanese embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
japan stopped its aid to panama six months ago but expects to 
resume and increase the assistance once it recognizes the new 
panamanian government installed with us support last week said 
the official 
on thursday a us state department team arrived in panama to 
assess the countrys immediate needs in providing shelter food and 
medicine to thousands of panamanians left homeless by the operation 
mounted dec 20 to remove noriega from power 
the team led by the head of the office of foreign disaster 
assistance andrew natsios will remain in panama until monday 
an estimated 570 people including 23 american servicemen were 
killed in five days of fighting against noriega loyalists 
officials report 
alfredo maduro president of the panamanian chamber of commerce 
said thursday that insurance brokers estimate losses from looting 
or other damage to businesses in the capital at 750 million to 1 
billion 
maduro said businessmen planned to ask the united states for 
something like a marshall plan for panama to recover 
to address the countrys longer term needs a task force has 
been formed with representatives from the treasury state and 
commerce departments the group has held talks since tuesday with a 
threeman panamanian delegation and will head for panama next week 
to examine the situation 
the focus of the panamanianamerican meeting is the transfer of 
some 400 million in panamanian government money frozen last year 
in the united states president bush last week ordered the funds 
released but the process is expected to take several weeks 
administration officials said 
the united states already has transferred 582 million 
confiscated from noriega to the new government headed by guillermo 
endara a us military spokesman in panama city said thursday 
the bush administration has not yet asked congress for money for 
panamas rehabilitation relying for now on the 400 million in 
unfrozen panamanian assets 
but rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint economic 
committee of the house and senate said that sum would not be 
enough 
the panama economy is in a mess maybe in a bigger mess than i 
think hamilton said at a news conference 
panamas needs must be identified and aid must be provided he 
said you cant promote their democracy unless you help their 
economy 
panama once a thriving banking center with a per capita income 
double that of its neighbors has seen its economy shrink at an 
estimated annual rate of 10 percent to 15 percent since 1987 
according to economic analysts 
economic sanctions by the united states and a loss of confidence 
in noriega led us firms including largescale employers like 
xerox and ibm to scale down their businesses in panama 
unemployment has risen to more than 20 percent 
in addition panama owes at least 56 billion to foreign banks 
governments and international lending agencies such as the world 
bank and international monetary fund 
the world bank is not expected to resume any lending to panama 
unless the country repays some 180 million in arrears on past 
loans bank officials said

eightyyearold edna cooley has been waking up 
at 3 am for nearly 22 years to trudge outside in occasionally 
bonechilling cold and record the weather in the sparsely settled 
high desert of central nevada 
some 18 hours later mrs cooley makes the last of her six 
daily weather observations and temperature checks for national 
weather service records on austin population 350 earning 1110 a 
day for her troubles 
why do i keep doing it they say you can even get used to 
hanging if you hang long enough mrs cooley said ive been 
meaning to quit for two years but cant find anyone else to do 
this 
she is among the last of a breed of handson recorders of the 
nations highs lows and precipitation amounts without the 
observers meteorologists and forecasters would have a more 
difficult time predicting the weather 
theres a need for live observation said gerald miles a 
meterologist in elko who supervises the weather watchers 
equipment is reliable but you need good remarks from observers 
to go with it equipment has its limitations 
bill davis the salt lake citybased western regional director 
of the observation program said about 50 weather watchers are on 
the national weather service payroll in his jurisdication 
several hundred others mostly farmers voluntarily report 
climate information to the agency to help keep a historical weather 
record 
davis said athome weather observation stations were set up 
during world war ii basically wherever they could find someone 
and where we didnt have a government office meteorology was 
rapidly developing and officials found eyeballtype 
information improved their ability to track storms he said 
the observers must pass a certification test and use weather 
service equipment to take measurements of temperature winds dew 
point atmospheric pressure and precipitation the routine can take 
10 to 15 minutes depending on the weather 
theres no grand plan to get rid of the weather observers 
davis said i think theyll be around for the next decade but 
well lose some to equipment and because people will retire and the 
younger generation doesnt want to work that hard for so little 
money 
mrs cooley said that when she goes on vacation theres no 
weather coming out of austin the tv stations just say oh well i 
guess that ednas out of town again 
debi gill who usually reports nevadas coldest overnight lows 
at wildhorse reservoir just south of the idaho border has been an 
observer for 3 years 
sometimes i wonder why i keep doing it especially at 530 in 
the morning she said 
mrs gill like other weather observers gets 250 for the 
first early morning recording 160 for daytime readings and 190 
for each night observation 
she said the most frightening thing about the job is the 
latenight readings when near silence fuels the imagination she 
said 
when the lake is frozen over the ice groans and the coyotes 
are yipping and howling i just get all nervous said mrs gill 
its silly but i get scared of the bogyman because thats the 
only one who would be out that time of night 
the good part of the job is closely watching how nature works 
and stopping to enjoy the surrounding weather sunrises and 
sunsets she said 
not many people stop and watch the sky she said the 
clouds actually grow puff up right before your eyes its 
wonderful 
observers must distinguish among three layers of clouds with 
nine different basic cloud types possible at each level 
susan deming who has been observing the weather in battle 
mountain in northcentral nevada since may said people sometimes 
stop her on the street or telephone her asking what the weather 
will be like or with weatherrelated inquiries such as whether it 
is too soon to plant 
i have to tell them i dont predict the weather i just 
observe it she said

the metropolitan operas lighthearted 
production of johann strauss die fledermaus was especially 
effervescent in its second appearance this season 
on thursday german baritone hermann prey respected for 
bringing importance to weighty music cavorted merrily and seemed 
to be having as good a time on stage as though really at prince 
orlofskys act 2 party it was preys first time to sing eisenstein 
at the met 
in the speaking role of frosch the jailer the met has had in 
recent memory jack gilford otto schenk who devised this 
production in 1986 and sid caesar on christmas night in this 
seasons first die fledermaus actorcomedian dom deluise made 
his met debut 
at the met singing is in german and speaking thus most of 
the jokes are in english 
deluises timing and body language were wonderful 
traditionally some of the jokes are changed each season deluise 
held a beer bottle which crumbled in his hand when he sang a couple 
of high notes 
and he told a series of leona helmsley oneliners concluding 
she thinks she owns the place 
deluises exchanges with the excellent franz mazura as the 
jails warden were genuinely funny 
carol vaness sang rosalinde who gets the best of her husband 
eisenstein in an elaborate practical joke set up by his friend 
falke well sung by lenus carlson miss vaness also handled the 
flamboyance well when she pretended to be a hungarian countess 
neil shicoff sang a tenor who adores rosalinde throwing himself 
into the fun wholeheartedly barbara kilduff sang sweetly as adele 
the maid and grace millo sparkled as her pert sister 
brigitte fassbaender sang prince orlofsky for the first time at 
the met she dressed simply for the part red sash across a tuxedo 
the distinctive edge on her speaking voice turned shrill on her 
sung high notes but miss fassbaender commands a stage easily and 
is an agreeable distinctive orlofsky 
hermann michael who has been herbert von karajans assistant at 
the vienna state opera and has conducted wagner operas in seattle 
made his met debut on christmas day his timing was unrushed and 
fine and the orchestra sounded very lyrical under his baton 
act 2 remains among the mets most delightful sets as the 
outside of prince orlofskys glass conservatory room moves on the 
met turntable until it becomes the rooms interior ready for 
dinner and lively dancing to strauss

penthouse magazine has broken weeks of silence 
by announcing publication of an intimate interview with stephen 
gobie the prostitute who had a relationship with rep barney frank 
the march 1990 issue will hit the newsstands the first week of 
february according to magazine spokeswoman leslie jay 
frank dmass who is under investigation by the house ethics 
committee for his involvement with gobie promptly dubbed the 
penthouse announcement thursday a nonstory 
my guess is the only problem penthouse is going to have is 
whether to classify it as fiction or nonfiction frank said 
penthouse publisher bob guccione in a oneparagraph 
announcement said the interview would detail the subterranean 
gay scene in the nations capital and its hottest players 
this is the most intimate interview ever published concerning 
a sitting member of congress guccione said 
gobie was paid a reported 50000 to tell his story to penthouse 
in a news conference earlier this week frank dismissed the 
potential explosiveness of the penthouse article he said it was 
nonsense to believe recent reports that the ethics committee 
was delaying its investigation until it can review the penthouse 
article 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif also rejected 
such claims noting that any information penthouse could obtain the 
committee also could get simply by issuing a subpoena 
gobie already has testified before the ethics committee frank 
has not yet appeared before the committee which holds all its 
hearings behind closed doors and has not said whether he has been 
invited to testify 
frank said he is anxious for the opportunity to show the 
committee that gobies charges are untrue 
gobie has an unlisted phone number in the washington area and 
could not be reached thursday for comment 
the ethics committee investigation began with frank publicly 
acknowledging late last summer that he had paid gobie 80 for sex 
in 1985 hired him with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper 
and driver from july 1985 through august 1987 and intervened with 
virginia probation authorities on gobies behalf 
but frank has denied other allegations by gobie including 
charges that frank knew gobie was running a prostitution ring from 
franks apartment on capitol hill and that the two had engaged in 
sex in the house gymnasium

census bureau figures released today indicate 
that seven states are likely to gain seats in the us house of 
representatives in reapportionment while as many as a dozen states 
will lose at least one seat forecasters say 
the next reapportionment will be based on the final 1990 census 
figures which will be collected in the 10year census next year 
the state population figures released today go up to mid1989 and 
represent one last checkpoint before the final official count 
the nonprofit population reference bureau said that if the 
trends in this latest report hold true through the final 1990 
figures california will gain seven seats texas and florida each 
will gain three and virginia north carolina georgia and arizona 
will gain one apiece 
at the same time 11 states are likely to lose one or more 
seats the population reference bureau said it said new york will 
lose three seats pennsylvania ohio michigan and illinois each 
will lose two and new jersey massachusetts iowa kansas west 
virginia and montana each will lose one 
comparable predictions by election data services inc a 
washingtonbased political consulting firm differed little the 
firm however added kentucky to the list of losers dropping one 
congressional seat and predicted that florida will gain four 
seats rather than three 
however the census bureau figures on which the predictions are 
based do not include members of the military and their dependents 
living overseas they will be counted in the 1990 reapportionment 
the government recently announced and that change could mean the 
difference in whether some states gain or lose a seat 
the census figures show that the populations of five states grew 
at rates faster than 10 percent from 1985 to mid1989 
the state that experienced the largest percentage increase in 
population between 1985 and mid1989 nevada grew by 18 percent 
second was arizona 12 percent followed by florida and new 
hampshire at 11 percent and california at 10 percent 
at the same time seven states lost population the bureau said

help new york companies learn to make butter instead of guns 
cuomo created the task force thursday to help new york companies 
that lose defense contracts make a successful transition into 
commercial production 
noting that defense spending is a 20 billion industry in new

given defense secretary richard cheneys plan to cut military 
spending

of weapons programs as part of an effort to reduce the defense 
budget last month cheney directed the services to come up with 
from 140 billion to 180 billion in cuts from the fiscal 1992 to 
1994 military budgets 
cuomo said the task force would be headed by vincent tese the 
states economic development director and brad johnson the 
governors washington lobbyist

must maintain its ability to produce weapons 
if events in the soviet union or in eastern europe were to 
take a dramatically different turn we must be able to respond

in this country at a time when the pentagon is awarding 10 billion

a racial issue was raised in closing 
arguments in a suit accusing paramount pictures of plagiarizing art 
buchwalds idea for a story about an african prince for the eddie 
murphy movie coming to america 
superior court judge harvey schneider took the lawsuit under 
submission thursday after arguments by buchwalds lawyer and an 
attorney for paramount pictures 
schneider said he would issue a written ruling relatively 
soon attorneys said that could mean within three to 15 days 
paramount lawyer robert draper drew a mild rebuke from the judge 
when he tried to inject a racial issue into the lawsuit 
eddie murphy is black and eddie murphy is a megastar and 
eddie murphy has to make a living attorney robert draper began 
hes not white like mr buchwald hes not an eastern 
establishment writer like mr buchwald 
at that point schneider interrupted the attorneys closing 
argument 
i dont perceive this to be a case about race the judge 
said 
i disagree with your honor said draper but he dropped the 
subject and moved on to argue there arent sufficient similarities 
between buchwalds script idea king for a day and murphys 
box office hit coming to america to show that one was based on 
the other 
attorney pierce odonnell representing buchwald argued there 
are at least 14 points and perhaps as many as 35 points of 
similarity between the scripts both involve an african member of 
royalty coming to the united states living in a ghetto working at 
a fast food restaurant falling in love and taking home a bride 
odonnell cited paramounts 1983 contract with buchwald to 
produce his brief treatment entitled king for a day and said 
it was clearly the inspiration for murphys film buchwald is 
seeking 5 million in actual damages and unspecified punitive 
damages from the studio 
hollywood makes movies but not without ideas odonnell 
declared at minimum what paramount bought was an idea a 
concept it was unique it was original as it turned out this 
was a 400 million idea 
schneider pressed both lawyers to tell him what elements would 
combine to prove that a movie was based upon another script or 
idea he called the issue amorphous and said the evidence had 
failed to clarify it

hawaii is trying to fight child abuse with an 
ambitious program designed to screen every new parent for the 
potential to commit domestic violence and offer counseling to those 
at risk 
the healthy start program presently reaches 60 percent of 
hawaiis new parents and the state hopes to be screening nearly 
every new parent by 1992 those judged at risk are offered five 
years of home visits and counseling on economic and emotional 
problems that can lead to child abuse 
whats nice about the program is theyre trying to help the 
family in all aspects of family life said loretta fuddy 
supervisor of child services for the state health departments 
maternal child health branch the department supervises seven 
private agencies that operate the program 
twenty percent of those surveyed are found to be at risk and are 
offered the services of a home worker who makes weekly visits said 
betsy uohara pratt of hawaii family stress center which began a 
pilot program in 1985 from which healthy start was developed only 
5 percent of the parents decline the assistance she said 
roughly 1500 to 1600 households have received home visits this 
year that number is expected to increase to 2600 by 1992 the 
program is expected to cost 6 million a year when fully operating 
there were 2215 documented cases of child abuse in hawaii in 
1988 according to the state health department 
pratt said it is difficult to locate abused children before they 
reach school age 
ive seen a lot of kindergarteners absolutely devastated by 
the time they reach kindergarten said pratt who supervises the 
training of counselors for healthy start we can help these kids 
get off to a safe and healthy start which would help them when they 
get into the school system 
healthy start begins at the hospital shortly after a baby is 
born workers interview new parents or examine their medical charts 
to spot warning signs that indicate a tendency to abuse or neglect 
children 
workers try to determine whether the parent or parents have 
financial problems housing problems low selfesteem were abused 
as children or have other traits considered warning signs for 
child abuse 
about 75 percent of those helped by healthy start are mothers on 
welfare pratt said 
the home worker counsels on basic parenting skills that help a 
childs development and alleviate stress on a parent many 
families have astoundingly little knowledge of infants she said 
workers also help the families attack economic and emotional 
problems by putting them in touch with social service agencies 
most important pratt said the workers help build the parents 
selfesteem 
what we do for them is cheer them on she said 
visits are made once a week until a baby is 18 months and then 
are gradually scaled back to quarterly visits until the child is 5 
years old 
fuddy said the program costs the state 1600 a year per family 
in comparison she said it costs 6000 to provide a year of 
foster care for a child 
she said she hasnt heard anyone objecting that healthy start 
might be an invasion of privacy 
its offered as a service to the families she said they 
ask permission to interview the families and offer them home 
visitor services 
she said assessment workers have permission from hospitals to 
screen patients records the patients permission isnt required 
she said 
pratt said its too early to say if healthy start has had an 
impact on hawaiis rate of child abuse 
we can only guess that its helping she said

the atlantabased broadcasting company wants to provide a 
satellite receiving station to the vietnamese at no charge and give 
them the right to take the cnn signal for 50 vietnamese dong a

lawsuit filed us district court in washington on wednesday that 
cnn would qualify under a 1988 amendment to trade law that exempts

this said carp

materials such as books or videocassettes may be exchanged with 
vietnam but not immaterial commodities including tv 
broadcasts 
vietnam now provides videocassettes for cnns world report

smithkline beecham clinical laboratories inc 
has agreed to pay 15 million to settle a federal investigation of 
alleged kickbacks for physicians who referred medicare and medicaid 
business to the company the government says 
the department of health and human services inspector general 
found that more than 100 physicians were investors in three 
california laboratories managed by the company 
the inspector generals office said the arrangement under which 
doctors were recruited as investors and lab profits were 
distributed to those same doctors violated a federal law 
prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of medicaid and 
medicare patients 
the 15 million settlement was the largest ever made under the 
law the inspector generals office said 
smithkline spokeswoman tobey dichter said thursday that the 
settlement is an agreement that was reached to avoid costly 
litigation and disruption to our business 
it is not an admission of liability in any way she said 
the inspector general proposed the three laboratories be barred 
permanently from participating in medicare medicaid social 
security and california health care programs and that some 
individuals and companies linked to the labs be barred for several 
years

the justice department says it obtained guilty 
pleas or convictions in a record 107 environmental criminal cases 
in the last fiscal year 
the number reflects a 70 percent increase over the previous year 
and demonstrates the bush administrations commitment to 
environmental protection says richard stewart assistant attorney 
general for the land and natural resources division 
but department officials acknowledged thursday that many of the 
107 cases concluded during the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 
and cited in wednesdays announcement may have been initiated 
before president bush took office last january 
the number of indictments alleging environmental crimes actually 
declined in fiscal 1989 by about 20 percent to 101 the lowest 
number in three years compared with 124 in 1988 and 127 in 1987 
spokeswoman amy casner acknowledged that the sharp increase in 
the number of cases won in fiscal 1989 reflected in part the high 
number of indictments filed in previous years 
the 107 cases resulted in the collection of 127 million in 
fines

neighbors of manuel antonio noriegas 
former military headquarters say he can turn himself into a snake 
or a bird so they warn us troops ringing the vatican embassy to 
keep a close watch 
noriegas mystique as a brujo or warlock survives even 
though he was toppled by us invaders and remained holed up in the 
embassy noriega practiced santeria a cult that mixes african 
roman catholic and american indian deities and sometimes involves 
animal sacrifice 
that man is the devil said a young woman in the poor 
neighborhood of el chorrillo a few blocks from the ruins of 
noriegas comandancia headquarters 
they better watch him i dont want him to escape he can turn 
himself into a boa or a dove and escape from the gringos she 
said 
the woman spoke as she stood in a line for food handouts other 
housewives nodded earnestly at her remark 
it had been said that noriega felt secure having the comandancia 
in el chorrillo because he believed panamas poor solidly supported 
his nationalism 
but the women interviewed thursday disputed that belief and said 
they would not feel safe while noriega remained out of us hands 
we didnt want his dictatorship anymore because he was 
bringing in communism said one woman any panamanian who did 
not agree with him he would kick them out of their jobs and throw 
them in jail he only had a bunch of thugs working for him 
the women refused to give their names as they awaited food bags 
distributed by the us military that included rice cooking oil 
sugar infant formula and canned goods 
the us attack on the comandancia destroyed several blocks of 
chorrillo but many in line said they did not feel bitter 
the gringos are helping us said one housewife theres 
few grocery stores that are open the dignity batallions stole 
everything she said in reference to a paramilitary group of 
noriega loyalists 
the women said they did not want noriega handed over to the new 
panamanian government the former strongman sought refuge at the 
vatican embassy on sunday 
theyll treat him too soft said one theres lots of 
noriegas friends who now are hurrying up to get in the good graces 
of the new government but just wait until the gringos leave it 
could start again 
another said the best solution would to turn noriega over to the 
united states to be tried on drugtrafficking charges 
i dont want that beast in panama she said we forgive 
him but let the gringos take him away all the same ill feel safe 
the day i hear hes out of panama 
as a reporter departed one woman ran up and asked can you 
take this to president bush 
inside a folder was a handwritten letter on white paper thanking 
bush for the invasion the letter dated dec 26 had been signed 
by 31 people mostly women from el chorrillo 
hallellujah the letter said the communists of panama and 
the internationalists preach the selfdetermination of the people 
but they dont respect it but for the selfdetermination of 
the people of panama we give you thanks for liberating us

the music syndicate bmi is suing home box office 
to bar the cable company from broadcasting bmicopyrighted songs 
which are used in a number of movies hbo has scheduled to run 
in a suit filed in us district court in manhattan thursday 
bmi asked that hbo be barred from transmitting the songs after 
sunday when the companies licensing agreement ends 
judge vincent broderick declined to issue an immediate bar 
scheduling fuller arguments before another judge pierre leval on 
tuesday 
bmi or broadcast music inc represents more than 100000 
composers and publishers of more than 15 million songs collecting 
a contracted fee whenever one of its songs is played it licenses 
radio and television stations hotel and restaurant chains even 
discotheques 
the suit comes amid efforts by bmi to boost its cable television 
levies beyond raising basic rates bmi wants to collect from local 
cable systems as well as from cable programmers it now charges 
programmers alone 
the suit said negotiations between bmi and hbo on a new contract 
had been fruitless ahrold declined to say what hbo currently pays 
bmi or how much more bmi wants 
the suit listed 11 films in hbos january schedule that include 
bmi songs including the beatles helter skelter in the movie 
u2 rattle and hum the song strangers in the night in 
fright night and george thorogoods bad to the bone heard 
in talk radio 
bmi has sued several other cable television programmers alleging 
copyright infringement this year but thursdays suit was its first 
seeking to prevent transmissions in advance said bmi spokesman 
robbin ahrold 
bmi president frances w preston said its rates for cable 
television have been discounted while the industry developed but 
must now be brought into line with the full value of the use of 
the bmi repertoire 
moreover under bmis reading of copyright law license fees 
must be paid by both the programmer and the local system operator 
each of whom receives revenues for the use of bmis repertoire 
she said 
ahrold likened the concept to a hotel piping radio music into 
its halls both the radio station and the hotel must pay bmi he 
said 
hbo owned by timewarner inc has more than 23 million 
subscribers making it the largest paytelevision service in the 
nation according to bmis suit hbo spokesman jim noonan said he 
had not seen the suit and could not comment on it but he said hbo 
still was negotiating with bmi on a new contract

the coldest december weather in new england in a 
century is hitting people least able to withstand the blow people 
on fixed incomes and those receiving a specified amount of fuel 
assistance 
but amid rising concern among the poor and increasing calls for 
investigations by elected officials there were signs thursday that 
the price of home heating oil may drop as rapidly as it rose 
the us department of energy reported record volumes of heating 
oil flowing toward the northeast the department also granted the 
first of what it expects to be several waivers allowing foreign 
ships to carry oil from one us port to another existing law 
restricts such shipments to usowned vessels 
people around the region say help cant come fast enough 
i have one patient who must have oxygen this week she turned 
it off to save money for fuel said jeanne steenbeke a visiting 
nurse in the concord nh area thats kind of scary 
elderly people have every penny of their social security money 
allotted she said theres x amount of dollars for rent for 
food and for utilities 
topsy corcoran 82 a widow on a fixed income paid 146 a 
gallon to fill her heating oil tank wednesday in concord nh on 
thursday she would have paid 152 the last time she filled the 
tank it cost almost 100 this time it was 150 
ive got to pay for it what am i going to do she said 
the massachusetts fuel assistance program already has received 
17000 applications for aid this year about 4000 more than it 
received any previous year said ed mccauley program director 
mccauley said some 643 households on aid have already run out of 
their allotted funds for the winter because of the high price of 
heating oil 
those people are in trouble right now he said 
federal energy department spokesman thomas olson reported two 
price drops on the wholesale oil market thursday the january price 
for home heating oil the price that wholesalers will pay for 
future deliveries dropped 3 cents per gallon according to olson 
and the price on the prompt market in new york harbor the 
price being paid for oil at the wharf dropped 12 cents per gallon 
it will take a few more days to see if theres a real trend 
here olson said 
added bernard smith of the new england fuel institute a group 
that represents fuel delivery companies what goes up will come 
down it will probably come down so fast people will hear it 
several members of congress including us sen john kerry 
dmass and reps bruce morrison dconn christopher shays 
rconn and joseph moakley dmass on thursday joined the chorus 
of officials calling on energy secretary james d watkins to 
investigate the price increases for the possibility of price 
fixing but olson said the department lacks authority over prices 
and that the attorney generals office would have to conduct such 
an inquiry 
these developments in washington did little to alleviate the 
immediate crisis in the coldbound northeast 
gary groleau energy coordinator for new hampshires fuel 
assistance program said 1200 more people have applied for 
assistance this year than last 
bostons city hall energy hotline reported record numbers of 
poor people calling because theyve used their fuel assistance 
allotment already 
jean fleischman of the bostonbased citizens energy corp a 
private foundation that supplies affordable heating oil to the 
poor related a tale of winter misery 
i had an elderly woman yesterday a widow from east boston

the news media shuttered by the 
regime of manuel antonio noriega are rushing to resume operations 
just days after the generals overthrow by us forces 
even employees of those media that loyally followed a 
progovernment line under noriega are celebrating the installation 
of the civilian government of president guillermo endara 
the noriega closed three opposition newspapers three radio 
stations and a television channel in 1988 shortly after the united 
states began demanding the generals ouster his regime 
expropriated another tv station this year 
in some cases broadcast or publishing licenses were revoked 
equipment confiscated and offending reporters hounded into exile 
the new government announced thursday that all news media can 
resume operations without any restrictions 
the governments basic line is to grant an opening for all 
communications media without regard to ownership and freedom of 
expression without any type of censorship said edwin cabrera 
director of the governments communications office 
cabrera also said the government is dismissing all court 
proceedings against journalists accused of violating censorship or 
security regulations under noriega 
the change in government has unleashed a wave of pentup 
resentment against the former strongman now holded up at the 
vatican embassy

discovery of an eagles nest apparently 
has complicated plans to build a 75 million hazardous waste 
treatment plant 
a state game warden found a pair of the birds nearly finished 
building their nest this week in a tall pine on an 86acre site in 
central florida where florida first processing inc wants to build 
the plant 
bald eagles and their habitat are protected by federal and state 
laws said don palmer a biologist in the jacksonville office of 
the federal fish and wildlife service 
the eagles were greeted with cheers from some of the 15 families 
who live a half mile from the site 10 miles south of mulberry and 
bitterly oppose the plant 
its an answer to our prayers said spokeswoman sandra 
lancaster 
because federal and state laws prohibit relocating or disturbing 
the endangered birds the plants developers could be barred from 
building according to federal and state wildlife authorities 
obviously we have to talk with the fish and wildlife bureau to 
learn more about this said florida first vice president ted 
leigh who was unaware of the nesting eagles until wednesday 
federal and state guidelines say development is prohibited 
within a minimum of a 750foot radius or about 40 acres of a 
nest palmer said outside that development up to a mile radius of 
the nest can be restricted by federal officials

a second baltic republic in less than a month has 
voted to scrap constitutional guarantees of the communist partys 
grip on power said local activists and journalists in latvia 
the republics parliament voted 22050 on thursday to drop the 
constitutional provision that makes the party the leading and 
guiding force of soviet society said viysturs koziols of the 
latvian peoples front newspaper atmoda 
eriks kehriks chief of the official news agency latinform 
confirmed the action 
neighboring lithuania voted dec 7 to strip the communist party 
of its leading role in society and most of eastern europe shed 
such provisions this year 
koziols said the latvian parliament voted after a stormy debate 
that lasted more than three hours 
sarmite elerte spokeswoman for the grassroots popular front 
movement said the decision must be made final at parliaments next 
session jan 1011 specific language is to be adopted then on 
constitutional amendments legalizing alternative political parties 
the change is expected to reduce the partys grip on all spheres 
of life in the republic like its neighbors lithuania and estonia 
latvia has a broadbased movement seeking independence from the 
soviet union which forcibly annexed all three nations in 1940 
lithuania also legalized alternative political parties 
its action to drop constiutional provisions giving power to the 
communists was the first threat to the partys guaranteed supremacy 
in the soviet union 
since then the issue has arisen in the national congress of 
peoples deputies and the parliaments of estonia and armenia all 
of which have similar provisions in their constitutions 
none has taken a formal vote on the issue but estonia is 
expected to in january 
lithuanias legalization of a multiparty system also helped push 
the republics communist party into breaking with the national 
party last week 
the lithuanian communists formed a separate party which favors 
independence that move infuriated many kremlin communists and the 
national partys central committee decided to send its leader 
president mikhail s gorbchev to lithuania next week to discuss 
the dispute 
on thursday tens of thousands of lithuanians rallied to support 
the republics communists against the kremlin 
the national television news show vremya said thousands of 
people gathered in vilnius kaunas and klaipede to hear bold 
uncompromising speeches supporting the party separatists 
scenes of the demonstration in vilnius showed a huge crowd on 
the central gediminas square numbering more than 50000 
the latvian parliament also considered reinstating the flag and 
national anthem of the independent republic that existed between 
the two world wars said latinforms kehriks the vote was 
postponed until january 
in estonia the parliament approved hefty taxes on alcohol and 
tobacco to finance pay raises for teachers doctors journalists 
and others in social and cultural work said estonian radio 
commentator peep kala student stipends also will rise he said 
the retail price of beer will double while the average price of 
tobacco products will rise 50 percent and alcoholic beverages by 20 
percent kala said

harvard university whose name has been 
emblazoned on sweatshirts from los angeles to maine as well as on 
shot glasses towels watches and boxer shorts has decided to make 
the name a trademark 
under new licensing procedures crimsonthemed boxer shorts may 
still be allowed but string bikinis maybe not 
licensing will protect harvard name according to ellen mitchell 
of the harvard office of patents copyrights and licensing 
we just dont want it to be outrageous she said we dont 
want to look silly 
more than 100 us colleges and universities already issue 
licenses for the use of their name including the seven other ivy 
league colleges according to the office of robert scott vice 
president for finance 
margot naulleau international licensing coordinator for 
champion products inc one of the main suppliers of athletic wear 
with college insignias said harvard was one of the last big 
schools in the country to issue a trademark 
but harvard officials had a good explanation 
its simply that we are very old and very conservative it 
took us a long time to decide if it was something that we ought to 
do said joyce brinton director of the patent office she said 
there was no incident that led to the decision to apply for a 
trademark such as a particularly egregious product on the market 
it was just that the time has come she said 
before the harvard corporation decided in june to apply for a 
trademark on the name from the us patent and trademarking office 
brintons office had inquiries from many many manufacturers 
about getting a license 
i think most of the companies have felt uncomfortable that 
they dont have a license from harvard said brinton those 
companies worried that if they didnt have a license they ran the 
risk of being left with hundreds of products if the schools 
lawyers suddenly cracked down on the names usage she said 
harvard ran a few trial programs before moving towards licensing 
on a broad scale at the schools 350th anniversary in 1986 
harvard wanted to ensure commemorative items were of high quality 
another program licensing the trademark in japan has been booming 
bringing in 130000 in royalties annually 
under the new licensing procedure if someone wants to make a 
product bearing the name harvard harvard university or the 
schools insignia they must first show designs and samples to 
demonstrate the quality of the product before harvard will grant a 
license 
and the cost of renting the harvard name a bargain mitchell 
said brinton said companies that market harvard products pay a 
flat fee of 300 and sales royalties of 7 percent

eastern airlines plans 600 more layoffs along with 
salary cuts for half its employees under measures to stem the flood 
of red ink that has swamped the airline for a decade 
about 10000 workers will have wages temporarily slashed from 10 
percent to 20 percent although some of those cuts must be 
negotiated with the air line pilots association and the flight 
attendants union 
the principal cause of the cuts which were announced thursday 
is the sale of easterns latin american routes to american 
airlines 
but tom matthews easterns senior vice president for human 
resources also cited the softness in the economy the 
increase in fuel prices the extensive competition in the miami 
hub particularly from pan american world airways 
the package is expected to save 100 million next year for 
eastern which reported a 1852 million loss in this years third 
quarter 
eastern president phil bakes said pay and benefit reductions 
were something we wanted to avoid but that large losses are 
expected to continue in the first half of the new year 
the cuts are also part of easterns bankruptcy court plan for 
financial reorganization that stemmed from the march 4 strike that 
virtually idled the miamibased carrier for weeks eastern claimed 
it was losing 1 million a day prior to the strike 
the majority of the layoffs will involve administrative and 
airport service personnel and will not include the unionized 
pilots flight attendants or mechanics 
attrition and early retirement will blunt the effects of the 
cutbacks but a number of operationsrelated employees will be out 
of work jan 31 as miami operations fall from 75 to 50 daily 
flights 
job cuts also will come july 1 when american airlines is 
scheduled to assume the latin routes 
meanwhile half of easterns 20000 employees including 
management pilots and flight attendants working at the older 
higher wage levels will have their wages cut by 10 percent to 20 
percent for a year beginning jan 16 
about 850 pilots will see their 72000 salaries slashed by 20 
percent for six months half of the cut will be restored after six 
months and wages are scheduled to return to normal after a year 
about 950 newly hired pilots are working for 27500 a year and 
will not be affected 
flight attendants earning a prestrike salary of 30000 a year 
will take a 15 percent initial cut but those hired under the new 
wage levels of 15000 will not 
machinists who had cuts imposed when the strike began arent 
affected machinists remain the only group that hasnt gone back to 
work 
mary jane barry head of easterns flight attendants union 
refused to comment on the proposal saying negotiations were 
continuing calls to alpa were not returned 
eastern employed 32000 before the strike began and the airline 
filed for bankruptcy protection five days later 
eastern a texas air corp subsidiary plans to reshape itself 
with about 75 percent of its operations centered at atlanta

deicing equipment and other parts of a 
commuter plane that will be tested in an effort to find the cause 
of a crash that killed all six people aboard the plane 
the crew of the united express plane from seattle reported light 
icing about an hour before it crashed at a small airport 180 miles 
southeast of seattle barry trotter of the national transportation 
safety board said thursday 
deicing and other equipment was being checked but it is much 
too early to determine the cause of the accident tuesday trotter 
said 
we still have not discounted anything and we are still looking 
at everything he said at a news conference 
the british aerospace jetstream 31 slammed into a sagebrush 
field short of the runway and burst into flames killing two crew 
members and four passengers 
several other aircraft that had landed prior to the crash 
reported light icing to insignificant icing trotter said an 
hour and 15 minutes before the accident this aircraft reported 
light icing 
but he said the crew didnt report any trouble in its final 
communication with the airport control tower or the faa control 
center in seattle just minutes before the plane went down 
icing tends to slow a planes forward speed or force it downward 
by increasing aircraft weight and drag and reducing lift and thrust 
the plane had made 7161 flights before to the crash and its 
flight history and maintenance records appeared clean trotter said 
united express one of several similarly named commuter 
airlines around the country is based in pasco and serves 15 
cities in washington oregon idaho and montana 
it serves as a feeder airline for united airlines with which it 
has a marketing agreement that permits it to use uniteds computer 
system and logo united express operated by npa inc began 
commercial air service in july 1987

the tokyo stock exchange closed its 1989 trading 
today with a halfday session in a festival mood and the fourth 
consecutive day of recordsetting left the markets key index 29 
percent higher than at the years beginning 
the dollar rose sharply closing 1989 at a level 139 percent 
above its 1988 close 
the 225issue nikkei stock average the stock exchanges main 
barometer finished at 3891587 points on its fourth consecutive 
day of setting a recordhigh closing in just a halfday session 
it gained 3893 points or 01 percent 
the stock market opened 1989 on jan 4 with the nikkei at 
3024366 and the index followed its familiar upward direction 
throughout the year reaching the 35000point mark aug 16 and the 
38000point mark dec 13 
its 1989 gain of 290 percent however was below 1988s 399 
percent 
the dollar closed today at 14340 up 125 yen from thursdays 
close of 14215 it opened at 14345 and stayed in a narrow range 
between 14315 yen and 14360 yen it had gained 005 yen on 
thursday after a fiveday decline totaling 213 yen 
the us currency had ended 1988 trading at 12590 yen this 
year despite pressure from the worlds monetary authorities to 
reduce its strength it traded as high as 15130 in june 
after a new year holiday the tokyo markets will reopen thursday 
the stock market was particularly strong in the last two months 
of this year when domestic politics finally settled down after a 
long period of instability and investors looked for business 
opportunities from the reform movements in eastern europe 
tokyo share prices recovered quickly from the crash in october 
when wall streets confidence was shaken by the failure of a united 
airlines buyout effort 
following an abrupt drop of 71 percent in the dow jones 
industrial average on the new york stock exchange oct 13 the main 
index in london fell 32 percent and the frankfurt market lost 132 
percent 
tokyo shares however declined only 18 percent or 64733 
points on the first trading day after the wall street crash and 
quickly regained 52739 points the next day in the next two 
months the index rose about 10 percent 
i think the tokyo markets strength was reconfirmed this year 
when the crashes in the new york and london markets were blocked by 
tokyos strength said josen takahashi a chief analyst at 
mitsubishi research institute a major private think tank 
the tokyo market also had recovered quickly from the crash of 
october 1987 and emerged as a powerhouse of world stock markets 
today the tokyo markets capitalization is estimated at 35 
trillion more than 25 percent larger than the new york stock 
exchange and tokyo is outperforming other major stock markets 
around the world 
analysts said the tokyo market overcame a number of obstacles 
this year including the death of emperor hirohito in january the 
resignations of two prime ministers in two months currency 
fluctuations and fear of creeping inflation 
there were some negative factors this year but overall the 
market situation was bullish throughout the year said ichitaro 
watanabe a dealer with nikko securities co 
in the currency market dealers attributed the dollars upward 
trend throughout 1989 to the gap in key interest rates between 
japan and the united states 
lower interest rates like japans tend to make a nations 
currency less attractive to investors 
on monday the bank of japan in an effort to stem inflationary 
pressure raised the discount rate the rate the central bank 
charges on its loans to commercial banks to 425 percent from 
375 percent 
the dollar however showed a moderate decline of only 095 yen 
against the japanese currency after the announcement and began 
climbing again on thursday 
but dealers say the dollar is expected to head downward early 
next year in anticipation of a further downswing in us interest 
rates the subject of speculation in recent weeks

florida and texas officials are taking stock of crop damage from 
the hard christmas freeze and taking steps to help growers who lost 
millions and farm workers who lost their jobs 
florida gov bob martinez declared his entire state a disaster 
area thursday and sought federal help while texas officials worked 
to open relief centers for farm workers displaced by the worst 
freeze to hit the lower rio grande valley in six years 
elsewhere in the deep south crews worked to restore water 
service after the past weeks freezing weather burst pipes and 
mains 
somewhat more moderate temperatures were returning to the south 
though at 5 am est today it was only 36 degrees in jacksonville 
fla 33 degrees in macon ga and 26 degrees in knoxville tenn 
cities in the north were being spared the arctic blasts of recent 
weeks though snow fell from salt lake city to the dakotas this 
morning 
the hard freeze saturday and sunday nights damaged oranges and 
grapefruit in floridas 700000acre citrus belt as well as winter 
vegetable crops the dollar value of the loss had yet to be 
determined 
the states tropical fish industry sugar cane crops and plant 
nurseries also were hurt badly 
after visiting several freezedamaged farms martinez signed an 
executive order declaring the disaster in all 67 florida counties 
the move opens the way for a possible federal disaster declaration 
by president bush 
from what i have seen there is no question that florida has 
suffered devastating losses and that our state is a disaster 
area martinez said we must now do everything we can to help 
those whose lives and livelihoods have been ravaged by the 
unmerciful weather 
in a letter martinez asked agriculture secretary clayton 
yuetter to approve farmers home administration loans for growers 
unemployment assistance direct grants and other help also could 
become available if bush declares a disaster 
state agriculture officials will assess each county to compile 
loss estimated which would be needed before a federal declaration 
is made that could take two or three weeks 
a freeze in 1985 freeze cost the florida citrus industry alone 
about 255 million 
higher vegetable prices have already been reported but the 
impact on citrus prices could be minimal because of a large juice 
reserve and the quick processing of frostbitten fruit into juice 
concentrate 
floridas 33 citrus processing plants were pushed to the limit 
thursday in an effort to salvage frozen fruit and squeeze it into 
juice before it spoils 
well be open 24 hours per day seven days a week during the 
salvage process said steve caruso assistant general manager at 
citrus world a processing plant in lake wales that produces about 
400000 gallons of fresh juice daily 
in texas officials estimated that 60 percent of the lower rio

an israeli who served as a top adviser to 
deposed panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega reportedly led a 
famous bungled mission as chief of special operations for israels 
spy agency 
the mission set out to catch the palestinians who carried out 
the massacre of israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics but 
wound up killing a moroccanborn waiter in norway in a case of 
mistaken identity 
michael harari whose arrest in panama was reported thursday 
was a security adviser to noriega and an instructor for panamanian 
defense forces according to a us embassy official in panama who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
spokesmen for the israeli foreign and defense ministries refused 
comment today on the arrest saying harari was a private citizen 
but the exploits of the 62yearold former israeli army colonel 
have been described extensively in israeli newspapers 
the daily yediot ahronot said harari helped noriega recruit 
israeli mercenaries as his personal bodyguards over the last year 
the newspaper also said a second israeli eliezer ben giton 
surrendered to us troops outside the vatican mission in panama 
city and identified himself as responsible for the personal 
security of gen manuel noriega 
us troops invaded panama on dec 20 to seize noriega and take 
him to the united states to stand trial on drugtrafficking 
charges but he eluded capture and took refuge in the vatican 
mission on sunday 
the independent haaretz daily said israel under strong us 
pressure to cut contacts with noriega convinced harari to leave 
panama last year 
but the former agent with the israeli mossad spy agency later 
returned haaretz reported that harari told israeli officials that 
if he did not work with noriega his role would be filled by cubans 
or nicaraguans 
israels ambassador to panama reuven beneliezer told israel 
army radio in an interview from new york that he had no contact 
with harari 
i dont know who harari is i didnt see him i didnt meet 
him i didnt get orders from him and he also didnt receive 
orders from israels embassy in panama beneliezer said in an 
interview recorded wednesday but first broadcast today 
he is a private israeli i dont know what he did there he 
did business and he was appointed by noriega as honorary general 
counsul for panama in israel beneliezer said 
yediot described harari as the former chief of mossads special 
operations and said his bestknown case was the bungled effort to 
kill the leader of the palestinian black september group that 
massacred 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 olympics 
the case is also described in the book the quest for the red 
prince by israeli authors michael barzohar and eitan haber 
haber now spokesman for defense secretary yitzhak rabin 
refused to comment on the case 
in the book the team leader is referred to only as mike 
but sources familiar with the case have said it was harari 
according to the accounts harari led a 15member mossad hit 
squad to kill the palestinian groups leader ali hassan salameh 
but the chase ended on may 23 1973 when agents shot and killed a 
waiter in lillehammer norway 
the incident embarrassed the mossad and the services image was 
further tarnished when six agents and other israelis involved in 
the mission were arrested by norwegian police

mayor tom bradley admitted no wrongdoing but 
agreed to spend 20000 of his own money to settle an ethics 
lawsuit charging he unlawfully failed to disclose personal 
financial holdings a judge said 
the agreement disclosed thursday settles a civil lawsuit filed 
sept 13 by city attorney james k hahn it charged bradley with 
failing to report personal financial holdings amounting to roughly 
160000 on six occasions 
typically politicians have been allowed to use campaign funds 
to settle such lawsuits said superior court judge robert i weil 
who called the bradley deal unique and extraordinary 
nevertheless weil said thursday that bradleys errors were acts 
of negligence not done with criminal or willful intent the 
settlement weil added does not constitute an admission of 
liability 
bradley said in a statement though none of my mistakes was 
intentional i have repeatedly taken public responsibility for the 
inadvertent errors 
therefore i chose the highly unusual step of resolving this 
manner by paying the settlement from my own resources the decision 
to use my personal funds was mine and mine alone 
hahn however characterized bradleys violations as 
significant and said the 20000 bradley paid personally to 
settle the case was unprecedented 
the fact that he is the mayor the chief executive officer of 
the entire municipal corporation of los angeles i think holds him 
to a high degree of requirement to fill out these statements of 
economic interest accurately every year hahn said 
the lawsuit was filed after the mayor revealed he had made more 
than 100 errors and omissions in his statements of economic 
interest from 1984 to 1988 at least 222000 in investments and 
income werent reported hahn sued over 160000 of it 
the agreement settles only one aspect of bradleys crisis over 
ethics and finances 
a federal grand jury is investigating the mayors business ties 
to eight banks savings and loans associations and brokerage firms 
for possible insider stock trading or violations of federal laws 
aimed at political corruption

one of four florida lawyers representing ousted 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega has asked to be allowed to 
quit in part because of public statements by the other attorneys in 
the case 
it was a question of drawing the line between function as a 
lawyer and a general spokesperson attorney neal sonnett said 
thursday he said hed rather not discuss his other reasons for 
withdrawing 
i have consistently refused to comment on panamanian affairs 
they are outside my responsibility he told the associated press 
its important for me to practice law 
i didnt really want to create a firestorm he added 
there have been other conflicts between me and cocounsel but 
nothing i feel is appropriate to discuss 
sonnett filed a motion wednesday with the us district court 
asking that he be allowed to quit representing noriega on federal 
drug charges filed in miami in february 1988 the court usually 
grants such requests 
although sonnett in recent months has indicated that he was 
pulling back from the case both frank rubino and raymond takiff 
also noreiga attorneys said they were surprised by sonnetts 
motion 
weve had no problems whatsoever said takiff just 
general differences of opinion 
takiff said he found sonnetts move puzzling especially since 
sonnett recently appeared on cnns crossfire and spoke of 
noriega 
sonnett countered that he appeared on the news show as president 
of the national association of criminal defense lawyers to discuss 
forfeiture of attorneys fees he said he didnt talk about the 
general 
a fourth noriega attorney steve kollin said he had no comment 
noriega was seeking asylum at the vatican embassy in panama city

proindian tamil guerrillas ambushed 
and killed at least 18 members of the rival tamil tigers militia in 
northern sri lanka residents said today 
the attack in the vavuniya district occurred thursday night 
barely 24 hours after the tigers ambushed and killed 28 members of 
another tamil band in the same area 
tamil residents in vavuniya 135 miles northeast of colombo 
said the peoples liberation organization of tamil eelam attacked a 
tiger patrol in musalkutti southwest of vavuniya on thursday 
evening 
the residents were contacted by telephone and spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
on wednesday the tigers ambushed two trucks carrying members of 
the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front killing 28 of 
them three tigers also died in that battle just west of vavuniya 
the peoples liberation organization of tamil eelam and the the 
eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front are allies in the 
struggle for power against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
the strongest tamil militant group 
the front won control of the provincial council a year ago in 
elections boycotted by the tigers who now are trying to dislodge 
the front and force new elections 
the tigers also have been battling the indian peacekeeping force 
sent to sri lanka in july 1987 to disarm tamil guerrillas who had 
been fighting sri lankas sinhalesedominated government for a 
separate homeland in northeastern sri lanka the two smaller tamil 
groups agreed to give up armed struggle but the tigers refused to 
surrender their weapons an started attacking the indian force 
the indians have been winding down their military presence and 
pulled out of the vavuniya area today they have withdrawn from six 
of the eight northeastern districts they once patrolled but remain 
in the major population centers of trincomalee and jaffna 
the peacekeeping operation grew out of a july 1987 peace plan 
the government of former indian prime minister rajiv gandhi said in 
september its troowould take longer 
indian foreign minister inder kumar gujral said the withdrawal 
should be over by march 31 
sri lankan foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said today he had 
not been formally notified of indias new timetable 
they the indians appear to have decided on their own 
wijeratne said he said he would have no further comment until he 
received a detailed report from the sri lankan embassy in new delhi 
an estimated 25000 indian soldiers remain in sri lanka india 
became involved because of the sympathies of its own politically 
powerful tamil minority of 60 million from their fellow tamils in 
sri lanka 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
say the sinhalese majority discriminates against them 
more than 11000 people including 1100 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the northeast since the tamil separatist revolt 
started in 1983 six thousand have died in backlash by sinhalese 
extremists in the sinhalese heartland of central and southern sri 
lanka who accused the government of making too many concessions to 
the tamils

the director of an antinuclear power group 
says hes alarmed the beaver valley nuclear plant did not get fined 
for lapses that included security officers napping on the job 
if you have this many lapses in a good program its scary to 
think what a bad program is like said ken bossong director of 
the critical mass energy project which is affiliated with the 
consumer group public citizen 
the absence of any fines or other reprimands shows lax 
oversight by the nuclear regulatory commission he said 
a plant security officer tampered with a safetyrelated device 
and others slept on duty the pittsburgh press reported thursday 
the newspaper also said a security supervisor at the plant in 
shippingport about 25 miles from pittsburgh placed an unloaded 
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger in january 1988 and in 
october two guards each allowed a person to enter the plant 
without required authorization 
the newspaper said its report was based on a review of nrc 
records and interviews with officials at the nrc and duquesne light 
co the operator of the tworeactor complex 
duquesne light spokesman kenneth service said the incidents drew 
strong disciplinary action including firings and suspensions no 
fines were imposed by the nrc 
throughout this period weve had a high level of security and 
continue to have a high level of security service said none 
of these individual items in any way degraded the level of security 
or safety at the plant 
the nrcs past three performance assessments covering 1986 
through august 1989 gave duquesne light the highest of three 
possible ratings for security

the vatican is urging panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega to leave his refuge at its embassy in panama 
city a holy see spokesman said today 
the spokesman joaquin navarro also criticized us activities 
outside the vatican embassy and said steps would be taken if 
the disturbances continue he did not elaborate 
us forces have staked out the mission and blasted rock music 
from a stereo system in the street to try to put pressure on 
noriega to surrender to be prosecuted on us drug trafficking 
charges 
the nuncio is doing his best to convince gen noriega to 
abandon the nunciature on his own by himself spokesman joaquin 
navarro said at the same time he cannot force noriega to leave 
nor can he consign him to us forces 
it was the first time the vatican said publicly it was trying to 
persuade noriega to leave however navarro said the possibility 
had been discussed with noriega since he took refuge at the mission 
on sunday 
in what has appeared to be a standoff the vatican has insisted 
that the papal nunciature or embassy cannot legally turn the 
general over to us forces since under accepted international 
procedures an embassy is only empowered to deal with the 
government of the host country 
navarro today said the vatican still has not received a formal 
request from the new panamanian government to turn over noriega 
navarro denounced us interference in the embassys 
autonomy 
an occupying power cannot interfere with the works of a 
diplomatic mission nor can it demand that a person seeking asylum 
in that mission be handed over to it navarro said 
he was asked to comment on us tactics such as the searching 
of the nuncio or the shooting out of street lights to blacken the 
area at night in hopes of thwarting a possible undetected exiting 
of noriega 
if this is going to continue further steps will be taken by 
the vatican the spokesman said without giving details he added 
however that the vatican was not in a clash with the united 
states 
navarro was asked about panamanian officials statements that 
the government of president guillermo endara has sent a letter to 
the vatican asking that noriega be expelled from the embassy 
we havent got that letter navarro said asked how come he 
replied i dont know ask the post office the telex office 
he said 
the vaticans top spokesman said there had been progress in 
negotiations between the united states and the holy see over 
noriegas fate 
asked for details he replied the positions are clearer 
on wednesday he estimated that the standoff would be resolved 
to both sides satisfaction within a few days 
he said today he still expected the matter to be resolved in 
days but that it could be 20 30 or 40 days

five greenpeace members were 
acquitted of mischief by a judge who ruled that the anchoring of a 
nuclearcapable us navy vessel off vancouver was an invitation to 
protest 
calling the defendants fears the concerns of all rightminded 
people about the dangers of nuclear weapons provincial court 
judge wallace craig said thursday that they were right to protest 
and that canadians had been too passive in the past 
i think its remarkable that the canadian government has 
seen fit to invite a vessel of this type craig said 
the five were charged after they spraypainted peace symbols and 
the international radiation warning symbol on the aircraft carrier 
uss independence as it attempted to anchor in english bay on aug 
9 a sixth protester charged with mischief rolph reynolds was 
given a conditional discharge 
the court was told reynolds climbed the carriers anchor chain 
waving a flag 
craig said he accepted that the defendants believed there were 
nuclear weapons aboard the ship the us navy routinely refuses to 
confirm or deny whether nuclear weapons are aboard a vessel 
carrier navigator cmdr richard ormsbee said reynolds put the 
vessels captain in a perilous situation because the carrier was in 
danger of running aground near stanley park 
if reynolds hadnt been dragged off the anchor chain he said 
the captain would have been faced with dangerous choices 
he would have been forced to either drop the port anchor 
endangering small boats near the ships bow drop the starboard 
anchor with reynolds on it or throw the engines into full reverse 
swamping several small boats ormsbee said 
craig said reynolds actions could have caused the accident he 
was trying to prevent but refused to grant the navys request for 
1950 for fuel the ship burned while the carrier was attempting to 
anchor

the supreme court has rejected pittsburghs 
request for authority to bar a menorah from the steps of the 
citycounty building 
by a 63 vote thursday the court rejected an emergency request 
by the city aimed at having the menorah taken down before 
saturdays conclusion of hanukkah chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices john paul stevens and antonin scalia were in 
the minority 
city officials had asked the full court to set aside an order 
justice william j brennan issued last friday letting chabad a 
jewish organization erect the menorah the menorah and a sign 
saying salute to liberty were put in place tuesday 
late thursday someone wrote plo the initials of the 
palestine liberation organization on the sign the vandal if 
caught could be charged with criminal mischief ethnic 
intimidation and desecration of a venerated object police officer 
thomas koral said 
the menorah is a candelabrum symbolizing the eightday jewish 
holiday 
earlier thursday the court had said it would take up the citys 
request jan 5 during its next regularly scheduled conference 
virtually assuring that the 40foot menorah would remain alongside 
a 45foot christmas tree until it is taken down by chabad members 
on saturday 
later in the day the justices decided to take up the citys 
request in a more timely manner 
city officials argued that the jewish group shouldnt have the 
power to determine what will be displayed on the steps of a public 
building they argued that the area isnt a public forum open 
to various messages by private citizens 
us district judge barron p mccune ruled last week that the 
city couldnt prevent display of the menorah but the 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals in philadelphia on friday postponed the 
effect of mccunes ruling 
brennan then set aside the 3rd circuit order 
the same menorah and a christmas nativity scene located at the 
allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh was the subject of a 
supreme court decision last summer 
the court ruled that the menorahs display was constitutional 
because it unlike the nativity scene was accompanied by a 
nonreligious symbol the christmas tree 
city officials said that ruling didnt obligate them to allow 
display of the menorah but judge mccune ruled that the steps of 
the citycounty building have become a public forum open to various 
types of expression

airlines flight to detroit canceled their reservations today after 
learning of a threat to bomb the plane airline officials said 
frederic wuatelet sales manager at northwests paris office 
said there was a steady stream of passengers calling or coming by 
after the report of a threat to saturdays flight 51 
most of those who call are changing their flight wuatelet 
said northwest is allowing passengers to change their bookings to 
another day or another airline without penalty but is not taking 
the initiative to contact them 
were waiting for them to call us he said 
wuatelet said at least 30 had canceled their bookings on flight 
51 by midday today but he could not say how many passengers were 
still booked on the flight 
tarek elkhazindar 28 an egyptian and his minneapolisborn 
wife brooke elkhazindar 29 were in the northwest offices in 
central paris this afternoon to change their travel plans 
i noticed when i was reading the paper at 830 this morning 
that it was our flight mrs elkhazindar said i dont know if 
its a great idea or not but were going to change 
her husband wasnt convinced 
my real instinct is just to stay on this flight he said 
while discussing the bomb threat with a northwest representative 
theres probably going to be four times more security now than on 
any other plane 
but you cant be too safe mrs elkhazindar replied 
in the end they switched to a delta flight saturday from paris 
to atlanta 
northwest announced the threat on thursday in an departure from 
the handling of most threats against us aviation which generally 
are not mentioned to passengers 
the us federal aviation administration and airlines have come 
under pressure to be more forthright in disclosing security risks 
after 270 people were killed dec 21 1988 when a bomb blew up pan 
am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
a threat against pan am on the frankfurttonew york route was 
mentioned within the us government but was not made public 
government officials later declared the threat a hoax even though 
its particulars fit the pan am explosion 
in st paul minn northwest spokesman douglas miller said 
tightened security would assure that saturdays flight was safe for 
those passengers who chose to take it 
in washington faa spokesman john leyden said officials were 
working with northwest and with the french authorities to ensure 
there is extra security on the flight 
pierre quilici deputy chief of frances air and border police 
said us authorities had passed on word of the threat several days 
ago he said most of the special security measures that will be

the violence came a day after fights broke out between two 
groups of vietnamese in a second center one person was killed and 
10 injured in the clashes 
vietnamese at the chi ma wan center threw stones and set fire to 
blankets after security forces arrived for the weapons search

injured in the camp on outlying lantau island 
the boat people in order to make the operation more 
difficult pushed their women and children to the front security 
secretary m geoffrey barnes said in a government statement 
although officials refused to say how many police were used in 
the operation governmentfunded radio put the number at about 300 
five hours of counseling by staff of the un high commissioner 
of refugees and voluntary agencies failed to persuade the 
vietnamese to cooperate the government statement said

reports that some of the chi ma wan inmates may be in the next 
group of boat people forced to return to their impoverished 
homeland 
that fatality occurred at the shek kong detention center late 
thursday when two fights broke out between two rival groups of

create a new force based on the present civic militia during a 
meeting with president wojciech jaruzelski the agency said

criminals is now carried out by the civic militia which in the 
past was also responsible for represssing the opposition and 
militant priests bugging telephones and monitoring letters between 
private citizens

was still under discussion as is the design of new uniforms the 
state news agency reported

concerning protection of public order and protection of 
individuals security and their property the agency said 
kiszczak one of only four communist ministers in the cabinet 
said that a new office for the protection of the state would be 
created to oversee activities by the intelligence and 
counterintelligence services 
kiszczak told jaruzelski that the interior ministry which now 
controls the civic militia was conducting consultations with the 
solidarityled government and members of parliament about the 
proposals 
when the discussions are completed kiszczak said he would ask 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki to start procedures to present a 
draft law on the new police force to parliament pap said 
there are now about 1250 crimes per 100000 people annually

northwest airlines says strict security 
precautions ensure that a parisdetroit flight saturday will 
operate safely despite a bomb threat that today caused at least 30 
passengers to cancel reservations 
in an unusual public response to a bomb threat the airline 
announced thursday that any passengers who do not wish to take 
flight 51 may postpone their flight or switch to other carriers 
without penalty 
at northwests paris office sales manager frederic wuatelet 
said at least 30 passengers had changed reservation by midday 
today earlier reports said between 120 and 130 passengers were 
booked on the dc10 
federal aviation administration spokesman john leyden indicated 
there was little unusual about the threat itself which he said 
came in an anonymous phone call and was one of about 300 received 
by us airlines each year 
leyden said officials were working with northwest and with the 
french authorities to ensure there is extra security on the 
flight 
northwests public response was a departure from the handling of 
most threats against us aviation which generally are dealt with 
stealthily and not mentioned to passengers 
the faa and airlines have come under pressure to be more 
forthright in disclosing security risks after 270 people were 
killed dec 21 1988 when a bomb blew up pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland the plane which had stopped in london was en 
route from frankfurt to new york a threat against pan am on the 
frankfurttonew york route got some distribution within the us 
government but was not made public government officials later 
declared the threat a hoax even though its particulars fit the pan 
am explosion 
the faa has a policy of not alerting the public to security 
threats unless they are very specific and the flight involved is 
not being canceled 
the northwest threat appeared to meet conditions that would 
allow disclosure 
this is an unusual threat in the fact that its very specific 
directed at a specific flight on a particular day and that is what 
adds to the precautions that were taking surrounding it said 
northwest spokesman douglas miller in st paul minn 
miller said northwest informed the faa fbi cia and foreign 
agencies that would be involved but he said the fbi had asked the 
airline not to disclose any other details about the threat 
including where or when it was made 
abc news quoting sources reported thursday night that a man 
with a middle eastern accent made the threat to northwests 
detroit office saying the bombing would be in retaliation for life 
sentences handed down to two palestinians convicted in sweden of 
charges connected with a string of bombings in europe 
one of the two abu mohammed talb is a suspect in the flight 
103 bombing he and codefendant marten imandi were sentenced to 
life for their part in the 1985 bombing of a northwest office in 
copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 20 one of four 
bombings in denmark and the netherlands for which they were 
convicted 
the threat against northwest has brought tightened security for 
all northwest flights out of paris miller said 
we intend to fly the plane he said we feel that we have 
all the precautions and security measures in place to operate the 
plane safely if we did not feel 100 percent positive about our 
ability to fly the plane safely we would not put it in the air 
miller said the airline had not decided whether to attempt to 
advise passengers individually prior to their arrival for the 
flight but a statement noting the bomb threat would be handed to 
those who go to the airport for departure saturday 
they can change their itineraries without penalty he said 
airlines regularly prohibit reservation changes or charge for them 
when passengers fly on the leastexpensive fares 
meanwhile northwest reservations clerks were advising callers 
of a security threat against the flight 
callers were told they could change reservations to another day 
or another flight on a different airline 
in a related incident a usair flight preparing to take off from 
philadelphia international airport for boston on thursday returned 
to the gate after a security threat was conveyed to the crew 
an airline spokesman said early today 
the threat was found to be unfounded after security personnel 
searched the cabin of flight 528 usair spokesman john bronson 
said the 127 passengers on board the plane scheduled to depart at 
555 pm were returned to the gate put up for the night and were 
to be flown to boston today

the agriculture department announced today 
that the federal price support for milk produced by farmers will be 
reduced jan 1 to 1010 per 100 pounds a 50cent cut from the 
current level 
acting secretary roland r vautour said the omnibus budget 
reconciliation act of 1989 authorized a reduction of up to 50 cents 
the maximum announced today if government purchases of surplus 
dairy products are expected to exceed five billion pounds of milk 
equivalent in 1990 
if the support had remained at 1060 per hundredweight 1990 
purchases by the departments commodity credit corp would have 
totaled an estimated eight billion pounds he said with the 
reduction to 1010 purchases are expected to be 74 billion 
pounds 
unlike price support operations for many other commodities the 
dairy program does not give farmers direct federal payments 
instead the ccc buys surplus cheese notfat dry milk and butter 
so that processors and handlers can pay dairy farmers at least the 
basic support rate for milk 
the ccc purchase price of butter will be reduced 1125 cents per 
pound to 10925 per pound the announcement said nonfat dry milk 
will be unchanged at 79 cents per pound the price of block cheddar 
and barrel cheese will be reduced by 45 cents per pound to 111 
and 107 per pound respectively 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who is on vacation had 
been urged by the national milk producers federation not to reduce 
the 1990 milk support rate contending that such a move would 
prove seriously destabilizing to the dairy industry

a group claiming responsibility for bombs that 
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer threatened in a 
letter full of racial invective to assassinate two naacp officials 
as part of the same reprisal 
in a letter to wagatv an organization calling itself americans 
for a competent federal judicial system also threatened to kill 
lawyers judges and members of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people any time a black man rapes a white 
woman 
the threatened reprisals led black leaders to bolster security 
plans for the jan 15 celebration of slain civil rights leader 
martin luther king jrs birthday 
precautions were being taken at the 600 southeastern branches of 
the naacp said earl shinhoster the organizations regional 
director he declined to say what those precautions were 
an fbi official said he believed the letter was authentic 
because it contained information available only to someone closely 
associated with the construction and mailing of the bombs that 
killed 11th us circuit court of appeals judge robert s vance at 
his home near birmingham ala on dec 16 and savannah attorney 
robert robinson two days later 
william l hinshaw agent in charge of the fbi investigation 
would not specify what that information is 
it opens a new door and we hope through that door will pass 
information from the public he said 
authorities are unfamiliar with the group hinshaw said 
the atlanta constitution in todays editions quoted 
unidentified sources as saying the letter contained the same 
identifying code as the previous letters and that physical evidence 
links all of the letters to the bombs the newspaper did not 
elaborate 
in its evening broadcasts thursday wagatv released excerpts of 
the letter which said the group held a secret meeting dec 19 in 
montgomery ala after the two fatal bombings 
according to the station the letter said group members from 
georgia florida and alabama gathered to draft new orders and 
to go public with their mission 
the group claimed it assassinated judge robert s vance and 
attorney robert robinson in reprisal for atrocities committed on 
julie love a white woman who was robbed raped and murdered in 
atlanta in 1988 
the letter also said two more prominent members of the naacp 
shall be assassinated using more sophisticated means as part of 
the same reprisal 
the letter expressed anger over school desegregation cases 
apparently referring to a longrunning battle over the dekalb 
county ga schools in which the slain judge was involved 
protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority than 
granting the blacks demand for white teachers for their 
children the letter said 
vance was on the 11th us circuit court panel that directed 
dekalb schools to transfer about 120 veteran teachers from 
predominantly white schools to predominantly black ones in an 
effort to balance teacher experience in the system 
robinson handled a desegregation case in savannah and another 
school desegregation case came out of jacksonville fla where a 
bomb was delivered to naacp headquarters that bomb and one sent to 
the 11th circuit building in atlanta were safely removed 
anytime a black man rapes a white woman in alabama florida or 
georgia in the future americans for a competent federal judicial 
system shall assassinate one federal judge one attorney and one 
officer of the naacp the letter said 
it cited the slaying of ms love 27 who disappeared july 11 
1988 after her car ran out of gas her remains were found a little 
more than a year later in a wooded lot near an innercity 
neighborhood 
two young black men emmanuel fitzgerald hammond 24 and 
william maurice porter 20 have been charged in the slaying 
porter pleaded guilty in november and is expected to testify 
against hammond 
its very difficult to react the naacps shinhoster said 
the threats against the naacp and others contained in that 
communication must be taken seriously weve already had two 
decent fine individuals murdered by that group 
walter morrison a spokesman at the naacps baltimore 
headquarters said the group wasnt intimidated by the action 
weve indicated that we will not be deterred he said

about 12000 us troops are permanently stationed in panama 
in texas where president bush was hunting fitzwater reiterated 
the us stance that noriega should be handed over to the united 
states to stand trial on drug trafficking charges

vaclav havel the passionate 
defender of human rights and eloquent philosopher of moral 
resistance was in jail just nine months ago for challenging the 
communist masters 
on friday he was elected president of czechoslovakia 
the spontaneous revolution that carried havel to the highest 
post in the land could not have been more perfectly scripted if it 
had been plotted by the 53yearold playwright himself 
one year to the day from czechoslovakias first legal 
demonstration for human rights the communists lost their monopoly 
on power 
the appointment of the new reform government on dec 10 and the 
simultaneous resignation of hardline communist president gustav 
husak followed four weeks of mass prodemocracy protests and days 
of negotiations between the communists and the opposition led by 
havel 
although sparked by the violent police crackdown on peaceful 
student demonstrators nov 17 the revolution that toppled the 
communists was achieved without violence its weapon was the 
enormous moral force which havel has come to symbolize 
the upheaval cast havel into the leading role as head of the 
opposition civic forum but long before he embodied for many 
czechoslovaks the individuals struggle for human dignity under 
communism 
his trouble with authorities began in the stalinist 1950s when 
he was declared too bourgeois to attend high school because he came 
from a family of wellknown architects and entrepreneurs in 
precommunist czechoslovakia 
he went to work in the theater where his play the garden 
party brought him instant success in 1963 
his essays letters and manifestoes were a relentless attack 
against tyranny in his 1978 essay the power and the 
powerless havel powerfully describes how the communist regimes 
of the soviet bloc sought to strangle independent thought 
his unbending defense of liberty which included signing the 
human rights manifesto charter 77 earned him a fouryear jail 
sentence in 1979 
even after release havel was hounded interrogated and followed 
by secret police his works were published and performed to wide 
acclaim in the west and despite an official ban his ideas 
circulated at home through smuggled books and underground journals 
and his popularity grew 
havels work especially the rich poetic philosophical 
meditations of his political essays made him one of the leading 
spokesmen for east european intellectuals 
in an interview published in may by the observer in london 
havel reflected on the unique role of the writer under 
totalitarianism 
where society cannot organize itself naturally and where 
politics in the original sense of the word have been abolished 
everything becomes cryptopolitical or semipolitical politics are 
thrown out the door only to come back through the window he said 
abolished as a specific form of activity politics spread to 
encompass a wide range of other pursuits 
everything from a rock group to a concert to a religious mass 
can become political if a writer attempts to speak the truth all 
his life he too becomes a political phenomenon he said 
havels election becoming the first noncommunist president in 
41 years revives czechoslovakias tradition of the philosopher 
president dating to tomas garrigue masaryk the professor and 
author who built the nation from the rubble of the austrohungarian 
empire in 1918 
his countrymen look to havel to create stability after the 
recent upheaval and to encourage investment from the west 
havel sees his role as director guiding the nation toward its

the vatican should put the fate of ousted 
panamanian gen manuel noriega in the hands of a special public 
tribunal a group of american scholars suggested 
in a statement transmitted this week to the vatican nine us 
legal experts and academicians said turning noriega over to a 
grandjurytype panel would set a positive precedent in 
international criminal law for handling deposed dictators accused 
of criminal activity 
the panel should be made up of distinguished persons publicly 
known to be of high integrity and fairmindedness selected by 
yourselves and others including the secretary general of the 
united nations the statement said 
noriega has been holed up in the vatican embassy in panama city 
since sunday both us and panamanian officials have urged the 
vatican to turn him over for trial on drugtrafficking charges 
alfred f andersen a selfdescribed retired philosopher and 
author who lives in tucson said in a telephone interview thursday 
that he and the eight others who signed the document believe it 
would be a mistake for the vatican simply to hand noriega over to 
the united states 
we the undersigned commend your not making a hasty decision 
in this matter and your evidently wanting to be sure that your 
ultimate decision will truly serve the cause of justice in this 
turbulent world the statement said 
andersen said the statement was his idea 
i saw the dilemma the vatican was in andersen said i 
started thinking about how he could be turned over to someone who 
would be more objective than the united states or even the 
panamanian government 
andersen said he contacted a friend richard a falk a 
princeton university international law professor and the two of 
them worked out the statement 
andersen said he and falk then contacted the others whose names 
appear on the document transmitted to the vatican wednesday night 
and again on thursday 
the vatican has yet to respond andersen said 
in addition to himself and falk andersen said the statement 
also was signed by benjamin b ferenca a prosecutor at the 
nuremberg trials following world war ii who now lives in new 
rochelle ny burns h weston a university of iowa law

the judge injured by a package of pipe 
bombs has no idea who mailed him the explosives and says he was 
surprised to have survived what he is calls a violent attack on the 
entire maryland bench 
there is no way i should have survived no way i should be 
alive washington county circuit judge john p corderman said in 
an interview published today by the sun in baltimore 
corderman arrived home at his apartment in downtown hagerstown 
on dec 22 and found a package leaning against his door he took it 
inside opened it and it exploded the judge suffered shrapnel 
wounds to his right hand and abdomen and partial hearing loss 
corderman said that although it was a personal attack on me 
it has a larger dimension it is an attack on the system i serve 
in a way i represent the 200 judges at the trial and 
appellate level in maryland he said 
i am deeply disturbed by the level of violence that seems to 
go unabated in our society he added 
doctors at washington county hospital removed pieces of pipe 
from his left groin and reconstructed the middle finger on his 
right hand the explosion punctured his eardrums and before 
releasing him christmas day doctors told the 47yearold judge 
that he might need corrective ear surgery 
it was the most remarkable christmas ive ever had in the best 
possible way corderman told the sun some of the presents 
werent wrapped and that was ok some of the cards didnt make it 
and that was ok 
because i had the gift of life that made everything material 
pale in comparison 
corderman has been helping postal inspectors and detectives try 
to make a list of possible suspects inspectors continue to examine 
hundreds of cordermans cases looking for potential suspects 
unfortunately this judge is very controversial said postal 
inspector don gattie he sentences 150 cases a year and thats 
just criminal 
gattie who said investigators were not close to making an 
arrest said corderman also handled child support cases and had a 
reputation for issuing harsh sentences against parents who failed 
to pay and also in cases involving drugs or alcohol 
they are portraying me as tough but i give people a chance 
all the time he said i modify sentences all the time i give 
people a chance to take a diferent path 
gattie said investigators received a couple dozen calls on a tip 
line the postal service set up in hagerstown 
investigators with the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms have completed their preliminary forensic investigation of 
bomb fragments 
there were at least three pipe bombs one of which did not 
explode and was deactivated by the bomb squad said tom hill an 
atf spokesman 
wrctv in washington quoted unidentified investigators as saying 
there were four bombs in the package and that three exploded 
federal investigators however have refused to confirm the 
report we dont want to inform the doer how were doing said 
jack killorin an atf spokesman in washington 
killorin said the investigation still was focused in maryland 
mike vision a spokesman for the postal inspection service in 
baltimore said he knew where the package was mailed but refused to 
divulge information about the postmark

when the new year arrives so will a gallant 
masked figure from the past of old spanish california with sword 
flashing black cape billowing white teeth gleaming here comes 
zorro 
yes by neddies zorro with a z its the latest in a long line 
of zorros that includes the abc series of 195759 that set millions 
of tykes to running about in zorro costumes trying to puncture 
each other in the name of justice 
that one starred guy williams this one starring duncan regehr 
36 is the first new zorro series ever on cable specifically 
the family channel where the halfhour series will debut on jan 5 
the shows star a canadian with shakespearean stage credits is 
a very big zorro he stands 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 215 
pounds were this a zorro of fistics not fencing hed be 
right at home 
this is because regehr a softspoken man with a dry sense of 
humor regularly used to put his dukes for sport he once thought 
of seeking a spot on canadas olympic boxing team he fought 65 
amateur bouts he says and had only three losses none of them by 
knockouts 
it did enter his mind that a flattened nose might be bad for 
someone seeking work as the handsome leading man in a work by 
shakespeare thats why it was kind of dumb idea dont you 
think he wryly asks 
but that was when he was in his late teens when the notion that 
he could get his face rearranged had not quite sunk in no at 
that age i think i was so stupid and cocky that i figured it 
wouldnt happen to me 
and fortunately i got out before it did i hope 
regehrs dossier includes such varied work as hamlet at 
ontarios stratford shakespeare festival and the role of the late 
erroll flynn in cbs my wicked wicked ways 
he shot 25 zorro episodes in spain this fall 
the new series takes place as have most zorro films in 
california in 1820 regehr has as have others before him a 
tworole part the dandy don diego vega who really is the masked 
senor zorro who zips about righting wrongs and leaving his 
trademark z carved in various places 
george hamilton played things for laughs and with a gay 
lookalike brother in 1981s zorro the gay blade so did cbs 
in 1983 with a contemporary zorro and son which was the sort 
of show in which a franciscan monk was arrested for selling wine 
before its time 
but in this edition done in the old romantic tradition don 
diego usually played as a popinjay or even a fop doesnt get that 
treatment from regehr 
ive played hm more like a renaissance man interested in art 
science and music more bookish rather than being er a little 
light on the feet 
the actor the son of an artist and a painter himself has lived 
for the past ten years in los angeles but he and his wife 
catherine have a new years project to move to vancouver island 
in british columbia 
he would keep a place in los angeles and commute there for film 
and tv work he says but he no longer wants to call it home i 
did sort of like it 10 years ago when it wasnt as crowded or 
smogfilled he says 
not now and he has found that there is such a thing as too much 
mellow of which there is said to be a lot in hollywood 
in the old days regehr says i could deal with the people 
there the laidbackness now i dont know it just seems too 
relaxed to me 
 
elsewhere in television 
stalins ghost on nbc on dec 31 nbc is airing a onehour 
news special stalins ghost at 10 am est its about the

a peace march by about 3000 european israeli 
and palestinian women ended today in a violent confrontation with 
police after an outlawed palestinian flag was raised in protest 
police said 16 women were detained most of them palestinians 
police sprayed the area with tear gas and reporters saw women 
kicked struck with nightsticks and dragged to police wagons 
one women shouted peace peace peace as police dragged her 
by her hair 
among those detained was dacia valent an italian citizen who is 
a member of the european parliament she was taken into custody 
after protesting the arrests to police 
the womens peace march which wound through city streets from 
jewish west jerusalem to arab east jerusalem was one of several 
major events planned to precede saturdays human chain around 
the old walled city 
police moved in to disperse the demonstrators after a 
palestinian flag was raised in the courtyard of a theater in east 
jerusalem 
it was unclear who raised the flag but palestinian women in the 
courtyard immediately took up chanting israel no plo and 
other antiisraeli slogans 
this morning soldiers set up checkpoints on roads from the west 
bank increasing rally organizers fears that the army intended to 
block palestinians from joining with israelis and the 1200 
europeans in saturdays human chain 
authorities have denied visas barred visits to palestinian 
refugee camps and blocked tour buses from traveling to west bank 
cities 
army spokesmen said the checkpoints were not intended to close 
off the occupied west bank and gaza strip they have refused 
comment on israeli news reports they will do so saturday 
organizers of the 1990 time for peace rally say their goal 
is to foster dialogue between arabs and jews 
we have emphasized that we are here to support the peace 
voices on both sides said chiara ingrao an organizer from the 
italian peace association 
israeli officials said however that they fear the activists 
visit could spark more violence in the 2yearold palestinian 
uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
the army frowns on people trying to make political statements 
especially those who are not citizens of the country in the 
territories said one army official who insisted on anonymity 
the activists vision of peace is at odds with the israeli 
governments view on three points the activists call for 
negotiations with the plo an international middle east peace 
conference and establishment of a palestinian state alongside 
israel 
janet aviad a spokeswoman for the israeli group peace now a 
sponsor of the rally said the government is afraid of european 
pressure and american pressure and this event covered by the press 
has potential for international pressure 
the europeans include about 900 from italy and smaller 
delegations from great britain west germany the netherlands and 
switzerland as well as some palestinianamericans other sponsors 
include groups from italy holland and britain and local 
palestinian activists 
late wednesday night police searched the corridors of the 
europeans headquarters hotel police spokesman avi zelba said the 
searches in principle were not related to their visit but were 
aimed at apprehending a wanted palestinian 
israel radio reported thursday that moslem fundamentalists from 
the islamic jihad group issued threats in sweden and italy for 
people not to participate in a rally that encouraged jewisharab 
cooperation 
however rally organizers issued a statement saying they 
consider the threats untrustworthy and unfounded

bulgarias turkish minority will be 
allowed to adopt the moslem names they were forced to change in an 
often violent campaign starting in the early 1980s a senior 
official announced today 
national assembly chairman stanko todorov stepping out of 
parliament to meet demonstrating turks told the crowd that in 
future everybody in bulgaria will be able to choose his name 
religion and language freely 
there was consensus among the demonstrators and observers that 
the crucial decision was made at a meeting of the central committee 
of bulgarias ruling communist party the communists convened 
earlier in the day to consider growing opposition demands for 
speeding up democratic reforms in the country 
the name change campaign which gathered momentum in 1984 
affected hundreds of thousands of people including pomaks or 
moslem slavs living in southern bulgaria 
meanwhile about 2000 journalists gathered in front of the 
party headquarters demanding freedom of the press 
at that rally a moslem speaker told them that the first birth 
certificate with a moslem name in the past 10 years that of 
1monthold osman bajram husseinov had just been issued by the 
municipal registrars office 
the forced name change and increasing curbs on ethnic and 
religious rights of the 15millionstrong turkish minority earlier 
this year prompted more than 300000 to emigrate to turkey after 
bulgarian authorities gave them passports 
the hastily convened plenary meeting of the central committee 
also planned to discuss further high level cadre changes in the 
party and state hierarchy as well as demands by bulgarian moslems 
for an end to official persecution sources close to the communist 
leadership said 
on thursday about 10000 people rallied in a city park to hear 
leaders of an independent trade union demand a faster pace for 
reform that was promised after hardline communist leader todor 
zhivkov was ousted last month 
political pluralism access to the media and ethnic 
problems are among some of the topics we will raise with the 
authorities at the talks podkrepa head konstantin trenchev told 
the cheering crowd 
at a second rally in sofia thousands of ethnic turks and other 
moslems demonstrated against government persecution and also 
demanded more democracy 
the gatherings came one day after the ruling communist party 
politburo agreed to talks with the opposition beginning wednesday 
podkrepa is one of several opposition groups that has been 
allowed to function publicly since zhivkov was forced from power 
nov 10 the new communist leadership has agreed to pursue reform 
but dissidents say the changes have been slow 
the reform movement gained impetus after police violently broke 
up an oct 26 demonstration called by the environmental group 
ecoglasnost two weeks later hardliner zhivkov was driven from 
power by more reformoriented communists 
ecoglasnost spokesman deyan kyuranov said at the rally that he 
was convinced that pressure from opposition groups was instrumental 
in wednesdays ouster of interior minister georgi tanev 
tanev was fired for ordering the police attack on demonstrators 
kyuranov said the union of democratic forces an umbrella 
organization of opposition groups also would press for the removal 
of sofia mayor stefan ninov whom they also held accountable for 
the crackdown 
kyuranov described the scheduling of talks as a significant 
victory despite the fact that the government was inclined to 
eventually stage such a discussion the threat of a general strike 
by the podkrepa independent trade union forced their hand he 
said 
the unofficial trade union had plans for a general strike 
thursday but called it off to respect the governments goodwill 
after authorities said they would hold talks 
we would like to produce a binding document whose topics would 
include free elections and human rights kyuranov said 
earlier a crowd of more than 5000 turks and pomaks ethnic 
bulgarian moslems marched through the capital chanting 
democracy and we want our names back 
bulgarian communist authorities forced hundreds of thousands of 
pomaks to change their moslem names into bulgariansounding names 
in a campaign that began in 1984 
we also want to know who was responsible for the atrocities 
committed in that campaign according to a demonstrator who 
identified himself only as mehmed 
the mere existence of the demonstrations is evidence of the 
changes in bulgaria where any form of dissent was often brutally 
suppressed all other nations in the soviet alliance have embraced 
reform to varying degrees this year

the justice department acknowledged today it 
failed to follow its own guidelines for considering national 
security problems when it brought drug charges against panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega 
it now appears that there was some rush to draw up the noriega 
indictment and guidelines requiring a review of national security 
implications may not have been completely followed spokesman 
david runkel told reporters 
he added however we believe there is a strong case against 
general noriega and that case can be successfully brought to 
trial 
in making the statement runkel backed away from his assertion 
on tuesday that concerns about the disclosure of state secrets in 
the noriega case have been grossly exaggerated 
he said national security issues in the case are being or will 
soon be reviewed by prosecutors in the case and their departmental 
supervisors 
noriega was ousted as panamas ruler in a us military invasion 
dec 20 but has found shelter at the vaticans embassy in panama 
city a major goal of the operation was to return him to the united 
states for trial on the drug charges 
runkel said the justice department policy that may have been 
overlooked requires that when drawing up indictments on matters 
involving national security those issues be reviewed prior to or 
during the process of drawing up the indictment 
he said such a review would include examination by prosecutors 
of classified documents 
i had been informed that that was the policy that had in 
fact been followed in this case runkel said adding that this 
no longer appeared to be the case 
he declined to elaborate on the nature of the rush to draw 
up the indictment saying i havent determined the reason for 
it 
runkel said the departments decision to review the national 
security issues was an outgrowth of a dec 14 meeting of 
prosecutors in the case with representatives of the drug 
enforcement administration fbi and cia 
he said the meeting was called to discuss drugtrafficking 
indictments returned in 1988 against noriega in miami and tampa 
fla and a decision was made to proceed with the miami case 
the washington post today quoted richard d gregorie who 
directed the federal grand jury investigation in miami that led to 
one of the indictments as saying he was never allowed to review 
all the pertinent cia files on noriega 
runkel said gregories statements were also a factor in the 
justice departments decision to review the matter 
concerns about disclosure of secrets in the noriega case have 
arisen from reports that he worked closely with the cia and the 
pentagon while he served as the head of panamas military 
intelligence service and after he became commanderinchief in 1983

gained a national reputation as a lawandorder hardliner has 
died after suffering a lengthy heart ailment he was 71 
short who served as chief from 1964 to 1973 evoked the ire of 
civil rights leaders in the late 1960s for his handling of racial 
disturbances but supporters said his tough stance in the face of 
rioting prevented houston from faring far worse 
he once was mentioned as a potential running mate for 1968 
conservative presidential candidate george wallace 
short resigned on the eve of the inauguration of former mayor 
fred hofheinz who planned to fire the chief the moment he took 
office

herman that believed in heavyhanded tactics that included the 
use of illegal wiretaps hofheinz said thursday 
wiretapping indictments were returned against officers who had 
served under short but he was never charged with wrongdoing 
certainly we made mistakes as does everyone but i never ruled 
in any way except in accordance with the rules short said five 
years after his retirement

where he had been listed in serious to critical condition since he 
was admitted dec 6 said hospital spokeswoman brenda cook

parliament today crowned the 
nations peaceful revolution by electing playwright and opposition 
leader vaclav havel as czechoslovakias first noncommunist 
president in 41 years 
in an unprecendented public vote that was televised nationwide 
the communistdominated parliament or federal assembly 
unanimously chose havel who was jailed for five years by the 
previous hardline communist leadership for speaking out against 
totalitarianism 
i will not disappoint you but will lead this country to free 
elections havel told hundreds of cheering supporters from a 
balcony of the presidential hradcany castle after his election 
this must happen in a decent and peaceful way so that the 
clean face of our revolution is not sullied it is a task for us 
all 
the election of havel 53 is the crowning achievement of the 
popular revolt that began only 41 days ago it comes amid 
democratic reforms in poland hungary east germany bulgaria and 
romania 
havel and his wife olga then walked across the courtyard from 
the castle to the st vitus cathedral for a special mass of 
thanksgiving given by czechoslovakias 90yearold roman catholic 
prelate cardinal frantisek tomasek 
at the entrance to the gothic cathedral several young girls 
presented havel with bouquets of white lillies 
we came to st vitus to thank god for the great hope that 
has opened before us in the last days of this year tomasek told 
the crowd 
the cathedral filled with antonin dvoraks te deum played by 
the prague philharmonic and choir after the short service 
the lawmakers meeting was opened by alexander dubcek champion 
of the prague spring reforms crushed in 1968 he was returned 
to power thursday when parliament elected him chairman of the body 
dubcek and havel are to serve until free legislative elections 
are held next year 
havel whose works were banned until recent weeks by the 
communists was praised by communist prime minister marian calfa as 
a man who is faithful to his beliefs despite persecution 
he never accepted offers from his friends or recommendations 
by his enemies to emigrate where the conditions of his life would 
have been more comfortable calfa told the deputies in his 
nominating speech 
president bush was among foreign leaders today sending their 
congratulations to havel he pledged us support for the rebirth 
of democracy in czechoslovakia and the white house said his 
election marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in 
eastern europe 
in warsaw poland solidarity leader lech walesa welcomed with 
great joy havels election and wished him strength in carrying 
out his new responsibilities 
in a scene unimaginable only a few weeks ago havel walked with 
dubcek up the red carpeted aisle of the castle hall to the flourish 
of a military band the applause of communist deputies and the 
flashes of camera bulbs 
he signed the oath of office under the draped red white and 
blue flag of czechoslovakia 
as the band played the national anthem 20 cannon salvos 
resounded throughout the city 
within the next few months parliament is expected to pass new 
laws guaranteeing freedom of expression and religion and the right 
of assembly and petition reforms already are being carried out for 
a freemarket economy 
havel helped form the opposition group civic forum on nov 20 
three days after a police crackdown on a peaceful student protest 
for democratic reforms 
within weeks of the creation of civic forum communists leaders 
voted themselves out of power and miroslav stepan considered 
reponsible for the police crackdown was under arrest facing 
charges that could bring him up to 10 years in jail 
havel already respected for his battle for human rights 
overnight became the most popular man in czechoslovakia 
havel for president buttons appeared on lapels and campaign 
posters covered every wall in central prague 
he has said he would be a working president to guide the 
country to democratic elections 
after the elections parliament will choose a new president for 
a full fiveyear term havel has said hes not interested in that 
job and wants to go back to writing 
the presidents duties are largely ceremonial but the position 
holds great symbolic importance especially now 
dubcek endured 20 years of humiliation at the hands of hardline 
communists who ousted him as party leader and banished him for 
trying to increase freedom with the prague spring reforms 
which were crushed by a sovietled invasion 
the prague spring involved economic reform and 
decentralizing control the idea was proposed nearly 20 years later 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and reform began sweeping 
one country after another in eastern europe last fall

the usfunded voice of america and 
radio free europe played a key part in preparing romanians for 
their revolt by informing them of the changes elsewhere in eastern 
europe bucharest residents say 
rfes broadcasts in romanian from munich and voas from 
washington have a big following among romanias 23 million people 
who have had a severely restricted access to western media 
media in neighboring hungary yugoslavia bulgaria and the 
soviet union also helped keep romanians abreast of warsaw pact 
change 
clusters of romanians formed every time bulgarian staterun 
balkan airlines posted the bulgarian tv schedule in its bucharest 
office and aeroflot used to display mikhail s gorbachevs latest 
pronouncements in romanian in its windows 
but east european and soviet broadcasts often could be received 
and understood only on the peripheries of the country and rarely 
carried romanian emigre or dissident views 
romanians say voa and rfe kept them abreast of news about their 
own country such as a significant letter last spring to nicolae 
ceausescu in which six former communist party officials demanded 
major changes and were arrested because of it 
we owe thanks to the united states for the help of the voa and 
radio free europe said a staffer at bucharests main childrens 
hospital many people were listening to voa and rfe 
through rfe a western diplomat said romanians with little 
experience of democracy know its terms and progress through the 
rest of eastern europe 
theyve never done it themselves but they are aware said 
the diplomat speaking on condition he not be identified 
under ceausescu romanian tv broadcast only two hours a night 
and up to 90 minutes of that time was devoted to the president and 
his deeds 
radio gave a diet of similar news and virtually the only item 
anybody read in the newspapers were the meager sports report and 
the weather 
radio and television which were captured by the revolutionaries 
who forced ceausescu from power a week ago have become beacons of 
the revolt spreading vital news through the country 
even now however the dissenting voices who have united against 
ceausescu can still communicate with each other and with the 
country most effectively through rfe 
dissidents like doina cornea a former university professor in 
cluj placed under house arrest for her critical letters to 
ceausescu poet mircea dinescu in bucharest and writer dan 
petruescu in iasi were unable to meet under ceausescus 
totalitarian rule they met on rfe a bucharest resident said 
other still powerful remnants of totalitarianism enhance the 
continued importance of the usfunded radio stations which can 
draw on the expertise of many wellinformed romanian exiles 
two years ago for instance ceausescus wife elena ordered 
all western news agencies into romania cut on grounds they were 
not needed delivery has not been restored 
thus voa and rfe are still a primary source of information for 
romanians eager to know how their revolution is perceived in the 
west 
voa is the most important broadcast resident valentin 
hornicar said outside communist party headquarters thursday 
not only food and medicine are needed said hornicar 26 
we need magazines and newspapers from all over the united states 
and all over europe we need to see what is being said about us

the winner of floridas record 55 million 
lottery prize has gone to the aid of a beleaguered family by making 
a 10000 donation for a 13yearold girl who needs a kidney 
transplant 
lottery winner sheelah ryan who established a foundation to 
help the needy said thursday she hoped the money would prompt 
others to help the family of bob and donna armstrong whose other 
daughter was kidnapped and killed in a stillunsolved case 
christina armstrong 13 suffers from alports syndrome an 
incurable hereditary disease and is undergoing kidney dialysis 
while awaiting a suitable transplant the armstrongs expect to 
incur bills totaling 100000 
their 6yearold daughter regina mae disappeared from in front 
of the family home more than four years ago the girls skull was 
discovered in a rural area but police have never found her killer 
i feel very strong that this family has suffered enough ms 
ryan said and the foundation cares very deeply about helping 
children 
the foundation has pledged money to a number of causes 
including 1000 to college students trying to find homes for stray 
cats and 500 to a high school student who found and returned a 
100000 check 
the girls father bob armstrong recalled wednesday that he 
used to deliver salt for ms ryans water softener about five years 
ago when she was a real estate saleswoman living in a mobile home 
ms ryan won the big prize in 1988 but continues to work in 
real estate and lives quietly 
im sure she wouldnt remember me armstrong said after 
hearing of the donation i was just a longhaired bearded thing 
who was always sweating from hauling around heavy equipment this 
is one heck of a coincidence 
ms ryan did not remember him but she remembered the story of 
regina maes disappearance 
she got approval from a majority of the ryan foundations board 
of directors to donate 5000 then decided to give 5000 of her 
own money 
the people of central florida have been very good about 
contributing to the poor and the homeless but maybe we can start 
something off to get them to contribute here ms ryan said 
this family has had enough

no flags flutter from the hovels of 
cornesti and not one house has been scarred by bullets but the 
revolt has unleashed hopes in this peasant village that are as 
fervent as any in bucharest 
we want to live just like anybody else in a free capitalist 
society laszlo kiss said 
kisss daughter tuende said she already is making plans to run 
her own shop an unheard of activity under executed dictator 
nicolae ceausescu who allowed no private entrepreneurship during 
his 24 years of communist rule 
then she said with a dreamy smile i want to see the 
world 
for ion ardilian kisss neighbor the revolt that brought 
promises of democracy has opened the door to the possiblity of 
working as hard as i want and owning as much property as i can 
afford 
the village of 600 people is less than five miles from 
timisoara the nations fourthlargest city where a small crowd 
protecting a defiant protestant pastor dec 15 sparked nationwide 
unrest that ended the ceausescu era 
to the outsider it seems another world reachable only by a 
dirt road pitted with deep potholes 
the village of small houses showed no sign on a recent afternoon 
of the historic events of the past two weeks the main dirt road 
was nearly deserted 
but villagers said the revolution has inspired in them the same 
pride and joy as those of their urban countrymen and while 
acknowledging that cornesti appears the same in many ways as before 
the revolution kiss and others said change was coming 
the same people are sitting in the village council chairs as 
before but theyre just keeping the seats warm until new people 
are chosen kiss 47 said were not interfering were happy 
to let things take their course 
the village leadership became communist party members just to 
be able to oppress us added ardilian 32 whenever someone did 
something they didnt like they bought in the militia to get their 
own way but were not seeking revenge were content to wait 
the status of approximately 30 informers until recently in the 
pay of ceausescus infamous securitate secret police also remains 
the same 
nobody had anything to do with them before nobody has 
anything to do with them now said kiss relatives gathered in 
the familys cold and modest sitting room where a bedcouch piled 
high with thick quilts competed for space with a kitchen table and 
chairs 
kiss a farm laborer with a small plot of land and some sheep of 
his own painted a dismal picture of life in cornesti under 
ceausescu 
as a villager you never went to any functionary whether in 
the city or here without eggs meat or other gifts he said 
if you didnt bribe them you accomplished nothing 
i once had a herd of 100 sheep but was forced to sell most of 
them to the state he said when i refused i was labeled an 
antisocialist element and threatened by the securitate 
the familys life was further complicated by their religious 
beliefs as seventh day adventists outside the mainstream orthodox 
catholic church controlled by the state they faced hurdles at 
school and the workplace 
my two sons and daughter werent allowed to complete high 
school and the boys were forced to find work as manual laborers 
he said 
there were no battles in cornesti of the kind in the major 
cities that pitted the army and civilan revolutionaries against 
diehard securitate agents 
they offered their services anyway 
we were told that civilians were not needed and the army 
could mop up the terrorists alone said kiss but decades of 
oppression have made us alert 
were ready to fight and to die if necessary to prevent a 
return to dictatorship

the muchcriticized custom in which senior 
members of congress may pocket leftover campaign funds when they 
retire or suffer defeat at the polls is targeted for repeal under 
newly minted ethics legislation 
but this wouldnt take effect until 1993 as lawmakers are 
reluctant to slam the door too quickly thus they are giving 
themselves a chance to run for one more term and then retire with 
the funds 
i think there are some members who will take advantage of 
it says rep al swift dwash an advocate of abolishing the 
practice but i dont think youre talking about a massive 
movement i would be surprised if it were more than you could count 
on one hand 
i have something in the vicinity of 200 grand in my campaign 
fund and i have no intention whatever of retiring he says 
under a bill approved before congress adjourned for the 
holidays lawmakers raised their pay from the current level 89500 
for both houses to 96600 for house members next year and 124400 
in 1991 senate pay would rise to 98400 in 1990 and 101400 the 
year thereafter 
to propel the politically touchy pay package lawmakers attached 
an array of ethics features including repeal in 1993 of the right 
of departing senior house members to convert leftover campaign 
funds to their personal use 
federal law already had barred defeated or retiring members of 
congress from carting off surplus political money but that 
prohibition contained a gaping loophole a grandfather clause 
that exempted lawmakers who were on capitol hill before 1980 
the pay and ethics package already signed into law by president 
bush would repeal the grandfather clause but it would take 
three years to do so thus providing maneuvering room to lawmakers 
who are planning a retirement and counting on a comfortable nest 
egg of campaign cash 
lawmakers whose right to convert surplus funds had been 
grandfathered in now can take the money only if they retire 
before the start of the 103rd congress in january 1993 
this is a very major step says susan manes vice president 
for issues of common cause the citizens lobby for too long the 
grandfather clause has allowed certain members of congress to take 
their political money with them when they leave 
in effect this allowed special interests to channel money to 
sitting members of congress which they in turn can use when they 
retire she said 
the measure also limits the amount they may take with them to 
the balance in their campaign fund as of the date of enactment 
nov 30 
it applies to senators as well as house members but the senate 
already had a rule barring members retiring or otherwise from 
converting campaign funds it might be difficult to enforce the 
rule against a former lawmaker but the senate ethics committee 
says it has never known one to violate it 
house members have not been bashful about converting the funds 
a january 1988 study by congressional quarterly said 
grandfathered lawmakers had converted at least 862000 since 
1980 the ralph nader group congress watch estimated that the total 
potential hidden pension accumulated by these lawmakers totaled 
39 million 
the capitol hill newspaper roll call in october counted 186 
sitting lawmakers covered by the grandfather clause including some 
seniorityheavy powers in the house with huge cash reserves in 
their funds rep stephen solarz dny and house ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill were first and second 
respectively both topping 1 million 
house speaker thomas foley dwash had 639513 
stories of lawmakers who have departed with campaign cash in 
hand abound in the house former rep gene taylor dmo in what 
some call the largest conversion in memory disbursed 345000 to 
himself from his campaign fund early this year 
and rep john j duncan rtenn died of cancer in june 1988 
bequeathing his 604521 campaign fund to his wife and four 
children 
after voters rejected former banking committee chairman fernand 
j st germain dri last november he told reporters he probably 
would use his leftover campaign dollars for charitable and 
political purposes 
thus far the largest outlay has been 67500 to the washington 
law firm of arent fox kintner plotkin amp kahn which represented 
him over the last few years while his dealings with savings and 
loan and other lobbyists were under investigation at the justice 
department 
they were legal fees for the overall inquiries says the 
silverhaired 61yearold democrat whom the department eventually 
declined to prosecute he is now practicing law and doing a very 
little lobbying 
actually st germains action might just remain legal after the 
grandfather clause is repealed once and for all the house 
committee on standards of official conduct has ruled more than once 
that paying lawyers to keep congressmen out of jail is a legitimate 
political expense 
reached at his washington office recently st germain indicated 
that the issue was less than fascinating to him frankly he 
said im not in congress anymore im busy in other areas and i 
leave these questions to sitting members of congress

associates of frank lloyd wright have 
asked marin county officials to redesign a proposed 23 million 
jail rather than denigrate the memory of the renowned architect 
the twostory jail with up to 219 cells would be built in 
front of one of wrights most famous works the marin county civic 
center whose pale pink arches sweep across three small knolls 
along busy us highway 101 
the center is the only government building designed by wright 
that actually was built 
william wesley peters senior architect and chairman of the 
board of trustees of the frank lloyd wright foundation and san 
francisco architect aaron green who worked closely with wright 
wrote to the county board of supervisors last week saying they 
were appalled by the jail design they asked that it be redone to 
harmonize with the wrights building 
the rectangular jail would stand 24 feet high and would obscure 
much of the view of the civic center 
the project is callously different from the soft and graceful 
lines of frank lloyd wrights hall of justice and administration 
building and would be the antithesis of what frank lloyd wright 
had so creatively conceived green wrote 
peters told supervisors the project would seriously denigrate 
frank lloyd wrights legacy to marin county to california and to 
the world 
but county supervisors who are under court order to relieve 
jail crowding say it is unlikely the design will be significantly 
changed 
we just dont have time said supervisor al aramburu its 
the best we could do given the site 
construction must begin by next fall so the county can qualify 
for state money for the project 
if the board is to stop this its members should be thrown in 
jail it would be criminal to lose the state bond money said 
robert stockwell president of the board

the countrys main 
antiapartheid alliance said friday it was entering 1990 with 
confidence that victory for democracy is in sight 
the united democratic front and the mass democratic movement 
two overlapping coalitions of opposition groups said in a new 
years message that government efforts at repression during the 
1980s had failed quell black resistance 
despite a determined state assault on progressive peoples 
organizations the state of emergency imposed in 1986 failed 
miserably in its desire to submit us further to the will of the 
minority the statement said 
it said 1990 would be a pivotal year bringing the expected 
release of jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
and the possibility of negotiations on a postapartheid political 
structure 
what we will all be doing from both government and liberation 
movement sides will determine whether south africa goes through 
the path of a bloodbath or takes the high road of a less violent 
transition to a nonracial and democratic south africa the 
statement said we enter the 1990s with the hope and confidence 
that victory for democracy in our country is in sight 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp in a yearend 
commentary friday said the face of south africa has changed 
dramatically and irrevocably in the 1980s because of moves away 
from racial discrimination and toward limited political 
powersharing 
ahead lies the further broadening of democracy with the 
extension of the principle of power sharing at all levels of 
government to black south africans the commentary said how to 
achieve that in a manner fair and equitable to all is the 
challenge that awaits the leadership of all political 
constituencies in the 1990s 
the antiapartheid democratic party which won 20 percent of the 
vote in white parliamentary elections in september commended 
president fw de klerk for his performance since the election 
the democrats three coleaders praised de klerk for freeing 
several prominent political prisoners reducing the duration of 
mandatory military service and abolishing segregated beaches but 
they said de klerk and his national party remained wedded to the 
concept of racial groups as the foundation of future political 
system 
we need to introduce into our society the principles of equal 
and equivalent franchise for all adults the democrats leaders 
said anything short of a full democracy is a threat to our safe 
future

when three men agreed to murder a united mine 
workers opposition leader and his family in 1969 they were told 
the killings would amount to nothing more than local news in 
the coal fields of western pennsylvania 
but in the two decades since the new years eve slayings of 
joseph a jock yablonski 59 his wife margaret 57 and their 
daughter charlotte 25 have been a catalyst for major reform in 
the coal miners union 
and the local news made national headlines 
basically all the things my father had said should be done 
have been done said kenneth yablonski now 55 who found the 
bodies in the familys stone farmhouse in clarksville almost a week 
after the killings 
in the months leading up to his death yablonski had waged an 
unsuccessful campaign to unseat umw president wa tony boyle 
he accused boyle of corruption nepotism and misuse of umw funds 
yablonski also pushed for increased rights for rankandfile 
members in electing district officers and fought to clean up union 
elections 
all of those things were accomplished said his son an 
attorney in nearby washington pa in the total picture because 
of what happened i dont think anyone would say the united mine 
workers is corrupt or its officers are totalitarian 
throughout the 1969 campaign yablonski endured intimidation 
from boyle supporters until his death he was suspicious of 
strangers who approached him or his family and with good reason 
about two weeks before the murders two of the gunmen had gone 
to yablonskis rural washington county house ostensibly asking for 
help in getting mining jobs but paul e gilly and claude e vealey 
lost their nerve and did not shoot yablonski that day 
that evening yablonski told his son ken i believe there 
were two men here to kill me today 
despite his defeat in the dec 9 1969 election yablonski had 
remained a vocal opponent of boyle and had asked the us labor 
department to investigate possible voter fraud 
boyle saw himself as the hardline heir to longtime umw boss 
john l lewis but couldnt match lewis charisma said james a 
craft a business administration professor at the university of 
pittsburgh at the same time yablonski was attempting to bring 
about reforms 
it was one of those kind of events that provided us with real 
change craft said yablonski wanted to make some changes and 
open things up and boyle wanted to maintain control and it 
exploded in terms of something terrible happening 
confessions and testimony revealed that boyle ordered the 
killings and other union officials embezzled umw funds to hire the 
gunmen 
in all nine people including boyle were convicted the three 
gunmen gilly vealey and aubran w buddy martin all of ohio

with organizers of the miss russianamerican pageant by assuring 
them that peoria would still like to be a host city for the event 
maloof said thursday he called the prime organizer vera von 
wiren garczynski in new york to explain why he didnt plug the 
pageant more in a national television appearance after the 
slavicamerican cultural association announced it would hold the 
us portion of the pageant in peoria 
maloof said he explained to garczynski that he wasnt given 
enough time by producers of the cbs morning news to talk about 
the pageant 
garczynski told the peoria journal star that members of the 
association and soviet officials were upset by maloofs brief 
remarks on the show and that peoria officials seemed more 
interested in shortterm publicity than in the event itself 
that explanation is fine garczynski said i dont want 
any fights one does not need any sensational controversy here 
promoters are hailing the pageant as a symbol of the new harmony 
between the united states and the soviet union the pageant will 
consist of two contests one for american women in peoria and 
another for soviet women in moscow

north korea has called home its 
ambassadors from its communist allies for an emergency meeting 
apparently because of the changes in eastern europe a south korean 
government official said thursday 
north korea appeared to have convened a meeting of its 
ambassadors to 30 countries including china and the soviet union 
one month ahead of schedule to discuss the radical liberalization 
in many of its allies said south korean unification minister lee 
hongku 
the korea times quoted a south korean government source as 
saying there is a high probability that the north will seek 
gradual openness to escape from political isolation and to 
boost the economy 
on tuesday north korean president kim il sung who has built up 
a massive personality cult in his four decades of hardline rule 
recognized the new romanian government 
north korea has called for the communist countries to increase 
vigilance against imperialist efforts to undermine socialism 
rodong shinmun the official newspaper of north koreas 
communist party urged intensifying revolutionary education in 
the country in the face of the ever more malicious antisocialist 
moves of the imperialists 
all people should be encouraged to establish a correct outlook 
by carrying into effect the idea and intentions of the party and 
the leader deeply trusting them as the mainstay said the 
papers editorial carried by pyongyangs official korean central 
news agency monitored in tokyo 
in our country today the superiority of socialism is fully 
displayed the entire people are closely united behind the party 
and the leader and a healthy revolutionary trait is pervading the 
whole society it said 
but it added the imperialists are craftily maneuvering to 
break the peoples conviction of socialism and undermine socialism 
from within 
under these conditions the editorial added only when 
revolutionary education is intensified is it possible to enhance 
the antiimperialist revolutionary spirit and class consciousness 
of the people still further and prevent the infiltration of the 
corrupt bourgeois ideology and mode of life 
the official news agency also said kims message to new romanian 
leader ion iliescu expressed hope for strengthening friendly and 
cooperative relations and wished the romanian people success

syria is believed to be seeking north 
koreas help in acquiring new surfacetosurface missiles after the 
united states pressured china to cancel a reported deal israeli 
military sources said friday 
the sources also said north korea and egypt have begun a project 
to develop missiles patterned after sovietdesigned scud missiles 
the revelation by the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity comes at a time of mounting concern in israel about an 
intensified missile race in the middle east 
fears intensified following iraqs dec 7 launching of the abed 
a 48ton threestage ballistic missile that baghdad claimed was 
capable of putting satellites into space 
north korea has a welldeveloped arms industry and the israeli 
sources said it had supplied iran with sovietdesigned scud 
surfacetosurface missiles during tehrans war with iraq 
the military sources said part of the egyptiannorth korean 
missile project was being developed in egypt 
aharon levran a retired brigadier general and an independent 
military analyst said egypt had an arsenal of aging scud missiles 
provided by the soviet union and had apparently turned to north 
korea last year for help in modernizing them 
its not known exactly what sort of help the north koreans can 
provide whether it is just to renew the old soviet missiles and 
provide spare parts or maybe install improved components such as 
guidance he said 
he also said published reports indicated north korea was helping 
iran develop its own surfacetosurface missile and was training 
pilots for the tehran regime 
the scudb which has a range of 180 miles and poor accuracy 
was introduced into the middle east in the early 1970s 
cairo apparently dropped out of a project with argentina and 
iraq t develop a more accurate missile called the condor 2 or badr 
2000 the missile was intended to have a range of about 540 miles 
and better accuracy than the scud 
egypts withdrawal followed political pressure brought by 
washington after the arrest of two egyptian colonels who were 
accused of trying to smuggle technology out of the united states 
that could be used to improve missile accuracy 
president bush sent national security adviser brent scowcroft to 
beijing this month to urge the chinese to cancel a planned sale to 
syria of m9 surfacetosurface missiles which have a range of 370 
miles and would be capable of hitting targets deep inside israel 
the jerusalem post reported syria signed an agreement with china 
for 140 m9 missiles at a cost of 170 million 
israeli officials have said israel was informed that china had 
pledged to refrain from such sales although some doubts still 
existed about whether china would go through with the sale 
officials in beijing have denied any sale was in the works 
syria has soviet ss21 missiles capable of hitting northern 
israel and scudb missiles 
levran said the syrians would likely be interested in north 
korean help only if they could improve the range and accuracy of 
the scuds unlike the egyptians he noted syria has close ties 
with the soviet union and would likely be able to get replacement 
missiles without the need for renovation

former panamanian strongman gen manuel 
noriega was tipped off two days in advance of the united states 
plans to invade his country bush administration sources say in a 
published report 
sources were divided on exactly how and when the former 
strongman who managed to evade the us military and later sought 
refuge in the vatican embassy was warned 
but one source told the washington times there is hard 
evidence the tipoff came in the form of a telephone call to 
panama from the state department about 48 hours before the military 
operation was launched at 1 am dec 20 
the call was intercepted by a national security agency listening 
post near panama city sources said 
there was a leak tipping noriega before it was coming one 
government official said we dont know who it was but we 
believed it was somebody at state 
pentagon spokesman bob taylor denied noriega was warned saying 
we dont have any indication at this time that there was a major 
opsec operational security problem 
taylor said a captured noriega bodyguard told us interrogators 
the panamanian leader was informed of the military action about 
three hours before it happened but refused to believe the 
information 
in corpus christi texas where president bush was vacationing 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he had no information 
to give out on the report in any event fitzwater said its 
history now 
according to the newspaper administration sources said some 
noriega forces and the general himself knew in advance about the 
operation dubbed operation just cause the sources based their 
assessment in part on four incidents 
the night before the military intervention cuban mig21s 
shadowed c141 starlifters carrying us army paratroopers from 
pope air force base nc to panama the sources said the 
pentagon is investigating whether one of the cuban planes may have 
fired its cannon as a warning shot noriega with his relationship 
with the united states crumbling in recent years had increasingly 
turned to cuba for military and intelligence support according to 
administration sources 
noriega intensified his nocturnal activities two days before 
the us assault and the pentagon has indications he visited 
the cuban embassy at one point the night of dec 1920 but left 
when us troops surrounded the compound sources said 
panamanian defense forces appeared to be lying in wait and 
opened fire on navy seal or seaairland commandoes who 
parachuted into the area of panamas small paitilla airport where 
the deposed leader maintained his private jet the pentagon said 
four seal members were killed 
noriegas most elite jungle warfare unit had vanished from its 
battalions facility when us troops arrived to attack 
the deposed noriega today remained holed up in the vatican 
embassy in panama city where he sought asylum on christmas eve 
a panamanian official said new president guillermo endaras 
government sent a letter to the vatican asking that noriega be 
expelled 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he did 
not know whether the government asked that noriega be turned over 
to us authorities or to panama 
in texas where president bush was hunting white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated the us stance that noriega 
should be handed over to the united states to stand trial on drug 
trafficking charges 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said in rome that officials 
still hoped to resolve the crisis within days but he gave no 
details

the navy is proposing to put two of its four 
battleships in mothballs and limit purchases of the 12 billion 
trident submarine to every other year a senior pentagon official 
says 
but the service studying proposals for the new fiscalyear 
budget is fighting to spare at least 14 aircraft carriers from 
white house pressures to trim the militarys most favored weapons 
programs 
president bush who is slated to deliver his budget to congress 
on jan 22 may be called upon to make the final decisions on any 
suggested cuts given their controversial nature 
were robbing peter to pay paul the pentagon official said 
of the current budgetjuggling exercise he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the fiscal 1991 spending plan will be a key barometer of the 
pentagons ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters on 
capitol hill and in the office of management and budget 
white house budget planners have told defense secretary dick 
cheney he can spend a little more than 292 billion in the new 
budget year which begins next oct 1 that means pentagon spending 
wont keep pace with inflation which the administration has 
projected will increase at an average rate of 41 percent 
the navy like other services is being forced to trim programs 
it holds to be successful such as the trident in order to meet 
these goals said the senior official 
the official said the service is seriously considering 
stretching out the annual purchases of the strategic trident subs 
to every other year 
the subs billiondollar price tag has made it easy prey for 
lawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclear 
weapons programs amid the warming of relations with the soviet 
union 
in november the electric boat division of general dynamics 
corp in groton conn won a contract to build the 17th trident 
submarine 
but due to its high cost and complexity funds for the submarine 
are stretched out over several years 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii has told rep john g 
rowland rconn that he expects to request full funding for the 
18th trident submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget 
but the letter made no mention about longterm procurement funds 
for additional submarines 
id put my money on some type of stretchout said another 
defense department official asked about the future of the trident 
program 
the official said it was premature to talk about an end to 
the program and said that if an everyotheryear purchase policy 
is finally adopted it may not even compromise the longterm 
number of submarines widely exepted to be 24 
the services world war iiera battleships also have become 
targets of budget cutters on capitol hill particularly in the 
aftermath of last springs explosion aboard the uss iowa which 
claimed 47 sailors lives the tragedy spawned a series of 
congressional hearings where lawmakers voiced sharp criticism of 
the huge ships safety procedures and personnel practices 
even the chief of naval operations adm carlisle a trost 
admitted at one hearing that the future of the four warships was 
up for grabs in the budget debate but the navy leadership is 
loathe to let the warships go the senior official said 
nobody not the army not the marine corps not the navy 
wants to give those ships up the official contended arguing 
that their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a president 
calls for a little gunship diplomacy 
the 91 budget plan calls for putting two in mothballs but 
wed still have two and we want to hang on to those he said 
the official argued against putting all four 58000ton vessels 
in mothballs again citing the high costs and problems that arose 
during their remodernization in the early 1980s 
the navy was forced to call up old retired sailors to help 
in the rebuilding of the ships the official said 
when it came to taking the propellers off the darn things 
there was only one retired chief petty officer who knew how to do 
it and you had to use special explosive charges to do it the 
official said 
the second dod official noted that congressional pressure may 
work against mothballing the battleships since their home ports 
were to be dispersed among four states under a revised program 
our phones rang off the hook from lawmakers unhappy about 
trosts suggestion of the ships possible demise the official said 
the senior official said that the navy is fighting to save at 
least 14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year 
one carrier the world war iiera midway is scheduled for 
retirement next year which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14 
tell me which commitment are we supposed to walk away from 
the official asked pointing out that the us commitment to sail 
the indian ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive persian 
gulf havent changed 
the official also said the requirements of the navy most 
probably will increase as the service is asked to place more power 
on the high seas to advance the nations war against illicit 
narcotics traffickers

decembers record deep freeze has easterners 
and midwesterners clogging phone lines at desert resorts and 
universal studios as they seek escape in the southern california 
sun 
we have an 800 number to call for information about palm 
springs and its been ringing off the hook and most of the calls 
have been from back east said carolyn patten of the palm springs 
city tourism office 
they want to know can we get some sun they are so tired of 
the snow i dont know how theyre going to feel in march but they 
hate it now patten said thursday 
its too early to cite statistics but a survey of resort hotels 
in the coachella valley surrounding palm springs indicated this 
winter tourist season looks like a scorcher with a hot streak of 
early bookings 
the phones are just going crazy on us said jim lopez 
marketing director at the 860room marriott desert springs resort 
in palm desert weve seen an increase in reservations within a 
twoweek time period and i think thats because its been pretty 
darn cold around the country 
typical high temperatures last weekend were 12 in detroit 14 in 
indianapolis 44 in miami beach and 37 in orlando fla 
it was 82 in palm springs part of unseasonably warm weather in 
what forecasters say may be the driest december since 1876 
since then things have averaged out again with temperatures in 
both florida and southern california running in the 60s and 70s 
but the earlier news of the big chill that extended into florida 
had its effect 
some of the people coming from back east this year have 
remarked they were coming here instead of florida because the 
weather is better said ken irwin at la mancha private villas 
where amenities such as private swimming pools and tennis courts 
come at a price tag of up to 895 a night 
overall southern california tourism has been slowing despite an 
increase in foreign visitors said jack kyser chief economist for 
the greater los angeles chamber of commerce 
americans are traveling less because of fears of a weaker 
economy higher air fares and there is a lingering fear of 
earthquakes kyser said 
but at the universal studios tour where a fake quake is a 
popular ride the flood of calls has been greater than usual this 
postchristmas season said spokesman jim yeager 
the tour guide person says the last two to three days the line 
has been ringing off the hook with people from the east coast 
yeager said 
we are getting a lot of calls coming in and the first question 
asked is what is the weather said rolfe g arnhym executive 
vice president of the palm springs chamber of commerce 
all that interest could disappear he points out with just one 
cold snap or a few stories about desert storms 
weve had situations where the weather has done a 180 on us 
and our tourists have scampered off elsewhere

a chevron tanker pulled alongside a sinking 
freighter today that 28 crewmen were fighting to keep afloat in the 
north pacific 
the tanker delivered additional pumps to reverse the flow of 
water into two of the bulkas cargo holds and stood by 800 miles 
northeast of oahu to rescue the 600foot scrapmetal carriers crew 
if necessary coast guard spokesman keith spangler said 
spangler said the greek officers and philippine crew were out of 
danger unless the ship sank rapidly 
it seems to us they still have a chance to save the ship 
spangler said its just a waitandsee game to see if the pumps 
will do it 
one of the cargo holds was flooded and a second was filling 
rapidly said air force sgt neil anderson of the joint rescue 
coordination center in honolulu the cause of the leak was unknown 
the vessel is bowed down and listing slighting toward 
starboard anderson said as it lists more as it fills up the 
crew probably will have to abandon ship 
spangler said the ship was listing 6 degrees to starboard and 
was down 15 feet at its bow 
anderson said the vessel was owned by a greek shipping company 
based in athens bacolitsas and sons but did not know if the ship 
was registered there he said the ship was bound for either north 
or south korea and was carrying scrap metal but didnt know the 
tonnage 
the tanker chevron colorado was diverted to the foundering 
vessel and passed three pumps to the bulka this morning hubbard 
said the coast guard cutter sassafras was expected to reach the 
area saturday 
the crew equipped with life vests and life rafts was prepared 
to abandon ship if the pumping failed hubbard said 
winds in the area were 10 to 15 mph and seas were running about 
six feet according to roy matsuda marine forecaster at the 
national weather service office in honolulu 
a coast guard c130 search and rescue airplane was on the scene 
and in radio contact with the bulka hubbard said

mississippi catfish farmers may have 
lost up to onefifth of an average monthly harvest because last 
weeks big chill froze fish ponds solid industry officials say 
in georgia state biologists fear that recent freezing coastal 
temperatures will mean no chance for a healthy shrimp season next 
year more bad news for a shrimping industry already reeling from 
a poor fall crop and low prices 
most of the deltas catfish processing plants reopened friday 
after cold weather forced them to close for about a week 
mississippi processes about 7 million pounds of catfish weekly or 
about 80 percent of the catfish consumed in the united states 
from 26 million to 30 million pounds of catfish may have been 
lost said hugh warren executive vice president of the catfish 
farmers of america a trade association industry officials said it 
will be at least another week before farmers know the full impact 
of the freeze thawing ponds are just beginning to reveal dead fish 
more than 2700 workers at the states largest catfish 
processing plants have been off their jobs he said 
farmers have suffered losses as high as 20 percent when ponds 
have frozen previously said dick stevens president of country 
skillet processing co country skillet and delta pride processors 
two of the industrys largest companies process about 60 percent 
of the nations farmraised catfish 
the economic impact is very high said delta pride president 
sam i hinote 
ponds froze last weekend some with 6 inches of ice when 
temperatures dipped into the single digits when ponds freeze 
ammonia builds up and oxygen supplies dwindle killing fish 
delta prides two processing plants in indianola and one in 
belzoni shut down tuesday officials at country skillet said they 
halted operations at one plant and cut back operations at the other 
georgia department of natural resource officials meanwhile 
began sampling waters in the brunswick area thursday and are 
expecting test trawls to net more dead shrimp than live shrimp as 
they move up the coast this weekend 
the news comes a week after the department announced that the 
winter shrimping season which normally ends dec 31 would be 
extended at least into january because of a bountiful shrimp 
supply biologist gordon rogers said if last weekends freeze did 
the damage the department suspects officials could rescind that 
announcement next week 
at worst it is our suspicion that there are no shrimp to be 
worrying about catching rogers said adding that the states 
prime white roe shrimp crop could be reduced for up to 18 months 
white shrimp which are caught in the spring fall and winter 
annually account for 80 to 90 percent of the georgia crop brown 
shrimp harvested in the summer bring in 10 to 20 percent of the 
annual crop

the white house today sought to 
make peace with the vatican asserting the roman catholic church 
was doing a fine job in its deliberations over the fate of 
deposed panamanian leader manuel antnio noriega 
it also said talks with church officials continue in a 
positive vein and that no deadline had been set for resolving a 
deadlock over noriegas refuge in the vaticans embassy in panama 
city 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater brushed aside the 
vaticans assertion that it had no obligation to turn over this 
man to an occupying force and instead lavished praise on papal 
authorities 
its a very difficult situation very tense circumstances 
they are managing a difficult situation fitzwater told reporters 
as president bush continued to enjoy a hunting vacation on a ranch 
near the south texas community of beeville 
the spokesmans remarks were in contrast to earlier more 
assertive white house statements suggesting the united states was 
forcefully pressing for noriegas return to stand trial on 
drugtrafficking charges in this country 
while fitzwater was softpedaling usvatican tensions state 
department deputy spokesman richard boucher in washington took 
issue with a church spokesmans description of the united states as 
an occupying power 
we are down there with the consent of the government of 
panama the legitimately elected leaders of panama that means 
were not an occupying power boucher said 
on another subject fitzwater said he had no information to 
impart on a report in todays editions of the washington times that 
noreiga had been tipped off 48 hours in advance of last wednesdays 
us invasion however the spokesman said he had an extensive 
intelligence operation 
in any event fitzwater said its history now 
apparently attempting to sooth increasingly harsh exchanges 
between the united states and the vatican over noriega fitzwater 
told reporters i think the vatican is doing a fine job we 
appreciate their efforts 
the vatican had flatly said it would not turn over noriega 
holed up in the vatican embassy since christmas eve to the united 
states 
in a written statement today the white house said our 
discussions with vatican officials continue in a positive vein we 
appreciate the papal nuncios efforts to resolve the current 
situation we remain hopeful for a resolution of the problem and 
there are no fixed deadlines to be met 
fitzwater said he did not know if us troops ringing the 
vatican embassy would now stop bombarding the building with 
nerverattling rock music 
but he said the administration clearly did not want to encourage 
or aggravate any further confrontation with the vatican 
this matter has to play out he said we cant predict how 
long it will take well just go calmly along 
fitzwater had said thursday it was up to vatican officials to 
break the stalemate over noriegas fate and we leave it to them 
to work this out as they see fit 
fitzwater today made it clear the white house was attempting to 
seek to play down the entire matter theres just not much that 
we can say or want to say while this is going on he said 
in fact even getting information from bush and secretary of 
state james baker iii from the secluded ranch about 60 miles 
northwest of here was proving to be a chore for fitzwater 
i called this morning for a report but they were out 
hunting he confessed 
bush planned to head later today for his adopted hometown of 
houston he was to stay there through new years day with a side 
trip sunday to two military hospitals in san antonio to visit us 
servicemen wounded in panama 
in washington meanwhile the justice department acknowledged it 
failed to follow its own guidelines for considering national 
security problems when it brought drug charges against noriega 
it now appears that there was some rush to draw up the noriega 
indictment and guidelines requiring a review of national security 
implications may not have been completely followed spokesman 
david runkel told reporters 
he added however we believe there is a strong case against 
general noriega and that case can be successfully brought to 
trial 
concerns about disclosure of secrets in the noriega case have 
arisen from reports that he worked closely with the cia and the 
pentagon while he served as the head of panamas military 
intelligence service and after he became commanderinchief in 1983 
fitzwater briefing reporters here thursday said it is still 
too early to discuss a reduction in the 26000 us forces 
stationed in panama even though the usinstalled government of 
president guillermo endara appears to be continuing to expand its 
control 
wed like to have a drawdown as soon as possible but we cant 
tell you exactly when with us military forces still ringing 
the vatican embassy he said 
fitzwater said the united states is no longer willing to allow 
noriega to travel to a third country where he would be shielded 
from drugtrafficking charges that await him in florida even 
though noriega had been offered such a deal privately by the 
administration as recently as october 
we had to go in militarily we have paid a price for this and 
our objective is that we want him returned to the united states for 
prosecution he said 
the difference is before the offer was if he would go in 
peace save lives and bloodshed and so forth and he chose not to 
do that the spokesman said

the national institutes of health is scrapping 
proposed conflictofinterest guidelines that stirred controversy 
among scientists and will go back to the drawing boards to draft 
new options officials said friday 
the guidelines proposed for the federal research agency last 
september were an attempt to ensure the integrity of 
governmentfunded projects by preventing researchers from having a 
financial interest in the outcome of their work 
but many scientists said the proposal would hamper efforts to 
turn academic research into commercial products and could cost the 
united states its competitive edge in biomedical research 
the proposal suggested that nih grant recipients disclose their 
and their familiys financial interests and said governmentfunded 
researchers should have no equity interest in any company that 
would benefit from their research it also proposed barring 
researchers from sharing information with companies until it is 
publicly available 
nih received more than 600 comments on the proposal said nih 
spokeswoman ann thomas 
dr louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and 
human services said friday that he has asked nih to submit to him 
new options that properly treat potential abuse while keeping the 
research process free of unnecessary burdens and disincentives 
while there is a crucial need to protect against possible 
abuses in the research system it is also important that we not 
impose on our scientific community regulatory burdens which may be 
unnecessary or counterproductive sullivan said 
likewise it is important that we not unnecessarily jeopardize 
the international leadership position we have built up through 
years of cooperative government and private investment he said 
he said any changes will be implemented through the formal 
regulatory process rather than as guidelines as the original 
proposal suggested

one branch of east germanys biggest 
opposition movement defied the coalitions leaders friday and said 
it would form a political party to challenge the communists in 
parliamentary elections 
the military announced it was replacing its topranking officers 
and said it had abolished the section in which the communist party 
ensured obedience from the military 
sen carl levin dmich said friday that he was told that east 
germany is considering reducing its defense spending by 20 percent 
next year 
the main body of new forum which claims membership of 200000 
decided earlier this week to remain a citizens group rather than 
found a formal political party 
new forum activists from five east german cities however met 
in karlmarxstadt and said they set up a committee to form the 
german forum party the official news agency adn said the new 
party will hold its founding convention on jan 27 and run 
candidates in the may elections adn said 
there has been friction between new forum founders who are 
mainly based in east berlin and the more radical members of the 
group in the provinces 
new forum was formed as a loose group of opposition activists 
just over two months ago when the prodemocracy movement began 
challenging the hardline communist leadership 
the protests grew into massive street demonstrations that forced 
the ouster of hardline communist leader erich honecker democratic 
reforms and the resignation of the entire communist leadership dec 
3 
in less the two months east germany opened the berlin wall and 
other borders and embarked on the path of democratic reforms that 
will culminate in the free elections 
late thursday new forums national council issued a platform 
for the elections but said it still considered itself only a 
nationwide citizens movement 
the group said it was ready to assume political responsibility 
strived for a mixed economy and supported a special 
relationship with west germany 
new forum said it will offer an alternative for citizens who did 
not trust other established parties and their willingness to carry 
out deep reforms it said it supported a confederation with west 
germany 
the east german offer to trim 20 percent of its defense budget 
could be very significant if it turns out to be true said sen 
levin levin said the figure came out during a meeting with defense 
minister theodor hoffmann 
it adds evidence that there is a very significant reduction in 
the threat from the east said the senator who added that lower 
us defense spending could be justified by the reforms being 
introduced in eastern europe 
east german officials had previously said the 1990 defense 
budget would be at least 10 percent lower than the 13 billion 
reported for this year 
the defense ministry announced a series of new appointments that 
take effect monday 
ministry spokesman uwe hempel told adn that gen horst bruenner 
was retiring after the abolition of the political administration 
department the office dealt with ideological matters and ensured 
communist policies and ideology were observed in the military 
the military also replaced the chief of staff and commanders of 
the navy air force and land forces 
adn gave no reason for the changes

prisoner of faceless men jailed yet again for antisocial 
behavior in a system he called morally rotten 
on friday he became president of czechoslovakia 
a playwright havel scripted much of the high drama which 
brought the communist party off center stage after 41 years of 
command performance 
his work was banned after soviet armor silenced the prague 
spring of 1968 writing in the shadows publishing abroad he 
sliced away communist underpinnings with strokes of his pen 
havel exposed the abyss between words and reality hurling scorn 
at the orwellian spin on terms like peoples democracy and 
socialism 
his goal he said recently was a modern contemporary system 
which would return to people their honor and freedom 
although havel recently called the prime ministers job 10 times 
more important than the presidents he is likely to loom large as 
czechoslovaks rediscover democracy 
he revives a tradition of the philosopher president his hero 
and the nations is tomas garrigue masaryk the professor and 
author who in 1918 created czechoslovakia from the ruins of the 
austrohungarian empire 
czechoslovaks who love ideas eloquently expressed have turned 
frequently to intellectuals for guidance in times of crisis 
at first glance havel appears less a president than a 
53yearold dennis themenace lookalike with a blond mustache 
impish eyes gleam and a halfamused smile leaves people wondering 
what he is up to next 
when he speaks however his gravely voice rumbles wit and 
wisdom he is small and shy but his presence can fill a room 
four years in prison during the last 20 have edged havels 
whimsy with flint mostly he has often said time alone with his 
tormentors gave him a chance to weigh his values 
his letters to olga written from his cell to his wife and 
published as a book reveal a man putting his mind through rigorous 
daily aerobics 
havel sweeps broadly from intense inner searching and musing in 
foreign languages to mundane details of life characteristically 
he blends the extremes 
in one letter he warns olga to fight when authorities cut off 
her fuel its not just the heating oil he wrote this could 
become a monstrous precedent franz kafka man is an eternal 
rebel 
he urges her to care for their farmhouse clearly the place to 
which he longs to escape to craft the plays that nourish him 
havels plays are only obliquely political he targets the 
unjust and the hypocritical taking them apart with swift 
sometimes imperceptible razor cuts 
in public comments however havel was blunt as a hammer blow 
at his trial in february given a final word in his own defense 
havel denounced authorities who arrested people for laying flowers 
at a patriots memorial 
i must say that words antistate and antisocialist lost 
any semantic meaning long ago since during their long years of 
wanton use they became a perjorative label for all citizens who 
for various reasons made the government feel uncomfortable 
havels parents were wealthy but only until he was 5 
communists took power and marked him as too bourgeois for higher 
education to be near the theater he worked as a stagehand 
eventually he earned a degree at night school 
like shakespeares caesar havel refused laurels until they were 
forced upon him by a nation chanting his name in a dec 7 news 
conference he said 
i have repeatedly said that my occupation is writer and that i 
have no political ambitions i dont feel myself to be a 
professional politician but i have always put the public interest 
ahead of my own 
and if god help us the situation should develop in such a 
way that the only service i could render my country would be to do 
this then of course i would do it 
that was quickly the case 
in the heady momentum of the november uprising the opposition 
wanted a balanced government that would steer the nation quickly 
toward free elections 
the communist premier resigned his successor haggled with 
opposition leaders including havel over a cabinet president 
gustav husak under an ultimatum stepped down a general strike 
was averted czechoslovakia needed a leader 
at a dec 9 rally it was havel on a balcony over wenceslas 
square who listed each triumph of the people he thundered love 
and love must prevail over lies and hatred the crowd of 100000 
roared we want havel 
havels sudden emergence was not a total surprise as the crisis 
widened mysterious hungarianmade havel for president buttons 
popped up all over prague 
asked about them at the news conference havel shrugged i 
dont wear one he said skillfully evading three followup 
questions on whether he approved of them 
he was redeyed and fallingdown tired but his answers were all 
havel when someone taxed him for squirming away from direct 
questions he laughed 
you talk of the presidency but dont accept the basic 
presidential quality of answering in a roundabout way he said 
he had seen george bush in action he added i so far have not 
said no comment 
more seriously he underlined the character of a revolution by a 
strong people who finally had enough of something they did not 
believe in 
what is important he said is what the students began 
with that is the humanitarian dimension resistance to violence 
the longing for truth and moral integrity 
one reporter asked him to list the lessons he had drawn from 20 
years of standing up to the state he reflected a moment and 
replied 
i have learned that when a person behaves in accordance with 
his conscience and when he tries to speak the truth behave as a 
citizen even when citizenship as such is degraded it may not lead 
to anything but it might 
what certainly will not lead to anything is when you calculate 
that it might

the colony of hong kong to return to chinese sovereignty in 
1997 also was heavily represented on queen elizabeth iis 
semiannual honors list which is compiled by the government the 
queen carries out the investiture of the honors at a later ceremony 
former new zealand prime minister david lange whose 
antinuclear stance put him at odds with prime minister margaret 
thatcher was made a companion of honor a prestigious order headed

the author of in a free state a bend in the river and 
enigma of arrival came to britain at age 17 on a scholarship to 
oxford university and has become one of this countrys most 
important writers 
the honor entitles him to call himself sir vidiadhar but his 
work always appears with his initials 
descended from an indian family that emigrated to trinidad as 
indentured laborers naipaul grew up in a tightly knit hindu 
family this background is reflected in his writing about 
rootlessness and being an alien even when visiting his ancestral 
home in india which he described in an area of darkness 
maggie smith 55 one of britains finest stage actresses and an 
oscarwinner for the prime of miss jean brodie was made a dame

kennedy heard of his honor after a 70yearold neighbor cycled 
two miles in a gale to his vacation cottage on the hebridean island 
of coll to summon him the phone

said 
more than 20 honors went to hong kong residents topped by a 
knighthood for justice derek cons of the hong kong court of appeal 
there was a cbe for li kwanha the colonys police commissioner 
and nine awards for public and community service 
the issue of british residence rights for hong kong citizens

too liberal

the government said friday that its chief 
barometer of future economic activity edged up 01 percent in 
november a tiny increase seen by many analysts as evidence that 
growth in 1990 will be modest at best 
the commerce department said the small rise in its index of 
leading economic indicators followed a 03 percent decline in 
october a figure that had originally been reported as a somewhat 
larger 04 percent drop 
for most of the year the leading index has been flashing 
signals that the us economy was headed for a rather dramatic 
slowdown in growth and analysts said the weak november showing did 
not change that picture 
the message is no growth and flirtation with a recession as we 
enter the 1990s said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co 
the economy as measured by the gross national product grew at 
an annual rate of just over 3 percent through the first nine months 
of this year 
however a variety of factors including a steep plunge in auto 
sales the san francisco earthquake and hurricane hugo are all 
expected to depress economic activity significantly in the current 
octoberdecember quarter 
sinai is among a minority of economists who believe growth will 
be negative in the fourth quarter and the first three months of 
1990 as the country suffers through what he believes will be a mild 
recession 
however less pessimistic forecasters are calling for weak 
growth in both quarters and no recession as the current recovery 
from the 198182 recession chugs into its eighth year a peacetime 
record 
to bolster their view they point out that while the leading 
index has declined in five of the last 11 months it has not fallen 
for three consecutive months the traditional though not 
infallible signal of an impending downturn 
after a weak start we expect 1990 to pick up some strength 
during the course of the year said david wyss senior financial 
economist for drimcgraw hill a lexington mass forecasting firm 
he predicted gnp growth in the current quarter would register an 
anemic 05 percent annual rate but would improve modestly in coming 
quarters for all of 1990 he forecast the gnp would expand by 16 
percent just about half of the growth this year 
that would be bad news for the bush administration which is 
counting on much stronger growth next year to bring in enough 
revenues to reduce the deficit without requiring a tax increase 
the administration is expected to unveil its 12 trillion budget 
proposal on jan 22 
the 01 percent rise in the leading index in november was led by 
a strong jump in orders for consumer goods 
the other four indicators providing strength were a drop in 
weekly unemployment claims an increase in plant and equipment 
orders a rise in the money supply and an increase in the backlog 
of manufacturers unfilled orders 
six other indicators acted as a drag on the index last month 
with the biggest negative coming from a drop in the price of raw 
materials while such a decrease is considered good news for 
inflation prospects it is counted as a negative in the index 
because it also can reflect declining demand 
other negative factors were a decline in stock prices a drop in 
consumer confidence a decline in the average manufacturing work 
week a decline in building permits and a speedup in business 
delivery times 
the various changes left the index at 1447 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 
one of the main reasons that analysts are looking for an upturn 
in activity next year is a belief that crediteasing moves by the 
federal reserve will provide a boost to interestrate sensitive 
sectors of the economy such as housing 
but william macreynolds forecasting director of the us 
chamber of commerce said that the big rise in the money supply in 
november a sign of the feds easing efforts was troubling because 
it raised the danger of higher inflation next year 
for the past six months the money supply has increased much 
faster than industrial output this will lower the purchasing power 
of money causing a new bout of inflation to take hold he said

want i will say yes toekes was quoted as saying

death in full publicity thats just not done

timisoara when people linked hands around the priests home to 
prevent him from being taken away it quickly spread into an

henchmen 
the priest said he was feeling relatively good now i have 
great spiritual pains only now am i aware of the great danger that 
my wife and son had been in my life was not worth anything 
for ceausescu i had already been dead i can only thank 
god that im still alive bild quoted toekes as saying 
toekes said he did not feel like a hero 
i am a priest who had a duty i am a very simple man i only 
did my duty conscientiously i am not a hero he said

ceausescu had given my life some value

wanted to help me securitate accused me of being responsible for 
their death my soul is destroyed toekes was quoted as saying 
toekes said his greatest wish was to go back to timisoara as 
soon as possible and celebrate a service with his parishioners

the white house on friday turned up 
its nose at advertisements for a decongestant featuring president 
bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev heads of state dont 
endorse cold medicine bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
fitzwater registered objections to ads for drixoral an 
overthecounter head cold remedy manufactured by scheringplough 
corp 
the ads in both newspaper and television versions show 
gorbachev and bush shaking hands at the superpower summit in malta 
earlier this month 
in the new year may the only cold war in the world be the one 
were fighting asserts the advertisements 
but the ads clearly are giving the white house a headache 
we do not approve or sanction or acknowledge any of these 
commercial endorsements and we appreciate the two television 
networks that declined to run them said fitzwater 
abc and cbs have refused to carry the spot 
some ad man gets high marks for imagination and ingenuity but 
he may have to pay for this one himself fitzwater said he did 
not elaborate

the sioux publisher of the lakota times 
said friday he has returned the hl mencken writing award he won 
in 1985 because of racist and sexist remarks mencken made in his 
recently published diaries 
i feel very strongly that everything that i have fought for in 
the last 20 years to try and improve race relations it just 
wouldnt wash if i accepted an award and kept an award from a 
person that has attitudes that are so bigoted said tim giago a 
member of the oglala sioux tribe 
his weekly paper is named for the dominant sioux language 
i have a strong feeling that this kind of subtle racism by 
people that are in a position to help is probably the worst form 
of racism 
we can deal with outright blatant redneck racism because 
its right there in front of us he said but it is very hard 
to deal with that kind of racism by people in prominent positions 
especially in the media that carry this silent racial attitude 
with them 
giago of rapid city said he also will return the 2500 prize 
that came with the award 
mencken the famous columnist for the sun of baltimore wrote 
his diaries between 1930 and 1948 publication was withheld until 
more than 25 years after his death in 1956 
giago writes a weekly syndicated column on indian issues for 20 
newspapers across the country he said he doubted others who 
attended the ceremony with him five years ago such as coretta 
scott king the wife of slain civil rights leader martin luther 
king jr would have taken part if they had known about menckens 
attitudes toward blacks women and jews 
in one entry mencken wrote it is impossible to talk anything 
resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman they are all 
essentially childlike and even hard experience does not teach them 
anything 
a spokesman for the baltimore sun which sponsors the award 
said friday neither publisher reg murphy nor other senior 
management at the newspaper were available for comment 
murphy wrote in editor and publisher recently that he had 
considered ending the awards because of the diaries but decided 
against it 
you dont throw away all of the wonderful work of a man like 
mencken that was in the public domain because of the private 
venom he wrote in the trade magazine 
another mencken award recipient chicago tribune columnist mike 
royko told the sioux falls argus leader he does not plan to return 
his award because of menckens private thoughts

thousands of secret police loyal to 
nicolae ceausescus shattered regime were reported in custody 
friday and the new government said it would begin steering the 
country toward democracy 
the revolutionary government also said that it has begun putting 
secret police on trial 
the government a disjointed collection of former officials and 
intellectuals that has changed almost daily made new moves to 
strengthen its hold on the country and reiterated its commitment to 
free elections in april 
the leadership also changed the countrys name and flag to 
reflect the clean break with ceausescus harsh communist rule 
which was toppled one week ago after 24 years of oppression 
the national salvation committee which has declared itself the 
interim government pledged to honor all of romanias international 
commitments including membership in the sovietled warsaw pact 
military alliance 
the government had told ceausescu loyalists still waging 
sporadic guerrilla attacks to lay down their arms by 5 pm 
thursday or face execution 
cazimir ionescu a vice president in the national salvation 
committees 145member governing council said friday that several 
thousand loyalists had surrendered or been captured in the week 
since ceausescu was toppled 
the governments newly formed military council issued a last 
call for surrender or else the proceausescu forces will face 
trial and be summarily sentenced 
the council said the army was in full control nationwide and 
that military tribunals set up to put the special police forces on 
trial had begun their work and will continue to try all acts of 
terrorism 
deputy foreign minister cornelieu bogdan said he hoped the 
trials would involve due process but said he did not know how 
defendants would be judged 
the death penalty may be abolished by then he said 
he said the prisoners included some generals and highranking 
officers 
there was scattered shooting in the capital thursday night but 
bogdan said the main danger from the terrorists has passed 
a snowstorm and high winds swept bucharest on friday a column 
of about 2030 tanks was seen rolling through the center of town 
with soldiers waving at people as they passed 
the provisional leadership announced it would honor all 
international commitments including those taken under the warsaw 
pact bogdan said 
the countrys new leaders are likely to meet the leaders of the 
six other warsaw pact countries for the first time in sofia 
bulgaria on jan 9 when the sovietled eastern trading bloc 
comecon meets 
interim president ion iliescu reportedly became friends with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev when both were college students 
in moscow 
it will be the first time the leaders of the seven east bloc 
countries will meet since all of those countries have embraced 
democratic reforms 
on friday iliescu and interim premier petre roman met with 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn to discuss possible hungarian

interim leadership saying they are needed to get the country back 
on its feet 
many communist party members are indispensible he said 
because ceausescu took the toughest line in eastern europe on

albania the last bastion of stalinism in 
eastern europe has protested criticism of its human rights 
policies by the greek foreign minister greece said friday 
an official statement said the greek charge daffaires was 
summoned thursday to the foreign ministry in tirana the albanian 
capital to explain why foreign minister antonis samaras had made 
the statement 
samaras commented monday saying with the fall of romanian 
dictator nicolae ceausescu all nations should recognize the time 
had come for dialogue and human rights 
and in the same way that christmas is being celebrated in 
romania today i hope that soon we will be able to see the greek 
christian minority the greeks of albania celebrating christmas in 
albania he said 
the remarks by samaras a member of the conservative new 
democracy party were criticized by greeces socialists and 
communists who also support the government 
greece in 1987 ended a technical state of war with neighboring 
albania that had lingered from world war ii 
the orthodox church of greece sharply attacked the decision at 
the time by describing it as an abandonment of our christian 
brothers 
ethnic greeks are banned from speaking greek and practicing 
their religion in albania a hardline communist country of 3 
million people that has shut itself off from the outside years for 
most of the postwar years 
samaras a member of the conservative new democracy party said 
later that no greek wishes it to remain the last unprotected 
minority in a europe that stands for human rights 
the orthodox church of greece claims 400000 greeks live in the 
tiny rugged country on greeces northwestern frontier but albania 
says the number of ethnic greeks do not exceed 60000 
with the fall of hardline communist governments in poland 
hungary east germany czechoslovakia bulgaria and now romania 
rumors spread through the balkans that some unrest was noted in 
albania but tirana denied that any demonstrations against its rule 
had taken place 
albanian embassy officials in athens were evasive when asked to 
discuss the situation in their country 
one greek foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said greeces embassy in tirana has reported nothing 
unusual going on 
sources in northwestern greece said security on the albanian 
side of the border remains tight with no noticeable change in the 
past week one main road was open for trucks carrying goods between 
the two countries 
analysts who closely follow events in the isolated communist 
state said they had received no reports of unrest and it appeared 
unlikely that the hardline government of president ramiz alia 
would be affected by what has occurred in eastern europe 
alia took power fie years ago following the death of longtime 
dictator enver hoxha who broke relations with the soviet union in 
1961 because of nikita s khrushchevs dismantling of stalinism 
museums and monuments in tirana honor hoxha amid the shabby 
apartment blocks he left behind 
secret police check albanians contacts with foreigners 
albania has accepted only about 10000 tourists a year and 
diplomats have said that albanian officials are petrified that 
affluent westerners might raise discontent among the poorest people 
in the continent thousands of households lacking any other source 
of heat burn dung and garbage 
an announcement in paris earlier this week by a group of 
albanian refugee associations criticized the international 
communitys inattention to rights abuses in albania 
from purge to purge it said all of albania has become a 
veritable prison camp and basic human rights have been violated 
since 1945

as czechoslovakia looks toward 
free elections next year for the first time in four decades 11 new 
political parties have emerged 
those already established are expected to attract large numbers 
of new members as people take advantage of the right to join 
political parties denied by communists for 41 years 
the parties 
communist party after four decades of a virtual monopoly on 
power enshrined in czechoslovakias constitution the communists 
are by far the best organized however the party is on the verge 
of bankruptcy and has lost more than 66000 of its 17 million 
members since the peaceful revolution began in midnovember 
during the decades of communist control only four small 
political parties survived the socialist party the peoples party 
and two parties in slovakia considered relics of czechoslovakias 
prewar democracy 
all of them recognized communist rule in their statutes and 
cooperated with the party 
within the party is a potential splinter group the democratic 
forum of communists this group of reformminded party members is 
organizing nationally and has threatened to leave the party at its 
forthcoming congress in may 199o 
such a break would further reduce the communist partys already 
greatly diminished political influence 
the socialist party evolved from the czech socialist party 
after the communist takeover in 1948 it has 18 deputies in the 
350member parliament and publishes the widely read daily svobodne 
slovo 
two of the new government ministers are socialists 
membership in the socialist party has stagnated at about 16000 
but in the current political landscape the party is expected to 
attract new members 
the peoples party traditionally attracts catholics and other 
religious czechoslovaks it has 47000 members and holds 19 seats 
in parliament 
two members of the new cabinet are members of the peoples party 
before the revolution both the socialists and the peoples 
party were docile partners of the communists with membership quotas 
keeping them out of real competition 
but they are emerging as viable contenders for the upcoming 
elections distancing themselves from the communists and siding 
with the democratic opposition the peoples party was the party to 
propose havel for president in parliament 
it is difficult to estimate membership in the smaller political 
parties and groups as the political terrain shifts with new 
parties emerging daily it is unlikely that any will be able to 
organize and attract a large number of members before the first 
elections 
among the smaller parties are 
the czechoslovak socialdemocratic party 
czechoslovak democratic initiative 
the green party 
the czechoslovak agricultural party 
the christian democratic party 
the trend for the third millenium 
the permanent opposition for democracy 
the party of free democrats created friday 
the strongest political force in the country however is not a 
political party 
civic forum founded by former dissident and new president 
vaclav havel is an association of former dissidents intellectuals 
and democratic reformers 
havel has said that anyone who feels like a member of civic 
forum is one and that after free elections are held there will be 
no more need for the group 
finally illustrating that these days anyone can form a party 
the party of mild progress within the constraints of the law was 
revived by jaroslav hasek author of good soldier schweik

a trading company owned by gen manuel 
antonio noriegas former presidential candidate was a slush fund 
that siphoned millions of dollars a year from international 
merchants in the free port of colon 
authorities think transit sa owned by carlos duque was also 
a conduit for the drug deals that enriched noriega as well as many 
defense forces henchmen 
the company is suspected of trafficking in drugs and arms 
said colons provincial governor leopoldo benedetti 
with noriegas downfall the inside story of transit is slowly 
coming to light 
us troops seized the company raided its warehouse and sealed 
the unmarked office like many noriega associates duque is on the 
run wanted for questioning by us and panamanian authorities 
transits manager rafael ceballos has turned himself in eager 
to spill his secrets and professing unbridled enthusiasm for the 
us forces that occupy colon home of the worlds largest 
dutyfree port after hong kong 
after 18 years with transit he says he has a lot to tell 
everything is in the books he said everything im no 
jerk 
ceballos was interviewed after surrendering to benedetti 
thursday 
he wants to talk he wants to tell everything hes tired of 
hiding he wants to keep on living the new governor said 
estimates of how much money transit collected vary 
the new director of the colon free zone jimmy ford a nephew of 
new second vice president guillermo ford estimates it at 1 
million a month ceballos says it averaged from 3 million to 4 
million annually 
others like colombian consul alfonso esquivel say transit 
collected tens of millions of dollars a year 
it is the only private company in the world that levies 
taxes esquivel said 
transit charged traders 1 percent of the value of a shipments 
freight on board and an additional 150 for every crate on board 
ceballos said 
the dutyfree port at the northern end of the panama canal 
operates as a marketplace to distribute goods throughout the 
hemisphere its particularly important to japanese and other asian 
nations who sell in south america 
ceballos said transits funds and importexport facilities were 
at the service of noriega and a few highranking officers 
for example if they asked for 150000 and the company only 
had 100000 it would have to get a bank loan for 50000 to get 
the money for them he said 
if they wanted to buy a refrigerator some champagne some 
liquor whatever the company bought it the company paid because 
of the connection between carlos duque and the defense forces 
many of the goods transit imported were for noriega and his 
family ceballos said 
he denied that transit which had trading concessions for 
colombian coffee cuban cigars and nicaraguan rum was involved in 
the cocaine trade 
no not for a moment he said as he awaited questioning by 
us army intelligence officials 
army col john brooks the commander of the us occupation 
force in colon said looters had emptied transits warehouse before 
the raid wednesday but that at one point a drugsniffing dog was 
brought in to sniff the residue 
it went crazy it was running around in circles brooks said 
us forces surrounded the city of 12000 as part of the 
invasion but did not enter for two days during which time it was 
sacked by looters 
transit was created in 1972 by noriegas predecessor gen omar 
torrijos and given the legal right to charge documentation 
fees 
he said noriega demanded more of transit than torrijos had 
noriega was possessive his daughters were always asking for 
something ceballos said recalling huge shipments from china for 
the noriega family whose home is stuffed with delicate porcelain 
jade and ivory carvings and furniture inlaid with motherofpearl 
ceballos said all decisions were made by duque he said only 
duque his son and his wife could sign company checks 
duque a longtime business associate of noriegas ran for 
president in the may 1989 election that noriega voided after 
international observers said the opposition had won in a landslide 
the opposition leader guillermo endara was installed as president 
following dec 20 invasion 
transit is despised by traders in the dutyfree zone officials 
of the zones merchants association say it has stifled growth by 
siphoning off money from the traders

police raided a vietnamese refugee camp friday 
and clashed with stonethrowing boat people who reportedly feared 
they would forced to return to their communist homeland officials 
said 40 people were injured 
police fired tear gas after the vietnamese set fire to blankets 
and threw rocks to prevent a search for homemade weapons said 
government spokesman timothy li twentyseven vietnamese were 
arrested and more than 700 weapons seized police said 
television showed police equipped with helmets and shields 
firing tear gas and smoke from the fires could be seen rising 
above the center on outlying lantau island which houses more than 
3000 vietnamese 
the boat people in order to make the operation more 
difficult pushed their women and children to the front said 
security secretary m geoffrey barnes 
the violence came only one day after clashes broke out between 
vietnamese at another center in which one person was killed and 10 
others injured 
the governmentfunded radio reported the resistance may have 
been prompted by reports that some of those in the center may be in 
the next group of boat people forced to return to their 
impoverished homeland 
earlier this month the government returned 51 vietnamese to 
their homeland against their will in the first such repatriation 
although officials refused to say how many police joined in the 
operation the radio put the number at about 300 
police said friday night that said 14 vietnamese and 26 guards 
and policemen were injured in the camp 
the officials said five hours of counseling by staff of the un 
high commissioner of refugees and voluntary agencies failed to 
persuade the vietnamese to cooperate 
police reported two clashes thursday night between vietnamese 
armed with homemade weapons at the shek kong detention center in 
which one person died and 10 others were injured 
police said they were investigating the cause of the brawls 
between two rival groups from quang ning about 100 people were 
involved in the fighting 
police have classified the case as homicide the injured at shek 
kong ranged in age from 16 to 28 and one was hospitalized in poor 
condition police said 
no arrests were made at shek kong but police found homemade 
weapons such as swords and lances in the detention center after the 
battles 
according to police five people have died this year in 
factional fighting that erupts frequently in the crowded and 
squalid vietnamese camps 
this latest violence is a further manifestation of the unrest 
in the camps caused by the threat of forced deportation said 
george foulkes of britains opposition labor party i fear that 
it is a foretaste of worse to come unless the government abandons 
its policy 
foulkes also accused the british government of delaying 
deportations at the request of the us government 
while they are dithering and delaying the situation in the 
camps is reaching boiling point he said 
a foreign office spokesman who requested anonymity said in 
response the facts are that considerable assistance is being 
given through our reintegration package to the boat people we 
are not waiting for washington 
about 44000 boat people who have sailed into hong kong since 
midjune 1988 and are considered illegal immigrants unless they can 
prove they fled persecution 
those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals 
rejected can volunteer to go home or face forced repatriation 
the 12000 boat people in hong kong who arrived before the 
screening program took effect were automatically granted refugee 
status and are awaiting resettlement overseas 
meanwhile the eighth batch of boat people to volunteer to 
return to their communist homeland flew back to hanoi friday 
the 111 people who took the chartered flight bring to 874 the 
number of boat people who have returned home voluntarily since 
march

the justice department acknowledged friday it 
was in such a rush to indict gen manuel antonio noriega on drug 
charges that it may not have followed its own rules for making sure 
state secrets would not be disclosed in court 
however said department spokesman david runkel we believe 
there is a strong case against general noreiga and that case can be 
successfully brought to trial 
some legal experts have said there could be problems in trying 
noriega because he would seek to use classified information 
stemming from his past cooperation with the central intelligence 
agency 
runkel said on tuesday that such concerns have been grossly 
exaggerated 
at a press briefing on friday he told reporters that the 
department may not have followed its usual policy of reviewing in 
drawing up an indictment any classified documents that might be 
used in a trial 
i had been informed that that was the policy that had in fact 
been followed in this case he told reporters 
it now appears that there was some rush to draw up the noriega 
indictment and those guidelines may not have been completely 
followed he said 
runkel declined to elaborate on the nature of the rush and 
said i havent determined the reason for it 
he said the departments decision to review the national 
security issues was an outgrowth of a dec 14 meeting of 
prosecutors in the case with representatives of the drug 
enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation and cia 
that meeting was called to discuss drug indictments against 
noriega in miami and tampa fla and a decision was made to 
proceed with the miami case runkel said 
noriega reportedly worked closely with the cia and the pentagon 
while he served as the head of panamas military intelligence 
service and after he became commander in chief in 1983

the body of a french citizen killed when a 
relief plane was shot down in southern sudan suddenly exploded in 
khartoum just before it was to be flown back to paris for funeral 
services sources said friday 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
medical personnel at the scene did not believe the thursday blast 
was caused by a buildup of natural gases and feared the corpse had 
been boobytrapped 
if the body indeed was sabotaged it was unclear if it was meant 
to explode on the unicef flight that carried the corpse back from 
southern sudan to khartoum or on the flight to paris the sources 
said 
it was not an accident but we dont know whether it was the 
responsibility of an organized movement or an individual dr 
rony brauman president of the aid group doctors without borders 
said in paris 
bernard kouchner the french secretary for humanitarian affairs 
said france would urge sudan to investigate the bombing and the 
downing of the plane 
the dead person was one of four relief workers killed in the 
attack over southern sudan three were french nationals working for 
the aid group doctors without borders and one was a sudanese 
employee of the world food program 
the identity of the person whose body exploded was not known 
but the sources said it belonged to one of the french nationals 
the sources said the bodies that were bound for paris were flown 
there on friday 
the four were killed when their twinengine brittennorman 
islander was shot down near aweil on dec 21 
the explosion was described as relatively small but big enough 
to knock a passenger from the truck that was carrying the bodies to 
the francebound flight and to cause a fire that burned the driver 
the sources said 
the blast occurred on the tarmac of the khartoum airport as the 
bodies were being taken to the plane 
our people in one of the trucks heard a small explosion and 
then the body just started to burn brauman said it burned the 
whole truck one of our local employees broke his arm when he fell 
on the tarmac to get away 
brauman refused to specify which body had burned but said 
toxicologists would test clothing and the body bag for traces of 
explosives he made their comments before a closedcasket service 
friday for the three french nationals at his organizations 
headquarters 
the relief group identified the victims as yvon feliot a pilot 
for the group laurent fernet a supply specialist and dr 
jeanpaul bescond the sudanese was frazer ariyaba 
doctors without borders operates a hospital at aweil a 
government garrison town about 590 miles southwest of khartoum that 
is said to be surrounded by sudan peoples liberation army rebels 
sudans government has accused the rebels of downing the plane 
with a missile but the rebels said the sudanese army shot down the 
plane to justify its continuing ban on relief activities in 
southern sudan 
the government two months ago banned relief flights into 
southern sudan it later accused the unicef relief effort of using 
relief flights to ferry arms and ammunition to the rebels the 
united nations has denied the accusation 
operation lifeline sudan since april has been moving relief food 
and supplies into southern sudan to avert a famine it said 
threatened up to 250000 people with starvation un officials say 
they succeeded in staving off the famine for this year but fear 
the situation could deteriorate next year if the ban is not lifted 
the rebels have been fighting sudans moslemdominated 
government since 1983 seeking greater autonomy for the countrys 
predominantly christian and african south

the ruling military junta has barred 
burmas last democratically elected prime minister from running in 
the may general elections the government said friday 
kyaw sann spokesman for the military rulers said former prime 
minister nu was disqualified for his refusal to dissolve a parallel 
government he declared at the height of last years national 
uprising for democracy 
the spokesman told a weekly official news briefing that nu also 
would face legal action but that he would not be imprisoned 
nu announced his 26member government sept 9 1988 saying he

the election will be the first multiparty balloting in burma 
since nu was elected in 1960 
but diplomats say the military junta has arrested and harassed 
thousands of dissidents since it seized power raising doubts the 
election will be free and fair 
at a christmas day news conference the 82yearold nu rejected 
the government demand saying he was prepared to face any 
consequences 
in a dec 7 letter to saw maung nu said he would disband his 
government only when ne win the general who ousted him made a 
public apology 
kyaw sann said members of nus party who were part of his

many romanians who have thrown off the 
yoke of their dictator want to make a clean break with the past 
but the new leadership says the country cant afford to purge 
former communist party members 
in romania virtually everyone in a leading position was 
required to be a party member and party membership government 
officials say is not a mark of ideology 
many communist party members are indespensible said cazimir 
ionescu one of the vice presidents of the provisional government 
we have not followed the old system of looking at dossiers 
ionescu said at a news conference 
the communist party has become a hated reminder in romania of 
the 24 years of nicolae ceausscu who was overthrown captured and 
executed in a bloody revolution that came so swiftly the country 
has had no time to plan its future 
jos comunismul down with communism is a slogan that 
now appears on posters and scrawled on walls around the captial 
romanians in the street say they want to wipe the words 
communist party from their mind and language 
communism is shame and it should be destroyed everywhere 
said gheorghe chelaru who described himself only as a worker 
but members of the provisional government say they are trying to 
run a country and an economy they need managers and organizers 
with a proven record in romania all those people once belonged to 
the party 
the new government is trying to take people on the basis of 
merit not their past said ionescu 
prominent excommunists in the new leadership include president 
ion iliescu former ambassador to the united states silviu brucan 
and former foreign minister corneliu manescu 
dumitru mazilu another leading figure was a diplomat who was 
under house arrest for most of the last two years because he 
refused to doctor a report for the un human rights commission in 
geneva 
even the poet mircea dinescu one of the countrys leading 
dissidents was a member of the party until last spring 
the party doesnt exist anymore where do you see the party 
how can it contribute to the revolution we dont know we didnt 
ask those who came to the palace to join the revolution are you 
communists said deputy foreign minister corneliu bogdan i 
myself was a member of the party 
if we begin to count by number then i think you are missing 
the point he told journalists who repeatedly asked how many 
former communists are in the new leadership 
bogdan and ionescu said the new government was committed to 
ending the abuses of ceausescu they pointed out that the 
government moved quickly to repeal some of the most hated laws 
romanians are free to travel ration cards have been eliminated 
and food once destined for export has been redirected to the shops 
ionescu and bogdan say they are committed to democracy to 
opening a free market and to holding free elections by april 
the government officials say if the people dont like the former 
communists they can vote them out

the group which has claimed responsibility for 
the mail bomb deaths of a federal judge and an attorney expressed 
ire over court rulings in school desegregation cases an area in 
which both victims were involved 
the letter claiming responsibility for the violence also decried 
the legal systems handling of crimes by blacks against whites 
particularly mentioning last years slaying of julie love in 
atlanta a case never touched by the two men killed in the 
middecember bombings 
the letter from a group calling itself americans for a 
competent federal judicial system said 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert s vance and savannah attorney robert robinson 
were assassinated in reprisal for the atrocities inflicted 
upon julie love 
the letter which was sent to wagatv in atlanta and disclosed 
thursday said the 11th us circuit court of appeals must be shown 
that protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority 
than granting the blacks demand for white teachers for their 
children 
the letter did not refer to specific cases 
however vance was on the 11th circuit panel that directed 
suburban atlantas dekalb county school system this year to 
transfer about 120 veteran teachers from majority white schools to 
predominantly black ones in a longrunning desegregation case there 
a school desegregation case in savannah also was before the 11th 
circuit this year vance did not sit on the panel that heard the 
savannah case but robinson had represented the naacp in that suit 
the letter threatened that two more prominent members of the 
naacp shall be assassinated using more sophisticated means as 
part of the reprisal for ms loves death

love posters ubiquitous 
following the discovery of her body this year two black men 
were arrested one of whom has pleaded guilty to murder rape 
kidnapping and armed robbery the other man is awaiting trial for 
murder 
the dekalb county school case dates back to 1969 when the 
system was first placed under a federal court order to desegregate 
the 11th circuit last year overturned a district judges ruling 
that by 1988 dekalb county had done its best to integrate the 
73000student system 
the appeals courts subsequent ruling that dekalb must take 
further steps toward integration recently went before the supreme 
court where the justices this month refused to intervene 
in savannah a lengthy school desegregation case was decided in 
october when the 11th circuit ruled that a magnet school plan 
offered by the school system was appropriate for integration the 
national association for the advancement of colored people which 
had argued that the plan still left many black students in 
segregated schools has not yet said whether it will appeal

vaclav havel the defiant 
playwright who rode a gentle revolt from a prison cell to the halls 
of parliament assumed the presidency friday in an emotional climax 
to an electrifying year 
the masses who chanted havel to the castle during the angry 
rallies of november thrilled to the sight of the dissident actually 
in hradcany castle taking the oath beneath the nations red white 
and blue flag cannons boomed and a military band played the 
national anthem 
i promise i wont betray your trust i will take the country 
to free elections and thats a task for us all the 53yearold 
president told the adoring crowds from the balcony of the towering 
medieval castle 
havel whose plays and essays in defense of civil liberty earned 
him jail terms totaling five years languished in a cell eight 
months ago on friday a special session of parliament elected him 
czechoslovakias ninth president 
the election by 323 deputies most of whom are communists was a 
historic victory for the prodemocracy movement that in 41 days has 
broken the partys stranglehold on power 
among his first acts of office havel named as chief of staff 
josef lzicar the attorney who defended him and other prominent 
dissidents 
havel also is planning an amnesty program the details of which 
are to be announced new years day the state news agency ctk 
reported 
havels election is part of a sweeping series of accords between 
the opposition and the communists that are to lead to free 
elections next year 
it came one day after alexander dubcek the ousted communist 
party chief who led the prague spring reforms that were crushed 
in 1968 was named head of parliament in another stunning rebuke to 
the repression of the past 
it also comes two days after the bulgarian government agreed to 
talks with the opposition seven days after the government was 
overthrown in romania seven weeks after the berlin wall was opened 
by east germany five months after a solidarity activist became 
prime minister of poland seven months after hungary opened its 
borders to the west and eight months after the soviet union held 
its first competitive elections in 70 years 
during his somber inauguration communist prime minister marian 
calfa praised him as a man who is faithful to his beliefs despite 
persecution 
he never accepted offers from his friends or recommendations 
by his enemies to emigrate where the conditions of his life would 
have been more comfortable calfa said in a nominating speech 
havel walked the aisle with dubcek as communist deputies 
applauded decorously camera bulbs flashed and the band played a 
stirring fanfare 
the playwright signed the oath of office which was amended just 
thursday to delete a pledge of allegiance to socialism 
tears filled the eyes of a few opposition members and old 
friends of havel who watched the 20minute ceremony from the back 
of the hall 
twenty cannon salvos fired from the castle on the plain of letna 
boomed over central prague below 
havel whose plays have been banned in czechoslovakia since 
1968 agreed to take the presidency for six months leading to free 
elections in mid1990 
this must happen in a decent and peaceful way so that the 
clean face of our revolution is not sullied it is a task for us 
all he told the crowd from the castle balcony after taking the 
oath of office 
long live havel they chanted as he and olga his wife of 
30 years left the balcony to walk across the courtyard to st 
vitus cathedral for a special mass of thanksgiving 
then havel became the first president since the communists took 
power in 1948 to attend the roman catholic mass traditionally part 
of the inaugural ceremony 
havels appearance at the nationally televised mass was 
significant for the countrys 9 million catholics who suffered 
repression for their faith under the communists 
after the brief mass the towering vaults of the cathedral 
filled with the voices of the prague philharmonic choir singing 
dvoraks te deum 
after dark havel briefly joined several thousand people waiting 
in the cold on pragues old town square the blonde mustachioed 
president wore a dark blue overcoat blue suit and striped tie 
rather than his usual cardigan and corduroy slacks 
he made no speech but smiled and waved from the castle balcony 
to those below on the baroque square 
strangers grabbed each other and danced while others broke out 
in spontaneous song folk groups played and danced on the stage and 
in small groups around a giant christmas tree among the czech 
flags waving on the square was one with 12 gold stars on a blue 
field of the european community 
czechoslovakias president traditionally has little real power 
but people are looking to havel to restore stability and inspire 
confidence in western investors 
president bush was among foreign leaders sending congratulations 
to havel he pledged us support for democracy in czechoslovakia 
and the white house said his election marks a fitting end to a 
year of astonishing change in eastern europe 
in warsaw poland solidarity leader lech walesa welcomed with 
great joy havels election and wished him strength in his new 
responsibilities 
immediately after havels election students declared an end to 
their strike that began in midnovember 
it was the students who sparked the revolution when their 
peaceful march on nov 17 was brutally crushed by police the 
violence prompted mass protests forcing the communists to 
negotiate their own demise over the next several weeks with the 
democratic opposition group civic forum led by havel 
talks that lasted until dec 23 between communists opposition 
leaders and other political forces led to the creation of a new 
reform government that included several former dissidents 
hardline president gustav husak who took over after the soviet 
invasion quit dec 10

the indictment of 18 people by a federal grand 
jury has broken up a worldwide conspiracy that made and 
marketed millions of counterfeit namebrand athletic shoes a 
federal prosecutor said friday 
federal agents executed arrest and seizure warrants throughout 
the country on thursday and friday winding up a 4month 
investigation directed by agents from the us customs service 
office in nogales ariz said us attorney stephen mcnamee 
the 18 defendants are charged with violating us trademark laws 
and moneylaundering mcnamee said 
mcnamee said federal agents have seized 45 million in cash and 
other assets from defendants in the case 
he said authorities in chile and mexico also made arrests in the 
case 
mcnamee was uncertain whether any or all of the defendants 
arrested in other countries would be extradited to the united 
states but said both mexico and chile had been cooperating in the 
investigation and that cooperation was being sought from other 
governments as well 
the indictment returned wednesday in tucson and unsealed 
friday alleges that south korean businessman dae yun hwang is the 
head of the operation three other south koreans also were 
indicted mcnamee said 
at least seven of the defendants had been arrested by midday 
friday mcnamee said he did not say which seven were in custody 
and did not know if any of the koreans had been arrested 
mcnamee said the counterfit shoes were made in hwangs south 
korean factories and smuggled into the united states and other 
countries where they were marketed with such brandname labels as 
reeboks vans converse avia tiger puma adidas la gear 
nike pony and jordache 
the shoes were sold through major retail organizations he said 
he said the investigation began aug 4 when mexican customs 
refused to allow 40 cartons of shoes to cross the border from 
nogales 
us customs agents examined the shipment and found that it 
contained counterfeit shoes bearing a number of brandname lables 
the shipment was seized and a nationwide investigation was launched 
harley lewin a new york lawyer representing converse reebok

antonio noriega as a house guest since sunday was out of the 
country when the us invasion occurred and was flown back to 
panama aboard a special us military flight american officials 
said friday 
archbishop jose sebastian laboa who has been a key figure in 
the talks over noriegas fate was in spain at the time of the 
invasion and set out for panama shortly thereafter 
us officials who asked not to be identified said laboa was 
unable to get back to panama because flights were canceled during 
the first few days after the invasion 
the officials said laboa felt it was important for him to be in 
panama during the critical postinvasion period because of the 
influence he wields as pope john paul iis emissary 
according to the officials the us military resolved laboas 
problem by arranging a flight to panama for him noriega turned up

the navy is proposing to put two of its four 
battleships in mothballs and limit purchases of the 12 billion 
trident submarine to every other year a senior pentagon official 
says 
but the service studying proposals for the new fiscalyear 
budget is fighting to spare at least 14 aircraft carriers from 
white house pressures to trim the militarys most favored weapons 
programs 
president bush who is slated to deliver his budget to congress 
on jan 22 may be called upon to make the final decisions on any 
suggested cuts given their controversial nature 
were robbing peter to pay paul the pentagon official said 
of the current budgetjuggling exercise he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the fiscal 1991 spending plan will be a key barometer of the 
pentagons ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters on 
capitol hill and in the office of management and budget 
white house budget planners have told defense secretary dick 
cheney he can spend a little more than 292 billion in the new 
budget year which begins next oct 1 that means pentagon spending 
wont keep pace with inflation which the administration has 
projected will increase at an average rate of 41 percent 
the navy like other services is being forced to trim programs 
it holds to be successful such as the trident in order to meet 
these goals said the senior official 
the official said the service is seriously considering 
stretching out the annual purchases of the strategic trident subs 
to every other year 
the subs billiondollar price tag has made it easy prey for 
lawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclear 
weapons programs amid the warming of relations with the soviet 
union 
in november the electric boat division of general dynamics 
corp in groton conn won a contract to build the 17th trident 
submarine 
but due to its high cost and complexity funds for the submarine 
are stretched out over several years 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii has told rep john g 
rowland rconn that he expects to request full funding for the 
18th trident submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget 
but the letter made no mention about longterm procurement funds 
for additional submarines 
id put my money on some type of stretchout said another 
defense department official asked about the future of the trident 
program 
the official said it was premature to talk about an end to 
the program and said that if an everyotheryear purchase policy 
is finally adopted it may not even compromise the longterm 
number of submarines widely exepted to be 24 
the services world war iiera battleships also have become 
targets of budget cutters on capitol hill particularly in the 
aftermath of last springs explosion aboard the uss iowa which 
claimed 47 sailors lives the tragedy spawned a series of 
congressional hearings where lawmakers voiced sharp criticism of 
the huge ships safety procedures and personnel practices 
even the chief of naval operations adm carlisle a trost 
admitted at one hearing that the future of the four warships was 
up for grabs in the budget debate but the navy leadership is 
loathe to let the warships go the senior official said 
nobody not the army not the marine corps not the navy 
wants to give those ships up the official contended arguing 
that their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a president 
calls for a little gunship diplomacy 
the 91 budget plan calls for putting two in mothballs but 
wed still have two and we want to hang on to those he said 
he did not identify which battleships would be retired 
the official argued against putting all four 58000ton vessels 
in mothballs again citing the high costs and problems that arose 
during their remodernization in the early 1980s 
the navy was forced to call up old retired sailors to help 
in the rebuilding of the ships the official said 
when it came to taking the propellers off the darn things 
there was only one retired chief petty officer who knew how to do 
it and you had to use special explosive charges to do it the 
official said 
the second dod official noted that congressional pressure may 
work against mothballing the battleships since their home ports 
were to be dispersed among four states under a revised program 
our phones rang off the hook from lawmakers unhappy about 
trosts suggestion of the ships possible demise the official said 
the senior official said that the navy is fighting to save at 
least 14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year 
one carrier the world war iiera midway is scheduled for 
retirement next year which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14 
tell me which commitment are we supposed to walk away from 
the official asked pointing out that the us commitment to sail 
the indian ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive persian 
gulf havent changed 
the official also said the requirements of the navy most 
probably will increase as the service is asked to place more power 
on the high seas to advance the nations war against illicit 
narcotics traffickers

parliament voted to change the countrys 
official name friday and to eliminate the constitutional provision 
guaranteeing the communist partys leading role in the goverment 
the constitutional changes were adopted 3741 with 11 
abstentions the majority of the lawmakers immediately rose and 
began to sing the national anthem 
the move changes the nations communistimposed name the 
peoples republic of poland to the preworld war ii republic of 
poland 
the amendments incorporate into the constitution the reforms won 
by the solidarityled opposition movement which won partially free 
elections in june and assumed dominance of the government in august 
sovietbacked polish communists changed the countrys name to 
the peoples republic of poland when they proclaimed a new 
government on july 22 1944 while the country was still ravaged by 
war 
both communist president wojciech jaruzelski and prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki head of the solidaritydominated government 
were present for the evening debate on the constitutional 
amendments 
the amendments eliminated the phrase that mandated the leading 
role of the communist party in state affairs and changed a phrase 
that called poland a socialist society to a citizens 
society 
the prewar crown that graced the head of the eagle on the 
national emblem also was restored the crown symbolizes polish 
sovereignty and unity 
the amendments also introduced a provision giving citizens the 
right to create political parties and other organizations until 
now the communist party the democratic party and the peasant 
party were officially the only legally recognized parties in poland 
also introduced was a clause guaranteeing protection of private 
property 
the amendments were adopted following a daylong debate with 
lawmakers often haggling over one or two words 
earlier cardinal jozef glemp wished lawmakers strength friday 
for the hard tasks ahead it was the first visit by a polish 
primate to parliament in the countrys communist history 
glemp met with senators and members of all political 
orientations in the sejm as the lower house of parliament is 
called during a midday break in debate over amendments to the 
constitution and a possible change in the countrys national emblem 
the lawmakers sang traditional polish christmas carols as glemp 
entered the building i address all gathered here with great 
respect and i would like to express my frank patriotic and hearty 
wishes glemp told the lawmakers 
i wish you enough strength for the coming year and that the 
link between the nation and the parliament will become stronger and 
meet with greater understanding please accept those best wishes 
from the church of which i am an abject servant he said 
solidarity leader lech walesa used a series of strikes to force 
the communists to the bargaining table this year winning 
guarantees for a role in the government in exchange for cooperation 
on polands economic problems 
but popular support for solidarity among the masses and 
repudiation of the communists forced them to ultimately grant the 
opposition a dominant role in the government reform movements 
subsequently swept the rest of the east bloc toppling the old 
guard communist governments in hungary czechoslovakia east 
germany bulgaria and romania

the government will allow bulgarias 
turkish minority to take back moslem names they were forced to 
abandon during an antiturk campaign that began in the early 1980s 
an official said friday 
word of the policy change came at the end of a oneday meeting 
of the communist partys policysetting central committee it was 
confirmed by politburo member alexander lilov at a news conference 
we adopted today a policy based on guaranteeing all freedoms 
starting with the free choice of names religion and schools 
without any restrictions lilov said 
the name change campaign which gathered momentum in 1984 
affected hundreds of thousands of people including pomaks or 
moslem slavs living in southern bulgaria 
the forced change and increasing curbs on ethnic and religious 
rights of the 15millionstrong turkish minority earlier this year 
prompted more than 300000 to emigrate to turkey after bulgarian 
authorities gave them passports 
lilov blamed longtime communist leader todor zhivkov for the 
name change which he said had harmed bulgarias reputation abroad 
zhivkov was ousted last month as part of the wave of reform that 
has swept across eastern europe 
the central committee has determined that no documents exist 
in the files of the politburo to prove that such a decision was 
ever formally adopted said lilov who was not a member of the 
politburo at the time the name change was ordered 
this represents one of the peaks of zhivkovs 
irresponsibility lilov told reporters 
while the central committee was still in session about 2000 
journalists gathered in front of the party headquarters demanding 
freedom of the press 
at the rally a speaker of moslem faith said the first birth 
certificate with a moslem name in the past 10 years that of 
onemonthold osman bajram husseinov had just been issued by the 
municipal registrar 
in ankara turkish foreign minister mesut yilmaz said turkey was 
pleased by the decision to revoke the name change 
earlier friday thousands of ethnic turks and pomaks braved a 
blizzard to stage a noisy but peaceful demonstration through 
downtown sofia for the second straight day chanting unity and 
give us back our names 
about 6000 of the protesters circled the parliament building 
vowing not to disperse until their problems are resolved once and 
for all 
we will remain here whatever happens until persecution is 
stopped and our demands are met said milen rusev one of the 
protesters 
he said that in 1980 he had been forced at gunpont to change 
his turkish name of mehmet refatu 
at the central committee meeting the date of an extraordinary 
party congress was moved up from march 19 to jan 30 
the official news agency bta quoted andrei lukanov the no 2 
man in the politburo as saying the decision was prompted by the 
dynamic development of the political situation in the country and 
the need to speed up the renewal process in the party 
lukanov reportedly also called for a complete and final 
destalinization of the party adding that the party shall be 
one of dialogue and social consensus 
at the news conference lukanov was asked if the communist party 
would concede defeat if it lost in free elections scheduled for may 
1990 
in a democracy the possibility of losing elections is always 
present this should be respected by all political forces 
including the communist party lukanov said 
an end to the partys guaranteed monopoly on power is one of the 
main demands of the union of democratic forces an umbrella forum 
of independent political groups trade unionists and 
environmentalists

the former israeli spy who was arrested in 
panama as a top aide to gen manuel antonio noriega headed one of 
the most bungled operations in the history of israels mossad 
intelligence agency 
michael harari whose arrest by us troops was announced 
thursday was described by an american diplomat in panama as a 
security adviser to noriega and an instructor to the panamanian 
defense forces 
israeli newspapers reported that harari had considerable 
influence in panamanian politics he was once appointed by noriega 
as panamas honorary consul general in israel 
but he is best known according to the daily yediot ahronot as 
the head of a team of 15 mossad agents who set out to kill a 
leading palestinian terrorist but instead murdered a hapless 
moroccanborn waiter in a norwegian resort 
spokesmen for the israeli foreign and defense ministries refused 
comment friday on hararis arrest in panama saying he was a 
private citizen but his exploits have been described extensively 
in newspapers and books 
yediot said harari helped noriega recruit israeli mercenaries 
for his personal bodyguard over the last year and noted that a 
second israeli eliezer ben giton surrendered to us troops 
outside the vatican mission in panama saying he was responsible 
for the personal security of general manuel noriega 
the haaretz daily said harari was convinced to leave panama last 
year by israel officials who were under strong us pressure to 
cut contacts with noriega but the former mossad agent later 
returned 
israels ambassador to panama reuven beneliezer told israel 
army radio he did not know harari 
i dont know who harari is i didnt see him i didnt meet 
him i didnt get orders from him and he also didnt receive 
orders from israels embassy in panama beneliezer said in the 
interview broadcast friday 
he is a private israeli i dont know what he did there he 
did business and he was appointed by noriega as honorary general 
consul for panama in israel beneliezer said 
harari 62 was born in tel aviv in a religious family that 
objected to his joining the israeli army he eventually became a 
colonel 
yediot said harari was chief of mossads special operations when 
he headed the unit trying to kill the leader of the palestinian 
black september group which massacred 11 israeli athletes at the 
1972 munich olympics 
the case is described in the book the quest for the red 
prince by israeli authors michael barzohar and eitan haber 
haber now the spokesman for defense minister yitzhak rabin 
refused to comment on the case 
in the book the team leader is referred to only as mike 
but sources familiar with the case say it was harari 
according to the accounts hararis squad traced the man they 
believed to be ali hassan salameh known as the red prince to the 
resort of lillehammer norway 
two agents killed the man on may 23 1973 but the victim turned 
out to be ahmed boushiki a moroccanborn waiter living in 
lillehammer with his norwegian wife 
the embarrassment was heightened when six of the israeli agents 
involved in the mission were arrested by norwegian police 
the real salameh was eventually killed when a bomb planted by 
israeli agents engulfed his car in flames on a beirut street on 
jan 22 1979

the bush administration on friday 
rejected a vatican claim that the united states is an occupying 
power in panama while acknowledging that the diplomatic standoff 
over deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega is likely to persist 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the vatican 
was doing a fine job in handling the noriega situation he said 
the united states must calmly go along while roman catholic 
church officials decide what do about noriega who has been holed 
up at the vatican embassy in panama city since christmas eve 
but state department spokesman richard boucher reflecting 
mounting tensions between washington and vatican city took issue 
with a vatican description of the united states as an occupation 
force in panama 
we are down there with the consent of the government of 
panama the legitimately elected leaders of panama boucher said 
that means were not an occupying power 
fitzwater however said talks with roman catholic church 
officials were proceeding in a positive vein he declined to 
get into an argument with vatican city about us actions in and 
around the embassy where noriega has been holed up 
the press secretary answered questions about the diplomatic and 
legal jockeying as bush some 60 miles away in beeville texas 
wound up three days of hunting and fishing 
fitzwaters remarks appeared aimed at soothing increasingly 
harsh exchanges between the vatican and the united states over 
noriega who took refuge in the vatican embassy on christmas eve 
that was five days after bush ordered us military invasion forces 
into panama 
fitzwater said he did not know whether us troops ringing the 
vatican embassy where noriega is hiding in panama city would stop 
bombarding the building with nerveshattering rockandroll music 
at the vatican earlier spokesman joaquin navarro had complained 
about the activities of us troops who have surrounded the panama 
city embassy to prevent noriega from slipping away 
an occupying power cannot interfere with the works of a 
diplomatic mission nor can it demand that a person seeking asylum 
in that mission be handed over to it navarro said 
asked about this friday fitzwater said the vaticans doing a 
fine job we appreciate their efforts we continue to work with 
them in a very positive way we think that theyve taken a very 
serious and constructive role in this episode 
navarro did say the papal nuncio in panama city was trying to 
convince noriega to quit his refuge 
the united states wants noriega handed over to stand trial on 
two drug trafficking indictments the decision to militarily 
intervene on dec 20 ended a twoyear standoff in which the us 
government had sought with words and economic sanctions to topple 
noriega who had thwarted efforts to restore democratic rule in the 
central american country 
fitzwater also said he wasnt upset about a report in the 
washington times friday which said an errant phone call from the 
state department to the us embassy in panama city could have 
tipped eavesdropping panamanians to the us invasion 48 hours in 
advance 
no one seems to know whether its true or not he said 
fitzwater said that noriega had an extensive intelligence 
operation but he added that its history now 
summing up where things stood nearly a week after the united 
states and the vatican commenced talks about noriega fitzwater 
said we cant predict how long it will take to resolve the 
custody issue 
this matter has to play out he said well just 
calmly go along 
its a very difficult situation very tense circumstances 
fitzwater added they are managing a difficult situation on the 
ground there in panama they have been very cooperative with us 
certainly and with other countries in trying to resolve the issue 
so our interest is in establishing a harmonious 
relationship the spokesman said 
asked whether the united states would seek to physically prevent 
noriegas removal to a third country fitzwater said we wont 
speculate wed like to have him in the united states 
fitzwater also would disclose nothing about which of noriegas 
cronies have left the vatican embassy theres just not much that 
we have to say or want to say while this is going on he said 
there are some things we dont know and theres some things we 
know and just wont tell you we just dont think its helpful 
the spokesman said 
earlier bush sent warm congratulations from beeville to 
vaclav havel on his election as president of czechoslovakia and 
pledged us support for the rebirth of democracy in the east 
european nation 
the white house said the election of the once dissident 
playwright marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in 
eastern europe 
later the president flew to houston where he will remain 
through new years day and dined with national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and first lady barbara bush fitzwater said the 
president had nothing to report on panama but likely would get a 
full briefing from scowcroft 
bush and his party bagged 20 quail during his 2day hunting 
vacation onb the lazy f ranch owned by his longtime friend will 
farish fiztwater said secretary of state james a baker iii 
caught a 19pound turkey which cleaned and dressed bush and baker 
brought with them on the flight to houston 
the bushes will make a sidetrip sunday to two military hospitals 
in san antonio to visit servicemen wounded in panama the president 
will stop in montgomery ala to go bass fishing on new years day

panamanian boxing champion roberto 
duran said friday he hopes the use of his luxurious apartment by 
us troops will count toward the community service he has been 
sentenced to in a florida court for driving while intoxicated 
duran said he is letting his penthouse apartment be used by the 
soldiers so they can keep an eye on the vatican embassy where 
deposed ruler gen manuel antonio noriega has taken refuge 
but mostly he hopes it will get him off the hook 
i want a letter of recommendation a certificate of good 
conduct from american authorities here to show the judge in miami 
that should compensate for the community service he said 
early this week us forces broke down the door of durans home 
on the 22nd floor of a highrise beside the embassy compound the 
soldiers have since maintained a constant presence there 
if i were anybody else i would be charging them or throw them 
out duran said in an interview theyre taking showers 
sleeping there the house is suffering some wear and tear i give 
them food too and im not charging them a cent 
duran and his wife felicidad were not living in the penthouse 
when noriega fled to the embassy sunday and us forces descended 
on the exclusive seaside neighborhood of punta paitilla 
the middleweight fighter who earlier this month lost a 
muchheralded but lackluster title bout to sugar ray leonard owns 
several homes in panama 
more than 100 us soldiers have sealed off the streets around 
the embassy with wire roadblocks tanks armored cars and 
sandbagged machinegun nests entrance and exit from durans 
building is strictly controlled 
duran was arrested jan 14 in miami for driving while 
intoxicated he pleaded no contest in county court five months 
later 
the judge gave him six months probation suspended his license 
fined him 250 and ordered him to do 50 hours of community service 
by giving boxing instruction to miami children 
but duran thinks his cooperation with the american forces should 
suffice as payment of the debt he owes to us society 
us military authorities said friday they were considering 
durans request for written acknowledgement of his cooperation

thousands of romanian women died over 
the past few years from illegal or botched abortions because of 
deposed leader nicolae ceausescus nearban on the procedure a 
report said 
the report thursday came after romanias new interim government 
lifted ceausescus ban which permitted few legal exceptions 
ceausescu instituted the abortion ban in 1966 to encourage 
procreation he also banned the sale of contraceptives 
even before ceausescus ouster and execution there had been 
reports in the official press of illegal abortions and doctors 
charging phenomenal sums for the service 
the criminal act the abortion restrictions caused the death 
of thousands of women many of them mothers of two to four 
children the official agerpres news agency said 
agerpres also quoted a leading medical official as saying a 
great many crippled babies were born because of inadequate 
maternity care malnutrition and other complications 
under the 1966 law abortions were permitted only for mothers 
who already had at least five children in cases where childbirth 
could endanger the womans life when the pregnancy resulted from 
rape or incest or when one of the parents suffered from serious 
disease that could result in birth defects 
mothers were given monthly allowances that varied according to 
the number of children they had 
still the entire population was impoverished by the ceausescu 
regime and for many having children made their situation even 
worse 
dr bogdan marinescu head of the giulesti maternity house in 
bucharest said that over the last eight years nearly 1400 women 
died from complications related to abortions in the capital alone 
agerpres said 
the figure for bucharest is apt to be even higher agerpres 
said suggesting that hospitals and clinics attempted to hide the 
fact they had conducted abortions 
their number is by far bigger because when in agony many 
of them pregnant mothers were transferred to die in other medical 
departments agerpres said 
it was not clear from the report how many of the purported 
deaths were a result of illegal abortions 
agerpres said ceausescus abortion ban was an aggression 
against millions of women children and ultimately families the 
very national being

cardinal juan landazuri but as the minute of silence began a small 
group of striking state workers clashed with riot police in the 
middle of the square 
witnesses said police quickly surrounded the group of about 10 
workers beat them with riot clubs and hauled them away 
as the minute of silence ended church bells rang and horns 
blared as motorists showed their support for the vigil the third 
consecutive year the minute of prayer has been observed 
peru is being wracked by a leftist insurgency that has taken 
more than 17000 lives since 1980 at least 2500 people have 
disappeared 
sen enrique bernales head of a special commission on violence 
said this week that nearly 3000 people have been killed in 
political violence this year 
ten years of violence of terrorism of destruction and of 
death have painfully torn apart the heart of our people 
landazuri said 
witnesses said traffic proceeded normally in outlying suburbs of 
the capital as many people ignored the call to prayer 
the government announced the extension of emergency rules in a 
decree published in the official gazette el peruano 
the state of emergency regulations gives broad powers to the 
military to fight leftist insurgents and suspends some civil 
liberties including freedom of movement and guarantees against 
search and seizure 
such restrictions cover about onethird of this andean nation 
affecting more than half its 21 million residents

the humane society says it 
will oppose an artists plan to snuff his pet rat sniffy by 
flattening it with a 55pound concrete block 
actually two canvases would be created in smashing the rat one 
under the hapless rodent and one on the block rick gibson plans to 
drop onto his pet next week 
im giving a public demonstration a free art lesson to show 
people how they could do this themselves rick gibson said 
friday people will be able to crush other creatures in the 
comfort of their own homes sort of thing to see what sort of 
patterns they get 
ah but is it art 
gibson insists the killing will be humane and legal and sniffy 
will be wellcared for right up to the end i have no desire to 
mistreat him at all im going to be treating him humanely at all 
times he said 
ingrid pollack of the vancouver humane society said the killing 
would be ridiculous and sick she said the society will try to halt 
gibsons plans 
gibson has created a guillotinelike apparatus to execute his 
plan there is a cage for the rat on the bottom the weight slides 
down a pole he tested it on a squash 
ive had this idea mulling around in my mind for some time 
gibson said 
he plans to roll the apparatus in front of the vancouver library 
on jan 6 for a saturday afternoon performance for a few of his 
friends 
killing a rat for art is no worse than trapping or poisoning it 
as a pest gibson said 
he bought sniffy from a pet shop and says it otherwise probably 
would have ended up as a meal for a snake or a lizard 
for the life of me i cant tell the difference between what 
im doing and what they do when they have rats in the house 
gibson said so i dont know what the fuss is about if there is 
any 
gibson 38 recently returned to canada after six years in 
england he plans to return in february to appeal a conviction for 
outraging public decency by making earrings out of freezedried 
human fetal tissue 
in vancouver last july gibson said police stopped him from 
consuming a slice of human testicle he acquired from a medical 
supply store he said he was able to complete the art performance 
in september 
i just wanted to be the first cannibal in vancouver to go 
public he said

rep joseph e brennan who left the 
governors mansion in 1987 as he traded jobs with thencongressman 
john r mckernan announced friday he will challenge mckernan for 
governor next year 
brennan a democrat opened his campaign with an attack on 
mckernan a republican who has not formally announced he is running 
for reelection but makes no secret of his plans to run 
maine can do better than this brennan said i think maine 
people deserve a better government than this these are challenging 
times i want to get maine moving forward again 
mckernan responded with a statement that defended his record and 
accused brennan of being indecisive throughout several months of 
speculation about whether he would run 
clearly this has not been an easy decision for congressman 
brennan as he has agonized publicly over a candidacy for months 
mckernan responded 
his hesitancy his delay in reaching a decision until the last 
possible moment his seeming paralysis in addressing the issue of a 
gubernatorial candidacy is i think revealing 
brennan said he had made up his mind to run on friday morning 
and he had not yet plotted out his campaign strategy 
brennans statement said a formal announcement of his candidacy 
would come later mckernan promised a formal announcement of his 
own candidacy in the notsodistant future 
mckernan was making no comment beyond his prepared statement 
according to a spokeswoman in his augusta office 
brennans announcement friday drew an immediate endorsement from 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine who defeated 
brennan in the 1974 democratic gubernatorial primary 
that election eventually was won by independent james b longley 
it will be the fourth run for governor for brennan 55 who has 
been in public life for a quarter of a century he was a state 
legislator when he entered his first primary and lost to mitchell 
brennan went on to capture the blaine house in 1978 serving the 
maximum two terms before running successfully for the us house of 
representatives in 1986 he was reelected handily two years later 
brennan grew up on portlands munjoy hill the son of a 
longshoreman after army duty he went to boston college on the gi 
bill and then entered law school in maine 
after three terms in the maine house he was elected cumberland 
county district attorney in 1970 two years later he was elected to 
the state senate and served as democratic floor leader 
following his 1974 primary defeat brennan was elected by the 
legislature to serve as attorney general a post he held until his 
1978 election as governor 
four years later brennan carried all 16 counties as he defeated 
republican nominee charles l cragin 
brennan acknowledged at the time that it was uncommon for 
governors to go on to the house giving up the perquisites of a 
chief executive to become one vote among 435 
however he was assigned to the house armed services committee 
a rarity for a freshman as well as merchant marine and fisheries

irancontra figure oliver l north won hearty 
applause for his musical stage debut friday night as narrator of 
peter and the wolf but among the youngsters in the audience he 
was clearly upstaged by the wolf 
it was right nice said aquil robinson 12 what i liked 
best was when the wolf ate the duck 
north 46 who is appealing his may 4 conviction on three felony 
charges in connection with the irancontra affair accepted an 
invitation from maria fisher president of the beethoven society 
to read the narration for sergei prokofievs musical tale for 
children 
the retired marine colonel and former white house national 
security aide wore a tuxedo for his halfhour performance in the 
main ballroom of a downtown hotel before about 1000 spectators 
the audience included norths probation officer ralph ardito 
and 100 innercity children from the save our youth antidrug 
program in washington where north is serving his sentence of 1200 
hours of community service he also was given two years probation 
and fined 150000 
north read with lively expression and never missed a cue from 
the orchestra conductor he said it was his first stage appearance 
since he played the bad guy in a high school production of 
how the west was won in his hometown of philmont ny nearly 
30 years ago 
it was wonderful said former north associate robert w 
owen who saw the show with his 2yearold daughter katie ollie 
may have a new profession said owen who once served as norths 
liaison with the nicaraguan contra rebels 
he was very good said conductor richard weilenmann some 
narrators are exaggerated and overblown but north read very 
naturally as if he were reading to his own children 
ollies doing it because hes a friend of mine said mrs 
fisher whose musical society sponsored the concert she said she 
has admired north since she watched his televised testimony at the 
congressional irancontra hearings in 1987 
north who reportedly charges 25000 for every speech he makes 
narrated peter and the wolf for free mrs fisher said

the government of taiwan is legally 
responsible for the acts of a military official who ordered the 
1984 killing of a taiwaneseamerican journalist a federal appeals 
court ruled friday 
the decision by the 9th us circuit court of appeals not only 
reinstates a 200 million suit by the widow of journalist henry liu 
but also links the taiwanese government to the actions of its 
defense intelligence chief vice admiral wong hsilin who has been 
convicted in taiwans own courts 
wongs act was committed within the scope of his employment as 
director of the dib defense intelligence bureau the court 
said we conclude that the roc republic of china is liable 
the ruling if upheld would virtually guarantee that taiwan 
would be found liable for the murder itself leaving only the 
question of damages to be resolved 
i read the decision to say that the republic of china is 
liable under california law for the murder of henry liu said 
gerard harper a lawyer for helen liu who sued for her husbands 
death 
its the first time to my knowledge that in a contested case 
a foreign state has been held liable for a murder in the united 
states 
my intention was to find the truth of this case because the 
trial held in taiwan was orchestrated mrs liu said friday 
the reasons why they had to kill henry they didnt ask in the 
taiwanese court i want people to know the real reasons the 
mentality of the taiwan regime he her husband was trying to get 
taiwan to be a more democratic country 
john martel a lawyer for taiwan said he had not seen the 
ruling and could not say whether it would be appealed but he said 
any implication that the government was responsible for the murder 
was false 
the ruling is one of several recent decisions allowing lawsuits 
against foreign officials for allegedly ordering crimes in the 
united states 
earlier this month a jury in seattle found the estate of former 
philippine dictator ferdinand marcos liable for the 1981 killings 
of two philippineamerican dissidents and labor union activists 
liu 52 a taiwaneseborn us citizen and author of a critical 
biography of taiwan president chiang chingkuo was shot to death 
in october 1984 at his home in daly city south of san francisco 
by gunmen who were later traced to the united bamboo gang in taiwan 
military courts in taiwan convicted five men of responsibility 
for the murder including admiral wong who was found to have 
ordered the gangsters to silence liu he was sentenced to life in 
prison a sixth man was convicted of murder in a california court 
while finding that wong was motivated by lius criticism of the 
government as well as a personal grudge the taiwanese courts 
concluded that taiwans government was not responsible for wongs 
unauthorized actions 
us district judge eugene lynch cited that conclusion in 
september 1987 when he dismissed mrs lius suit against the 
government 
lynch said wong was acting outside the scope of his employment 
a us court could not authorize a further inquiry into the 
conclusions of the taiwanese courts lynch said without involving 
the judiciary in sensitive areas of a foreign governments national 
security and intelligence affairs causing potential embarassment 
to us foreign policy 
the appeals court in a 30 ruling disagreed with both of 
lynchs conclusions 
the opinion by judge robert boochever said the relationship of 
wongs actions and his job as intelligence chief was shown by the 
factual findings of the taiwan courts 
as for the republic of china although the suit may affect its 
government financially it does not affront its sovereignty and 
can cause no more embarrassment than the exposures already made by 
the roc courts boochever said

a builder announced friday the selection of a 
site near this tiny community for a lowlevel nuclear waste dump 
for nebraska kansas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana 
opponents and a senator from neighboring south dakota said they 
would fight the selection but others hailed the 40 million 
project for the jobs and money it would bring to boyd county in 
northern nebraska 
the 320acre site about two miles west of this community of 
about 530 people and five miles from the south dakota line was 
chosen for its geology said us ecology vice president rich paton 
gov kay orr cautioned that it would be premature to conclude 
that the site was acceptable until the licensing process is 
completed 
a license will not be issued unless us ecology can convince us 
that nebraskas environment and the health and safety of the 
citizens of boyd county will be protected mrs orr said 
the application wont be made before july 1990 said us ecology 
spokesman jim neal 
the reinforced aboveground concrete vault system is expected 
to begin operating in 1993 and to employ 25 to 30 people 
it will have a 30year lifespan and capacity for up to 5 million 
cubic feet of radioactive waste but officials estimate there will 
be only 50000 to 70000 cubic feet neal said the waste gloves 
and other radioactive garbage from nuclear power plants or 
hospitals will come from the five states 
i dont think we have a whole lot of people who are afraid of 
this thing said butte mayor ron schroetlin 
schroetlin said the fivestate waste compact commission had 
promised 300000 a year to the area chosen until the disposal site 
is built and up to 2 million each year it is used 
if thats used wisely it can help the whole county he said 
the site was one of three us ecology was considering the others 
were in nuckolls and nemaha counties in southeast nebraska 
the 500 to 1000 feet of impermeable shale bedrock beneath the 
boyd county site will provide a sound natural barrier between 
it and the dakota sandstone aquifer paton said said 
us ecology is developing the site for the central interstate 
lowlevel radioactive waste compact commission member states voted 
two years ago to make nebraska the host state 
in november 1988 nebraska voters rejected an initiative 
petition question to remove the state from the compact 
boyd county opponents had argued that their area contains 
wetlands that should be protected but paton said us ecology could 
build without disturbing them 
harold pierce an area geologist who worked for the county 
lowlevel radioactive waste monitoring committee said us ecologys 
choice was a wise decision theres not much question in my mind 
that thats the best site geologically and hydrologically 
pierce said 
actions over the years by local opponents included boycotting 
businesses owned by supporters and trying to recall a county 
supervisor 
last month a jury acquitted four boyd county men accused of 
confronting security guards at the gate of the proposed site and 
charges were dropped against a fifth 
schroetlin said things have calmed down maybe it will fire up 
again he said 
us sen thomas a daschle dsd said he would ask the army 
corps of engineers and the nuclear regulatory commission to review 
the decision 
i find it incredible that the state of nebraska can determine 
that a site that contains numerous federal wetlands would be 
acceptable for a lowlevel nuclear waste site the senator said 
lowell fisher head of the save boyd county antidump group 
said were going to do everything we can think of well attack 
it legally and every other way possible i firmly believe it wont 
be built here 
boyd countys people for progress a group formed about a year 
ago to support the waste site welcomed us ecologys choice 
now is the time for everyone to come together to work for the 
good of our county said ken reiser the groups vice chairman

in a new documentary about the end of 
life in a hospital intensive care unit patients are dying 
husbands and wives weep and doctors talk about god and ethics 
frederick wiseman wept making near death his 23rd 
documentary but he says hes cheered by the thoughtprovoking and 
often surprising results 
intensive care takes on new meaning here where the dying peer 
into the abyss and discover a rare sense of belonging here 
physicians and nurses display exquisite sensitivity as they guide 
patients and their families to choose comfort over heroics 
a lot of people want to live in a community where people are 
tuned in to each other and care for each other and listen to each 
other wiseman said in an interview at his film studio here 
for most of us that doesnt happen 
in daily life said wiseman we also have to deal with 
banality and cruelty and indifference a lot of these things are 
filtered out in the intensive care unit 
shot in black and white at beth israel hospital in boston and 
nearly six hours long the film scheduled to be broadcast on pbs 
stations this month uses wisemans trademark flyonthewall 
technique 
no narrator or talking heads intrude to explain things its 
just a camera and a microphone watching and listening in as 
families and the fatally ill reckon with death 
in a hospital however death is a complicated business 
technology sticks a wedge in the door to life machines and 
powerful medicines allow us to gamble on one more day one more 
kiss goodbye one more week or month or more in the land of the 
living 
while the notion of choosing when and how to die is eerie it is 
part of the modern way of death slightly more than half the deaths 
in 1986 the last year for which such figures are available 
occurred in hospitals according to the national center for health 
statistics 
wisemans intention in making the film was to stimulate 
discussion of what many of us and our relations may someday 
encounter to show in some detail the kind of decisions people 
have to make 
near death keeps the viewer in emotional suspense what is 
most riveting is the candor this is no place to tiptoe with the 
truth 
if he breathes he breathes if he doesnt its in gods 
hands a doctor tells a patients son 
a nurse explains to an 83yearold man youre not going to 
get better its sad and its frustrating and its angerprovoking 
but youre not going to get better 
the man smiles sadly he listens she continues i want to 
help you but i dont want to keep you alive unless you like 
living were telling you what we know about your body and asking 
you to make a decision 
the man tells her wants to see his children 
a wife cries to a husband slipping from her with every breath 
hes my life hes my life 
this is not the place to go gently into that good night 
ghastly ghostly lights shine to keep the dark out translucent 
tubes gurgle electronic monitors hum and shoot across their 
screens jagged fragile traces lifelines 
patients lie shrouded in their beds and stay tethered to the 
lifesaving machines sometimes the only sign of the tenacity of 
life is a wiggle of a toe a squeeze of the hand a blink 
wiseman trained his camera on four people two elderly men with 
heart disease a 33yearold man whose chemotherapy for testicular 
cancer turned his lungs to the density of cork and an elderly 
woman with severe difficulty breathing on her own 
these patients their spouses and their children agreed to have 
their most intimate and painful moments filmed to give to others 
what they would have liked for themselves wiseman said the chance 
to preview the ambiguities and uncertainties of the lifeanddeath 
questions 
but the patients and their kin are not alone in their suffering 
a doctor named scott is reassuring to patients and kind to their 
families but to his colleagues he talks often about his doubts 
and theirs 
im quite nihilistic about what happens he tells one 
doctor a lot of this stuff is not really relevant to making 
quality of life all that much better its really rolling the rock 
up the hill and having it come back down again thats what a lot 
of this is 
but he says later god decides we dont decide these things 
have a life of their own

when mel boggs parks his 18wheeler at a 
truck stop he expects good food clean showers and a safe parking 
lot free of hucksters prostitutes and drug dealers 
get the drugs alcohol and paid women off the lots and let the 
men get the proper rest the 54yearold boggs said during a fuel 
stop at the perlis truck stop in cordele if a mans got the 
proper rest hes going to be a safer driver 
boggs a burly plainspoken man with 20 years of longhaul 
experience said truckers sometimes are disturbed while parked at 
truck stops and rest areas by people selling sex drugs jewelry 
and other merchandise 
when im ready to stop and rest i dont want people beating 
on my doors said the jamestown ohio driver 
the truck stop industry responding to president bushs call for 
a major drug offensive has launched a nationwide campaign known as 
operation roadblock to transform truck stops into drugfree 
zones owners are considering the use of drugsniffing dogs sting 
operations counseling programs and random drug tests for truck 
stop employees 
roger a king spokesman for the national association of truck 
stop operators estimates 3 to 5 percent of the nations 1 million 
commercial drivers either sell or use drugs 
the vast majority of drivers are small businessmen who cant 
afford to lose their livelihood because of drugs he said 
trucker denny austin 36 of calhoun ky said he welcomed the 
campaign and hopes it cuts down on the number of impaired drivers 
austin said truckers cant afford to have muddled brains because 
they have to respond quickly to changing highway situations the 
stopping distance for an 80000pound rig is five times greater 
than for a car 
drugs can turn a real smart person into a dummy austin 
noted while eating breakfast in the perlis restaurant 
owner lamar perlis proposed the truck stop campaign during a 
recent natso meeting in new york 
perlis a member of natsos steering committee said the 
association will evaluate the antidrug efforts of individual 
operators and will consult with the white house staff the fbi and 
drug czar william bennett before developing specific 
recommendations for its members 
he said natsos 1050 truck stop members and 220 allied members 
have been asked to contribute 250000 to fund the program 
we are aware that drugs have infiltrated every segment of our 
society including the trucking industry and the truck stop 
industry and we are trying to mobilize he added 
several truck stops already are using drug dogs one is spending 
7000 a month for security lighting others have installed fences 
around their lots and many have hired security guards to protect 
drivers rigs and loads king said 
the allamerican truck stop in carlisle pa has posted signs 
warning wouldbe dealers that they may get caught in sting 
operations supervised by the district attorney 
the new england truck stop in sturbridge mass includes notes 
with paychecks offering help for employees with drug problems 
king said in an interview from natsos alexandria va 
headquarters 
natso and the american trucking association have endorsed a us 
senate bill that would authorize strong penalties for selling drugs 
within 1000 feet of truck stops congress has passed similar 
legislation to protect schools and playgrounds 
us rep bob clement dtenn has sponsored a bill known as 
the drugfree truck stop act of 1989 that also would designate 
truck stops as drugfree zones violators would be subject to 
maximum sentences of 10 years for selling drugs within 1000 feet 
of truck stops 
this bill targets all people whether they are commercial 
drivers or not who ply their onerous trade in areas where trucks 
congregate said natso president william clower congressional 
action in this area will strengthen our efforts to make americas 
highways safer 
perlis believes most drivers will welcome operation roadblock 
they want safe havens just as anyone else he said 
his truck stop has a security guard six nights a week its 
employees monitor cb radio channels for signs of drug activity and 
the sheriff assists when needed 
the perlis truck stop is one of the most popular along heavily 
traveled interstate 75 a major route between florida and the 
midwest the 14acre facility has a large restaurant showers a 
garage a store video games refueling bays for trucks and cars 
and a small motel it serves up to 2400 trucks a day 
truckers are basically like you and me said general manager 
leon perlis the owners son theyre family people trying to 
make a living the guy who gets the exposure the guy who gets 
caught with drugs or the guy who runs over someone is the 
exception not the rule

texans strode into washington last january 
confident the lone star was in ascendancy laying claim to the 
white house the house speakership and a passel of cabinet posts 
and congressional committee chairmanships 
they begin the new year with their influence on the bush 
administration undiminished but their clout in congress has been 
decimated by death illness a retirement and the resignation of 
their most powerful member 
rep michael andrews a houston democrat says texas is coming 
off a windshift year 
some texans fear their legendary clout which they predicted 
was waxing at the start of 1989 has waned so much that the state 
is now at a disadvantage in fighting for the government largesse 
that has traditionally come their way 
early on the senate refused to confirm president bushs choice 
of john tower as secretary of defense after exploring allegations 
of womanizing and excessive drinking by the former texas senator 
three months later in june house speaker jim wright abandoned 
a 34year career in the house and resigned from the most 
influential position in congress amid an ethics investigation of 
his personal finances 
in august rep mickey leland of houston was killed when his 
bush plane slammed into a remote mountain in ethiopia on its way to 
a refugee camp 
in october after suffering abdominal pains rep jack brooks 
dean of the texas congressional delegation was hospitalized for 
six weeks for an inflammation of the pancreas 
and on dec 1 rep marvin leath an influential democrat on the 
house budget and armed services committees announced he would not 
seek a seventh term in 1990 
despite the setbacks the texas delegation still landed 225 
million to begin building the superconducting super collider a 
giant particle accelerator that scientists hope will help them 
understand the origins of the universe and fended of a potential 
attempt to cut 100 million in pentagon funding for sematech a 
national semiconductor research consortium in austin 
texas also saw the pentagon chose dyess air force base as a site 
for railbased mx missiles a project that supportors say 
guarantees the abilene installation a mission into the next century 
even as budget cutters slash military spending 
but they still face a tough fight to maintain research and 
development funds for another military project being built in texas 
the v22 osprey aircraft and they failed to obtain tax breaks 
for the states troubled oil and gas industry 
rep john bryant a dallas democrat says hes afraid the 
delegations weakened presence in washington leaves it vulnerable 
to new attacks this year by other members of congress who believe 
texas has long gotten more than its fair share from the federal 
government 
bryant who in april announced he was a candidate for state 
attorney general decided in december to pull out of the race and 
stay in washington where he can keep an eye on next years budget 
as a member of the house budget committee 
he says the super collider sematech and the space station 
being built in houston all may be under seige in 1990 
when congress reconvenes later this month he says it will do 
so for the first time in modern history without a texas member in 
a key position to protect our states interests in the budget 
process 
still texas is hardly without wellpositioned members of 
congress 
its senior senator democrat lloyd bentsen is chairman of the 
finance committee in the house brooks heads the judiciary 
committee rep henry b gonzalez is chairman of the banking 
finance and urban affairs committee and rep kika de la garza is 
chairman of the agriculture committee 
we still have a lot of power there says bentsen the 1988 
democratic vice presidential candidate and a potential presidential 
candidate in 1992 
bentsens fellow senator from texas republican phil gramm puts 
it this way 
before all this happened texas had the greatest degree of 
influence in washington of any state in the union texas still has 
the most influence of any state in the union

screenwriter dennis turner at first turned 
down an offer to write the screen biography of rock hudson because 
he had also led a double life 
i said no a few times but they kept coming back turner 
said im glad they did i said no because i didnt know how 
seriously they wanted to treat his homosexuality i didnt want to 
do a travelogue of his life nor did i want to do an exploitation 
story because it was too close to my own life 
i didnt want it to be like the liberace movies where they 
didnt adequately acknowledge his homosexuality if youre going to 
do a rock hudson movie it didnt make sense to me not to go into 
all the corners 
i was persuaded when abc and the producers agreed it would be 
a serious study i knew it was going to be done and felt as a gay 
man who had shared a lot of experiences that it should be done by 
someone who would understand what was going on 
actor rock hudson was one of hollywoods most handsome and 
virile screen lovers whose secret life as a homosexual became 
public knowledge when he became stricken with aids his death in 
october 1985 helped create an awareness of the disease 
the twohour rock hudson will be telecast on abc next 
monday it stars thomas ian griffith as hudson daphne ashbrook as 
phyllis gates his former wife william r moses as marc christian 
his companion who later successfully sued the estate and diane 
ladd as his mother 
andrew robinson who played liberace in one film version is 
henry willson the agent who changed roy fitzgeralds name to rock 
hudson 
nbc also has a rock hudson project in the works based on rock 
hudson his story which sara davidson wrote in cooperation with 
hudson and his estate the movie is currently in development with 
no announced plans for production 
turner said he felt his own background would help him bring an 
understanding to the story i had been married and had 
children he said im a recovering alcoholic and he was an 
alcoholic who did not recover were both gay were both products 
of the 1950s although he was older and we both suffered in that 
secretive environment 
you felt you were the only person on the planet who was gay 
the thought of being excluded was frightening rocks secrets were 
eating away at him and they ultimately killed him he would not 
reveal his personal life even to his closest friends i think the 
fact that he couldnt be truthful contributed to his drinking the 
alcohol in turn contributed to his promiscuity he was incapable of 
having a longterm relationship with anybody i dont think he was 
living the kind of life he wanted it destroyed him 
turner said he interviewed phyllis gates marc christian and 
others who knew hudson the screenplay is also partially based on 
gates book my husband rock hudson 
the story takes him from 21 to 58 he said it begins in 
1948 when he got his first job in a movie he had one line in 
fighter squadron which starred edmond obrien and robert stack 
his homosexuality had already manifested itself by then 
said turner i think he and phyllis loved each other they had a 
romantic relationship before they married rock wanted to be 
straight he wanted to have a family he gave it his best shot 
i want this movie to show the complexities of a man who 
happened to be gay and a human being im tired of the media and i 
guess the everyday population treating gays or any minority as a 
stereotype a joke or a walking disease i wanted to show that 
keeping secrets not being able to be honest or choosing not to be 
honest is destructive to everyone 
a former new york playwright turner previously has written such 
film projects as poor little rich girl the long hot 
summer and between the darkness and the dawn hes also a 
former staff writer for dynasty where he met hudson when he 
was on the show in the 198485 season

drug enforcement administrator john c lawn 
generally keeps a low profile he speaks in a quiet husky voice as 
he guides the actions of agents throughout the world trying to 
keep them safe in the field and supported in washington 
but when a miniseries on the 1985 murder in mexico of dea agent 
enrique kiki camerena airs on nbctv in january he could 
become something of a national hero 
the television movie depicts lawn tangling with mexican 
officials who stonewall efforts to find camarena and his killers 
and going public to criticize those officials over the objections 
of reagan administration officials 
at the conclusion of a national archives screening a chokedup 
lawn told the audience of about 100 dea and mexican embassy 
officials that it was an extraordinary piece of work 
the miniseries is based on the book desperados by elaine 
shannon and tells the story of lawn and camarena who was kidnapped 
feb 7 1985 in guadalajara 
a mexican pilot who had worked with dea agents there alfredo 
zavala avelar was kidnapped a few days later the bulletriddled 
bodies of the two men showing signs of torture were found march 
5 1985 wrapped in plastic bags and dumped on a ranch 60 miles 
southeast of guadalajara 
lawn was the deas deputy administrator when camarena 
disappeared by the time the agents body was found lawn was 
administrator it was his first crisis 
dea deputy administrator terrence burke called the film 
powerful but operations director david westrate said theres 
a lot of pretend in there lawn said privately the miniseries was 
about 80 percent accurate which he considered commendable for 
television 
the mexican embassy minister for narcotics affairs gustavo 
gonzalez baez appointed by the new administration in mexico that 
has cracked down on drug traffickers and corrupt officials said 
americans are accustomed to seeing this kind of series and they 
realize this is not reality this is just amusement 
the movie he said suggests that all the mexican authorities 
were involved in protecting drug traffickers and that is 
absolutely inaccurate 
gonzalez baez noted that drug traffickers rafael caro quintero 
and ernesto rafael fonseca carrillo along with several mexican 
judicial police officers have been convicted and sentenced to long 
terms in connection with the murders 
although the miniseries is generally grim the national archives 
audience found some humor when suddenly up on the screen in living 
color was william von raab the former us customs commissioner 
playing himself as he vowed to shut down the usmexican border 
with carbycar searches to put pressure on mexican officials the 
audiences disbelief at seeing von raab on the screen began with a 
murmur and grew into surprised laughter drowning out von raabs 
lines 
lawn a 54yearold exmarine who goes by the name jack 
seems somewhat abashed at being in the words of one observer 
canonized on television 
it may be because the subject matter is so difficult 
in an interview before the screening lawn said the loss of any 
of his 2900 agents is the toughest part of his job 
when you talk to families the first question i have gotten 
from each of the families the nine recent funerals that i have 
presided over the question has always been is what he did 
important will it make a difference 
it started with camarenas wife mika 
her initial response was please assure me that kiki will not 
just become a number it has to mean more than that 
in camarenas case it has meant more in large part because the 
dea was determined to uncover who was responsible 
many individuals in the international community have said 
the mexican government has lost hundreds of people the colombian 
government has lost hundreds of people why pursue camarena 
lawn recalled 
to lawn camarena was a symbol that we in the law 
enforcement community domestic and international depend upon one 
another 
kiki depended upon law enforcement counterparts in mexico who 
failed that trust lawn said and thats the reason we had to 
pursue it with vigilance 
lawn wont say how many more agents hed like to have but he 
contrasts the 88 billion drug war budget for 1990 to the excess 
of 30 billion a year the united states spent for the vietnam war 
to have fewer agents than there are musicians in the united 
states army or to have fewer agents than there are new york city 
transit police or female officers in the new york city police 
department you get a sense of too few people being asked to face a 
herculean challenge lawn said 
but he doesnt believe the us drug crisis will change without 
a far greater emphasis on education to reduce demand 
even if his force were doubled twice as good a job is still 
not good enough because without a balance on the other side 
without demand reduction without international cooperation our 
victorys a pyrrhic victory he said 
the miniseries drug wars the camarena story starring 
steven bauer elizabeth pena treat williams miguel ferrer and 
craig t nelson is to air jan 7 8 and 9 on nbctv

the wind blew and the earth shook and the wall came down 
there it is 1989 in review a year of disasters that rivaled 
old testament plagues of triumphs that challenged credulity a 
year that led people again and again to the same words i never 
thought id see the day 
for a while it seemed that this would be the year of the oil 
spill then the year of the hurricane then the year of the 
earthquake 
but the last turbulent year of the decade will be remembered 
finally as the year the iron curtain lifted 
twentysix years earlier john f kennedy had stood before the 
berlin wall and said of free citizens everywhere let them come 
to berlin in 1989 they came and from the least imaginable 
direction they came from the east 
what joy a west berliner exclaimed and people from east 
and west berlin danced and laughed and hugged atop a wall that no 
longer divided them 
we live in exciting times president bush observed the 
rapidity of change is mindboggling 
indeed it was 
in poland the solidarity trade union was illegal at the 
beginning of the year it had ousted the communist government by 
the end then came hungary east germany czechoslovakia one by 
one eastern europes ruling communist parties followed polands 
lead and agreed to step aside and allow democratic multiparty 
elections 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had loosed the shackles 
that once bound eastern europe and after a seasick summit with 
bush in the tempestuous mediterranean he declared that the cold 
war was over 
even romania among the most stalwart of the oldline communist 
states was overwhelmed by democratic fervor that drove president 
nicolae ceausescu from his palace and ultimately to his death 
before a firing squad 
images of eastern europes peaceful revolution will stick in the 
memory for a long time but so will a sadder picture a lone man 
standing before a phalanx of tanks near beijings tiananmen square 
it had been a hopeful spring in the square where tens of 
thousands of students demonstrated daily to demand democratic 
change military officers at first balked at suppressing the 
protesters 100 officers signed a statement saying the army will 
never shoot the people but on june 3 the army began shooting 
the people 
the death toll may never be known estimates ranged from 300 to 
3000 
brute force blocked democracy in china but us troops 
forcefully imposed it in panama where an invasion just before 
christmas ousted the dictatorship of gen manuel antonio noriega 
and installed an elected president 
on a smaller scale too it was a year of tumultuous transition 
the tv lights went out for televangelist jim bakker who got a 
45year prison term for conspiracy and fraud 
zsa zsa gabor finally starred in a film that everyone remembers 
her trial on copslapping charges she played beverly hills 
official court jester and was rewarded with a conviction and jail 
term 
leona helmsley was the queen of a hotel empire but she was 
mocked and reviled outside her kingdom and was sentenced to four 
years in prison for tax evasion 
pete rose became as closely linked with betting as batting and 
agreed to a lifetime suspension from the game to which hed devoted 
his life 
john tower president bushs choice as secretary of defense 
lost the nomination and a sizable chunk of his reputation when he 
was pilloried as a liquortippling party animal 
house speaker jim wright resigned in a furor over outside 
income tom foley took his place

the mosthonored movie of the year rain man suggested

some measure of humanity in caring for his autistic brother 
then again the grammy award for best song went to bobby 
mcferrins dont worry be happy 
historically speaking the year began on a chilly cloudy day in 
january when george bush took the oath of office as the 41st 
president of the united states 
a new breeze is blowing he declared in his inaugural 
address and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push 
on there is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken 
if presidencies are defined by symbols and styles bush set out 
to cast his as open informal active sort of an aerobic teddy 
roosevelt he opened the white house to the public the day after 
his inauguration he met with the press far more frequently than 
did president reagan and he seemed at times to be cultivating an 
image as the triathlete president jogging golfing fishing 
speedboating playing tennis tossing horseshoes tussling with

no customer losses have been incurred 
with the closing of swink amp co a little rock bond company that 
cited heavy trading losses for the shutdown the companys attorney 
says 
the closing is due to unrealized losses because of market 
value decline in government securities jim dale swink the 
firms chairman and principal owner said in a letter to state 
securities regulators 
patrick r james swinks general counsel said in announcing 
the closing wednesday that the company was in the process of 
selfliquidation 
at this point it appears there are no customer losses 
james said we notified the national association of securities 
dealers and the arkansas securities department of these events 
other than that i have no comment 
all of swinks halfdozen offices will close and about 100 
workers will be out of work james said as of wednesday the firm 
operated offices in atlanta albuquerque nm boca raton fla 
and other cities in florida he said however most of the workers 
were in swinks little rock office 
state securities commissioner beverly bassett said the firm 
likely has some small investors as clients although much of the 
bond houses business has been in underwriting municipal bond 
issues swink sold bonds mainly to institutional buyers 
investors likely are protected because the securities investment 
protection corp insures swinks accounts up to 100000 in cash 
and 500000 in securities ms bassett said 
she said she expected the securities dealers association to send 
a representative from new orleans to supervise swinks liquidation 
basically what our office will want to do is get with the 
nasd to make sure somebody monitors to be sure customers are 
covered by swink funds or the insurance pool ms bassett said 
we will also want to see if any state laws have been violated 
swink has been plagued by runins with regulators and investors 
lawsuits since it opened in 1971 as swink amp brittenum inc by 1975 
the firm had split into two companies swink amp co and jon r 
brittenum amp associates run by the former university of arkansas 
quarterback 
in 1986 brittenums firm failed and he received a fiveyear 
suspended prison sentence this year after pleading guilty to theft 
by deception charges he was ordered to perform 100 hours of 
community service and ordered to pay what reportedly could turn out 
to be millions of dollars in restitution 
swinks fortunes dipped more in recent years with the decline of 
the bond market and government cutbacks on municipal bonding 
authorities also more swink underwritings went sour

a plastics recycler and five companies 
that own mcdonalds franchises have gone to court to challenge the 
city of portlands ban on polystyrene foam products used in 
restaurants and other food vending operations 
polystyrene generally known under the brand name styrofoam is 
widely used to package food and drinks in fastfood outlets 
mark cushing the plaintiffs attorney said the lawsuit 
contends the ban scheduled to take effect monday violates 
oregons solid waste control and opportunity to recycle act as well 
as the state and federal constitutions 
in a nutshell we contend that the city has no legal authority 
to ban a recyclable product cushing said 
the lawsuit filed thursday in multnomah county circuit court 
seeks an injunction preventing any enforcement of the ban 
city attorney jeffrey rogers declined to comment on the merits 
of the lawsuit but said the city was prepared to defend the 
ordinance 
although the ban takes effect on monday rogers said the 
ordinance wont be enforced until a judge rules on the request for 
an injunction sometime in midjanuary 
under terms of the ordinance the city serves a written notice 
when it receives a complaint from a citizen or a report from a 
health inspector that a business is violating the ban the city 
must wait at least 20 days after the notice is received before 
sending inspectors to the business to see if the foam ban still is 
being ignored 
if the ban is being violated the business is subject to a 250 
fine on the first offense and a 500 fine on subsequent offenses 
the lawsuit was filed by denton plastics a major plastics 
recycler based in portland and five companies that own most of the 
14 mcdonalds franchises in the city also joining as plaintiffs 
were gerald herman described by rogers as a longtime recycling 
activist and two other companies gage industries a portland 
plastics recycler and irwin research and development a yakima 
wash company that manufactures recycling equipment 
i expect the number of plaintiffs to grow because already 
calls are coming in from delicatessens and small restaurants 
wanting to be a part of the activity cushing said 
the city council first passed the ordinance in november 1988 and 
adopted it officially last january on dec 13 the council voted 
41 to table a proposal by commissioner bob koch to require 
recycling of the material rather than banning it 
barbara george assistant to city commissioner earl blumenauer 
said the council felt that although the industry has quit using 
chlorofluorocarbons in the manufacture of polystyrene they still 
are using gases to blow air into the product and some of those are 
still destroying the ozone layer 
chlorofluorocarbons which damage the earths ozone layer have 
not been used in the manufacture of polystyrene for about three 
years cushing said 
the council also was concerned that the foam products werent 
biodegradable and would be difficult to recycle because of how 
light they are george said the ban does not apply to packing 
material or to polystyrene used in schools hospitals and other 
nonprofit institutions 
im just surprised and sort of disappointed that it happened 
three days before the implementation date george said the 
council approved this a long time ago so people have had fair 
warning i know a lot of restaurants either were complying already 
last year or have since complied with the council policy 
he also said the coated paper product that would replace 
polystyrene is not recyclable and is two to three times as 
expensive as polystyrene 
the ban would affect 2200 businesses in portland including 
1700 restaurants and 500 grocery stores with prepared food 
operations 
george said whether the replacement products are no less 
biodegradable than polystyrene is open to debate

the governments main forecasting gauge of 
economic activity edged up a modest 01 percent last month the 
commerce department said today in a report that analysts took as a 
sign the economy will slow in 1990 but not topple into a recession 
the small rise in the departments index of leading economic 
indicators for november followed a revised 03 percent decline in 
october 
in all the index which is designed to forecast economic 
activity six to nine months in the future has exhibited a sawtooth 
pattern this year rising in six of the past 11 months and falling 
in the other five months 
through november the index was down by 03 percent for the 
year compared with an increase of 39 percent for all of 1988 
to economists this provided evidence that economic activity in 
1990 will be more sluggish than in 1989 
many analysts are predicting that the economy as measured by 
the gross national product will expand at a modest annual rate of 
2 percent or less in 1990 compared with expected growth of 3 
percent this year 
however analysts generally expect the economy will be able to 
escape a recession that belief based in part on the fact that the 
leading index has not yet declined for three consecutive months 
the traditional though not infallible sign of a downturn 
the 01 percent rise in november which was right in line with 
expectations was led by a strong jump in orders for consumer 
goods the other four indicators providing strength were a drop in 
weekly unemployment claims an increase in plant and equipment 
orders a rise in the money supply and an increase in the backlog 
of manufacturers unfilled orders 
six other indicators acted as a drag on the index last month 
with the biggest negative coming from a drop in the price of raw 
materials while such a decrease is considered good news for 
inflation prospects it is counted as a negative in the index 
because it also can reflect declining demand 
other negative factors were a decline in stock prices a drop in 
consumer confidence a decline in the average manufacturing work 
week a decline in building permits and a speedup in business 
delivery times 
the various changes left the index at 1447 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 
the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 3 percent 
in the julyseptember quarter but economists believe the growth 
rate slowed dramatically in the current octoberdecember quarter 
frank mccormick senior economist at the bank of america in san 
francisco said the gnp probably expanded at an annual rate of just 
12 percent in the fourth quarter the government will not release 
its own estimate of this growth rate until next month 
some analysts are even more pessimistic fearing that the gnp 
may not have expanded at all and instead registered a small 
negative number the most pessimistic say the economy may suffer a 
small recession with negative growth in both the fourth quarter and 
the first quarter of next year 
but mccormick discounted this minority view contending that the 
feds easing efforts have come in time to keep alive the expansion 
following the 198182 recession a recovery which already has 
lasted a peacetime record of seven years 
we think we have gone through the slowest growth already this 
quarter and the economy will be gradually picking up through next 
year he said 
that forecast would be good news for the bush administration 
which is counting on continued growth to boost government revenues 
and help reduce the federal deficit without a tax increase

as the economy heads into choppy waters in 1990 
many investors will try to ride out the storm with what they hope 
are recessionresistant stock portfolios 
for the last several months managers at investing institutions 
have been putting their money in stocks whose fortunes appear least 
exposed to the ups and downs of the business cycle 
at the same time they have been shunning auto steel and other 
industrial issues that would presumably be most affected by the 
first general economic slump since the 198182 recession 
the economys slowing down no question about it says peter 
lynch who runs the fidelity magellan fund the nations largest 
stock mutual fund with 124 billion in assets when that happens 
cyclical stocks just dont do very well 
the risk of an economywide slump is higher than at any time 
since the 1982 recession says martin sass president of md 
sass investors services inc an independent moneymanagement firm 
with 38 billion in accounts 
still sass assigns only a 25 percent probability to that 
outcome and says he believes lower interest rates and inflation 
can help bring new life in 1990 to wall streets bull market 
certainly its not the early innings of the ball game he 
observes but i think theres still some more room here 
its no simple trick to devise a stockpicking strategy for 
gains in a rising market while minimizing exposure to losses should 
prices decline 
the traditional way to do that is to concentrate on 
defensive stocks like highyielding utilities and those of 
companies with steady yearin yearout earnings growth 
so it comes as no surprise that consumer noncyclical and 
utility stocks ranked first and second in 1989 among the eight 
sectors of the stock market tracked by dow jones amp co 
from the end of 1988 through dec 26 the consumer noncyclical 
index rose 3786 percent while the overall dow jones equity market 
index posted a 2427 percent gain the utility index climbed 3434 
percent 
that struck a marked contrast with increases of just 1565 
percent for the industrial sector and 51 percent for technology 
stocks 
lynch says those divergent trends have lifted the bigname 
consumer stocks to expensive levels cyclical stocks may look 
cheaper he says but they could go lower still if the business 
outlook keeps darkening 
im still buying stocks every day but ive been letting cash 
build up to about 11 percent of the magellan funds assets he 
says im not finding many outstanding attractive bargains 
sass for his part thinks the time has come to buy cyclical 
issues in such industries as paper aluminum steel and chemicals 
the cyclical stocks have gotten killed he asserts many 
of them are trading at levels that already discount a recession in 
my view 
these companies have gotten more lean more efficient but the 
stocks are very much out of favor and hardly anyone is 
recommending them 
sass pins his hopes that a recession can be avoided partly on 
what he sees as a renewed easing of inflationary pressures as the 
economy slows the inflation rate could be a positive surprise 
in 1990 he says 
he also argues that slowdowns in the pace of business can keep 
occurring in separate areas of the economy as they did through 
much of the 1980s without bringing on a recession 
these rolling readjustments he concludes will permit the 
long us expansion which began in late 1982 to enter its eight 
consecutive year the longest peacetime expansion on record

dresser industries inc has called off its 620 
million offer for smith international inc a houston drill bit 
manufacturer but the oil services company said it is pursuing an 
alternate transaction 
in a oneparagraph news release on thursday dallasbased 
dresser said it was terminating the merger no details were 
provided in the release about the alternative being considered and 
company officials declined to elaborate 
when first announced in november the companies said the deal 
was contingent upon approval by shareholders and federal antitrust 
regulators 
smith is the nations second largest drill bit manufacturer and 
dresser is no 4 some analysts speculated the federal trade 
commission had expressed opposition to the transaction which would 
have put 45 percent of the nations drill bit industry in one 
company 
other analysts suggested smith management may have decided to 
remain independent or had found a better deal than the complicated 
dresser cash securities and debtassumption offer 
yet others suggested dresser had uncovered troubling information 
in its review of smiths finances 
dresser had sought to buy smith to broaden its base in the 
exploration and production side of the oil business especially 
smiths expertise in horizontal drilling considered an important 
technique in the reviving industry

the corporate bond market enjoyed a banner year 
in terms of volume of new issues but the quality of outstanding 
bonds deteriorated and the number of defaulted issues hit its worst 
level of the decade in 1989 
meanwhile the municipal bond market saw moderate growth during 
the year reviving a trend that was distorted by the 1986 federal 
tax changes 
in the corporate market the volume of new bonds in 1989 hit a 
threeyear high of 1337 billion according to a preliminary 
figure compiled by securities data co the figure excludes 
socalled hybrid debt issues such as mortgagebacked securities 
but of the more than 900 billion in publicly traded corporate 
debt outstanding an estimated 6 billion defaulted during the 
year according to moodys investors service inc 
moodys said an estimated 45 corporations stopped making 
payments on their bonds during 1989 that far exceeds the 33 
issuers that defaulted in 1986 the previous record high for the 
1980s moodys said 
moodys projects a continued rise in corporate bond defaults in 
1990 
youre going to find that some of these near misses of 1989 
will default outright in 1990 said john lonski moodys chief 
economist 
standard amp poors corp the other major creditrating company 
does not predict a major increase in defaults this year 
we have not seen a wholesale acrosstheboard decline in 
credit quality over the last six months nor do we see one in 
1990 said gail hessol an sampp managing director 
but she said that projection does not include the troubled 
junk bond market 
we think the world has not yet seen the worst as far as junk 
bond defaults ms hessol said 
all of the corporate bond defaults in 1989 involved junk bonds 
which are highyield highrisk bonds issued by companies with low 
or no credit rating they often are used to raise the funds needed 
for leveraged buyouts in which the assets of the target company 
are pledged as collaterial to raise the cash 
the junk bond market was shaken in 1989 by a number of 
wellpublicized defaults including those of resorts international 
inc and integrated resources inc 
if the economy weakens further as many predict the number of 
defaults this year could be even greater lonski said 
a weak economy is going to make it more difficult to disguise 
the problems of troubled companies he said 
lonski predicts a significant tapering off in new junk bond 
issues this year due mainly to the slowdown in takeovers about 
253 billion worth of junk issues were sold in 1989 down 88 
percent from 1988 according to securities data co 
as for investmentgrade corporate bonds lonski foresees an 
increase in new issues this year if interest rates continue to 
drop these new issues primarily will be sold to refund older 
higherinterest bonds 
in the municipal market a total of about 120 billion in 
longterm new bonds were sold in 1989 according to preliminary 
figures by the public securities association 
that figure is about 35 percent above the 1988 total of 1169 
billion said the psa a trade group for the muni bond industry 
the favorable interest rate environment and pentup demand for 
capital has fueled the increase in issuance said psa president 
heather l ruth 
but both years figures pale in comparison to the 2222 billion 
of state and local bonds issued in 1985 the year before the 1986 
tax law revision that law made it less desirable for banks to own 
municipal bonds drying up a prime customer for the securities and 
placed certain limits on the amounts of the taxfree bonds 
municipal governments may issue 
many municipal and state governments rushed to sell bonds before 
the tax law took effect the volume of new bonds more than doubled 
from 1984 to 1985 
but in the past few years the level of new muni bond sales were 
back to the same trend before there was a rush to market due to 
the tax act said psa vice president caroline m benn 
the psa projects a continued strong supply of muni bonds in 1990 
due to a number of infrastructure projects scheduled to start this 
year including a new airport in denver and a major sewage plant 
project in boston 
in addition the psa predicts that if interest rates continue to 
drop a number of municipalities and states will refund old 
higherinterest bonds

grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed 
friday in a shortened trading session on the chicago board of trade 
trading conditions were thin ahead of the new years weekend 
the markets closed at noon cst 75 minutes earlier than usual 
oldcrop contracts those for delivery through next summer were 
little changed or lower while manyof the newcrop contracts rose 
moderately as traders began to think about the 1990 growing season 
said dale gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in 
chicago 
he said current stocks of grains and soybeans are more than 
adequate and there is no danger of supply tightness 
but any adverse weather beginning next spring could affect next 
years crops gustafson said and with this winter starting out as 
a hard one some traders already are anticipating crop difficulties 
in the new year 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in march at 409 a bushel corn was cent lower to 
1 cents higher with march at 239 a bushel oats were cent to 
cents lower with march at 153 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with january at 568 a bushel

consumer inflation is likely to pick up over the 
next month or so generating complaints from shoppers but barely 
producing a reaction of any sort from economists 
this is the reverse of how it was last year when tense 
economists trained telescopes on the horizon stepping back from 
time to time to issue warnings about the ogres approach 
consumers meanwhile hardly worried 
all in all the consumers were right inflation did make a thrust 
early in the year accompanied by shrill warnings from the 
economists but it has been diminishing since then somehow 
consumers knew all along 
this time however the increase in prices will be hitting in 
especially sensitive areas of the market place particularly at the 
fruit and vegetable counters and in the monthly bill from the 
heating fuel supplier 
some of the price jumps such as 35 percent from some heating 
oil dealers might remind people of the late and unlamented 1970s 
when prices changed so fast that people bought in advance of need 
figuring theyd save that way 
but none of this is likely to excite forecasters the very ones 
who raised the alarm in 1989 it isnt systemic this time they 
explain meaning that the cause lies in isolated temporary factors 
rather than a faulty economy 
still that economic assumption might not be as sound as it 
seems relying as it does on still another forecast this one of 
meteorological conditions 
weather over the years has demonstrated that it presents 
forecasting problems equal or worse than those encountered in 
economics nevertheless the relative calmness of economists is 
based on a quick return to normal weather 
winter came early savagely and relentlessly to much of the 
northern tier of the united states and thrust cold waves deep into 
the south 
in the north and in much of the south too it meant higher fuel 
usage the threat of shortgages and higher prices making matters 
worse it forced some refineries to close farther south it 
destroyed vegetable and fruit crops 
economists now assume the severe weather factor will abate 
although like so many of their assumptions about politics for 
example they have very little expertise in the area regardless 
they say winter ends in three months 
meanwhile there could be an economic effect of an opposite sort 
because of added costs in the food and fuel areas millions of 
consumers might have less to spend on other goods and services 
that could lead to lower prices for some items enough even to 
offset the food and fuel inflation 
moreover if the cold weather continues in this city it 
averaged more than 10 degrees a day below normal for december it 
could further reduce demand by making it too uncomfortable to look 
for cars and houses 
thus those higher food and fuel prices that will have people 
grumbling over the next few weeks arent likely to bother the 
professional inflation watchers 
as they see it those higher prices are isolated and temporary 
why they say it is even possible they could help lower inflation

a shot of oj with a heating oil chaser was the new years drink 
of choice in the commodity pits 
orange juice futures rallied this past week after a damaging 
freeze in the florida citrus belt and heating oil for january 
delivery finished with a record high 
on other markets precious metals futures nosedived most grain 
and soybean futures fell and livestock and meat futures were 
little changed 
frozen concentrated orange juice for delivery in january soared 
21 percent during the holidayshortened fourday trading week 
settling friday at 16565 a pound on the new york cotton exchange 
compared with 137 a week earlier 
the contract jumped 16 cents on tuesday alone as traders 
returned from the long christmas weekend to reports of widespread 
damage to the florida orange crop 
buying pressure eased on wednesday when profittaking took the 
january contract down nearly 3 cents but the rally resumed 
thursday from news that brazil a major supplier of orange juice to 
the united states was suspending juice exports until next week 
when an official estimate of the florida damage is expected 
analysts said brazilian imports could increase by 20 percent 
because of the florida freeze they said brazilian officials are 
probably trying to decide whether to raise the prices of their 
orange juice 
futures prices jumped again friday amid forecasts for a return 
to normal temperatures in florida this weekend a warmup would 
hasten the falling and rotting of freezedamaged fruit and make it 
more vulnerable to spoilage 
quite frankly for some growers in florida this has been a 
disaster said bert ruiz a vice president of balfour maclaine 
futures inc 
on the other hand he said speculators who bought the market 
prior to the christmastime freeze were paid handsomely 
the contract for january delivery of home heating oil expired 
friday at a record high of 106 a gallon the new york mercantile 
exchange compared with 8174 a week earlier a 30 percent gain 
just one month ago january heating oil was trading at about 62 
cents a gallon 
jay klopfenstein head of norwood securities inc in chicago 
called the markets gains a onceinadecade type of movement 
analyst peter beutel of elders futures inc described the december 
rally as one of the most spectacular bull moves in heating oil of 
all time 
the rally was largely linked to the unusually cold weather in 
recent weeks which caused shortages of home heating oil on the 
cash market the problem has been most severe in the heavily 
populated northeast where this december has been among the coldest 
ever 
january heating oil rose sharply on tuesday and wednesday then 
retreated thursday after hitting 102 a gallon early in the day 
the market seemed to have peaked but buyers roared back on 
friday and bid the price up to 106 by the close reflecting 
uncertainty over next weeks weather 
the late rally raised speculation that the market will continue 
to surge when trading resumes next week

a widely watched measure of the labor market 
sent out weak signals in november a business research group 
reported monday 
the conference board said the helpwanted index dropped six 
points in november erasing almost all of octobers fivepoint gain 
the seasonally adjusted index fell to 145 in november from 
octobers 151 and septembers 146 the november reading was 11 
points lower than the year earlier level 
as the decade ends the economy is not now growing fast enough 
to keep up with the rise in the workingage population 
conference board economist ken goldstein said consequently new 
entrants or reentrants to the workforce spend a little more time 
finding jobs he said 
clearly this is a weakened labor market but not a declining 
one he said noting that the us unemployment rate probably 
will edge up in 1990 
the jobless rate was 54 percent in november up from 53 
percent in october and the same as in november of 1988 goldstein 
said the rate may rise to 58 percent by june 
job advertising volume fell in seven of the nine regions of the 
country measured by the new yorkbased research group only the 
east south central and mountain regions showed increases while new 
england continued to be the weakest as it has been for several 
months 
the helpwanted index is based on ad volume in 51 major 
newspapers across the country the conference board says ad volume 
has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions and provides 
a gauge of change in the supply of jobs

from the budget deficit to bad loans from 
bankruptcies to unsaleable junk bonds one of the biggest 
unfinished stories of 1989 boils down to borrowed money 
the consequences of selling trading and repackaging debt are 
only now beginning to bubble to the surface economists and 
financial strategists say 
whats still unfinished is determining how excessive was the 
excess lending said james grant a creditmarket analyst who 
writes a newsletter about interest rate trends 
thats not just the unfinished business of the year but of the 
decade grant said so what well discover as the 90s roll in 
is just how reckless was reckless 
the final weeks of the year left the federal budget deficit 
growing so fast it could bump against the 100 billion grammrudman 
annual ceiling eight months before the fiscal year ends 
threatening to provoke a new round of cuts in government aid 
programs at a time when the ranks of the poor are growing 
bankers on both coasts have suddenly realized what their 
counterparts in the oil and farming regions have known for years a 
declining property market makes mortgages to many homebuyers and 
developers unprofitable compounding the default problems raised by 
other risky lending 
i think our society is debt fragile said robert dugger 
chief economist of the american bankers association in washington 
and a major part of the unfinished business left over for the 
1990s is correcting the statutory tax incentives we have to use 
debt rather than equity to finance 
some banking analysts now worry that a severe economic decline 
could cause an alarming number of bank failures forcing the 
government to rescue depositor funds with the kind of 
megabilliondollar bailout it faces from the savings and loan 
crisis 
on the corporate level the twilight of 1989 left some 
highprofile companies in almost hopeless hock and others battling 
for time to pay their bills a partial result of an unprecedented 
era of debtfinanced takeovers 
the end of the year also cast a shadow on the 200 billion 
market for highyield highrisk ious known as junk bonds once 
considered the wonderdrug of finance but now shunned by many 
investors and banks fearful of getting burned 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co an aggressive 
user of junk bonds for takeovers watched one of its debtfinanced 
companies retreat to bankruptcy court this past week hillsborough 
holdings corp formed by kohlberg to acquire building materials 
maker jim walter corp for 24 billion sought chapter 11 
protection 
perhaps the biggest junk bond casualty is campeau corp the 
giant retailer now facing relentless pressure from creditors and 
suppliers who want reassurances theyll get paid campeaus stores 
owe more than 7 billion which has forced the parent company to 
put its crown jewel the swank bloomingdales chain up for sale 
such problems tend to set off chain reactions for example 
campeaus inability to pay suppliers could derail another big 
debtfinanced takeover the 3 billion acquisition of 
sheetandtowel maker west pointpepperell by chicago industrialist 
william farley maker of fruit of the loom underwear 
if campeau cant pay west pointpepperell farley might have to 
sell fruit of the loom to pay his debts the financial equivalent 
of selling the underwear off his back 
all these fellows need nice pliable suggestable lenders who 
have belatedly woken up grant said in the debt financing

energy futures prices surged friday as a late 
rally boosted heating oil to a sixyear high on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
heating oil for delivery in january which had declined thursday 
after a twoweek rise jumped 547 cents to finish at 10187 
helped by a wave of frenzied buying in the final 30 minutes of 
trading 
heating oil last closed higher on jan 27 1984 when it settled 
at 10497 said pat kelly an exchange official the contract 
traded as high as 110 a gallon an alltime high before easing 
off 
analysts attributed much of the gains to lastminute buying 
ahead of the january contracts expiration at the close of trading 
nevertheless the buying spree surprised many traders said 
peter beutel energy analyst with elders futures inc 
it came on the last trading day of the contract that 
definitely helped beutel said 
heating oil contracts for later delivery posted gains of between 
060 cent and 127 cents a gallon 
meanwhile wholesale unleaded gasoline futures also soared 
boosted by an industry report that showed a sharp drop in supplies 
the january unleaded gasoline contract which also expired friday 
rose 311 cents to end at 6322 cents a gallon in a modified 
trading session other contracts gained between 105 cents and 2 
cents 
trading ended at 1 pm est because of the new years holiday 
west texas intermediate the main us grade of crude oil 
finished at 2182 per 42gallon barrel up 32 cents on the 
exchange later contracts advanced between 16 cents and 34 cents 
the real surprise was the sharp gains in gasoline said bob 
baker energy analyst with prudentialbache securities inc the 
draw on inventories simply was a surprise for the market 
the american petroleum institute in its weekly inventory 
report said that gasoline supplies fell 48 million barrels last 
week to 2217 million barrels 
heating oil and other distillate fuel oil stocks declined 4 
million barrels to 1122 million and crude oil inventories declined 
by 43 million barrels to 3435 million 
analysts said investor concern over possible tight supplies of 
oil and gasoline fueled some of the buying even though the effects 
of the recordsetting cold snap that boosted the price of heating 
oil in recent days was believed to be tapering off heating oil has 
risen 45 percent since dec 15 when it closed at 7042 cents a 
gallon 
while demand for heating oil and other domestic fuels remains 
strong actual shortages are not expected to occur they said 
nevertheless refinery problems in some southern states remained 
a concern observers said 
people decided that if refining problems are going to be the 
norm gasoline is going to be bullish said linda simard energy 
broker for drexel burnham lambert inc 
analysts said investors are expecting further refinery problems 
if unseasonably cold weather persists in january and february 
frigid weather in the last two weeks has caused operating 
problems at several texas and louisiana refineries some plants 
closed temporarily and others cut back operations while crude oil 
shipments were delayed in some parts of the country 
heating oil prices got a boost early in the week after last 
sundays explosion at exxon corps baton rouge la refinery the 
plant closed since the explosion was expected to resume partial 
operations this weekend exxon officials said

the australian brewing interests of bond 
corp holdings ltd were placed in receivership friday by a state 
supreme court after national australia bank ltd a major lender 
requested the action 
the court decision raised speculation that similar action might 
be taken by bonds other creditors and force into receivership the 
entire group of companies held by the company which is controlled 
by millionaire alan bond 
in theory it could trigger the repayment of every other 
facility we have said peter lucas executive director of bond 
corp it could bring bond down 
bond chairman of the cashstrapped media brewing natural 
resources and property company vowed to fight the decision and 
immediately launched rival court action to fend off the 
receivership 
the court ruling in the state of victoria followed bond corps 
disclosure that it planned to sell its australian brewing assets 
among bonds main businesses 
the move cast further doubt on the future of the g heileman 
brewing co based in la crosse wis bond purchased heileman in 
1987 for about 13 billion and reportedly still owes about 850 
million after selling the profitable heileman baking co and other 
heileman subsidiaries 
in november heileman announced it was given a waiver on its 
loans from us and canadian banks the company said the agreements 
with creditors would give it until next june to rebound from a 
declining market share and sales 
telephone calls by the associated press to heileman offices 
friday in la crosse were not answered 
national australia bank which requested the court action is a 
major lender to bond corp national australia bank heads a 
syndicate of banks which it says is owed 880 million australian 
dollars or 695 million us by bond corp 
the banks include first national bank of boston hong kong amp 
shanghai banking corp toronto dominion bank mitsubishi trust amp 
banking corp and standard chartered plc of britain 
bond issued a statement friday saying the brewing units have not 
missed any principal or interest payments to the australia bankled 
syndicate 
bond corp also stated that in light of the strong financial 
condition of the breweries there is absolutely no foundation for 
the allegation that a serious deterioration in the business puts 
the lenders at risk 
the bond units included in fridays court action include bond 
brewing holdings ltd bond brewing investments pty swan brewery 
co castlemaine perkins ltd tooheys ltd and bbh securities pty 
the banks announcement came hours after bond corp announced it 
had reached agreement to sell its australian breweries to its 58 
per cent owned bell resources ltd for 2 billion australian 
dollars or 16 billion us 
bond corp had proposed in may to sell its brewing assets 
including heileman but the company later changed plans and 
postponed the sale of the us company 
in its fiscal year ended june 30 bond corp lost 9802 million 
australian dollars the largest annual loss in australian corporate 
history much of the loss was due to onetime writedowns of the 
value of some of bond corps assets

fur retailer antonovich inc announced friday it 
has sought federal bankruptcy court protection because of financial 
problems caused in part by a weak fur market 
the new yorkbased company which runs nine stores in new york 
new jersey and connecticut blamed serious cash flow 
difficulties for its decision to file for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
the cash crunch was created by a number of serious problems 
over the past few months the company said but did not 
elaborate company executives refused to discuss the situation 
the financial trouble developed despite a 4 million infusion 
antonovich received in july when investors bought a controlling 
interest in the company 
peter masanotti a fairfield conn attorney with the law firm 
representing antonovich said the bankruptcy court filing was 
necessary now because the company faces a series of hefty payments 
to lenders in the next few months 
masanotti said weakness in the market also has contributed to 
antonovichs troubles 
fur sales have been in a slump that started with the october 
1987 stock market crash industry analysts say more recently 
prices have been weighed down by an oversupply 
antonovich and the two other major publicly traded fur companies 
all experienced losses in their past two fiscal years 
as of dec 1 antonovich had about 204 million in liabilities 
and 188 million in assets according to document filed in us 
bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
phil bell antonovichs president said in a news release that 
the company intends to reorganize and will continue operating 
during bankruptcy court proceedings besides selling furs 
antonovich provides related services such as storage cleaning 
repair restyling and insurance 
our current sales and sales projections are encouraging and 
at this juncture we are optimistic bell said

the planned 1992 unification of europe and the opening of the 
eastern bloc created the prospect of economic opportunities that 
propelled major foreign stock markets to doubledigit gains in 1989 
investors worldwide scrambled to put money on the continent 
us investors pumped money into mutual funds that invest in europe 
and the japanese set up their own stock funds invested specifically 
in west german companies seen as the most immediate beneficiaries 
of the iron curtains collapse 
in the past two months foreign appetite for german stocks has 
helped boost the frankfurt market to an annual net gain of 35 
percent 
but germanys market performance was not an isolated one key 
stock indices in london and milan also rose impressively as did 
the worlds largest stock market japan 
japans stock market seemed to be on a recordsetting spree 
throughout the year the 225issue nikkei stock average opened the 
year at a record high of 3024366 it finished the year friday at 
3891587 the fourth consecutive day of record closings and a 29 
percent gain over 1988 
analysts in tokyo said the market overcame a number of obstacles 
this year including the death of emperor hirohito in january 
political instability currency fluctuations and fear of creeping 
inflation 
the markets strength was underscored in october when the nikkei 
failed to follow wall streets precipitous oct 13 drop when the 
dow jones industrial average fell 71 percent in value 
the key british stock index fell 32 percent and the frankfurt 
market lost 132 percent in response to wall streets drop but 
tokyo shares declined only 18 percent before rebounding 
despite the minicrash the biggest event of the year is the 
opening up of eastern europe said robert rolland executive vice 
president at shearson lehman hutton inc in new york thats 
definitely the theme going into the 90s and it obviously 
overshadows any oneday drop in the stock market 
in frankfurt the faz 100share index rose 35 percent to finish 
the year at 74090 up from 54986 at the start of 1989 
rolland characterized the recent buying of german stocks and 
stock funds particularly by the japanese as almost a 
frenzy because german stocks typically are not split their 
prices can become prohibitively expensive deutsche bank for 
example is trading in the 490ashare range 
but the germany fund a closedend mutual fund that trades on 
the new york stock exchange can be had for 19 a share rolland 
said about a year ago the germany fund sold for 662 a share 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
finished the year at 24227 up from 17931 at the beginning of 
1989 investors were attracted to british companies because they 
have issued little debt in comparison to their american 
counterparts 
but volume was disappointing prompting investment firms to cut 
costs through layoffs and other measures 
elsewhere in europe takeover fever gripped france in 1989 and 
helped push the cac40 index up 27 percent on the year 
not only was it takeovers driving the market but the 
possibility of takeovers ahead of 1992 when europe will meld 
into a single barrierfree market rolland said 
among the larger deals the bank holding company cie financiere 
de suez took over cie industrielle and its insurance subsidiary 
groupe victoire for about 41 billion after a brief but bitter 
fight 
in italy the key bci index rose 17 percent from 58972 to 
68744 on friday italy also is positioning itself for 1992 but 
the countrys overwhelming debt which roughly equals its gross 
national product has created drag on the stock market experts 
say 
theres a perception of negativity in italy said guy stern 
an analyst at abd securities corp in new york they have to 
reevaluate their national strategy and how they will expand 
the italian market began to rally in late may when giant fiat 
announced a major share buyback program but stumbled later over an 
italian banks unauthorized loans to the iraqi government the 
country was dealt a further blow when fiat failed to strike a deal 
with the swedish automaker saab which instead allied itself with 
general motors corp 
the unheralded growth market was spain it is not yet attracting 
much foreign capital and the madrid general index rose just 8 
percent this year but stern noted that spain has the fastest 
growing gross domestic product of any european country with the 
exception of portugal

airport border guards abruptly revoked the 
passport and exit visa of a soviet strike leader friday as he was 
to board a flight to the united states to meet american union 
leaders the us embassy filed a strong protest 
embassy spokesman jim bullock said the united states considered 
the action a violation of what us officials have been told would 
be the new freeexit policy 
soviet officials previously had authorized the us 
governmentsponsored trip by 10 leaders of last summers national 
coal strike soviet citizens must obtain an exit visa for each trip 
out of the country 
but permission was refused at the last minute for sergei v 
masalovich a strike leader from vorkuta in the soviet arctic 
bullock said 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman sergei komolov said 
masalovichs visa was canceled because the trade union committee in 
vorkuta had stripped him of his duties on the strike committee 
so he cannot be part of the official delegation but may 
reapply for a visa for a private visit komolov said 
the miners were chosen for the trip by their strike committees 
bullock responded that masalovich was traveling on the personal 
invitation of the us ambassador and an organization cannot 
cancel an invitation to a private individual he said 
bullock said embassy officials did not know if masalovich had 
been removed from the strike committee and that it was irrelevant 
even if true 
bullock also denied the foreign ministrys claim that the 
embassy had been notified we find the foreign ministry statement 
to be false and incomprehensible he said 
hundreds of thousands of coal miners went on strike in july in 
the soviet unions first nationwide work stoppage in decades the 
government quickly gave in saying complaints of poor social and 
economic conditions were justified but the struggling soviet 
economy has been hardpressed to fulfill those promises of more 
soap food and social programs 
miners in vorkuta famed in the soviet union as the site of 
harsh prison camps under former leader josef stalin struck again 
in october for five weeks saying the government failed to keep its 
promises to increase pensions and wages and to improve living 
conditions 
the miners are scheduled to meet with us labor leaders 
including aflcio head lane kirkland

heatingoil futures prices rebounded to close at a sixyear high 
friday and gasoline futures climbed sharply on indications that the 
push to produce more heating oil is taking a toll on gasoline 
supplies 
orange juice futures also rose dramatically as temperatures in 
florida continued to warm threatening further damage to oranges 
stricken by last weekends freeze 
on other commodity markets precious metals advanced grains and 
soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
heating oil futures settled 60 cent to 547 cents higher on the 
new york mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in 
january up 547 cents a 10187 a gallon 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 16 cent to 34 cent 
higher with february at 2182 a barrel unleaded gasoline was 11 
cent to 311 cents higher with january at 6322 cents a gallon 
heating oil last closed higher on jan 27 1984 when it settled 
at 10497 said pat kelly an exchange official the contract 
traded as high as 110 a gallon an alltime high before easing 
off 
trading ended at 1 pm est because of the new years holiday 
analysts attributed much of the gains in heating oil to 
lastminute buying ahead of the january contracts expiration at 
the close of trading 
this possibly ends one of the most spectacular bull moves in 
heating oil of all time said analyst peter beutel of elders 
futures inc 
wholesale unleaded gasoline futures were boosted by an industry 
report that showed a sharp drop in supplies 
the american petroleum institute in its weekly inventory 
report said gasoline supplies fell 48 million barrels last week 
to 2217 million barrels 
heating oil and other distillate fuel oil stocks declined 4 
million barrels to 1122 million and crude oil inventories declined 
by 43 million barrels to 3435 million 
this is normally the low point of the year for gasoline 
prices said william hinton an energy broker with stotler amp co 
but since theyre really so pumped up trying to make heating oil 
i think maybe the gasoline season is on 
orange juice futures rocketed higher on the new york cotton 
exchange supported by forecasts for a return to near normal

standard amp poors corp predicted friday that 
inflation will remain near 4 percent in 1990 after opening the 
year on a price surge inspired by recent cold weather 
the december cold wave will leave us with a january hangover 
of higher prices for heating oil other energy and fresh fruits and 
vegetables sampp chief economist david m blitzer said in sampps 
semiannual consumer price forecast but the damage will be 
temporary and prices will return to their recent 4 percent track 
blitzer said the soft economy will push consumer price inflation 
below 4 percent by late in the year 
sampp is an investment advisory service that also rates debt 
securities and distributes a series of widely followed stock 
indexes 
through november consumer prices have risen at an annual rate 
of 46 percent enough to cause the federal reserve to move 
cautiously 
four percent inflation doesnt disturb most politicians or 
most people but it does bother the federal reserve he said 
even with a soft economy the fed will continue to watch the 
inflation measures very carefully 
inflation has been close to 4 percent since 1983 the first full 
year of the current record economic expansion however entering 
the eighth year of strong growth without a substantial decline in 
inflation is rather frustrating blitzer said 
sampp also predicted that air travel will rise 2 percent in 1990 
although bargain hunters should still find good deals domestic 
auto prices may drop clothing prices will stabilize or drop 
gasoline prices will level out and food prices will remain in 
check

we have interviewed many candidates and are confident that we 
have the best qualified person for the job vlasic said in a

said a successor to mcgovern would be named early next year 
moran said he did not know whom the board picked and could

bond prices fell moderately friday after a 
survey of chicago purchasing executives indicated strength in the 
manufacturing sector of the economy 
the treasurys 30year bond fell 532 point or about 156 per 
1000 face amount its yield edged up to 797 percent from 796 
percent late thursday 
analysts said an initial report that chicago purchasing managers 
were reporting a slowdown in the economy gave the market a lift 
but when the report was corrected showing strength among 
industrial firms bond prices turned downward 
traders believe the federal reserve is more likely to relax 
credit and allow interest rates to fall if the economy is slowing 
the report of a pickup in the economy led them to believe the fed 
would not push rates downward 
the national association of purchasing management will issue its 
monthly survey on the economy next week traders are looking to 
that report and the governments unemployment figures for possible 
signals on how the fed might act 
trading was extremely light friday as most traders had closed 
their books for the year 
the federal funds rate often an important reflection of the 
feds credit policy fell dramatically as the central bank added 
funds to the system to help banks meet their yearend needs 
the rate which closed at 9 percent on thursday fell to 7 
percent 
analysts said the extra reserves were needed by banks for the 
long weekend 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged to 132 point lower intermediate 
maturities were off 116 point and longterm issues were down about 
316 point according to telerate inc the financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 093 to 118841 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 782 percent as the 
discount dropped 9 basis points to 758 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills rose to 799 percent as the discount picked up 7 
basis points to close at 759 percent yields on oneyear bills 
rose to 775 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 724 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 116 point to 93 1432 the average

the stock market put a final flourish on the 
money decade by climbing to record highs in 1989 
but the years advance paid out its benefits very unevenly for 
example rewarding investors in energy while stinting on high 
technology and industrial america 
many of the markets biggest winners and losers for the year 
underwent drastic form reversals from earlier in the decade 
anyone who witnessed the depression of the mid1980s in the 
nations oil patch might have been startled to see the list of 
1989s best performing stock groups as compiled by dow jones amp co 
through dec 26 
oil drilling ranked no 1 up 8702 percent oilfield equipment 
and services no 3 up 5626 percent and pipelines no 6 up 5293 
percent 
their resurgence heralded a rebound in prices of energy 
commodities which was given extra impetus by a blast of frigid 
winter weather across much of the nation in the last few weeks of 
the decade 
energy will be an enduring theme throughout the 90s 
asserted john connolly an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc 
with us oil production clearly in decline the nonopec free 
world has now flattened out meanwhile demand is rising inexorably 
as conservation and substitution wane 
at the other end of the spectrum stood the computer its image 
badly faded in the investment world from the moment just a few 
years earlier when time magazine accorded it the status of 
machine of the year 
computer stocks down 1861 percent had an uncontested hold on 
last place in the dow jones group rankings for a year marked by a 
steady stream of earnings disappointments in the industry 
the most celebrated downer among the computer stocks was 
international business machines which fell to its lowest levels 
since 1983 and finished the year below 100 far short of the peak 
of 175 it reached in 1987 
but ibm the longtime darling of investing institutions was by 
no means alone in the doghouse unisys the product of a 1986 
merger between burroughs and sperry and prime computer both 
sustained drops of more than 50 percent at their low points for the 
year 
the question many investors were asking as the 1990s began was 
the earnings growth potential of the computer dissipating turning 
it into just another cyclical industrial commodity 
between extremes like that the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 4181 points in the last week of the year to 
275320 
that left the average up 58463 points or 2696 percent for 
1989 and up 191446 points or 22825 percent for the decade 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 309 at 19504 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 1025 at 45482 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 716 at 37800

some of the brightest stars among individual stocks for 1989 
were closedend investment companies formed in recent years to 
invest in the stock markets of countries as diverse as switzerland

the spain malaysia thai and asia pacific funds all ranked high 
on the list of percentage gainers they were joined as the year 
drew to a close by the germany and austria funds amid intense 
demand for potential beneficiaries of the opening of eastern europe

the recent weatherrelated jump in energy and wholesale food 
prices should have a minimal impact on interest rates barring 
severe crop or oil shortages but frigid temperatures in coming 
months could chill investors inflation outlook economists said 
thursday 
a recordsetting cold snap in the past week has heavily damaged 
fruit and vegetable crops in such major growing areas as florida 
and texas and sent heating oil prices soaring in many parts of the 
country 
the price of home heating oil and other fuels such as propane 
and kerosene have nearly doubled in some areas in the last two 
weeks as demand surged and supplies dwindled cold weather closed 
some refineries in texas and louisiana and curtailed crude oil 
shipments in some states 
on the new york mercantile exchange nearmonth heating oil 
futures jumped more than 40 percent in two weeks from 7042 cents 
a gallon on december 15 for the nearterm contract to 9971 cents 
on wednesday prices fell 331 cents to 9640 cents a gallon on 
thursday 
but economists believe the current weatherrelated price rise is 
temporary as such it is unlikely to produce a longterm change in 
the inflation outlook that would prompt the federal reserve to 
increase interest rates in an attempt to stem rising prices 
the federal reserve would be out of its mind if it changed 
economic policy because its snowing in florida said susan 
lakatos economist with kidder peabody amp co 
if the heating oil situation were so serious and widespread 
that it created shortages and closed factories we could expect some 
impact on interest rates but there is no indication of that she 
said 
nevertheless the rise in heating oil prices and the deep freeze 
that has damaged citrus and other crops have confused the inflation 
outlook prospects for a drop in interest rates in early 1990 are 
being put on hold analysts said 
higher energy and food prices have also altered the inflationary 
psychology of the credit and financial markets with investors less 
sure the fed would act to loosen credit and push interest rates 
lower said john silvia economist with kemper financial services 
inc in chicago 
instead of expecting the fed to ease in january as before 
people will be a lot less optimistic with respect to inflation 
even though everyone knows its a temporary situation silvia 
said and the fed will be slower to ease than it might have 
been 
david h resler chief financial economist for nomura securities 
international inc said the rise in heating oil prices may have 
contributed to the rise in shortterm interest rates in recent days 
the federal funds rate the interest commercial banks charge 
each other for shortterm loans surged to 9 percent on thursday 
from 819 percent last friday after holding relatively steady 
during the rest of december 
in a thin market with relatively few players around anxieties 
run higher than normal resler said 
but investor worries may be premature resler said that because 
food and fuel are considered nondiscretionary items in a household 
budget higher prices for those produces could mean individuals 
simply would cut back on purchases in other areas 
if i get stuck with oil bills 50 percent higher than usual 
the harsh reality is that i will have to spend less on something 
else resler said over time that would exert downward pressure 
on other prices 
peter greenbaum economist with smith barney harris upham amp 
co said that food and energy normally are separated from other 
inflation indices because of their shortterm volatility and while 
higher prices for heating oil citrus fruit and vegetables likely 
will push the december and january wholesale price indexes up it 
should not amount to a sustained rise in prices he said 
the core inflation rate should be insulated from these 
effects greenbaum said

united airlines trans world airlines and 
eastern airlines said friday they were considering new surcharges 
on tickets to help cover the skyrocketing cost of jet fuel 
other airlines also may be weighing the measure which if 
imposed would be the first special fuel surcharge by the airlines 
since the 1970s oil crisis 
it is a fare increase said louis marckesano an airline 
analyst at the philadelphia brokerage janney montgomery scott inc 
its going to raise the cost of the ticket 
a fuel surcharge likely would be figured into fares rather than 
charged separately analysts suggested they speculated the 
airlines might charge around 3 per ticket 
earlier this week in an effort to lure passengers during the 
slow winter months the nations big airlines cut fares as much as 
30 percent in selected markets 
oil prices have been catapulted higher recently by the 
recordsetting cold snap and refinery problems in texas and 
louisiana jet fuel which represents around 35 percent of an 
airlines operating budget has jumped to 96 cents a gallon from 64 
cents at the end of october 
every 1 cent rise in the price of jet fuel costs us airlines a 
total 150 million a year according to the air transport 
association an industry group in washington dc 
it has been a precipitous and unprecedented increase in fuel 
prices considering there hasnt been a disruption in 
supplies said robin matell a spokesman for eastern at its 
headquarters in miami were reviewing the situation and suspect 
other carriers are doing the same in that sense a surcharge 
cannot be ruled out 
don morrison a twa spokesman in st louis mo said were 
in the process of looking at some fuel data we are looking at some 
possibilities 
united the nations secondlargest airline also is pondering a 
charge said rob doughty a spokesman in chicago were looking 
at it no decisions been made he said 
the airline spokesmen all declined to give further details 
on thursday explaining a new hike in northeast shuttle fares 
from 99 one way to 119 on weekdays trump shuttle cited increased 
costs for fuel and other expenses trump shuttle officials werent 
immediately available for comment friday on whether they were 
weighing a surcharge as well 
spokesmen for delta air lines usair group inc and pan am corp 
said those airlines were not considering a fuel surcharge at the 
present time 
a special fuel surcharge would not require government approval 
for domestic flights 
such a charge hasnt been imposed in the united states since 
1973 when oil prices rose steeply and the federal government 
allowed the airlines to raise fares a few dollars to help cover 
costs the us airline industry was deregulated in october 1978 
since then other types of surcharges have been instituted for 
airport security and for the airport and airway trust fund some 
us carriers such as pan am and twa add 5 to the cost of a 
transatlantic ticket to cover security screening for international 
flights 
the aviation trust fund is supplied by an 8 percent tax that is 
included in fares because of pressure to reduce the federal budget 
deficit neither the white house nor congress has been willing to 
dip into the fund which hit 69 billion in september 
under legislation before congress the money would be released 
to pay for devices to detect plastic explosives in baggage 
fuel surcharges are a way of life in europe said paul turk

the government said its chief barometer of 
future economic activity edged up 01 percent in november a tiny 
increase seen by many analysts as evidence that growth in 1990 will 
be modest at best 
the commerce department said friday the small rise in its index 
of leading economic indicators followed a revised 03 percent 
decline in october 
for most of the year the leading index has been flashing 
signals that the us economy was headed for a rather dramatic 
slowdown in growth and analysts said the weak november showing did 
not change that picture

workers feel increasingly insecure at their jobs 
and are worried about layoffs in 1990 an informal callin survey 
sponsored by a jobcounseling company found 
about 600 of the 1100 people who participated in the national 
callin were employed and nearly half of that number 44 percent 
felt 1990 would bring significant changes for them in the 
workplace the firm challenger gray amp christmas said friday 
the survey is not scientific because it was not a random

united airlines trans world airlines and 
eastern airlines said they were considering new surcharges on 
tickets to help cover the skyrocketing cost of jet fuel 
other airlines also may be weighing the measure which if 
imposed would be the first special fuel surcharge by the airlines 
since the 1970s oil crisis 
a fuel surcharge likely would be figured into fares rather than 
charged separately analysts suggested friday they speculated the 
airlines might charge around 3 per ticket

business reached its zenith with the record 2453 billion buyout 
of rjr nabisco inc there were two fewer deals 933 but the 
acquisitions totaled a record 1831 billion 
leveraged buyouts the debtfinanced deals so popular a year 
ago dropped even more sharply there were 22 lbos announced during 
the fourth quarter of 1989 totaling 155 billion down 85 
percent from the 49 deals worth 1022 billion in the last quarter 
of 1988 
the figures compiled by the financial research firm securities 
data corp were unsurprising the takeover business has been 
devastated over the past year by the failure of campeau corps 
66 billion buyout of federated department stores inc and the 
subsequent collapse of the market in junk bonds the highinterest 
securities used to finance many buyouts 
the enthusiasm that takeover strategists and their bankers once 
displayed was replaced by caution in 1989 over the year 1447 
purchases of us businesses worth a total of 3627 billion were 
announced down 29 percent in value from the 1543 acquisitions 
worth 5115 billion in 1988 
securities data considered transactions worth 10 million or 
more in compiling its figures 
the 1989 record of kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the company 
that bought rjr nabisco is an illustration of how times have 
changed 
in 1988 kohlberg kravis considered the leader among leveraged 
buyout firms announced four transactions worth 2788 billion 
excluding rjr nabisco the companys other deals totaled 335 
billion 
but in 1989 kohlberg kravis participated in one deal worth just 
310 million the buyout of several small divisions of macmillan 
inc 
kohlberg kravis likely adopted the same cautious stance that 
other prospective acquirers have had to take 
ruth pachman a spokeswoman for the firm declined to say that 
kohlberg kravis had become more conservative however she said 
theyre not going to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal 
kohlberg kravis although buoyed by the stellar performance of 
rjr nabisco this year has had to contend with financial problems 
at some of its smaller units that may have put a crimp into some of 
its acquisition plans 
earlier this week hillsborough holdings corp formed as part 
of kohlberg kravis takeover of homebuilder jim walter corp filed 
for federal bankruptcy court protection 
another kohlberg kravis company seaman furniture co has been 
forced to reschedule its debt payments and a third company sci 
television inc also is trying to renegotiate its debt 
the slowdown in takeovers also was evident in financing of deals 
and merchant banking activity securities data said 
there were 67 junk bond offerings raising a total of 141 
billion in 1989 with 4 billion of that amount attributable to 
just one deal the rjr nabisco buyout in 1988 there were 90 junk 
bond offerings that raised 164 billion securities data said 
meanwhile major investment banks participated directly in 82 
deals worth 248 billion this past year in 1988 there were 83 
such transactions but they totaled 955 billion far 
outdistancing the 1989 total

freezing weather is putting the squeeze on 
supplies of florida orange juice and heating oil but its 
providing hot profits for speculators who own those commodities on 
paper 
speculative trader george booth estimates his customers will 
make 700000 to 1 million off the florida freeze 
the norwood hyacinth fund a public futures fund managed by dunn 
capital management inc in stuart fla tallied profits of 
383000 in the heatingoil futures market from nov 22 through 
wednesday according to jay klopfenstein of norwood securities the 
funds sponsor 
the recent rallies in the prices of orange juice and heating oil 
have been spectacular 
the price of heating oil for delivery in january soared 74 
percent from nov 22 through wednesday when the contract settled 
at 9971 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange 
during the same period frozen concentrated orange juice for 
january delivery surged 23 percent to 15015 a pound on the new 
york cotton exchange with most of those gains made in the past two 
weeks 
commodity speculators dont deny the frequent accusation that 
they make money from other peoples misery but they do defend 
their gains as the hardwon rewards of an extremely risky business 
in addition many of them were doing poorly this year until the 
recordbreaking cold spell hit 
mort baratz editor of managed accounts report monitors 169 
public futures funds and 129 private investors pools that provide 
opportunities for investors to speculate in commodity and financial 
futures 
i can tell you that the great majority of them have had a very 
difficult year through the end of november baratz said thursday 
suddenly along comes a cold wave with a substantial effect on 
heating oil and orange juice baratz said in a telephone 
interview from his office in columbia md 
now im confident that many of those i follow will recoup 
some if not all the losses they sustained in first 11 months 
a futures contract is the right to buy a set amount of a certain 
commodity such as oil or orange juice at a certain price on a 
certain date 
there are two kinds of traders in the futures markets 
speculators and hedgers hedgers produce or use the commodities 
themselves they buy and sell in the futures markets as insurance 
against price swings in the cash markets 
for example when a freeze hits an orange grower can sell 
futures contracts at high prices when prices inevitably fall he 
can buy back the contracts at the lower price and use the profit 
from that transaction to offset his cash loss from freeze damage 
speculators are not involved in industries that produce or use 
the commodity they merely buy and sell in the futures markets on 
the hope of profiting from price changes 
booth of palo alto calif calls himself one of the countrys 
biggest orange juice speculators his company george booth amp 
associates inc manages about 32 million invested by 15 
individual customers and 10 funds and spread among 22 futures 
markets 
booth said those who depict orange juice speculators as vultures 
circling the devastated florida orange groves dont understand the 
realities of frozen oranges or the futures market 
first of all he said freezing an orange reduces its juice 
content but doesnt destroy it so orange growers havent been 
entirely wiped out 
and many growers are as savvy as speculators at using the 
futures market which is essentially a vehicle for transferring 
risk to those willing to accept it 
a dec 22 report from the cotton exchange showed hedgers 
outnumbering speculators in the orange juice market by about 12500 
to 10200

than 100 million in debt in bankruptcy court

in an effort to lure passengers during the slow winter months 
the nations big airlines are lowering fares as much as 30 percent 
in selected markets 
the fare reductions in effect through early march only apply 
to about 10 percent of the airlines route networks but they 
involve densely traveled routes the move was started by midway 
airlines which announced last saturday oneway fares ranging from 
19 to 99 across its 50city route system within the continental 
united states 
united airlines followed suit wednesday and uniteds cuts were 
quickly matched in the same markets by northwest airlines and trans 
world airlines spokesmen for american airlines delta air lines 
and continental airlines said thursday those carriers have matched 
the move 
weve got to be competitive said ed stewart a spokesman 
for american at its headquarters outside fort worth texas 
american the nations largest airline will cut fares to about 
40 cities from chicago that compares with its total network of 
about 1200 markets 
americans roundtrip fares between los angeles and new york 
for example will be cut to 278318 from 398438 between 
boston and nashville tenn fares will drop to 178198 from 
238278 
the discounts affect flights between new york boston and los 
angeles and other cities in the continental united states arizona 
florida and nevada are excluded 
analysts said the historical winter slowdown in air travel 
which is expected to be worse than usual this year motivated the 
fare discounts they are aimed mostly at vacationers who can meet 
the requirements for advance purchase and minimum stays 
we knew that the fourth 1989 and the first 1990 quarters 
were going to be very sloppy for this industry said edward 
starkman an airline analyst at painewebber inc in new york 
the last major change in fares was in early december when the 
big airlines raised discount maxsaver fares but softened the blow 
by eliminating advancepurchase requirements for the popular 
tickets during the holiday period 
last week southwest airlines cut prices on its longer routes a 
move other carriers followed on a limited basis 
the new fare reductions require a 14day advance purchase and a 
saturday night stay 
passengers wanting to use the lower fares must make reservations 
by jan 31 the fares are available only on a roundtrip basis and 
arent refundable

floridas 33 citrus processing plants are 
pushing their operations to the limit to squeeze frostdamaged 
oranges before they have a chance to rot 
truckloads of oranges are flooding plants that are running 
nonstop to process the fruit damaged during a twoday christmas 
freeze 
industry officials fear several days of 70degree weather would 
cause the damaged fruit to decay and fall from trees if not picked 
and processed quickly enough 
at tropicana products inc the nations largest citrus 
processor maximum plant capacity is 36 million oranges a day 
which translates into 1 million gallons of juice 
all of tropicanas 400plus fruithauling trailers have been 
mobilized to race the clock said tropicana products inc president 
robert soran 
well be open 24 hours per day seven days a week during the 
salvage process said steve caruso assistant general manager at 
citrus world a juice processing plant in lake wales that produces 
about 400000 gallons of fresh juice a day 
the juice bowl plant in lakeland also is running nonstop 
indefinitely 
gov bob martinez lifted highway weight restrictions on trucks 
so citrus growers can move crops faster and growers have pressed 
all migrant farm workers into service to help harvest the fruit 
from groves hit hard when the overnight temperature plunged as low 
as the high teens last sunday and monday 
the final freezedamage toll wont be known for some time but 
soran said that based on recent estimates florida may be able to 
produce 100 million boxes of oranges this season down from an 
anticipated 130 million boxes 
a damage estimate is due jan 11 said ernie neff a spokesman 
for florida citrus mutual which represents citrus growers 
florida and brazil produce 81 percent of the worlds oranges 
almost entirely for juice and soran said a recent increase in 
brazilian production means that the overall supply this year may 
change very little 
juice made from a blend of us and imported oranges may not 
fluctuate widely in price at current supply levels said soran 
however shoppers may pay more for juices made only from florida 
oranges such as tropicanas pure premium and minute maids premium 
choice he said

lowinterest federal loans could be 
made available to florida farmers who lost crops in the christmas 
freeze after gov bob martinez declared the state a disaster area 
martinez sent a letter thursday to us secretary of agriculture 
clayton yuetter asking for approval of the farmers home 
administration loans the governor also signed an executive order 
declaring the disaster following several visits to freezedamaged 
farms 
from what i have seen there is no question that florida has 
suffered devastating losses and that our state is a disaster 
area martinez said we must now do everything we can to help 
those whose lives and livelihoods have been ravaged by the 
unmerciful weather 
the governors order affects all 67 florida counties and opens 
the door to a possible disaster declaration by president bush once 
the full extent of the losses is known a presidential declaration 
would make unemployment assistance direct grants and other 
assistance as well as fha loans available to growers 
the hard freeze saturday and sunday nights damaged floridas 
700000acre citrus belt as well as winter vegetable crops many of 
which would have gone to markets in the northeast the states 
tropical fish industry sugar cane crops and plant nurseries also 
suffered heavy losses 
higher vegetable prices have already been reported but the 
impact on citrus prices could be minimal because of a large juice 
reserve and the quick processing of frostbitten fruit into 
concentrate 
reaction from growers was mixed with some industry 
representatives saying the programs could throw the delicate 
supplyanddemand balance of the food business into disarray 
driving down some prices 
it can extend the disaster beyond its time said reggie 
brown spokesman for florida fruit and vegetable association in 
orlando 
ernie neff spokesman for florida citrus mutual in lakeland 
said not all growers could benefit from disaster programs but they 
could keep some from going deeply into debt 
when youre in a disaster area you look for all the options 
not every grower can use them but it will certainly help some 
neff said 
state agriculture officials will assess the damage in each 
county to find the exact losses which would be needed before a 
federal declaration is made that could take two or three weeks 
jon peck the governors press secretary said it will take time 
to ascertain just how much of the citrus crop was lost because some 
damaged fruit can still be turned into concentrate for juice 
martinez earlier declared a statewide emergency that waived 
truck weight restrictions so growers can quickly haul their 
products to processing plants

dissent appears to be growing among members 
of the founding family of campbell soup co as three heirs to the 
fortune put their 17 percent stake up for sale and threatened to 
oust board members who oppose a plan to sell the food company 
the group composed of three nieces of campbells late chairman 
john t dorrance jr and their husbands said in a securities and 
exchange commission filing thursday that it plans to seek a price 
per share significantly in excess of current market value 
the filing magnifies and brings to actuality the discord weve 
been hearing about among the family said mary harden an 
industry anaylst with duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
its not particularly surprising said pavlos m 
alexandrakis an analyst with argus research corp in new york 
campbell shares have been driven higher in recent weeks by 
increasing speculation of dissent within the dorrance family on 
the new york stock exchange campbell shares closed thursday up 
437 to 5737 in active trading 
they would seem over the last many months to not have 
agreed said roderick rumreich an assistant vice president at 
moodys investors service inc in new york for any group to 
reach an agreement given the recent filings seems somewhat 
improbable 
james h moran a spokesman for camdenbased campbell said the 
company had no comment on thursdays sec filing 
heirs of john dorrance sr the chemist who invented condensed 
soup in 1897 control about 59 percent of campbells 1296 million 
outstanding common shares including the three nieces of dorrances 
son who hold a 174 percent stake 
the group pushing for a sale said it would encourage campbells 
board of directors to do the same and consider ousting members who 
opposed a sale 
theyve become much more aggressive about managing their 
assets said rumreich 
last week three children of dorrance jr who died last april 
and whose great uncle founded the company issued a statement 
saying they intended to maintain their ownership in campbell and 
keep the company independent the three recently received control 
of their fathers 313 percent stake in the company 
ms harden said about 11 percent of the companys stock is in 
hands friendly to the dorrance children including robert j 
vlasic chairman of the board who also opposes a sale 
those who want to sell are outvoted it looks like ms 
harden said 
but alexandrakis said the family members pushing for a sale 
could recruit others if the price was right 
none of the descendants of dorrance sr have played as active a 
role in the company as his son dorrance jr did 
alexandrakis described campbell as a laggard in the food 
industry slow to update facilities and products the companys 
dominance in the retail soup market has dropped in recent years and 
campbell has had trouble gaining an upper hand in the fastgrowing 
dry soup market 
campbells fiscal 1989 earnings totaled 13 million or 10 cents 
per share down sharply from a profit of 2741 million or 212 a 
share the previous year 
the most recent results were reduced by 343 million as a result 
of a restructuring in august that included the closing of 
manufacturing plants in camden maryland and tennessee with a loss 
of 2800 jobs 
in november r gordon mcgovern stepped down as campbells chief 
executive officer and president after heading the nations largest 
soup maker for nine years a twoman interim management team was 
appointed to oversee daytoday operations but a replacement has 
not been named 
ms harden said the dissenting family members may have 
difficulty finding a prospective buyer willing to pay top price for 
campbell 
theyre assuming its somebody out there with deep pockets 
she said im not certain in this investment environment that 
theyre going to find an investor willing to pay the kind of 
prices theyre looking for
