the experimental drug ddi can help aids patients 
gain weight and feel better but can have severe even 
lifethreatening side effects according to two reports published 
today 
many hoped the new medicine would be a less toxic alternative to 
azt the only medicine approved for routine use against aids a 
major nationwide study is under way to see how ddi compares with 
azt in controlling the disease 
the new smaller studies confirm that ddi is promising but also 
caution that it can harm the pancreas and cause other painful 
symptoms 
there is some evidence that it inhibits the aids virus said 
dr howard a liebman of boston city hospital senior author of one 
of the studies the important question is will the spectrum of 
toxicity prove to be the limiting factor of the drug will that 
make it not any better than azt and perhaps worse 
the two studies conducted on small numbers of patients by 
doctors at boston city and the university of rochester were 
published in the new england journal of medicine the results were 
similar to those of another preliminary study conducted at the 
national cancer institute and published last july in science 
all three studies were socalled phase i trials they were 
intended to determine the maximum dose that patients can tolerate 
not whether the medicine had an effect on their illness 
nevertheless the researchers found that many of the patients 
clearly improved while taking ddi for a few weeks 
in an editorial in the new england journal dr anthony s 
fauci director of aids work at the national institutes of health 
wrote that there certainly is a suggestion of shortterm benefit 
from ddi 
about 800 patients are enrolled in a major study that compares 
ddi with azt or zidovudine an additional 8600 people who cannot 
take azt because of side effects or worsening symptoms are using 
ddi in an unusual program that makes the drug available prior to 
its formal approval by the food and drug administration 
in his editorial fauci predicted that the two latest reports 
will stir up inevitable enthusiasm about the treatment but he 
added that doctors and patients should withhold judgment about ddi 
until tests aimed at determining the drugs effectiveness in 
fighting the virus are completed 
the studies published today were directed by drs john s 
lambert of rochester and timothy p cooley of boston city and 
involved a total of 71 patients 
many of the patients felt better or put on weight while taking 
ddi virus levels fell while the number of white blood cells the 
infectionfighting cells that are destroyed by the aids virus 
increased 
however high doses of the drug caused a potentially fatal 
pancreas inflammation and severe foot pain 
liebman senior author of the boston city study said the 
pancreas ailment often occurred after three or four months of ddi 
treatment and frequently affected the sickest patients 
physicians have to be very alert to the toxicities he said 
a lot of physicians are not sensitive to this they are just 
happy to be able to give something to their patients 
even if ddi turns out to be no better than azt it may still be 
an alternative for some patients azt often loses its effectiveness 
after a year or so of treatment and it also suppresses the bodys 
ability to make new blood cells

in an academic study of the air time 
television preachers devote to fundraising and promotion cited in 
an associated press article march 16 the findings for pat 
robertsons show were inflated by an overemphasis on special 
telethon programs 
the communications professor who conducted the study stephen 
winzenburg of des moines grand view college said robertson 
devoted an average 44 percent of air time to fundraising and 
promotion robertsons organization says its record shows that the 
robertson programs on average devote 18 percent of air time to what 
they regard as fundraising and promotion 
winzenburg says a disproportionate concentration of telethon 
programs among the robertson programs he monitored may have skewed 
the result two of the six robertson shows he studied were telethon 
programs 
winzenburg says the nontelethon robertson shows he monitored 
devoted an average 30 percent of air time to content he considered 
to be fundraising and promotion

the cochairman of the troubled joffrey ballet 
has resigned the new york times reported in fridays editions 
anthony a bliss announced his resignation thursday and told the 
times that david h murdock the other cochairman had also 
resigned and that frank w lynch vice chairman of the board had 
either resigned or was about to 
the three executives are said to be among those opposed to the 
continuing directorship of gerald arpino who founded the company 
with the late robert joffrey 
arpino earlier this month resigned as artistic director of the 
ballet and withdrew his works and joffreys from the ballets 
repertory he quit after the joffrey board of directors voted to 
set up an operating committee that would run the company in place 
of both arpino and the 55member board 
but arpino remains artistic director of the companys ballet 
school and negotiations are continuing on his future role in the 
joffrey 
arpino has been a dancer and choreographer with the modern 
ballet company since its early days in the mid1950s however 
critics and dance buffs alike have often called his works 
pedestrian instead of inspired and without structure purpose or 
artistry 
the joffrey like many dance companies has financial problems 
based in new york and los angeles it faces a deficit of about 2 
million 
murdock had agreed to close the deficit with gifts loans and 
fundraising over three years the new york times previously

thomas jefferson once ran a lottery to pay off 
his personal debts calling it a wonderful concept because it 
lays taxation only on the willing 
now some members of congress are talking about a national 
lottery as a possible way to raise money without raising taxes 
especially after george bushs campaign pledge read my lips no 
new taxes 
but visions of megajackpots aside the very idea of a national 
game seems like a bad gamble for states already in the lottery 
business and for religious and social groups 
we oppose the idea said michael carr director of the 
michigan lottery and head of the north american association of 
state and provincial lotteries we would prefer the money stay in 
the states clearly it would be competition 
lotto america a 10state group that pools its resources to 
offer bigger jackpots also views a national game as a bad bet 
i dont think theres enough room in the marketplace said 
jim davey director of the oregon lottery and vice president of 
lotto america a national lottery would significantly cut into 
lotto america sales theres probably a limit on the disposable 
income people have for gambling 
lotteries are now a billiondollar industry thirtyone states 
and the district of columbia offer games and sales this year are 
expected to top 20 billion four times what they were in 1982 
lottery officials say 
most states make a profit of 30 percent to 40 percent that is 
earmarked for such things as education and aid to the elderly and 
some congressmen are itching to get in on the action 
sen alan simpson of wyoming the senates no 2 republican 
said tuesday a a national lottery was a possible revenue source to 
plug into the federal budget 
rep austin murphy dpa plans to try again with a national 
lottery bill he first suggested in 1985 
attempts at starting a national lottery have failed in the past 
in large part because rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the house ways and means committee is adamantly opposed to them 
and his panel has jurisdiction in the house 
murphys bill would return a share of the take to states selling 
tickets the congressman recognizes that any measure that lacks 
such a provision doesnt have a chance according to mike 
johns a staff member of the house labor standards subcomittee 
but there are many opponents who see lotteries as a shell game 
that tax the poor 
a lottery is the sale of an illusion to poor people who view 
it as the only possibility of breaking out of the cycle of poverty 
they live in said weston ware of the baptist christian life 
commission in texas its bad public policy bad social policy 
and bad moral policy 
valerie lorenz executive director of the national center for 
pathological gambling in baltimore also thinks the idea is a bad 
one 
it is absolutely foolhardy to legalize any type of gambling 
without studying the social and economic costs of promoting an 
addictive process she said the government would be promoting 
an addiction 
still the chance to win instant riches by buying a ticket has 
giltedged appeal and taxpayers are weary of shelling out more and 
more to the government 
the resistance to gambling in increasingly counterbalanced by 
the desire not to pay more taxes said emory university history 
professor dan carter 
a 1984 gallup poll commissioned by the trade magazine gaming and 
wagering business found that 62 percent of americans supported an 
annual national game and 26 percent opposed it 
but paul dworin the magazines publisher said such sentiments 
would not be enough to offset political realities 
i dont think it has a chance dworin said will utah 
allow a national lottery to operate will some of the southern 
states in the bible belt 
this wouldnt be the first congress to try to hit the jackpot 
with a quick fix 
in 1776 the continental congress approved a lottery to raise 
10 million for george washingtons army it was abandoned because 
most colonists couldnt afford the 10 ticket and the wealthier 
ones who were tories had no desire to aid the rebellion said 
john scarne in his complete guide to gambling 
lotteries also helped finance ivy league schools such as 
harvard dartmouth and princeton but games were outlawed in the 
19th century because many of them were fixed 
new hampshire reintroduced gambling in modern times with a 
statewide sweepstakes in 1964 for public schools 
but a lottery would have to rake in a lot of money to put a dent 
in the 301 trillion national debt a congressional research 
service study in 1985 said every american over age 16 would have to 
spend 2041 on the game to eliminate a deficit of 185 billion 
and h roy kaplan an associate professor at the florida 
institute of technology said the most optimistic estimates from a 
lottery game would not be enough to cover the interest on the 
national debt 
in realistic terms the national debt is unapproachable in 
terms of a lotterys ability to diminish it kaplan said

who steals william wardhams work steals 
art who steals his raw materials steals trash indeed 
wardham is the first artistinresidence at san franciscos huge 
trash transfer station near candlestick park hes happily been 
welding metal scraps into more than half a dozen works already on 
display near his work area 
there is so much activity so much history in this the 
48yearold sculptor said holding crumpled chrome that once was a 
grocery cart you immediately ask yourself how it got that way 
was it crushed by a hydraulic press here in the yard or did 
something happen to the grocery cart 
jacqueline tripp head of the program for norcal solid waste 
systems inc said the goal is to get people to start thinking 
about recycling to reduce the amount of garbage they generate 
its important to be aware of all the waste out there and that 
some of it can be reclaimed tripp said we have to find a 
means to extend the life of our landfills 
wardham says the smell bothers him occasionally although the 
2000 tons of trash received every day is deodorized somewhat by a 
bubblegum smelling aerator that also controls dust with moisture 
tripp said norcal plans to pay artistsinresidence an average 
of 2000 a month for a one to sixmonth stint at the site where 
trash is dumped and then shipped to landfills at other sites 
completed works will remain at the solidwaste transfer station 
as part of a growing exhibit open to visitors including school 
children and civic leaders according to tripp 
we renovated a building for an artists studio right on site 
here she said i think well see some interesting pieces of 
art created 
jo hanson a longtime conceptual artist who helps select 
artists for the dump project proposed it out of her love of 
creating art from trash she found on the streets in front of her 
san francisco house 
by bringing together the environment and art were carrying a 
message that will make people more thoughtful about materials 
she said there is an infinite supply of material here both in 
quantity and variety 
in 1970 hanson said she was sweeping the sidewalk in front of 
her home when she began to see art in what was there blowing 
past me every day 
ive studied garbage in the streets of other big cities and 
san francisco has unique trash she said people dont hide 
their private lives here 
just from the stuff on the sidewalks you can follow the 
progress of some peoples affairs including their drug dealings 
and sex lives 
hanson and wardham say working with used materials is more 
challenging because the items have a history that can influence the 
artist 
you can do conceptual things that relate to where the trash 
comes from and where it goes hanson said recently ive begun 
working with metal that has been run over in the streets enough to 
make it into interesting shapes theres an urban energy to the 
pieces 
so far hanson has received 30 applicants from artists 
interesting in working at the dump i think weve always had a 
more progressive outlook here she said this is just another 
innovative art program

censorship ended with the fall of 
nicolae ceausescu in december but the opposition says state 
control of television and major newspapers and of newspaper 
distribution is just as effective 
spokesmen for independent news outlets and parties say telling 
the opposition story is extremely difficult as romania approaches 
its first free elections in 44 years scheduled for may 20 
the chief target of criticism is the national salvation front 
which dominates the interim government and is suspected by many of 
seeking to bring back a milder form of communism 
many ranking members of the front including interim president 
ion iliescu are former communists who had been critical of 
ceausescu front leaders profess democratic ideals including a 
commitment to freedom of the press 
the human rights law group based in washington dc said 
after a factfinding tour in late april that many romanians 
believed the front controlled the government 
it said the fronts advantages are amplified by the 
governments control of television printing presses and newsprint 
distribution of national and opposition print media international 
communications networks and air and ground transport 
there are widespread complaints that the newspapers 
distributed by the government especially those of opposition 
parties and certain independent papers often fail to reach their 
destination are not delivered promptly or are returned when they 
could have been sold the monitoring group said 
several journalists working for independent dailies or 
opposition party papers echoed those concerns in recent interviews 
on television representatives of opposing political parties 
have three minutes to tell their story from scripts held in 
their hand said petre mihai bacanu president of the 
4000member independent journalists union 
mr iliescu could grin on the screen all day and nobody at the 
television would mind he said 
supporters of the front say iliescu and other senior officials 
get more coverage because national leaders make more news than 
obscure candidates for parliament 
several journalists said even coverage of news events was biased 
in the fronts favor 
one example cited was a demonstration organized by the liberal 
party at which the camera dwelt at length on barefooted gypsies in 
the crowd most romanians think of gypsies as idlers and thieves 
images of roses flattering graphics and stirring music were 
added to taped coverage of a front rally the journalists said 
distribution of independent or opposition daily newspapers was 
one of the problems mentioned most often 
bacanu is a member of the group that publishes romania libera 
which has a circulation of 850000 and is the largest paper 
regularly critical of the government 
he snorted when asked whether copies were reaching readers in 
the provinces people on the train simply throw them off 
becanu said 
gelu netea manager of the liberal party paper vitorul said 
state trucking companies were run by neocommunists meaning 
supporters of the front who did not honor contracts to deliver the 
newspaper nationwide 
in bucharest the press distributor regularly either doesnt 
take our copies or only a small amount netea said during an 
interview in his office he gestured at stacks of newspapers 
several days old 
other government companies with agreements to distribute 80000 
copies nationally will take only 40000 on a given day and then 
will wait up to five days to take them to newsstands he said 
officials and supporters of the government denied the charges 
both sides agree the staterun presses which turned out only a 
halfdozen dailies in ceausescus day are woefully inadequate for 
printing the more than 700 newspapers now being published 
some typesetting machines at the central printing plant date 
from the 1940s and much of the lead is melted in an antiquated 
gasfired furnace 
welcome to gutenbergs era a foreman on the printing floor 
told a western reporter who was touring the plant

its midmorning and publisher robert maxwell is 
on the telephone lambasting someone about distribution problems in 
germany or doing an interview with a london radio station 
its part of a hectic countdown to friday when the 66yearold 
tycoon launches his latest venture a paneuropean weekly 
fired by a vision of a united europe he says hell back the 
newspaper the european for as long as europe is around and 
rails against those skeptical about the viability of the european 
as uninformed biased scribblers 
with the crumbling of the eastwest divide in europe and moves 
toward closer unity of the 12nation european community maxwell 
believes the european is an idea whose time has come 
the europeans have ended their stupid nationalism he says 
were in the business of uniting europe 
there are no buts about this maxwell said in an interview 
in his penthouse suite at maxwell house london headquarters of a 
global publishing and communications empire spanning two dozen 
countries 
hes the new papers owner editorinchief masthead designer 
and owner of the company doing the color 
ive taken on the role of editorinchief for this newspaper 
because the europeans want to have a guarantee that this isnt just 
some perfidious albion foisting a european newspaper on the natives 
on the continent he told the london radio station 
and since im born in czechoslovakia speak a lot of european 
languages and everyone knows im more patriotic than the natives of 
this country im virtually tailormade for the job he said 
the 64page englishlanguage newspaper will have an initial 
print run of 1 million copies friday selling in london for 84 
cents each half in color it has three sections main news 
business and sports and a 32page tabloid lifestyle and arts 
section called elan 
the theater listings include whats on from amsterdam to zagreb 
via cluj romania a dummy edition has frontpage stories about 
europe from moscow berlin and paris and inside are congratulatory 
letters from among others polands lech walesa and anglofrench 
actress charlotte rampling 
actor peter ustinov writes a column and the editorial staff of 
100 includes some top names in european journalism the paper is 
being printed in london frankfurt roubaix in france and near 
budapest in hungary 
maxwell britains secondbiggest newspaper publisher after 
rupert murdoch is launching the european as part of the mirror 
group newspapers which he bought in 1984 
he says he is spending 41 million on the europeans launch and 
guarantees advertisers sales of 225000 copies weekly from july to 
december 60 percent in britain if sales are under 225000 
advertisers get rebates the breakeven point maxwell says is 
300000 
the european enters a british market which with 21 national 
daily and sunday newspapers has never been more crowded 
the boom results chiefly from the defeat of the printworkers 
unions which were crushed by murdoch and maxwell to usher in the 
high technology on which the european depends 
media analysts credit maxwell with a brave new idea 
but many question whether the european is viable only in english 
and with twothirds of its projected sales in britain whether it 
can compete with established englishlanguage papers in europe 
such as the international herald tribune the wall street journal 
europe and the financial times and whether it can attract vital 
corporate advertising 
and the question remains whether there are enough dedicated 
europeans 
its an admirable and rather heroic idea says eric de 
bellaigue publishing analyst at the london brokerage panmure 
gordon but i would doubt if an awful lot of people are going to 
see themselves at this stage as being european and identifying 
automatically with something called the european 
its a very good product in search of a market says alec 
kenny media director of saatchi and saatchi advertising 
but you just have to wonder if there are enough people out 
there in the market place who really want this sort of product 
kenny said in an interview 
raymond snoddy media correspondent of the financial times 
agrees 
as a purely financial venture i wouldnt give many chances for 
the europeans longevity snoddy says but maxwell is committed 
to making it a success and he might be prepared to back it 
financially long enough until the perceptions of europeans catch up 
with his 
maxwell born labji hoch to jewish peasant parents who died at 
the hands of the nazis arrived in britain penniless in 1940 
a decorated world war ii british officer he has sat in 
parliament for the labor party but he has never quite been 
accepted by the british establishment and rival publications mock 
him as the bouncing czech and a selfpublicist 
in 1987 in a blaze of publicity maxwell launched a new british 
daily the london daily news which folded after five months but 
with the european maxwell insists hell spend anything for it to 
succeed 
mirror group newspapers makes a profit of 15 million a 
week he says i suspect they will be able to sustain any 
losses on the european for as long as europe is around

check it out the latest at the supermarket will 
let customers become doityourselfers at the checkout lane not 
only for bagging 
they will be able to run packaged products over a scanner and 
weigh their own produce before going to a central cashier 
but dont try to slip an extra can of peas or bunch of bananas 
past the computer a security system in the checkrobot inc lanes 
reverses the conveyer if any unscanned unweighed or switched 
product is placed on it 
and a gentle electronic voice says please set the last item 
aside and continue scanning 
the lanes were on display wednesday on the final day of the 
washington dcbased food marketing institutes supermarket 
industry convention at mccormick place 
and scott m sloan vice president of marketing for checkrobot 
said the benefits of the system and a new cooperative marketing 
agreement with ibm should make it popular 
its rare that youll find a piece of equipment in the food 
industry that will address the retailers greatest concern and 
thats the labor shortage as well as address the single greatest 
concern that their shoppers have and thats speed of checkout 
sloan said 
the systems on the market for about a year are already 
installed in 11 supermarkets including locations in ontario 
canada new jersey virginia florida and wisconsin other 
installations are planned soon 
sloan said the lanes are easy to operate 
you can go to a number of our sites and you can see 
children scanning groceries while their mothers at the other 
end bagging he said 
stores can still provide baggers and can decide how many cash 
registers they want to use but to get the financial benefit from 
the machines its recommended that each cashier handle at least 
three lines sloan said 
a computer screen and two rows of buttons face the shopper 
bringing groceries to the line prices of scanned products appear 
on the screen while anything that needs to be weighed is put on 
the scanner surface which is also a scale 
buttons have pictures of different kinds of produce such as 
grapes put the grapes on the scale and hit the button and the 
price is recorded 
for more detailed lists a button might say fruit screen 
and a checkerboard of several varieties appear on the screen a 
touch of the right one registers the weight and price 
all of this is done with or without a computer voice stating the 
prices at the customers discretion and with recorded video of 
a woman to give some messages including help is on the way 
for those who touch the help square on the screen 
a receipt at the end of the line is taken to the cashier for 
payment 
while saving labor costs is a selling point of the machines 
sloan said the devices really will fill a void created by a 
shortage of 16 to 24yearold workers 
al zack spokesman for the washington dcbased united food 
and commercial workers union which represents retail food 
employees said theres only a shortage because stores want too 
many parttimers 
he also predicted customer dissatisfaction with selfcheckout 
and slow lines due to baffled shoppers 
i dont think many customers consider it a convenience to do 
the work for the store he said 
but richard honerkamp chief financial officer of deerfield 
beach flabased checkrobot said most customers have liked the 
system and checkout would be faster especially in nonpeak hours 
when stores often shut down most lanes 
at each site conventional lanes also operate 
thats the way it must be at least for now said kim contos 
director of special projects for pay less super markets inc which 
operates nine stores in anderson and lafayette ind 
the chains flagship store in anderson is getting five automatic 
lanes installed 
we wouldnt convert a store entirely contos said i dont 
think any of us are ready for that in the immediate future

francois mitterrand began his 10th year as frances 
president this week with his popularity plummeting and his 
political integrity under harsh attack in a new bestselling 
biography 
some political analysts predict mitterrands problems will 
worsen in the coming months others suggest the socialist president 
will bounce back as he has many times in an upanddown 45year 
political career 
recent public opinion polls show a dramatic drop in his 
popularity a survey by sofres a major polling firm recorded a 
12point collapse from 61 to 53 percent in a single month while a 
poll by the journal du dimanche newspaper found only 39 percent of 
respondents satisfied with mitterrands performance 
dont ever forget francois mitterrand is an artist of 
resurrection says franzolivier geisbert 41 author of the new 
unflattering biography in 1980 he was finished in 1981 he was 
elected president of the republic 
geisbert a prominent journalist who has worked for both leftist 
and conservative publications has been following mitterrands 
career for years 
his second book on mitterrand the president is filled with 
revealing anecdotes and interviews and conversations with 
presidential advisers ministers opposition leaders reporters 
and mitterrand himself 
currently on the bestseller list it strips away mitterrands 
image as a lofty highprincipled statesman and depicts him instead 
as a ruthless scheming politician who squeezed aside principle 
and ideology to carve out his place in history 
mitterrand has fascinated me for a long time geisbert 
writes in the introduction this man in fact is never the man 
you think he is he is both better and worse 
the whole mitterrand is there in this mix of electoral 
cynicism and artistic haze he does not let himself be burdened by 
scruples when power is at stake geisbert writes 
the book is a devastating behindthescenes look at how 
mitterrand 73 exercises presidential power by manipulating 
political allies and enemies 
it chronicles his intense dislike of his longtime socialist 
rival michel rocard whom he relegated to minor cabinet posts until 
attrition among his stalwarts forced him to name rocard as premier 
after mitterrands reelection in 1988 to a second sevenyear term 
the book also describes how mitterrand cleverly engineered a 
leftist coalition to beat valery giscard destaing in 1981 the 
maneuver was doubly useful to mitterrand it led ultimately to 
the decline of the communist party and fueled the rise of the 
extremeright national front party which has discredited and 
divided conservative political factions ever since 
mitterrands troubles have been making headlines for weeks 
political analysts attribute them to several events including the 
amnesty of a former socialist minister involved in a political 
fundraising scandal 
after the socialist party congress in april turned into a mean 
dogfight among contenders to the presidency not vacant until 
1995 mitterrand descended into the arena and gave a rare 
television interview trying to explain the mess his efforts 
appeared to make matters worse 
the book also paints merciless portraits of some of mitterrands 
closest aides jacques attali one of his most influential 
advisers emerges as insecure and ambitious former premier laurent 
fabius once seen as mitterrands political heir comes across as a 
calculating powerhungry ideologue 
analysts say mitterrands drop in popularity can be explained by 
his loss of favor among voters with political sympathies on the 
right many of these voters backed mitterrand in 1988 viewing him 
as a reassuring father figure comparable to charles de gaulle who 
would work for the broad national interest 
the key to his reelection was his ability to preserve 
influence beyond the political and sociological boundaries of the 
left eric dupin said in liberation 
this loss of rightleaning voters has not been countered by an 
increase of support from the left such as young people and 
bluecollar workers 
mitterrand is looking for the choke to get going again 
headlined liberation a leftist daily the elysee presidential 
palace seems to have run out of inspiration and enthusiasm

it was a math mistake everybody has made in a 
checkbook but in this case it caused the hubble space telescope to 
miss its target by trillions of miles 
somebody added when he should have subtracted or vice versa 
embarrassed nasa scientists gave that explanation wednesday for 
the failure of the telescope to find two bright stars the 
telescope missed its target by onehalf degree about the width of 
a full moon as seen from earth 
when we were trying to point the telescope to the center of a 
pretty rich star field with a high probability of acquisition we 
were really off to one side of that said jean olivier deputy 
manager of the hubble project for the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
because of the math error and other problems scientists wont 
be able to take the first star pictures with the telescope until 
next week nasa said when the hubble was launched from the space 
shuttle discovery on april 25 they expected the first picture 
within a week 
in the latest glitch the telescope was looking for two stars of 
a certain brightness in the star cluster but failed such guide 
stars are necessary to tell the telescope precisely where it is 
pointing without them it is disoriented 
astronomers relied on star charts made in the 1950s when they 
designed pointing instructions for the telescope olivier said but 
the stars have moved since then from earths vantage point the 
mistake was made when the scientists factored in the extent of that 
movement 
they corrected in the wrong direction 
instead of subtracting it they added it or vice versa 
olivier said 
instead of going from 18 arc minutes back to zero we went from 
18 to 36 or close to 37 he said that was the fundamental 
problem 
in the language of astronomers an arc minute is onesixtieth of 
a degree in the 360degree pie that makes up a circle 
the mathematical error threw the telescopes aim off by a 
halfdegree 
for several days we didnt understand what the problem was and 
we were thinking we maybe had some problem with the onboard system 
alignment or the onboard function of the fine guidance system 
olivier said now we can take corrective action and point in the 
right direction 
engineers still are puzzled by a slight jitter in the telescope 
when it is commanded to roll and by some unwanted motion as the 
instrument moves from the shadow of earth into the sunlight but 
they are going ahead with focusing tests and other planned setup 
activities 
to date more than 21 billion has been spent on the telescope 
and ground facilities the hubble has been ready for launch since 
1985 maintained at a cost of 7 million a month hundreds of 
engineers and astronomers have been involved in planning for the 
telescopes 15year mission 
in hindsight you look at it and say how could we have done 
that olivier said of the error but going into it even though 
it might have been something staring us in the face it was not 
obvious to many of us that we had this problem 
he added 
i dont know how to explain it we made a mistake of about 
a halfdegree and it wasnt caught by many people who worked the 
problem over the past many years 
what else can i say olivier said

a tshirt protest against a 
government decision to let sikhs in the royal canadian mounted 
police wear turbans with their uniforms has angered human rights 
advocates 
gerhard neufahrt of harrison hot springs produced 100 tshirts 
emblazoned oh oh canada and showing five mounties one 
wearing a stetson one a turban one with braids one in a veil and 
one wearing a viking helmet with horns he said the purpose was 
protest rather than profit 
its designed to tell politicians they have made a mockery of 
our history and culture said neufahrt there is nothing racial 
about the tshirt and i have nothing against sikhs 
leaders of the british columbia human rights coalition disagreed 
its disgustingly clear and we will be deciding soon what to 
do about it said coalition official susan odonnell 
aspiring mountie baltej dhillon 23 dismissed the tshirt as a 
moneymaking ploy that preyed on emotions 
and i am not suprised that polls show people dont like 
turbans as part of the uniform especially with this kind of 
message dhillon said 
in a recent gallup poll on the issue 68 percent of 1049 
respondents opposed letting sikh mounties wear their traditional 
turbans 22 percent were in favor and 10 percent had no opinion 
sikhs belong to a hindu religious sect founded in northern india 
about 500 years ago and have a tradition of distinguished service 
in the military and police

thirty years ago today predominantly 
protestant west virginia said yes to a catholic and played a 
pivotal role in the making of a president 
when john f kennedy routed sen hubert h humphrey in the 
states democratic primary on may 10 1960 he put to rest the 
notion that a catholic couldnt be president experts said 
it propelled john kennedy to the nomination and undermined the 
religious issue said west virginia wesleyan professor robert 
rupp who is organizing a symposium wednesday to discuss the role 
of religion the media and campaign techniques in what he calls 
the primary that made a president 
the west virginia primary really was the difference in john 
kennedys success or defeat said ted sorensen kennedys former 
speechwriter 
given the handicap of his religion and to some extent the 
handicap of his age he knew he would not be the choice of bosses 
in the back rooms he had to win in the primaries and above all 
he had to win in protestant areas sorensen said wednesday 
kennedys advisers expected the worst from west virginia about 
90 percent protestant at the time although kennedy had won five of 
nine earlier primaries 
kennedy beat humphrey in west virginia 236510 votes to 152187 
although the vote made political history west virginias people 
and the grinding inescapable poverty some of them lived in made a 
lasting impression on the scion of a wealthy massachusetts family 
he had seen poverty before sorensen said but the 
longterm hardship faced by many of the people he met in west 
virginia the look on their face and the stories they told made a 
very deep impression on him it wasnt a theory any longer 
kennedy spent more time campaigning in west virginia than 
anywhere else his advisers supporters and family members hit 
every chicken dinner student rally and ladies auxiliary meeting 
they could 
it was an exhausting campaign we went to every hill and 
hollow sorensen said 
when he was asked about his catholicism kennedys standard 
response was to talk about his familys military service a 
voteswaying appeal in a state with a high percentage of soldiers 
sailors and airmen 
he said nobody asked my brother about his religion when he 
died for his country in world war ii said charles peters who 
managed kennedys kanawha county effort and is now editor of the 
washington monthly 
kennedy also had franklin d roosevelt jr son of the most 
popular president in west virginia on his side 
that was as if gods son had said its all right to vote for 
this catholic peters said 
west virginia secretary of state ken hechler a firstterm 
congressman at the time was convinced kennedys religion would 
cost him the state he changed his mind after he saw the kennedy 
family in action 
it impressed me so much that they as a family team knew 
exactly what needed to be done without any kind of chitchat 
hechler said 
the kennedy and humphrey campaigns differed markedly kennedy 
chartered a plane at one point to fly to campaign stops humphrey 
rode around in a bus kennedys theme song was high hopes by 
frank sinatra humphrey had a folk singer 
but the kennedy high style didnt scare off the simple folk of 
west virginia 
peters said he advised against bringing jacqueline kennedy to 
campaign in west virginia 
i thought she would come across as a snobbish northeast woman 
who would contrast unfavorably with the downtoearth muriel 
humphrey peters said instead she was a big hit

months of complex financial negotiations 
between the united states and iran produced a tentative 105 
million settlement of more than 2000 us small claims pending 
since the 1979 islamic revolution the state department says 
the package deal also includes a tentative agreement to pay 
400000 to settle 108 iranian claims against the united states 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said wednesday 
the bush administration repeatedly has declared it will make no 
deals to secure the release of the us hostages in lebanon 
believed held by proiranian militants and that the claims 
negotiations are not related to the hostage situation in any way 
nonetheless the tentative accord on the small claims is a step 
toward settling about 16 billion in larger claims that have been a 
major irritant between iran and the united states for a decade 
officials of both countries said in the hague netherlands site of 
the iranunited states claims tribunal 
in washington a department official who commented on condition 
of anonymity said he could not predict whether resolving the claims 
issue will result in the release of hostages or was in any way 
connected with the recent release of two captives 
i have no way to speculate the official said 
the agreement covers 2370 us claims government and private 
the department said with 50 million going to private claims and 
55 million to us government claims 
us officials in the hague said an additional 400 or so claims 
not before the tribunal also are covered 
the actual text of the agreement on claims of up to 250000 
must still be written signed and then ratified by the tribunal 
the panel was established under the 1981 algiers accord that won 
the release of 52 americans held captive at the us embassy in 
tehran for 444 days 
the proposed settlement is the result of many months of 
effort boucher said noting that negotiators discussed the issue 
at meetings held almost every month since last april 
he said it is not clear how long it will take to wrap up final 
details of the tentative agreement 
state department officials have said repeatedly that there is no 
link between the negotiations to settle the claims and the hostage 
situation they maintain that the talks at the hague are not a 
forum in which hostages are discussed 
boucher said that among the us government claims now near 
settlement are loans made to iran by the agency for international 
development the private claims included those for private us 
property expropriated by iran and for goods and services that were 
delivered but never paid for 
the big claims still outstanding involve mainly us military 
equipment for which iran contracted but did not receive after the 
overthrow of shah reza pahlavi iran in 1979 canceled contracts for 
9 billion in weapons including four destroyers under construction 
that were later taken over by the us navy 
the tehran government has since claimed 11 billion for 
undelivered gear 
also outstanding are claims by major us oil firms for 
properties expropriated by the revolutionary government the 
companies have put that figure at 5 billion 
still pending as well is an american offer to voluntarily 
compensate the families of persons killed in july 1988 when a us 
warship in the persian gulf shot down an iranian airbus iran has 
yet to accept the offer 
the united states is represented at the claims talks by abraham 
sofaer the state departments chief legal adviser 
dealing with major claims the tribunal earlier awarded more 
than 13 billion to american claimants and about 130 million to 
iranians the state department said 
the tribunal also has ordered the return of 492 million in 
iranian funds held in escrow after bank claims against the money 
are satisfied

foreigners have ridden horses and danced 
classical ballet atop chinas great wall now a california man has 
set out to become the first person to bicycle from one end to the 
other some 3700 miles 
like mao said youre not a man until youve reached the top 
of the great wall kevin foster said wednesday 
maybe if the late revolutionary leader mao tsetung were still 
around foster a 30yearold parttime actor from ojai calif 
might have gotten atop the wall sooner 
he spent years trying to persuade chinese authorities to approve 
his plan and several more trying to find financial sponsors in the 
united states 
the last hitches were smoothed out late last year and foster 
boarded a train wednesday for the western mountain pass where the 
wall starts at jiayuguan 945 miles from beijing he will begin his 
trek later this week 
from there the fragmented remains of the more than 
2000yearold wall snake through desert and mountains before 
reaching the sea at shanhaiguan east of beijing 
over the years the wall has attracted foreigners with strange 
ideas they have ridden horseback danced ballet performed 
concerts and held cocktail parties on the wall originally a symbol 
of chinas desire to keep out the world and now simply a symbol of 
china 
an englishman ran the length of the wall in 1987 others have 
ridden bicycles beside it but so far despite hundreds of millions 
of chinese relying on bicycles as their only means of 
transportation no one has ridden a bicycle on top of the wall its 
entire length 
everyone wants to be first at something said foster who 
said he got the idea as a child when he saw television coverage of 
former president nixon visiting the great wall in 1972 
with his short tousled ponytail handlebar mustache and 
hyperkinetic personality foster said his hosts at the academy of 
sciences institute of geography call him that crazy american 
last november he rode the new york subway system for 85 
continuous hours to get into the guinness book of world records 
riding the wall on his mountain bike he risks broken bones and 
axles the wall never had an even surface and the centuries have 
not been kind many portions have steep stairs or slopes others 
have been reduced to rubble in some places the wall has 
disappeared altogether due to the ravages of invading armies 
weather and farmers who steal bricks for their homes 
at those parts foster and his chinese entourage will travel in 
jeeps in fact zhou yu one of two young staffers the institute of 
georgraphy assigned to bicycle with foster said he thinks much of 
the trip might best be made in jeeps 
i know there are some parts well look at and say theres no 
way we can bicycle it if we can just walk it i want to walk 
the army has refused to let the group even drive near one long 
stretch of the wall immediately west of beijing because it is near 
military installations instead they will detour around the area 
on train and resume bicycling at beijing 
from there to the sea foster said he expects the smoothest 
biking because many sections have been renovated for tourists 
the whole journey will take about seven weeks foster estimated 
it is costing him 20000 the fee charged by the institute for 
making all arrangements foster said he will pay it in part with 
15000 he expects to receive from a us helmet manufacturer for 
wearing their product 
i cant wait to get it done so i can get on with the rest of 
my life he said im already planning my next project it will 
be even bigger

the us military failed to observe the laws 
of war in an attack on a panamanian installation last december and 
dozens of civilians may have died as a result a private human 
rights group contends 
a report made public wednesday contended that both the us and 
panamanian military violated international humanitarian law 
governing armed conflict during the us invasion of panama five 
months ago 
the study was prepared by americas watch which attempts to 
promote protection of human rights in latin america and the 
caribbean 
some 15000 persons were left homeless in the attack and a 
very rough estimate is that 5070 civilians were killed the 
study said many more were seriously wounded 
the attack took place on the panama defense force headquarters 
situated in the midst of a poor panamanian neighborhood called el 
chorrillo 
the report gave little credence to allegations by some observers 
that forces loyal to panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega were 
responsible for fires that broke out in el chorrillo and left 
numerous civilian casualties 
noriega was ousted by the invading force and subsequently was 
flown to the united states for trial on drugtrafficking charges 
the study said us military leaders were unable to cite 
military necessity such as the need for surprise as a reason for 
not informing the residents of el chorrillo that an attack on the 
headquarters was imminent 
there was no immediate comment on the report from the pentagon 
in contrast to the americas watch report roman catholic priests 
at an el chorrillo church estimated last january that about 20 
people died in the neighborhood many in a fire that was set by 
retreating paramilitary supporters of noriega they said nearly 
10000 people sought refuge in the church and the school and a 
nearby home for the elderly 
the rev javier arteta said members of the paramilitary dignity 
battalions bore much of the blame for the casualties they came 
out of their homes shooting in every direction arteta said 
adding that the us military never fired in the direction of the 
church 
the americas watch report said the us military failed to 
follow the laws of war in refusing to free war prisoners upon the 
cessation of hostilities 
as for noriegas forces the report said they violated 
international law by taking civilian hostages and by dressing as 
civilians during the fighting thus attracting fire and exposing 
innocent people to combat 
the study also said the us southern command in panama 
undercounted the number of civilian deaths that resulted from the 
fighting the pentagon total was 202 but the report said 300 is 
more likely the real figure 
former us attorney general ramsey clark has estimated the 
death toll in the 40007000 range but the report said there was 
no basis for such a finding

the dukakis campaign stacked the audience for 
the 1988 vice presidential debate between lloyd bentsen and dan 
quayle and used a whip system to signal their partisans how to 
react a top campaign aide says 
we told people when to cheer and when to applaud and when not 
to thomas donilon said wednesday at a panel discussion sponsored 
by the commission on presidential debates 
donilon who was a top adviser to the campaign of democrat 
michael dukakis said people were flown to omaha neb for the 
oct 5 1988 debate between the two vice presidential nominees 
he said controlling audience reaction was part of an effort to 
have an impact on the millions of people watching the debate on 
television 
fellow panelist charles black an adviser to the bush campaign 
said the debates between the presidential and vice presidential 
candidates were the most important single news events of the 
campaign 
paul g kirk jr who was democratic party chairman during that 
campaign and frank j fahrenkopf jr who was his republican 
counterpart were present at the panel discussion and said they 
were unaware of the dukakis campaigns effort to manipulate the 
audience 
were up there saying quiet down said kirk recalling 
that both he and fahrenkopf appealed to the audience to refrain 
from loud responses to candidate statements 
but their appeals were ignored as the audience appeared to react 
spontaneously on several occasions 
asked if he thought the dukakis campaign tactic was a dirty 
trick donilon responded i dont think it was a dirty trick at 
all we had tickets to give to our supporters 
but donilon also conceded the tactic was not a good thing to 
do 
later he said that he disclosed what was done to show how 
easily debate audiences can be manipulated and to encourage the 
commission to recommend that future debates be held without a live 
audience in the auditorium 
the commission transcript of the 1988 vice presidential debate 
showed repeated audience response to bentsen comments and virtually 
none to remarks by quayle 
the loudest reaction described in the transcript as prolonged 
shouts and applause came after quayle compared his experience to 
that of john f kennedy and bentsen retorted senator you are no 
jack kennedy 
but that was not the only occasion when the audience reacted to 
bentsen remarks 
after quayle said he and presidential nominee george bush had 
the environmental interest bentsen said this late 
conversion is interesting to me the transcript said that remark 
was followed by laughter and applause 
partisans of both candidates reacted with what the transcript 
described as cheering and booing when quayle referred to the 
jimmy carter grain embargo in late 1979 after the soviet 
union sent troops into afghanistan carter instituted an embargo on 
grain sales to the communist nation a move that was widely 
criticized in the farm belt 
black argued against trying to force presidential campaigns to 
adhere to a debate format set up by people outside the campaigns 
he said the debates present the toughest most important set 
of tactical decisions of the campaign and its absolutely 
essential for each nominee to make those decisions 
we must run our own campaigns black said

the environmental protection agencys 
guidelines for what constitutes clean beach water need tightening 
says an engineer for an environmental organization 
diane m cameron of the natural resources defense council urged 
a congressional panel wednesday to set a zero health risk goal 
for beach water 
nrdc believes that epas recommendation of 19 cases of 
gastroenteritis per 1000 marine swimmers as the maximum acceptable 
public health risk is clearly too high a threshold of risk she 
said in testimony submitted to the house merchant marine 
subcommittee on oceanography and great lakes 
many states including new york and massachusetts have 
adopted epas swimmer health risk goal as their own with the 
result that many beaches deemed safe for swimming may actually be 
laced with sufficient pathogens to make hundreds of people each day 
sick with gastroenteritis and other diseases 
cameron said a zero health risk is achievable because it doesnt 
mean zero pathogens she also suggested developing a bathing 
beach water quality index akin to the familiar air quality 
index 
however officials argued that the current system for testing 
the cleanliness of beach water is adequate and that the federal 
government should not trample on states rights 
epa witness william r diamond said that in the past two 
decades programs to control water pollution established by the 
epa under the clean water act have virtually eliminated the threat 
of serious illness and disease from swimming at beaches 
diamond who is director of the agencys criteria and standards 
division in the office of water regulations and standards said the 
epa opposes a bill before the subcommittee which would set 
mandatory guidelines for testing beach water 
the bill sponsored by rep bill hughes dnj would require 
the epa to revise its criteria to ensure beach water testing on a 
weekly basis at minimum 
currently some states test their water less frequently or 
average the results of repeated tests 
the bill would also require states to adopt the epas standards 
they now are voluntary unless a state adopts them as part of its 
own waterquality program 
james p burgess an official with the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration called hughes bill unnecessary because 
current law covers a system by which epa establishes national 
water quality criteria and states develop state water quality 
standards is already in place 
second noaa believes that mandatory criteria and uniform 
testing and monitoring procedures may be an unnecessary intrusion 
by the federal government into the responsibilities of individual 
states he said

the head of the irs listened quietly as 
members of congress described one of his agencys undercover 
operations as too unbelievable for hollywood and an embarrassment 
to the keystone kops 
im not sure we have a different side irs commissioner fred 
t goldberg jr began when asked for his side of the story some 
aspects of the gambling operation were inadequate period no 
minced words he admitted 
that las vegas operation known as project layoff was an effort 
by the agency to track down those who evade federal gaming taxes 
and income taxes on their winnings 
after 11 months of poor recordkeeping and difficulty collecting 
from losers the sting was shut down in 1985 after the lives of 
irs agents were threatened by illegal bookmakers 
any businessman in las vegas would be thrown in jail if his 
books looked like project layoffs sen richard bryan dnev 
complained wednesday to the house government operations consumer 
subcommittee 
the irs would audit this firm and slap it with so many 
penalties and so much interest that your hair would stand on end 
said sen harry reid dnev 
reid said the project cost taxpayers 600000 and resulted in 
only two prosecutions on minor charges more important he said 
conduct of the sting gave rise to speculation that irs workers 
could have skimmed some of the 22 million of bets that passed 
through the operation 
how many illegal bookmaking operations that did business with 
the irs sting were closed as a result asked rep doug barnard 
jr dga chairman of the subcommittee 
to my knowledge there were none said inar morics 
assistant irs commissioner for criminal investigations 
goldberg said irs planning control and recordkeeping of the 
operation which ended four years before he took office were 
inadequate although he had little praise for the project he said 
the irs will continue undercover operations including an 
occasional sting as part of its fight against drugs money 
laundering and tax evasion 
if we are going to do it weve got to do it right goldberg 
said he acknowledged that would include seeking cooperation from 
the fbi as was done in the project layoff case and from local 
gaming authorities which was not done 
if we submitted project layoff as a tv script it would be 
rejected on the grounds that it is too unbelievable bryan said 
it was a complete fiasco said rep james bilbray dnev 
no target was arrested he said the irs should get out of the 
sting business 
some republicans on the subcommittee said they were concerned 
that failure of the las vegas project might slow the irs fight 
against drug dealers and organized crime 
i hope there is no political pressure for you to lay off 
said rep chuck douglas rnh 
the house subcommittee investigated the project as part of a 
longterm probe of misconduct among highlevel irs officials 
goldberg said the irs erred in failing to conduct a timely 
background check of a woman hired and later promoted in the 
criminalinvestigation division of the milwaukee office the woman 
acknowledged later that she had been involved in illegal gambling 
the controls which could have prevented the promotion from 
occurring failed to operate effectively in this case goldberg 
said 
he said the irs is investigating allegations that some irs 
employees in the albany office have been the subject of retaliation 
from superiors because the workers cooperated with subcommittee 
investigators 
we take these charges most seriously goldberg said we 
cannot and will not tolerate harassment and retaliation within our 
agency

tv sports fans dont have to worry about 
paying to see the super bowl or world series on the tube yet 
but a panel of professional baseball football and basketball 
executives told a house subcommittee wednesday that as costs rise 
and network television viewership falls teams will lean more 
toward cable particularly for local viewing of baseball 
that doesnt mean viewers will have to pay 10 just to watch the 
super bowl or the world series at least for the foreseeable 
future network tv still commands the audiences and advertising 
revenue to outbid cable tv for the major championship events the 
executives said 
i am confident that for some time to come free television 
will remain the key method of distribution to our fans national 
basketball association commissioner david j stern told the house 
energy and commerce telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
i do not anticipate any dramatic change in the number of nba 
games available on or shifting of our key events away from free 
overtheair television 
stern along with his counterparts in the national football 
league and major league baseball said they could not foresee major 
championship games going to payperview cable before the year 2000 
nfl commissioner paul tagliabue repeated an earlier pledge that 
the super bowl would not be offered on paycable in this decade 
however under questioning by rep edward j markey dmass 
tagliabue and the other executives would not make the same 
predictions for sports on socalled basic cable services 
tagliabue said it was extremely unlikely that the super bowl 
would appear on basic cable in the next 10 years but he couldnt 
say what would happen to regularseason games 
beyond the next four years it is difficult to speculate as to 
the nature of nfl television arrangements tagliabue said 
stern said the nba championship games were under contract to cbs 
until 1997 but he would not predict what would happen after that 
in light of statistics showing the three major networks share of 
the viewing audience has dropped from about 95 percent to about 65 
percent in the past decade 
i dont think youre going to see an increase in network 
shares of the audience stern added 
baseball commissioner francis t vincent jr said the issue was 
not so much championship games to which networks can attract large 
audiences and therefore outbid cable but in the broadcast of local 
games 
he said chicago white sox baseball recently went to national 
cable superstation wgn when no local broadcasters would bid for the 
rights vincent said that because of cable baseball fans elsewhere 
are seeing games they otherwise would not have had access to

savings and loan financier charles h keating 
jr is defending the five senators who defended him whether they 
like it or not 
they should be congratulated keating said wednesday in a 
nationally televised luncheon at the national press club 
the senators now the target of a senate ethics committee 
investigation met with savings and loan regulators in march 1987 
on behalf of keating and his institution lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine calif 
the five alan cranston dcalif donald w riegle jr 
dmich dennis deconcini dariz john glenn dohio and john 
mccain rariz all had received political contributions from 
keating 
two years after the meeting regulators seized lincoln they 
estimated the cost to taxpayers for the failure at 2 billion 
keating and his family are defendants in a 11 billion civil fraud 
and racketeering suit brought by the government 
keating said he is not disappointed that the senators have since 
tried to distance themselves from him 
theres something wrong with the system and from my 
perspective thats what the senators were trying to call attention 
to i think they did darn well he said 
keating in an emotional appearance in which he twice recited 
poetry proclaimed his innocence and blamed regulators unjustified 
and arbitrary writedown of lincolns assets for the sampls collapse 
he said he is broke and in danger of losing his house because he 
hasnt paid his mortgage in four or five months 
if i were the crook that they say i was and if i were the 
greediest man in the world by golly youd have to also call me 
the most stupid because nothing that i supposedly took has 
stuck to my palms or my childrens he said 
keating sharply criticized savings and loan bailout chief l 
william seidman for his decision to cut the price on 
difficulttosell sampl real estate in the governments possession 
hes sure doing his best to make a heckuva lot of people that 
are rich get richer he said applauding a move by the bush 
administration to nudge seidman from office 
seidman has dismissed keatings contentions as full of 
baloney and way off the mark 
the press club speech was part of the former sampl executives 
campaign to portray himself as a legitimate businessman persecuted 
by regulators 
last year during the weekly house banking committee hearings 
into lincolns failure keating refused to talk to reporters 
making his only comments in written statements 
but in recent months hes made himself available for interviews 
on tuesday night he fielded questions from callers to a 90minute 
program on the cspan cable television network 
at this point i am trying to tell you my side of the story and 
i do appreciate the fact that youre letting me do it he told 
reporters at the lunch 
keating has sued the government seeking the return of his sampl 
us district judge stanley sporkin is scheduled to hear closing 
arguments in the case on june 8

the bush administration is fighting the war on 
drugs with rubber bullets and losing the battle to keep school 
children from taking drugs according to several members of a house 
committee 
our young people are succumbing to this crisis in greater 
numbers as the days go by as both victims and victimizers rep 
charles rangel chairman of the house select committee on narcotics 
abuse and control said wednesday 
an entire generation may be lost before we are finished with 
the drug crisis the new york democrat said without the 
support of the nations leadership the war on drugs will continue 
to be fought with rubber bullets 
the attack on the administrations drug useprevention policies 
came as education secretary lauro cavazos touted two new antidrug 
initiatives a model curriculum and a handbook for grappling with 
drug and alcohol abuse on college campuses 
cavazos also outlined his departments efforts to monitor the 
implementation of required new prevention programs and policies at 
schools and colleges 
rangel complained that the strategy overlooks the needs of 
school dropouts as well as those of schoolage drug abusers in 
local and state jails and treatment centers 
quite frankly mr secretary these studies are not helping at 
all rangel told cavazos i am disappointed that we dont have 
a federal treatment strategy im disappointed that we dont have a 
foreign policy strategy in my community i dont need to give a 
model plan to the principal nor do i need a handbook 
rep bill grant rfla said he too was frustrated by all 
these studies he said school children should be given 
alternatives to using drugs and teachers should learn how to help 
boost students selfesteem 
rep joseph brennan dmaine said i dont see any spirit 
passion from this administration to seriously do something about 
drug abuse and some of the things i see are counterproductive 
brennan criticized william bennett president bushs drug policy 
coordinator for a recent statement that education is kind of a 
helpful auxiliary maybe its something thats nice 
cavazos refused to criticize bennett but stressed education is 
the only solution to drugs 
other committee members criticized the administrations approach 
to drug prevention in the schools a few however praised the 
departments handbooks and other literature used to tell students 
about the dangers of taking drugs 
education is a critical component of our nations 
drugprevention efforts and i want to commend you for your efforts 
to date said rep larry coughlin rpa 
the new initiatives in the war on drugs cavazos said will 
include releasing to about 150000 public and private schools a 
model drug useprevention curriculum covering kindergarten through 
grade 12 
he said the curriculum titled learning to live drug free 
is designed to show students how taking drugs harms the user as 
well as society 
cavazos said more than 600000 copies of a new handbook for 
parents have been distributed he added that in july a handbook for 
college and university officials will be released to provide 
strategies for eliminating drug and alcohol abuse on their campuses

yogurt has arrived in the agriculture 
departments annual book of dairy statistics 
last year according to the new figures about 9124 million 
pounds of plain and fruitflavored yogurt were produced theres no 
way to compare that with 1988 because its the first time the usda 
has published yogurt figures 
in addition to the regular yogurt about 663 million gallons of 
frozen yogurt and 442 million gallons of frozen yogurt mix were 
produced in 1989 
by comparison last years ice cream production was 831 million 
gallons down 6 percent from 1988 ice milk at 377 million 
gallons was up 6 percent and milk sherbet was unchanged at 522 
million gallons 
dan buckner of the departments national agricultural statistics 
service said wednesday the yogurt figures were requested by the 
international association of ice cream manufacturers 
the trade group asked that the agency gather and publish figures 
only for frozen yogurt but buckner it was decided to include 
regular yogurt so wed know exactly what we had 
budget crunches in recent years have chewed deeply into some 
usda statistical and economic research programs and the ice cream 
people were prepared to see some of their other items struck from 
the list in order to get the yogurt figures 
however buckner said in a telephone interview that it was 
possible to squeeze yogurt into the statistical study without 
dropping something else 
but there are some dairy items that one of these days may be 
folded into other categories and not identified separately 
this happens when the number of processing plants and production 
decline so much that it would be impossible to protect the 
identities of companies 
for many food manufacturers including those who turn out dairy 
products exact production figures for various items are considered 
trade secrets and are guarded closely 
one of the candidates for losing its separate statistical 
identity is limburger cheese an aromatic product that tends to 
identify itself regardless of manufacturer 
were going to get a crunch one of these days and its going 
to be dropped into the other category because such a small 
number of plants make it anymore buckner said 
limburger production in 1989 was shown at 901000 pounds down 
nearly 8 percent from 1988 total cheese output rose 1 percent to 
561 billion pounds which included 267 billion pounds of 
americantype cheese

it stinks missouri state legislator jean 
dixon says of the recording industrys voluntary new warning label 
for albums containing explicit lyrics 
we all think the label is cute says daddy o a member of 
stetsasonic rap music group 
jay berman president of the recording industry association of 
america is hoping that parents whose children bought more than 2 
billion worth of records cassettes and compact discs in 1988 will 
agree with daddy o 
at a news conference wednesday berman unveiled the industrys 
uniform parental guidance label for recordings that might be 
deemed objectionable because of lyrics dealing with sex violence 
suicide drug abuse bigotry or satanic worship 
the blackandwhite logo which reads parental warning 
explicit lyrics will appear on the front lower righthand corner 
of new releases reaching retail music stores in july if the record 
companies and performing artists decide they are potentially 
offensive 
recording manufacturers distributors and retailers hope the 
standardized stickers will halt the drive in a handful of state 
legislatures for mandatory warning labels 
the music industry is backed by the parents music resource 
center led by tipper gore wife of sen albert gore jr dtenn 
and the national pta the consumer advocates who won the industrys 
agreement in 1985 to use voluntary warning labels 
we ask state legislators to consider dropping their 
legislation in favor of a voluntary system said national pta 
president ann lynch 
we clearly have demonstrated that music consumers especially 
parents want and need label information not censorship she 
said 
but mrs dixon a republican state representative from 
springfield mo and chief sponsor of a mandatory warning label 
bill this year was unconvinced 
are they kidding it stinks this is a joke she said 
this plan doesnt even touch most of the music were talking 
about 
bermans trade association represents companies that produce 
more than 90 percent of the recordings sold in the united states 
but many of the objectionable records are released by small 
independent companies that dont belong to the recording industry 
group 
mrs dixon also criticized the size color and content of the 
warning labels her bill would have required a bright yellow label 
that listed specific offensive material including sex violence 
and substance abuse 
im not happy with this but well give it a chance to work 
she said 
berman says all but five of the 21 state legislatures that once 
considered mandatory labeling have backed down since the industry 
promised in late march to produce a standard easily recognizable 
label 
he said his association will continue its battle against 
mandatory labels in state legislatures in missouri pennsylvania 
delaware new york and louisiana 
previously individual record companies produced their own 
diverse warning labels and compliance was erratic this resulted in 
parental complaints and the legislative drives for mandatory labels 
on albums with objectionable lyrics primarily rap and heavy metal 
music 
we believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing 
voluntary system and better respond to the legitimate concerns of 
parents berman said now that we have agreed on this new logo 
it will be up to parents to use it as they see fit 
daddy o the father of five children applauded the voluntary 
labeling system 
we dont think the government should determine what our 
children listen to he said we all think the label is cute

defense and many domestic programs would be 
shredded if the 60 billion to 100 billion in automatic spending 
cuts that the bush administration says may soon be necessary 
actually take place analysts say 
administration and congressional leaders plan to begin 
negotiations next tuesday aimed at working out a budget deal for 
fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
should they fail the grammrudman deficitreduction law will 
trigger spending slashes that white house budget director richard 
darman says will be in the 60 billion to 100 billion range from a 
spending plan totaling 123 trillion 
neither congress nor the administration would contemplate cuts 
in that realm robert reischauer director of the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office said wednesday its not even in the 
realm 
lobbyists agreed 
ellen nissenbaum of the center for budget and policy priorities 
which advocates programs for poor people said a 100 billion cut 
would mean that 172000 preschool students could lose their spots 
in the head start program about 23 million poor and elderly 
americans could be dropped by another program that helps them pay 
their utility bills she said 
it would be politically unpalatable across the board she 
said 
reischauer calculated the effect of a 97 billion cut next year 
the amount cbo believes may be necessary he said that would work 
out to 247 percent cuts in eligible defense spending and 372 
percent reductions for affected domestic programs 
even 60 billion in grammrudman cuts would require reductions 
in defense that were nonsensical from a foreign policy perspective 
and would be damaging to domestic programs reischauer said 
the overall us economy also would be badly wounded analysts 
said cutting federal spending by 100 billion would take that 
amount away from corporations members of the public and other 
beneficiaries of government programs 
as the economy cooled the governments tax collections would 
drop its payments to the unemployed and the poor would rise and 
the deficit would move upward again reischauer said 
you would see a slowdown to virtually a stall in the 
economy he said 
many in washington believe it will never come down to automatic 
cuts of the magnitude darman is suggesting they predict that a 
budget agreement will be reached by negotiation or the grammrudman 
law will be changed to reduce the amount of savings that are needed 
if not however the grammrudman cuts would be highly 
noticeable to the public 
people who make safety inspections of food and inspections of 
the workplace wouldnt show up said reischauer thousands of 
businesses that sell pencils and paper clips and stinger missiles 
and computers to the government would suddenly find their business 
is off dramatically 
the grammrudman cuts would not apply to every program in the 
budget 
in defense money the government has already committed to 
contracts cannot be slashed therefore out of the 290 billion 
defense budget about 190 billion would be subject to the 
reductions 
nearly threefourths of domestic programs would also be exempt 
from grammrudman cuts these includes social security payments 
interest on the debt and many federal retirement and veterans 
benefits many other programs including medicare and guaranteed 
student loans are subject to only limited cuts 
that means that programs vulnerable to cuts would be hit hard 
they would include many initiatives in which the government is 
building for the future education public housing science and 
highway construction all would be affected 
youd find entire agencies firing half their staffs said 
stanley collender who follows the budget for the accounting firm 
price waterhouse

two california democrats battling for their 
partys gubernatorial nomination have been trading the lead almost 
as often as pollsters can crank out new numbers 
the race between former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein and 
state attorney general john van de kamp may well be decided by two 
onehour debates set for statewide broadcast on sunday and one week 
later 
with less than one month to go before the states june 5 
primary the candidates have had few facetoface encounters and 
the campaign largely has been a fundraising fight and a battle of 
television ads 
these campaigns have become a black box said darry sragow 
feinsteins campaign manager on one side you put in dollar 
bills and on the other side you run out video tape 
total spending for the governors race is expected to reach 18 
million to 20 million by november 
the democratic contest has been marked by sharp shifts in public 
opinion feinstein was well ahead of van de kamp in early polls 
but the next round of surveys showed her lagging behind by a 
seemingly insurmountable doubledigit deficit 
next a milliondollar media blitz that extolled feinsteins 
performance as mayor of san francisco and cast her as a takecharge 
executive moved her from 18 percentage points behind van de kamp to 
19 ahead in six weeks 
that heavy lead soon evaporated fueled by van de kamp ads 
attacking feinsteins mayoral record but a los angeles times poll 
released in early may had her bouncing back with a 13point lead 
37 percent to 24 percent over van de kamp the undecided vote was 
even higher at 38 percent 
on the republican side lowkey lowprofile pete wilson has no 
major opposition and is steadily raising money for the november 
general election 
when feinstein was trailing in the polls wilson went out of his 
way to bolster her candidacy in hopes of eroding van de kamps 
support but as feinsteins campaign gained momentum wilson 
largely abandoned that tactic 
feinstein has crisscrossed the state in recent months hoping to 
overcome her earlier lack of personal contact with democrats 
outside her san francisco home base her unabashed support for the 
death penalty and her vocal antidrug stand have won backing from 
moderate and conservative democrats 
van de kamp however received the official endorsement of the 
state democratic party and has the support of other grassroots 
democratic groups and organized labor 
van de kamp has built his campaign on ethics the environment 
and crime pushing ballot initiatives on each subject in hopes they 
will generate popular support for his candidacy 
feinstein is the first woman to make a serious bid for the 
california governorship but it is van de kamp who describes 
himself as the best feminist in this race who has received the 
most backing from womens rights activists 
a 13 million infusion into feinsteins campaign from her 
wealthy husband real estate magnate richard blum has kept her 
drive alive and financed her television campaign 
van de kamp with perhaps double feinsteins money has received 
help from democratic stars including san francisco mayor art agnos 
feinsteins bitterly critical successor 
wilson is likely to raise the most money before november 
probably 10 million or more with substantial help from 
outofstate sources president bush has headlined two wilson 
fundraisers and reportedly plans to attend at least two more 
republicans consider a wilson victory pivotal to protecting gop 
interests in next years reapportionment battle the redrawing of 
political boundaries and the shifts in population are expected to 
boost californias congressional delegation by as many as seven 
members

the bush administration is expected to name 
career diplomat harry shlaudeman as the first us ambassador to 
nicaragua in almost two years a us official says 
the administration had planned to send another career diplomat 
melissa wells to managua but had a change of heart after 
concluding she might face a prolonged senate confirmation fight 
because she has been a target of conservatives 
the administration is eager to have an ambassador in managua 
quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that 
usbacked president violeta chamorro has taken over after almost 
11 years of rule by the leftist sandinista party 
mrs chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving 
nicaraguas bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation 
after long years of warfare 
the united states has had no ambassador to nicaragua since july 
1988 at the time the sandinista government expelled ambassador 
richard melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were 
interfering in the countrys internal affairs 
the reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight 
nicaraguan envoys in washington including ambassador carlos 
tunnermann 
shlaudeman who has served as ambassador to argentina peru 
brazil and venezuela is a premier state department specialist on 
latin america and is expected to win easy senate confirmation 
he retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called 
back to duty last fall to serve as a state department liaison with 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
shlaudeman who will turn 64 next week was approached by a 
senior state department official weeks ago about going to managua 
but said he was not interested 
he told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally 
by president bush when bush telephoned him earlier this week 
shlaudeman agreed to the appointment the us official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said wednesday 
in addition to his ambassadorial posts shlaudeman was the top 
latin america aide to president ford in the mid1970s and a 
diplomatic troubleshooter in central america under president 
reagan 
the us official said sen jesse helms rnc and several of 
his conservative allies would not assure the administration that 
they would not delay wells nomination 
when wells was nominated to be ambassador to mozambique in late 
1986 helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11 
months they took the action as a means of expressing opposition to 
the reagan administrations friendship toward mozambiques marxist 
government

a us airline pilot a british tycoon and a 
soviet cosmonaut hope to be the first adventurers to circle the 
globe nonstop in a balloon 
only three years ago such a trip as this would have been 
considered unthinkable cocaptain richard branson of the united 
kingdom said wednesday at a news conference announcing the attempt 
in the past the soviet union refused to allow a balloon into 
its airspace said project leader and captain larry newman of 
scottsdale ariz but the soviet space agency glavkosmos last year 
agreed to permit the expedition and even offered cosmonaut vladimir 
dzhanibekov as a partner newman said 
newman an america west pilot made the first successful 
transatlantic balloon flight in 1978 and holds the world distance 
record for a balloon 5209 miles across the pacific in 1981 
branson crossed the atlantic in a hotair balloon in 1987 
dzhanibekov a pilot is chief of glavkosmos cosmonaut training 
department and has been in space five times 
the helium balloon will take off from loral airdock in akron 
ohio sometime between november and february whenever weather 
conditions are best 
newman called the balloon essentially a giant plastic bag whose 
design has not been unveiled our secret weapon it was 
conceived by burt rutan of scaled composites inc who also 
designed the voyager aircraft that made the first nonstop flight 
around the world without refueling 
newman branson and dzhanibekov will spend 14 to 25 days at an 
altitude of at least 35000 feet in the balloons 24by10foot 
pressurized capsule 
the 1200pound fiberglass craft insulated with styrofoam to 
protect the crew from temperatures that can reach 60 below zero 
will have no steering capability leaving the crew at the mercy of 
the winds 
the vagaries of the wind are essentially our engineer 
newman said 
the three expect to be carried at 75 mph to 200 mph across the 
atlantic central europe the soviet union north of the himalayas 
across the pacific and back to the united states they hope to land 
anywhere east of the longitudinal line of akron newman said 
branson estimated the endeavor would cost in the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars primarily financed by his virgin atlantic 
airways 
nasa will supply navigational and communications equipment and 
the crew will conduct experiments for the agency to measure wind 
shears and examine the stratospheric ozone 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration will provide 
advisories on weather conditions maps and graphs and a 
searchandrescue beacon said noaa official gary castle 
in the early 1980s maxie anderson of albuquerque nm and don 
ida of boulder colo made three unsuccessful attempts to circle 
the world in a helium balloon taking a route south of the ussr 
newman however considers his own effort the first 
practical attempt 
in my mind this flight couldnt have been made with any other 
balloon that youve ever seen before he said

president bush says being poor is no excuse 
for being out of shape 
even someone who is not having it so good can stay physically 
fit bush said in a session with health and fitness writers at 
the white house 
i think that anybody can participate in certain kinds of 
fitness said bush who gave the interview on tuesday as part of 
his efforts to promote national fitness month 
yes theres differences he acknowledged some can afford 
snappy lifecycles or stairmasters and afford to go to health clubs 
and plenty of people cant 
but the concept of an individual doing some kind of athletics 
or some kind of calisthenics to stay fit transcends economic lines 
it seems to me bush told reporters from the detroit free press 
and other newspapers and magazines 
bush said he and his fitness czar actorbodybuilder arnold 
schwarzenegger want to debunk the notion that only the fiscally 
fit have the time or means to worry about exercise 
the president who turns 66 next month has an array of 
expensive exercise equipment for his personal use a few steps from 
the oval office not to mention a horseshoe pit heated pool and 
tennis court nearby 
bush captained the baseball team at yale and has played tennis 
and golf all his life he still jogs three times a week for two 
miles at a slowpoke 9minute pace the 6foot2 president said 
he is about five pounds overweight 
bush credits all this exercise with helping him keep up a daily 
7 amto6 pm schedule in the oval office plus two or three 
other events at home in the evenings 
i dont believe i could do that if i werent physically fit 
he told interviewers 
people think whats this ivy league elitist doing playing 
horseshoes this is some puton deal said bush but now they 
know i like it and as arnold can attest im reasonably good 
bush acknowledged he came from a privileged background where 
competitive sports were part of growing up 
im not suggesting that everybodys had it so good he said 
but i am suggesting that an example of an athletic presidency can 
set a tone for this concept of fitness that arnold and i are 
working together on 
the writers pressed the president on what he planned to do for 
americans who cannot afford to see a doctor an estimated 30 
million americans most in working poor families have no health 
insurance 
bush said health and human services secretary louis sullivan is 
searching for ways to get control of costs and if we can do 
that i think that will expand services 
asked if health care should be a basic right for all citizens 
he said i would think so yes but that doesnt mean that i 
think the federal government is the only way to do it 
all levels of government must be involved plus charitable 
care and neighbor helping neighbor bush said

the federal government is looking at tobacco 
smoke as an indoor pollutant in a draft assessment that is becoming 
the focus of a debate over whether passive smoking is harmful 
to your health 
antismoking activists say the environmental protection agencys 
work could encourage tighter restrictions on smoking while tobacco 
industry spokesmen said a scientific review would show there is no 
evidence that nonsmokers are being hurt 
the epa said wednesday it is drawing up a policy guide to 
workplace smoking restrictions and an assessment of the cancer risk 
to nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke 
agency spokesman dave ryan said he could not discuss the content 
of the draft until it is submitted to an independent science 
advisory board probably later this month 
but epa sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
draft assessment includes a statement that passive smoking is a 
known carcinogen responsible for more than 3000 cases of lung 
cancer among nonsmokers each year 
the draft conclusions were reported first in wednesdays los 
angeles times 
in a statement the epa said its risk assessment will classify 
ets the smoke to which nonsmokers are exposed at work and 
elsewhere according to the agencys carcinogen assessment 
guidelines 
it said the risk assessment was based on 24 studies of the 
association between passive smoking and lung cancer 
the separate policy guide will describe the technical basis 
for smoking restrictions as well as the technical and policy 
options for mitigating exposures to tobacco smoke the agency 
said 
the epas work usually involves regulating pollutants discharged 
outdoors by smokestacks or effluent pipes the agency said the 
assessment of passive smokings dangers is being carried out under 
the authority of the radon gas and indoor air quality research act 
of 1986 
john banzhaf executive director of action on smoking or health 
an antismoking group said the report could encourage the idea 
that the epa should be more involved in controlling indoor 
pollutants 
his group is suing another arm of the federal government the 
occupational safety and health administration to force it to ban 
smoking in workplaces nationwide or restrict it to separately 
ventilated areas 
i think theres going to be a tremendous breakthrough when the 
average person realizes that tobacco smoke can kill him or his 
loved one banzhaf said 
what they will report is that tobacco smoke is more dangerous 
than all of the other pollutants we regulate put together he 
said tobacco smoke is far more dangerous than radon it is far 
more dangerous than lead in gasoline it is far more dangerous than 
asbestos 
john r nelson vice president of corporate affairs for philip 
morris usa said most of the studies the epa is relying on 
examined very small groups of people usually in the home rather 
than the workplace he said they have found no evidence that 
tobacco smoke is causing lung cancer among american nonsmokers 
our interest in this process is that the epa consider all the 
scientific information out there nelson said if they do that 
theyll be compelled to conclude the evidence is not there to 
conclude that environmental tobacco smoke is a scientifically 
significant risk to nonsmokers 
he said the largest study for a phd dissertation at yale 
university by dr luis varela found that nonsmokers exposed to 
tobacco smoke in the workplace or from their spouses at home had no 
statistically significant risk of lung cancer 
the varela study also found that the more smokers were exposed 
to smoke in social situations the lower their risk of developing 
lung cancer nelson said 
the epa said in its statement that it was aware of the varela 
study and was seeking more information about it

the countrys secondlargest political 
party has asked parliament to declare its intention to leave the 
warsaw pact and become a neutral nation 
the proposal made wednesday by the league of free democrats 
advocates making it clear that hungary does not wish to belong to 
either the warsaw pact or nato 
it is similar to a 1956 government statement that annulled 
hungarys membership in the sovietled military alliance and 
prompted the soviet invasion that crushed a nationalist uprising 
deputy parliament speaker matyas szueroes said the proposal 
would be discussed during the next session of the new parliament 
which was chosen in march and april in the countrys first free 
elections in four decades 
the liberal free democrats led by former dissidents won 94 of 
parliaments 394 seats in the balloting the largest party the 
centerright hungarian democratic forum won 165 seats and is 
trying to form a coalition government with smaller traditional 
parties 
the socialist party which is dominated by former members of the 
longruling communist party won 33 seats 
the free democrats have not been approached as coalition 
partners and it is unclear if a new government would adopt their 
proposal 
the party campaigned on a platform of swift transfer to a free 
market economy while the democratic forum emphasized the need to 
avoid social disruption and generally emphasizes conservative 
traditional values 
hungarys leadership has until now pledged to remain in the 
sovietled alliance although individual leaders have repeatedly 
suggested the country could one day become neutral 
the free democrats proposed the new move on the basis of the 
1956 statement 
the proposal was presented by miklos vasarhelyi an associate of 
imre nagy the leader of the 1956 uprising vasarhelyi was 
imprisoned following the uprising nagy was executed after a show 
trial 
three days after hungary declared its withdrawal from the warsaw 
pact soviet troops and tanks rolled into budapest they have since 
remained though hungary has negotiated the complete withdrawal of 
soviet troops from its territory by the middle of next year 
the new parliament has asked to renegotiate the accord to 
provide for a quicker withdrawal 
a special subcommittee of the foreign relations committee in 
parliament is examining the issue 
vasarhelyi said the proposal does not call for hungarys 
immediate withdrawal from the warsaw pact but opens negotiations on 
the topic with moscow 
but he said that if the proposal is adopted hungary should 
suspend all activity in the east bloc alliance and forbid warsaw 
pact exercises on its soil 
the warsaw pact was established in 1955 and includes the soviet 
union east germany poland czechslovakia hungary romania and 
bulgaria the alliances future is uncertain now that most of its 
members have virtually broken free of soviet domination

sen dave durenberger faces new ethics charges 
that he abused his office and misused senate money in a pattern 
of improper conduct involving his minneapolis condominium 
the senate ethics committee on wednesday widened its case 
against the minnesota republican by finding substantial credible 
evidence of financial wrongdoing misrepresentations to the 
senate and improper administration of his blind trust 
the latest allegations stem from senate expense payments that 
durenberger claimed for renting the residence that he partly owned 
for several years durenberger may have violated federal law as 
well as senate rules the committee said 
the latest charges were added to an earlier list of allegations 
that will be the subject of triallike committee hearings scheduled 
to begin june 12 
the committee last february charged durenberger with six 
possible rules violations stemming from a 100000 book promotion 
deal and acceptance of free limousine service for personal travel 
the new allegations are the first mention in the case of 
durenbergers blind trust which had been approved by the ethics 
committee in february 1986 
durenbergers chief of staff bert mckasy said the trust held 
the senators interest in the condominium partnership 
the question as we understand it is whether the trustee of a 
trust who is also the senators attorney and the senator should 
have discussed the sale of the condominium and related matters 
mckasy said 
the committee listed three other possible violations 
submitting misleading travel reimbursement vouchers to the 
senate 
misrepresenting the ownership of the condominium 
backdating real estate transactions and other documents through 
which durenberger transferred the property to a partnership in 1984 
the panel found substantial cause to conclude that 
durenberger may have abused his united states senate office and 
misused united states senate funds through a pattern of improper 
conduct which has brought discredit upon the united states senate 
this is the logical next step in the inquiry said 
durenbergers press secretary lois west its what we expected 
would happen 
durenberger has denied any wrongdoing in the condominium deal 
although he admitted he was trying to cut the expense of 
maintaining homes in both the washington area and minnesota 
durenberger transferred the condominium to a partnership in 
which he was a partner in 1984 and backdated papers to obtain 
reimbursement for staying there in 1983 according to documents he 
provided the senate rules committee 
he sold the property to a company owned by his former campaign 
manager in 1987 but continued to get reimbursed for staying there 
until late last year 
durenberger repaid the senate 11005 last january after the 
rules committee decided he was not entitled to expenses incurred 
when he stayed at the condominium during official congressional 
recesses 
he also used the condominium when he returned to minnesota on 
weekends and at other times when the senate was in session 
durenbergers aides claim the backdating was proper since the 
senator had made the agreement for the partnership at that time 
durenberger said last week that he had been negotiating 
informally with the ethics committee and that the hearing date 
served as a deadline for reaching a settlement if he negotiated a 
plea agreement by then the hearings would be unnecessary 
mckasy said the committees statement makes clear that all 
matters will be resolved together in the near future 
durenberger does not face reelection until 1994 but polls 
indicate he has lost significant support in minnesota because of 
the yearold ethics investigation 
four of the six counts approved against durenberger on feb 22 
result from an arrangement he had with a publisher to promote two 
books he had written a fifth count charged durenberger with 
accepting gifts of limousine service for personal trips in the 
boston area 
the sixth count alleged that durenbergers actions reflected 
poorly on the senate

the senate is moving toward passing a bill to 
loosen a ban on political campaigning by federal employees as 
republican opponents bowed to repeated defeats on amendments and 
agreed to allow a final vote 
under an agreement reached late wednesday between the two 
parties leaders democrat george mitchell of maine and republican 
bob dole of kansas the senate would vote on a wholesale revision 
of the 1939 hatch act before recessing tonight 
before the final vote minority republicans will have the 
opportunity to offer nine more amendments including a measure by 
dole to continue the current restrictions on employees in 
intelligence agencies the justice department the internal revenue 
service and the federal election commission 
a similar amendment by dole was defeated on a 5146 vote tuesday 
despite a veto threat by president bush the bill was 
overwhelmingly approved by the house a year ago and in several 
test votes this week and last several republican senators joined 
democrats in defeating amendments by dole and other gop leaders 
aimed at retaining most of the current restrictions 
some 29 million federal civil service and postal workers are 
now prohibited entirely from working in campaigns soliciting 
contributions and holding office in the political parties or 
attending their state and national conventions as delegates 
even holding a campaign placard at a rally or voting in local 
caucuses on party nominations is a hatch act violation for which a 
federal employee can be suspended from his or her job 
the unionendorsed bill would still prohibit federal workers 
from engaging in any political activities while on the job and 
continue to bar them from running for public office or soliciting 
campaign contributions from the public 
but they could start holding office in local state and national 
political organizations and for the first time solicit campaign 
funds from the coworkers on behalf of candidates or federal 
employee union political action committees 
dole called the bill a pot of gold for the democrats because 
they receive on average about 90 percent of the millions of 
dollars in pac contributions already raised by postal and federal 
employee unions 
democrats have repeatedly denied an ulterior motive saying they 
only want to give federal workers the same political rights that 
people in eastern europe are beginning to exert 
bushs senior advisers have said they would urge him to veto any 
change in the law as undermining the integrity and independence 
of the traditionally nonpartisan civil service 
the senate has spent more than a week on the legislation with 
democrats mustering between a dozen and 17 republican votes on each 
of the challenging amendments by gop leaders 
george gould a lobbyist for the national association of letter 
carriers called the stream of amendments an attempt by gop leaders 
to slow the process to give the white house time to try to peel 
away votes 
republican whip alan simpson of wyoming admitted his party 
lacked the 40 votes needed to maintain a filibuster against the 
bill in the 100member senate he said the real test will come 
later when the white house asks republican leaders to scrape 
together the 34 votes needed to sustain a veto by bush 
in bushs first 16 months in office congressional democrats 
have been unable in 10 attempts to override any of his vetoes

an exconvict was convicted of poisoning 
the historic treaty oak with a powerful herbicide in an alleged 
occult ritual at the centuriesold tree and could get up to life in 
prison 
paul stedman cullen jr 46 faces five to 99 years in prison 
following his conviction by a jury wednesday of criminal mischief 
his sentencing hearing was to begin today 
cullen jailed since his arrest last june could receive a harsh 
sentence because of a previous burglary conviction and problems 
while on probation 
cullen refused to comment as he was led from court but his 
father insisted his son had done no harm to the 60foot oak 
discovered poisoned a year ago 
they convicted an innocent man said the elder cullen 
legend has it that texas patriarch stephen f austin and indians 
signed a treaty in the 1820s under the giant oak estimated to be at 
least 500 years old the tree is a city landmark and people have 
gotten married under its boughs 
the tree shed six sets of leaves in as many months after it was 
poisoned with velpar and half the trees crown is bare residents 
put getwell cards under the tree and lit candles for its recovery 
prosecutors said cullen poisoned the tree in a ritual to either 
end his affection for his drug counselor or to protect her from 
harm 
defense lawyers terry kirk described the exconvict as a 
loser with little selfesteem who boasted falsely about 
poisoning the tree to impress an acquaintance cindy blaco 
kirk said ms blaco became the prosecutions key witness to 
claim some 11000 in rewards 
ms blaco testified that during february 1989 when experts 
believe the tree was poisoned cullen had several books on 
witchcraft and the occult she said she saw two containers of 
velpar in the back of cullens truck traces of the herbicide also 
were found in the truck by police after cullens arrest 
more than 100000 has been donated to save the tree 
velparcontaminated dirt has been removed from around its roots 
the tree has been doused with spring water and elaborate screens 
were built to shade it

shipping companies scrambled to get 
barges off the missouri river after a federal judge acting to 
protect fishermen reduced the amount of water that may be released 
from a reservoir upstream 
were going to lose a lot of money several hundred thousand 
dollars said roger blaske coowner of blaske marine inc in 
alton ill 
his company was trying to get barges moved downstream from the 
omaha neb area wednesday for fear they will be marooned by 
falling water he said his company would try to get business on 
other rivers including the mississippi 
us district judge patrick conmys ruling issued wednesday in 
bismarck nd will keep the depth of south dakotas lake oahe 
steady until june 1 when the reservoirs walleye hatch will have 
ended 
south dakota officials contended the hatch would have been 
destroyed if the us army corps of engineers had gone ahead with 
plans to lower the reservoir 3 feet this month and the judge 
agreed there would be irreparable harm 
officials in south dakota north dakota and montana praised the 
ruling saying it would save a vital fishing industry 
but the downstream states of nebraska iowa and missouri said 
drinking water wildlife and power plants would suffer in addition 
to shipping companies 
a spokesman for nebraska gov kay orr called the decision very 
disturbing news and the army corps of engineers will appeal the 
ruling 
but south dakota gov george mickelson said the three states 
including his already have won even an expedited appeal is likely 
to take a few weeks mickelson said by then we will have 
accomplished most of what we set out to do he said 
the rivers main shipping channel runs 730 miles from sioux 
city iowa to st louis 
because of the ruling the river was expected to begin dropping 
at sioux city by midday today at omaha by may 11 and at kansas 
city by may 14 said corps spokesman john ferrell 
chet worm chief of the corps reservoir regulation section 
said the reduction would probably drop the river level by about 3 
feet at sioux city and by about 3 feet at omaha kansas city likely 
would see a drop of 2 feet 
it couldnt come at a worse time said marion conover 
fisheries management supervisor for the iowa department of natural 
resources he said most of the fish that build nests to lay their 
eggs spawn in may and early june 
don cummings wildlife management supervisor for the same 
agency said the lower water would hurt waterfowl too we did 
see some little ducklings and geese along the river he said 
the lower water is going to leave them high and dry 
once the river is lowered the corps may not be able to raise it 
again because the water could flood the nests of protected birds 
worm said 
in sioux city water systems supervisor rick mach said the lower 
water would affect the alluvial wells where the city gets its 
water the city has had to ration water the last two summers 
because of drought 
if we are going to have a low missouri river we will have to 
consider water rationing at a sooner time mach said 
utility officials in nebraska and iowa said the lower water 
could cause problems for power plants if they extend beyond june 
1 many plants draw in river water for cooling 
its entirely possible there would be some forced outages 
said omaha public power district spokesman mark gautier

the bush administration is opposing a special 
100 million international fund to help poor nations curb their use 
of ozonedepleting chemicals saying such assistance should be made 
through existing channels 
the united states agrees that financial assistance should be 
made available to help developing countries phase out production of 
cfcs chloroflurocarbons white house deputy press secretary 
roman popadiuk said wednesday in a prepared statement 
however we believe it is more sensible to use existing 
institutions and existing financial mechanisms already established 
by the world bank popadiuk said 
a world bank spokesman said wednesday that the institution has 
insufficient resources to handle the millions of dollars needed for 
such a project 
the spirit of former interior secretary james watt has been 
reincarnated in the bodies of white house chief of staff john 
sununu and budget director richard darman the tweedledum and 
tweedledee of environmentalism in the 1990s said sen joseph 
lieberman dconn 
sen claiborne pell dri said it is incredible to me that 
the bush administration would be unwilling to come up with the very 
modest sums involved in the transition fund 
sen al gore dtenn began circulating a letter to the 
president among colleagues asking for a meeting with the 
administration on the decision 
the establishment of such a fund was to be proposed at an 
ongoing cfc conference in geneva which us representatives are 
attending the washington post reported the europeaninitiated 
proposal wants money to help third world countries convert to 
alternative chemicals and identify ways to replace cfcs the post 
said 
such a fund would be administered by an international lending 
authority such as the world bank according to the newspaper 
cfcs are used widely for refrigeration and aerosol products as 
well as some production scientists say cfc emissions ares 
depleting the ozone layer that protects the earth from harmful 
ultraviolet rays 
the united states has signed a treaty calling for cutting cfcs 
in half by the end of the century

attorney general dick thornburgh says he has 
asked congress to stiffen criminal penalties for cross burnings and 
other forms of racial harassment that do not result in personal 
injuries 
the proposed amendments to the 1968 civil rights act would make 
cross burnings a felony under federal law punishable by a fiveyear 
prison sentence and a fine up to 250000 
the offense is now a misdemeanor that carries a maximum oneyear 
sentence and a 100000 fine 
misdemeanor penalties would be retained to allow prosecutors to 
bring lesser charges in appropriate cases the department said in a 
letter to congress 
the harsher penalties are proposed for what thornburgh called 
particularly egregious cases those where firearms are used or 
fire or threats of fire including cross burnings are employed 
thornburghs statement wednesday cited a case in which people 
who burned down a home rented by a black family were prosecuted for 
a misdemeanor because there were no injuries

the food and drug administration says it will 
strengthen warnings about a possible risk of leukemia for children 
taking a growthstimulating drug 
jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends 
asked the fda in february to ban the sale of human growth hormone 
or hgh pending further study to determine whether it increases the 
risk of leukemia 
studies in japan europe and the united states suggest that the 
risk of getting leukemia within four years after completing hgh 
treatment is two to three times greater than for children who have 
not received hgh he said 
fda spokeswoman faye peterson said wednesday the agency is aware 
of the studies 
she said the agency has not yet responded to rifkins petition 
but added that fda officials are going to adjust the labeling to 
make the wording stronger on a possible leukemia risk 
but were not going to take any action on the drug she 
said theres not enough evidence to do anything that will 
disturb its use 
the wording of the warning has not been worked out she added 
the geneticallyengineered hgh is sold by genentech inc under 
the trade name protropin and eli lilly under the trade name

the nations votingage population will climb to 186382000 by 
novembers election the census bureau projected on wednesday 
thats up from about 1827 million two years ago the bureau 
said 
but the absence of a presidential contest this year means there 
will probably be less public interest and so a lower turnout

congressional election year without a presidential vote only 334 
percent voted 
the new census report shows that voters in the 25to44 age

kim philby the famed soviet mole in british 
intelligence told soviet authorities about rudolf hesss secret 
mission to britain to arrange a separate peace three days after it 
happened tass reported 
the may 1941 mission came a month before nazi germany attacked 
the soviet union and prosecutors at the nuremberg war crimes trial 
said the germans through hess were seeking peace with britain so 
they could concentrate their efforts against the soviets 
it would have been possible to save hundreds of thousands or 
even millions of human lives if stalin had trusted soviet 
intelligence officers reports about nazi germanys preparations 
for an attack on the soviet union tass the official soviet news 
agency said wednesday 
tass counted philby among the soviet agents the british 
intelligence officer spied for the soviets for 30 years 
soviet secret archives on the flight of hess adolf hitlers 
deputy will be declassified in the next few days the news agency 
said it will include materials sent by philby tass said 
hess flew to england in a messerschmitt fighter plane on may 10 
1941 to try to arrange a peace treaty he said he did so without 
adolf hitlers knowledge but that was never proved 
hess was jailed after his flight after the war he was 
convicted of war crimes and imprisoned until his death in 1987 in 
berlin 
tass claimed philby helped thwart nazi attempts to conclude a 
separate peace with the western allies 
philby also gave stalin the allies strategy going into the 
potsdam conference in july 1945 where the victors worked out 
details of the postwar arrangements for europe tass said 
it said philbys reports were responsible for stalins cunning 
smile at the conference which was noted by a number of journalists 
who covered it 
tass said british prime minister winston churchill wrote in his 
memoirs that he was shaken by the depth of stalins perception into 
british policy in north africa during the war 
however this perception was based on precise information 
received from british intelligence where philby was making a 
skyrocketing career tass said 
philby also used his position in british intelligence to warn 
stalin of nazi plans for an offensive near kursk in the summer of 
1943 tass said the warning allowed the soviets to build up troops 
in the area before the great battle 
philby had access to intercepted german radio messages and

pop singer sinead oconnor became the second 
entertainer to boycott this weekends saturday night live 
because of guest host andrew dice clays foulmouth brand of humor 
saturday night live cast member nora dunn announced monday 
that she will not go on the air because of the comedians 
expletiveladen routines which refer to women as bitches and 
pigs seldom outside of a sexual context 
on wednesday oconnor joined the anticlay chorus 
it would be nonsensical of saturday night live to expect a 
woman to perform songs about a womans experiences after a 
monologue by andrew dice clay her spokeswoman elaine schock 
said in a phone interview from pelham ny 
saturday night live producer lorne michaels said the nbc 
program will find a new musical guest and the show will go on and 
clay has given me his word that he will not violate programming 
standards michaels said 
mtv banned clay from its cable network last year after he 
delivered a monologue laced with lewd poetry and references to fat 
women and sex clay had assured mtv repeatedly that his material 
would be in line with our programming standards a network 
official at the time 
dunn a fiveyear cast member applauded oconnors boycott as a 
very classy thing to do 
this is not about dirty words this is about the language of 
rape if you took the word woman in his routine and replaced it 
with jew i guarantee you that person would not be on saturday 
night live dunn said 
oconnors album i do not want what i havent got is no 1 
on the billboard pop chart her single nothing compares 2 u 
written by rock star prince also is the no 1 pop song on 
billboards charts 
schock said the irish singer watched videos of dices routine 
wednesday and decided to back out of the show 
i feel it shows disrespect of women that saturday night live 
expected me to perform on the same show as andrew dice clay 
oconnor said through her spokeswoman 
clay whose act has been called racist and homophobic as well as 
sexist called dunn nora dunce in an interview taped for 
wednesday evening on entertainment tonight 
i think nora dunce is a very silly girl he said because 
ive watched saturday night live many times and ive seen her 
play from hookers to just like street tramps and i wouldnt look 
at that and go if thats really her i wouldnt do the show 
i think shes just doing this because i am the hottest comic 
in the world today i didnt invent dirty words i just know how to 
make em rhyme 
in his act clay recites lewd parodies of nursery rhymes 
dunn reached at her new york home wednesday responded hes 
not too bright is he ive never played hookers or streetwalkers 
michaels said the defections took him by surprise 
suddenly we were getting phone calls and it sort of blindsided 
us he said in a telephone interview from new york where 
rehearsals were under way for saturdays show 
he said dunn did not talk to him about boycotting the show but 
if it is about conscience and principles i have to applaud her 
for that

the highly organized radical students 
who have battled police by the tens of thousands this week are 
among the elite of south koreas young a pampered 
antiestablishment cadre 
as university students they are the pride and joy of a nation 
that equates education with success and prosperity as 
international symbols of militance they are a deep embarrassment 
in a society that values harmony 
in koreas strict authoritarian society it seems paradoxical 
that senior government officials often urge students to avoid 
protest and then treat student protesters with leniency 
perhaps that is because koreans generally sympathize with 
student protesters though without necessarily agreeing with their 
opinions or tactics 
on wednesday tens of thousands of students battled riot police 
in seoul and 16 other cities to demand the ouster of president roh 
taewoo 
the violence coincided with the inaugural convention of the 
newly created democratic liberal party opponents contend the 
gigantic new governing party a merger of three political groups 
will lead to dictatorship 
the rioting was the most violent in the capital since 1987 
police said they arrested 1864 people nationwide but released most 
with warnings about 150 people including some 100 police were 
injured they said 
koreans traditionally feel students are the only selfless group 
in society to fight perceived wrongs they have no families to 
support no jobs to protect 
students as well as many citizens cherish the notion of student 
uprisings three times in this century studentinstigated protests 
have challenged governments to force change and three times history 
has treated those battling students as heroes 
virtually all koreans can recite student deeds in the 1919 
uprising against japanese colonial rule in the 1960 toppling of 
the government of president syngman rhee and the 1987 protests that 
opened the door to democratic reforms 
wednesays protests were the largest and most violent since 
nationwide antigovernment demonstrations nearly three years ago 
forced authoritarian president chun doohwan to carry out major 
democratic reforms and step down 
radical students feel they have an obligation to confront 
authority to fight the rich the powerful and the privileged the 
very group many will join after graduation 
radical students dramatize their countrys fever for unification 
with the communist north but unlike their elders lack experience 
to express concern about conflicts in communist and capitalistic 
ideology 
korea is one they shout at rallies 
campuses are adorned with colorful banners two and three stories 
high that show radical students astride the border between the two 
koreas 
none of them are old enough to remember the bloody 195053 
korean war launched by north korea to communize the south a war 
in which 5 million americans served some of them say they have 
never talked to an american 
the government says most of the radical students are naive 
leftists who have been brainwashed by communist north korean 
teachings some of them the government has said may be communist 
agents 
many korean students reach college age without ever having 
discussed politics or ideology their middle and high school years 
are spent slaving over textbooks and rote memorization to pass the 
allimportant college entrance exam 
its with a heady sense of righteousness and indignation that 
idealistic young radicals enter the political forum 
radicals view the january merger of the ruling party with two 
opposition groups as a political coup that altered party alliances 
without an election they support the overthrow of the government 
but offer little solid plans on how a new leader could do better 
radicals wear american jeans and sneakers carry their books in 
a backpack and look like college students everywhere they go to 
some of the best schools in south korea 
the radicals number only about five percent of the roughly 1 
million students in college other students listen to their 
rallies read their newspapers and may agree with some of their 
thinking but usually do not join the militants in their pitched 
battles with riot police 
radicals claim washington makes decisions for a seoul puppet 
government they demand the withdrawal of 43000 us troops based 
in south korea because they say their presence hinders unification 
talks with north korea 
the radical movement consists of both men and women students and 
is organized vertically with a direct line of authority training 
retreats are held to indoctrinate recruits 
at protests women collect rocks wave banners tend to injuries 
and sing support songs men deployed in platoon fashion hurl 
firebombs and rocks 
the radical student movement lost momentum after president roh 
took office in february 1988 in the countrys first direct 
presidential elections in 16 years and promised broad democratic 
reforms 
the smaller numbers forced radicals to become more violent to be 
noticed some began to use homemade explosives 
the government downplays the significance of violent protests 
but privately worries they could breed discontent among older 
koreans especially laborers who often feel underprivileged and 
underpaid

a federal judge in a decision with 
farreaching consequences has ruled northern wisconsins 
harvestable natural resources should be split 5050 between 
chippewas and nonindians 
the ruling wednesday by us district judge barbara crabb came 
in a lawsuit over chippewa rights under 19th century treaties to 
hunt deer but state legal experts say the decision extends to 
fishing and logging 
lawyers for wisconsins estimated 4000 chippewas had no 
immediate comment on the ruling 
tom maulson a chippewa active in treaty issues said the tribe 
has supported the idea of sharing resources for years he said 
dividing the resources will not unfairly deprive the chippewa of 
their rights 
i bet the tribe will never touch 50 percent he said we 
say the resource is for everybody maybe theyll start to realize 
thats what weve wanted all along 
the ruling came in a case that began with the arrest of two 
chippewas in 1974 for ice fishing off the reservation 
mrs crabb wrote that equal sharing is the fairest result and 
the inevitable one whatever analysis is employed 
she said the indians needs for a moderate standard of living 
dictate their right to a full share of the harvest subject to a 
ceiling set at 50 percent to prevent the frustration of the 
nonindian treaty right 
previously mrs crabb had ruled the chippewa are entitled to 100 
percent of the safe allowable catch of fish an allowance the 
indians had never come close to reaching state lawyers said the 
new ruling alters the previous one 
its our understanding of this decision that it does not apply 
only to deer but that it applies to all natural resources said 
wisconsin attorney general donald hanaway it includes fish it 
includes furbearing animals white tail deer and timber 
under treaties ceding indian territory to the us government 
wisconsins chippewas retain the right to spear fish hunt and cut 
timber off the reservation on 23929 square miles of public land in 
northern wisconsin 
since a court affirmed those rights in 1983 the chippewa have 
encountered huge and sometimes violent protests by nonindians who 
claim the treaty rights give them an unfair edge and threaten to 
deplete fish and timber 
the chippewa have filed a series of lawsuits asking the court to 
define how much of the resources they are entitled to and to what 
degree the state can regulate tribal activities 
state and tribal officials said that the chippewa were unlikely 
to take 50 percent of the available deer and that the ruling could 
provide a model for resolving the dispute over the tribes rights 
dean crist spokesman for the antitreaty rights group stop 
treaty abuse said that mrs crabbs ruling was a good step that 
didnt go far enough 
the bad thing is you still have less than 1 percent of the 
population with 50 percent of the resource he said it looks 
to me like shes trying to courtappoint comanagement 
comanagement the sharing of resources that has been used 
successfully in washington state has been touted by some as a 
solution to wisconsins dispute 
still to be decided are possible financial payments to the 
tribes for alleged state infringment on treaty rights

the first birth of testtube tiger cubs 
offers hope for the worlds endangered tiger population scientists 
say 
dr lee simmons said two yellow cubs and one white one were 
delivered by caesarean section april 27 at henry doorly zoo the 
surrogate mother was a 9yearold siberian tiger the parents a 
male and two females were bengals 
the white cub died shortly after birth from respiratory 
complications unrelated to the fertilization but the 
yellowandbrown striped cubs a male and female are healthy and 
being handreared at the zoo simmons said 
the invitro technique a technology developed on humans 
already has been used for farm animals an egg and sperm are taken 
from animals and combined in a lab dish and the resulting embryo 
is implanted in a surrogate mother 
three zoos doorly the national zoological park in washington 
and the minnesota zoological gardens in minneapolis have 
collaborated on the project for more than 10 years beginning with 
experiments on house cats simmons said 
the aim of the project is to take the technology into the wild 
where tigers are endangered because of human encroachment at least 
three of eight tiger subspecies have become extinct in the past 20 
years simmons said 
in the future he said frozen embryos from tigers in omaha or 
other zoos will be used to impregnate females captured in the wild 
in places like india or nepal the tiger would then be released to 
deliver her cubs in the wild 
the cubs born last month wouldnt be suitable for release 
because they were brought up around people simmons said they are 
on display at the zoo 
a project leader dr david wildt of the national zoo hailed 
the birth as bringing us one step closer to using reproductive 
techniques to preserve genetic diversity 
sperm and embryos could be collected from wild animals and 
frozen helping ensure survival of endangered species the 
scientists said 
john schalles a professor of biology at creighton university 
said the program will likely help some endangered species but 
the big problem out there is protecting the habitat these animals 
live in

the nations no 1 supplier of 
laboratory mice says it is up to 70 percent capacity after a fire 
one year ago today that dealt a blow to medical research projects 
around the world 
the blaze at jackson laboratory killed 400000 mice and 
destroyed much of the 29yearold breeding complex now it is 
counting on at least 10 million from the national institutes of 
health for a full recovery 
well be at 85 percent by the end of this summer and well be 
at 100 percent by the end of 1991 if we get the 10 million from 
nih said director kenneth paigen who was about to assume the 
post when the fire broke out 
an october report by a panel of consultants convened by nih said 
the blow to jackson represented a significant loss to important 
national research efforts the panel urged the government to 
provide money to restore the research center quickly 
jax mice as they are known in the scientific community are 
used in research on cancer aids diabetes arthritis and thousands 
of hereditary diseases 
the research center using frozen embryos can breed mice of 
1700 strains to give scientists the genetic makeup they need for 
their experiments 
the research center founded in 1929 and struck by a 
catastrophic fire in 1947 reported annual shipments of nearly 2 
million mice to researchers in all 50 states and 23 foreign 
countries before the fire 
about half of our total production went to provide mice that 
are unavailable from any other source in the united states 
paigen said in the kinds of mice 95 percent of whats used in 
the united states is only available from jackson 
paigen said the private nonprofit laboratory is unable to say 
exactly how much disruption the fire caused to an estimated 600 
million to 1 billion in scientific projects but its a big 
chunk 
the nih consultants said some food and drug administration 
research had to be reevaluated and the pentagon was said to face 
major impact on the future directions and capabilities of its 
research 
for now the research center is doing some of its work out of 
six trailers construction is under way on a permanent wing plans 
envision a series of separate buildings to minimize the impact of 
any new calamity 
fire health problems utility breakdowns tornados who knows 
what maine is subject to we cant lose it all again at one crack 
god willing paigen said 
ironically research at jackson itself was largely unaffected by 
the fire because scientists there raise their own mice some 
researchers however have had their working quarters squeezed 
down said paigen

the rev jesse jackson said harvard law 
school is morally on trial for its failure to hire a black 
woman professor and he ridiculed the schools claim that few 
candidates were available 
harvard officials say that 45 percent of the professors given 
full tnure at the university in the last decade were women or 
minorities 
the law school however has three black men and no black women 
among its 60 tenured faculty members its administrators say hiring 
has been limited by a lack of applicants who have excelled at top 
law schools or clerked for the supreme court two traditional pools 
for faculty members 
jackson speaking at a rally of 400 students wednesday said 
those standards were too narrow and elitist 
harvard university is saying in effect there is no 
africanamerican woman alive who is qualified to teach at our 
university to say that in 1990 is both an error and a gross 
insult to our intelligence jackson said 
harvard at the top of the hill of academia cannot cast 
shadows it must cast light in some sense the character of harvard 
is on trial 
derrick bell harvard laws first tenured black professor 
announced plans last month to take an unpaid leave of absence until 
the school hires a minority woman 
jackson came to harvard hoping to mediate the dispute between 
bell and the administration but law school dean robert c clark 
rejected the offer 
jackson did meet briefly with clark early wednesday however 
we had a very cordial visit i tried to convey a sense of the 
efforts we are making to achieve greater diversity clark said 
my sense is that he is concerned without a sense of urgency 
but there is an emergency here jackson said at a news 
conference this matter is not just internal injustice anywhere 
is a threat to justice everywhere 
tatia williams a thirdyear law student from washington who 
attended the rally said recruitment of minority teachers is 
important for helping minority students succeed 
if you have a homogeneous population of law professors i 
dont think that they can give a perspective that everybody can 
relate to she said theres a comfortability factor when 
people have like backgrounds and like lifestyles

the navy said 
the navy has not provided a cause of the fire or the amount of 
damage

as thousands of government employees 
walked off their jobs demanding more pay a top official said the 
new governments coffers are empty and it will have to impose harsh 
austerity measures 
the situation of bankruptcy is very serious antonio lacayo 
minister of the presidency told a news conference 
he said president violeta barrios de chamorros cabinet 
ministers had apprised her of the situation on wednesday 
planned steps to try to bring down inflation will be deeper 
more serious and more painful for the people and for all the 
country said lacayo the presidents soninlaw 
thousands of government employees went on strike wednesday and 
thousands more elsewhere threatened to join them to demand hefty 
pay raises to compensate for soaring inflation 
employees at the national assembly turned off the electricity 
and the sound system before going on strike leaving deputies 
sitting in the dark cavernous hall unable to begin their session 
the assembly workers were quickly joined by employees at other 
government offices including the labor and foreign ministries 
jose angel bermudez a leader of national federation of workers 
told a rally of 3000 government employees his organization was 
planning a nationwide strike if mrs chamorro does not do more to 
help wage earners he said the strike could be called later this 
week 
the newly formed independent federation claims a membership of 
60000 
bermudez demanded a 200 percent pay increase which he said will 
just cover the basic needs of an average workers family he 
scoffed at a 60 percent pay raise ordered by mrs chamorro on 
tuesday for the governments 61000 employees saying it was 
insufficient 
no government estimates on inflation are available yet for this 
year but the leftist sandinistas voted out of office in february 
implemented 31 devaluations along with tough austerity measures to 
bring inflation from a record 33600 percent in 1988 to 1800 
percent last year 
they devalued the currency eight more times this year before 
leaving office 
mrs chamorro also ordered a sharp devaluation of nicaraguas 
cordoba on wednesday she is urging the private sector to go along 
with 60 percent increases but many businessmen complain that they 
cannot cover the cost 
daniel ortega her predecessor accused mrs chamorros 
administration of pursuing a policy of terrorism in the economic 
field 
the prosandinista newspaper el nuevo diario called mrs 
chamorros policy antilabor saying that while cabinet ministers 
in the new government make up to 5500 a month a worker barely 
makes 44 
it was mrs chamorros third devaluation in three weeks 
dropping the value of the cordoba 20 percent on the official 
market which handles only a few essential imports such as crude 
oil and 51 percent on the parallel exchange where most of the 
money is changed 
mrs chamorro devalued the cordoba by about half on the parallel 
market april 29 four days after she took office and by another 20 
percent on may 5 
officials said the devaluations were necessary because the 
sandinistas left nicaragua broke after 11 years with only 3 
million in the treasury and a foreign debt of 11 billion for a 
country of 35 million people 
when the sandinistas seized power the cordoba was traded at 10 
to the dollar on wednesday 100000 bought one dollar on the 
official market and the parallel market rate was 180250 to a 
dollar 
the devaluation makes nicaraguan goods cheaper on foreign 
markets encouraging exports and makes foreign goods more 
expensive in nicaragua discouraging the spending of hard currency 
for nonessential goods

foreign minister moshe arens today criticized 
the united states for coordinating with arab states in drafting a 
un resolution opposing settlement of soviet jews in occupied 
areas 
i am troubled by the activity of the united states when the 
arab countries raise in the un security council the issue of 
immigration from the soviet union arens said on israel radio 
arens who indicated usisrael relations were at a low point 
took the unusual step of summoning us ambassador william brown on 
wednesday night to protest the us activity 
foreign ministry spokesman yossi amihud said israel objected to 
the us effort to formulate a resolution because it encouraged 
the arab attack on the right of jews to immigrate to israel 
a key paragraph of the working draft composed by nonaligned and 
arab states claims settlement violates international law a 
stronger wording than the us position which contends settlements 
are an obstacle to peacemaking 
israels policy and practices of settling part of its 
population and new immigrants in those occupied territories are 
in contravention of the fourth geneva convention and it is a 
serious obstruction to achieving a just and lasting peace in the 
middle east the arab draft says 
israeli officials said there was no policy of settling 
immigrants in occupied lands and no basis to suggest such 
settlement was illegal under the conventions governing the conduct 
of occupying powers 
other hardline sections of the twopage document which was 
read to the associated press state 
palestinian exiles should have the right of return 
aid that could be used for settlement should be withheld 
palestinian civilians should have impartial protection 
the draft grew out of a call in march by the soviet union for a 
debate on the settlement of soviet jews in occupied territory 
a un vote on a settlement resolution which had been scheduled 
for today was postponed with no new date set 
israeli officials said the united states should veto the 
resolution because it was part of a political warfare being 
waged by arabs who are opposed to all immigration to israel not 
just to the warwon lands 
they argued that western countries could not support the 
resolution without violating their stand in support of freedom of 
movement 
in the past the united states has vetoed most antiisrael 
resolutions but officials said that this time un ambassador 
thomas r pickering has been seeking agreedon language with the 
arabs he proposed various changes earlier this week to soften the 
hardline sections but details were no available 
arens referred to the increasing strain in israelus 
relations saying theres no doubt that at this moment we are 
going through a period of tension with the united states 
he contrasted the troubled relationship with bushs 
administration to the more sympathetic treatment israel received 
under former president ronald reagan 
we have had differences of opinion with the united states on 
certain subjects for many years with this administration 
especially in all that is connected to settlements said arens 
despite us expressions of concern rightwing prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs caretaker government helped fund a jewish 
settlement in jerusalems old city and started two new ones in the 
west bank and gaza strip 
there are more than 70000 jewish settlers in the west bank and 
gaza strip where 17 million arabs live 
gad ben ari spokesman for the jewish agency which assists 
immigrants said only about 200 soviet jews about onethird of 1 
percent had chosen to live in the occupied territories in the past 
year 
he said about 1000 had chosen to live in jerusalem but no 
figures were available on how many are in israeliannexed arab east 
jerusalem where 120000 jews and 130000 arabs live 
about 30000 soviet jews have come to israel so far this year 
and more than 150000 are expected in the next 12 months

premier andrei lukanov has announced wage 
hikes and measures to ease consumer shortages in an apparent 
attempt to boost the chances of the ruling former communist party 
in next months free elections 
lukanov told a news conference wednesday that minimum monthly 
wages will be raised as of june 1 the export of foodstuffs and 
other goods in short supply will be banned and a steep hard 
currency tax on imported cars will be abolished 
the government which recently suspended payments on bulgarias 
10 billion foreign debt also will try to import food and will 
guarantee the jobs of workers at unprofitable companies until after 
the elections lukanov said 
while approving free elections and professing to accept full 
democracy the communists remain in full control in bulgaria prior 
to the elections scheduled for june 10 
 
the premier a leading figure in the renamed communist party 
now the socialists said minimum monthly wages would be raised june 
1 from 140 to 170 leva under the current official exchange rate 
there are eight to nine leva to the dollar 
the average wage in bulgaria at present is about 250 leva 
before a drastic change in exchange rates decreed this spring one 
dollar officially was worth 250 leva 
by the end of this week the government will issue a list of 
consumer goods that cannot be exported by either bulgarians or 
foreigners lukanov said 
the measure seemed intended to alleviate the fast increasing 
food shortages in this traditionally agrarian country of 9 million 
people 
also new laws will be passed to punish speculators exporting 
consumer goods and to alleviate the tension on the internal 
market lukanov said 
yugoslavs romanians and greeks are thought to buy up cheap 
bulgarian appliances and other goods for resale at higher prices 
abroad bulgarians have also engaged in such trading in goods from 
the increasingly empty shelves 
sugar is the latest scarcity a shop in sofias downtown 
rakowski street selling several hundred pounds of imported sugar 
was besieged by hundreds of citizens on monday and tuesday 
lukanov said draft legislation on privatizing farmland and 
industry will be published for public debate within the next 
few days currently farmers are allowed to own only small plots of 
about 1 acres around their homes with the bulk of agricultural 
land in state hands 
lukanov also disclosed that bulgarian geologists had discovered 
rich oil fields in central northern bulgaria around the town of 
pleven 
the oil deposits are some 13000 feet deep the premier said 
bulgaria is negotiating with foreign firms to exploit the oil 
fields whose exact extent was not revealed 
bulgaria long viewed as the soviet unions most loyal ally in 
eastern europe is seeking to boost its ties to the west as it 
moves away from the hardline communist rule of todor zhivkov 
ousted november after 35 years in power 
but the ruling socialists are cautious about scrapping 
centralized economic planning and subsidies and introducing a 
totally free market 
lukanov praised an accord signed with the european community 
this week to give bulgarian goods including agricultural produce 
and greater access to the ec market he also said bulgaria hopes to 
join the international monetary fund by september 1990

oil rigs disguised as dinosaurs and four 
giant red lobsters were the winning entries in a national design 
contest to decorate a rundown gasoline station built in the 
mid1950s 
the jury initially dismissed the lobster motif as too 
whimsical but we kept coming back to it over and over said 
former mayor pamela plumb one of the judges it would become the 
eiffel tower of portland an instant landmark and potential 
meeting place she said 
theyre not token lobsters or trite gestures theyre blown up 
to a scale where theyre truly heroic said deborah andrews 
another judge 
the 60footlong and 20foottall lobsters each resting on a 
giant canopy were designed by philadelphia architects willis 
pember and andrew blanda 
that design and the dinosaur entry from architect william 
collett of cambridge mass were the winners in the gateway gas 
design competition devised by the cn brown co owner of the 
dilapidated station 
the two firstplace winners announced wednesday received 2000 
each residents in portand will have a chance to comment about the 
winners and 157 other entries 
cn brown is not obligated to use any of the designs when it 
renovates the station the contest came about when city planners 
balked at the companys bid to use a standard mobil oil corp 
design to replace the existing structure 
colletts design pays homage to fossil fuels the roof is 
reminiscent of prehistoric animals and appears to mimic the action 
of oil drilling rigs when blown by the wind

a computer system used at us border crossings 
to screen out criminals contains inaccurate information and is 
ineffective congressional investigators have concluded a 
newspaper reported today 
the systems defects may have resulted in a significant 
impairment of the ability of border agents to prevent criminals 
from entering the country the new york times said 
the problem dates back to the creation of the computer records 
investigators with the general accounting office the auditing arm 
of congress said in a report to a house panel 
criminals may enter the country while innocent people may be 
stopped and searched at borders the report said 
the gao report given to the panel in march was provided to the 
times recently 
the computer system treasury enforcement communications system 
ii is maintained by the customs service 
computer terminals linked to the system give customs agents 
background information based on the names and automobile license 
numbers of people wishing to enter the country 
the bush administration has recommended that the computer system 
be used as a central repository for information gathered by 
agencies that enforce drug laws 
a customs service spokesman challenged the reports findings 
this system is not rife with errors said spokesman dennis 
shimkoski he said many of the problems cited by the report had 
been identified previously by internal investigators at the customs 
service and were being corrected 
the gao report said no lookout records had been created in 
the computer system for known drug smugglers and other major 
criminals as a result border guards did not know which suspects 
to detain 
the gao reviewed files for 70 investigations in which customs 
agents had arrested or searched people last june the report found 
that in 65 of those cases the suspects names were not entered 
into the system even though many of them were drug smugglers had 
tried to enter the country with concealed weapons or were involved 
in other major crimes

toyota motor corp denied today that it tried to 
prevent texas oilman t boone pickens from placing ads in local 
newspapers in his battle to assert ownership rights in a japanese 
company 
but several of tokyos largest newspapers said they held up the 
ads which claim that collusive business practices force higher 
prices on consumers the papers said they were considering printing 
a version that omits company names 
theres no freedom of speech in japan said pickens lawyer 
kanji ishizumi toyota published an ad in a us paper saying 
shut up to pickens they were able to enjoy freedom of speech in 
the united states but pickens cant do that here 
pickens issued a statement wednesday in texas claiming toyota 
and its powerful advertising agency dentsu were trying to block 
him from publishing the ads 
since last year boone co a us investment firm has held the 
largest equity stake in koito manufacturing co a major automobile 
parts maker closely linked to toyota japans largest automaker 
pickens says his unsuccessful battle to gain a seat on koitos 
board of directors and to exercise leadership in the company 
illustrates how investment opportunities are closed to foreigners 
in japan 
the pickens ad is addressed to consumers auto parts employees 
and shareholders of koito claiming the texans fight could be a 
major step toward freeing japanese consumers from artificially high 
prices and returning portions of the profits to the companies 
investors 
the ad asks japanese consumers with any information on unfair 
practices of toyota nissan honda or other carmakers to send it 
to pickens in dallas 
it would never ever happen that dentsu would pressure the 
media not to carry pickens advertisement said jim sakaguchi of 
toyotas international affairs department we have never 
discussed this matter with dentsu 
pickens statement said our ads were accepted but we have 
now been told that there wont be any space available for several 
more weeks because toyotas advertising firm dentsu is buying up 
all available space 
dentsu the worlds largest advertising agency places more than 
20 percent of the ads in major newspapers and almost onethird of 
ads in major magazines 
in his book the enigma of japanese power karel van wolferen 
wrote that dentsu helps shelter big business from the scrutiny of 
consumers 
dentsu is able to apply enormous pressure on the media not to 
report or to downplay incidents that might harm the prestige of 
its clients wolferen wrote 
the ad was to have been published wednesday in the asahi 
shimbuns edition in hokkaido in northern japan a worker in the 
advertising section said the ad had been delayed 
japans largest newspaper the yomiuri shimbun said it was 
considering running the ad without references to toyota and honda 
two of the newspapers principal advertising clients 
we dont want to get involved in anything that upsets our 
major clients thats how we support our business said ikuo 
terai of the papers advertising department 
terai said the paper refused the pickens ad twice because it 
didnt want to publish a personal dispute between pickens and 
koito 
representatives from the mainichi shimbun and asahi shimbun said 
the ads had been delayed but that they would run by may 16 with 
references to toyota and honda deleted from the original text

ramona africa remains imprisoned five years 
after she survived a fire that killed 11 fellow members of the 
radical group move refusing to renounce her beliefs even though 
doing so would mean freedom 
ms africa the only adult to survive the blaze touched off when 
philadelphia police bombed moves rowhouse stays in an 
8by10foot cell at a prison for women where she has fought 
losing battles large and small against the system 
she wants freedom to associate with move friends but her 
refusal to renounce her family keeps her in her cell and she 
wants to be known as ramona africa a last name move members 
generally adopt but the system makes her use the name ramona 
johnson 
according to your law we have the right to speak freely and 
to demonstrate freely ms africa said in a prison interview 
but because the police department and every agency of this system 
are designed to protect the institutions of this system they are 
not going to support move 
on may 13 1985 move and police transformed a quiet 
neighborhood into a combat zone gunfire rang out for hours and a 
bomb dropped in an attempt to dislodge a bunker atop move 
headquarters started a fire that destroyed 61 homes and left 270 
people homeless 
eleven move members including five children were killed in the 
attempt by police to evict them for harassing neighbors with 
foulmouthed revolutionary rhetoric blared through a bullhorn at 
all hours 
memorials are planned for friday and saturday in philadelphia 
if people knew the truth about move they would not stand for 
this system treating us the way it does ms africa said 
those among the 14 imprisoned move leaders who are eligible for 
parole have been told they can get out if they renounce the 
organization none has agreed ms africa was eligible for parole 
five months after being sentenced in 1986 
according to ms africa move whose name stands for nothing in 
particular was once a peaceful but misunderstood group protesting 
in the 70s against abuse of animals the elderly and the 
environment the system made it mean 
in 1978 in the groups first serious brush with the law a 
policeman was slain in an attempt to evict move from a house 
we dont say that move is innocent and expect people to just 
accept it ms africa said our innocence is documented all 
through the court records 
ms africa who considered going to law school after becoming 
involved with move had been selected the groups spokeswoman 
before the 1985 battle 
she was very articulate direct and nonhostile recalled 
michael nutter who attempted to mediate the 1985 dispute between 
move and police 
nutter said ms africa spoke in calm reassuring tones and asked 
questions of him that he could not answer she put forth 
intelligent questions asking me what i would do in the same 
situation nutter said 
she still asks the same kinds of questions calmly inquiring 
what other steps she could take against a society that imprisoned 
people she says are innocent 
as for her personal battles ms africa said nothing less than 
her identity is at stake 
mail addressed to ramona africa is returned undelivered with 
a note saying no such person is lodged there consent forms for 
interviews tape recorders and photographs come back to her if she 
doesnt sign the name johnson 
is it worth it she asked being right is worth it

india today rejected negotiations with 
the united states over removing india from an american hit list 
of countries targeted for unfair trading practices 
india is not going to be intimidated or policed by anybody 
on the issue of countrys sovereignty and economic independence 
commerce minister arun nehru told the national parliament 
nehrus statement marked the first time indian officials have 
openly rejected negotiations with the united states over the trade 
issue 
on april 27 president bush cited india under a 1988 law that 
provides for economic sanctions if protective trade barriers are 
not eliminated bush removed japan and brazil from the list 
leaving india the only country on it 
india has steadfastly refused to modify its restrictive trade 
policies designed to protect domestic industries by limiting 
foreign investment and imposing high import duties 
nehru said india will not enter into either secret or open 
negitiations with the united states under threat of retaliation 
under the 1988 us omnibus trade act washington could levy 
tariffs of up to 100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged 
an unfair trader 
under former prime minister rajiv gandhi india began a program 
of relative economic liberalization opening up to limited foreign 
investment but indias new government led by prime minister vp

china said today that it freed a second large 
group of protesters arrested for roles in last years prodemocracy 
movement including leading journalist dai qing and several famous 
academics 
the official xinhua news agency said 211 lawbreakers have 
been given lenient treatment and released upon completion of 
investigations 
thousands of students workers and others who took part in 
massive marches in beijing and other cities were detained after the 
armys attacked protesters in the capital on june 4 killing 
hundreds of unarmed civilians 
the releases come shortly before president bush must decide 
whether to renew chinas most favored nation trading status 
which entitles it to lower tariffs 
the united states grants mostfavorednation status to almost 
all countries but bush can deny it if a country does not allow its 
citizens freedom to travel 
some us congressmen have indicated they favor lifting chinas 
mostfavorednation status to protest its overall human rights 
record the prison releases and the lifting of martial law in tibet 
last week both appeared intended to placate such critics 
the government announced in january that it had released 573 
people the only other large group to be freed 
xinhua quoted an unidentified spokesman for the public security 
ministry as saying 431 people remain in custody and under 
investigation the report did not elaborate and the 431 presumably 
does not include those tried and sentenced 
the official media has reported 20 executions of people who took 
part in the protests and violent clashes with the army and police 
and the government has denied western reports of other secret 
executions 
few other sentences have been made public and none of the 
trials have been open to foreign journalists 
dai qing a journalist for guangming daily said she was 
released wednesday 
coming back home was like a dream after 10 months my kitchen 
is like a stranger she said contacted by telephone at her home 
in beijing she declined to speak further saying she would be 
arrested again if she spoke to reporters without permission 
sources have said ms dai and other leading intellectuals were 
held at qincheng prison in western beijing and were generally well 
treated 
she had made an emotional but unsuccessful appeal to the 
students to quit their occupation of central beijings tiananmen 
square days before the army crackdown 
also released was cao siyuan former director of a research 
institute under the stone corp chinas leading computer company 
and an adviser to ousted communist party chief zhao ziyang zhao 
was purged last summer for allegedly supporting the democracy 
movement and splitting the party 
zhou duo also of stone corp one of four nonstudents who 
staged a hunger strike in the square on june 2 also was released 
only one of the hunger strikers liu xiaobo remains in jail and 
sources have said he has been charged with counterrevolutionary 
incitement 
the public security ministry spokesman said protesters still in 
prison would be dealt with leniently if they show a good attitude 
make voluntary confessions and show repentance 
those who obstinately stick to a wrong course and continue 
to do evil will surely be punished strictly he said 
also today cable news network owner ted turner said he believed 
the chinese government felt forced to call in troops last year 
to end the prodemocracy movement 
in a speech to foreign journalists turner also accused the 
united states of interfering in the affairs of other nations 
the thing that drives me most crazy and makes me most 
embarrassed is the fact that our leaders feel they have the right 
to interfere in the affairs of other countries and tell them what 
to do he said i personally dont feel thats done a bit of 
good 
he added you catch more flies with honey 
turners cnn played an important role in showing the world the 
events of last spring when students intellectuals and workers 
sometimes in the hundreds of thousands took to the streets every 
day for seven weeks demanding political reforms and an end to 
corruption in government 
in another development today about three dozen chinese 
demonstrated outside the australian embassy in beijing to demand 
refunds of thousands of dollars from australian schools the 
protesters said they paid tuition and board money in advance to the 
englishlanguage schools but later were refused visas and could 
not attend 
diplomats inside the embassy refused to come out to talk to the 
students 
were simply not willing to cooperate in a staged publicity 
event embassy spokesman grant thompson said later in an 
interview inside the embassy

albania has announced it will ease 
restrictions on travel and religion as part of a package of laws 
representing a break from the countrys stalinist traditions 
europes last hardline communist country also said it wants to 
join the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe in a further move from its decadeslong policy of 
isolationism 
the proposed reforms were announced before the albanian 
parliament on tuesday and a report on the meeting carried by the 
state ata news agency was made available to the associated press 
in vienna on wednesday 
the moves come before an expected visit to albania on friday by 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
in a speech to the parliament deputy premier manush myftiu said 
a new law was being drafted that would allow any albanian to hold a 
passport to travel abroad ordinary albanians have been forbidden 
to travel outside the country for more than 40 years 
he did not say when the travel law would be ready or whether 
there would be any other conditions for travel it was not clear 
whether the move was part of the countrys bid to join the european 
security conference process 
myftiu also indicated that the death penalty would no longer be 
applied to people attempting to flee the country illegally he said 
that defection which remains an offense would no longer be 
treated as a capital crime involving betrayal of the country 
myftiu added that albania would no longer punish people for 
spreading religious propaganda and ease laws banning 
antisocialist agitation 
albanias communist leaders have vigorously promoted atheism 
under its former stalinist leader enver hoxha albania banned all 
faiths and closed all houses of worship 
hoxha also pursued a policy of isolationism shunning relations 
with both superpowers albania which broke with the soviet union 
and the warsaw pact in the 1960s refused to join the european 
security conference charging it meant interference in the 
countries internal affairs 
but since hoxhas death in 1985 his successor communist party 
chief ramiz alia has moved gradually to reestablish contacts 
abroad and introduce new policies at home 
last month the communist leadership signaled albanias 
willingness to resume relations with moscow and washington and to 
establish ties with the european economic community 
at tuesdays session of parliament premier adil carcani said 
his country wanted to join the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
he emphasized the countrys desire to join the process of 
european cooperation and security and render our possible 
contribution to its process 
carcanis statement was believed to be the first such public 
pronouncement by an albanian leader senior officials had 
previously only hinted that albania might now consider joining the 
conference 
the conference which first met in 1975 in helsinki finland 
groups 35 nations all the european nations except albania as 
well as the united states canada and the soviet union 
at the helsinki meeting the nations signed a key accord on 
european security issues economic cooperation and human rights 
at later conference meetings the countries adopted 
supplementary documents that helped stir popular demands for human 
rights in eastern european countries where communist regimes were 
toppled in dramatic revolutions last year 
one of the key points in the helsinki accords is the right to 
free travel 
albania wedged between yugoslavia and greece has about 31

the homicide rate in the nations capital 
declined for the first four months of the year law enforcement 
officials say 
as of may 1 there were 152 homicides in the city 85 percent 
less than at the same time last year when there were 165 had 
slayings increased at the same rate as the two previous years 
there would have been more than 250 people killed in the city by 
may 1 
a year ago this month there were 55 percent more killings than 
at the same time in 1988 the rate of increase between may 1987 and 
may 1988 was the same 
dc police chief isaac fulwood jr said wednesday he doesnt 
want to read too much into the statistics he noted that a few bad 
nights of violence could send the homicide tally soaring its 
just too early to tell fulwood said 
american university criminologist james fyfe said one possible 
reason for the slight decrease in slayings is what sociologists 
call the ceiling effect 
you hit a peak and you cant go much higher because there is 
only a limited pool of people who are committing the homicides or 
are subject to being victims of homicides fyfe said this 
small group of people who account for the number of homicides are 
wearing themselves out

east german teachers factory workers and 
farmers held protests nationwide today to demand job security when 
their nation unites with west germany 
teachers closed classrooms textile and leather workers shut off 
their machines and farmers in tractors blocked border crossings 
into west germany in the latest and largest demonstrations by an 
increasingly restive workforce 
the protests came as lawmakers met to discuss the status of 
negotiations with west germany on merging the two nations 
there have been growing signs of a split in recent days in the 
coalition government of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
the leftleaning social democrats the junior partners in the 
coalition are demanding more social guarantees to protect workers 
from the loss of jobs and benefits when the nation shifts quickly 
to a freemarket economy 
thousands of teachers held two to fourhour warning strikes 
this morning in east berlin frankfurt and der oder magdeburg 
neubranderburg hohenschoenhausen rostock and halle the 
government news agency adn said

marched through east berlin to the parliament building where 
lawmakers were convening 
the marchers demanded job and benefits security 
farm workers blocked highway border crossings at the east german 
cities of magdeburg eisenach and rudolphstein police said 
traffic was snarled for about an hour in the latest of several 
blockades held by farm workers 
after the protests started parliament secretary guenther krause 
said discussions would begin next week with the 600000member farm 
workers union and eventually all labor organizations adn said 
the farm workers are fearful of job losses from western 
competition and the transition of stateowned land to the private 
sector 
thousands of leather and textile workers in leipzig dresden and 
chemnitz shut off their machines for an hour to call attention to 
their fear of western imports adn said 
east germans have been buying bettermade western imports since 
the borders between the nations were opened in november after the 
stalinist regime was ousted 
last month workers at a chocolate factory began selling their 
goods doortodoor because east german shops were buying cheaper 
bettertasting west german chocolate 
economists predict that many inefficient east german factories 
will close in the next year and that between 500000 and 2 million 
east german workers will lose their jobs 
on wednesday the ministry for labor and social affairs said the 
number of unemployed rose from 38313 in march to 64948 last month 
the unemployed included 36000 skilled workers 16000 unskilled 
workers and 12000 unemployed who have recently left school 
according to the figures distributed by adn 
east germany once had one of the strongest economies in the 
soviet bloc but since the beginning of the 1980s has been plagued 
by growing inefficiency 
east germany and west germany plan to merge their economies and 
social institutions by july 2 when the west german mark will 
become the currency of east germany 
in bonn west germany today chancellor helmut kohl pressured 
east germany to show greater flexibility in negotiations over 
unification and told parliament that a series of important 
questions needs to be resolved before the two nations can seal 
their planned merger

of a sixnation tour that will include nigeria libya algeira 
egypt and zambia

a lawsuit to abolish runoff elections might help 
andrew young become georgias first black governor but then again 
it might be the kiss of death political analysts say 
twentyseven legislators civil rights leaders and others filed 
the federal lawsuit to end runoffs in most statewide and regional 
elections they said wednesday its aim is to boost black voting 
power not help youngs campaign 
this is not about candidates who are running this time said 
state rep billy mckinney 
georgia is one of nine states eight of them in the south that 
require candidates to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the 
primary or else face a runoff 
the lawsuit filed tuesday contends runoffs violate the 1965 
voting rights act by diluting black voting strength 
the runoff requirement forces you to run twice to win once 
said state rep tyrone brooks the lead plaintiff the law was 
enacted to deny black people access to the political process 
it wasnt known whether the lawsuit would be settled before the 
july 17 primaries no hearing was immediately scheduled 
young former atlanta mayor and un ambassador is the leading 
candidate for the democratic primary but recent polls give him 
only about 30 percent of the vote 
if young were to win the primary without having to prove himself 
in a runoff he would be in the weakest possible position going 
into the general election said emory university political science 
professor merle black 
young would have the immediate political problem of attracting 
white votes anyone who wins the primary with only 30 percent of 
the vote has simply not demonstrated an ability to unite the 
party black said 
georgias population is an estimated 27 percent black 
pollster claibourne darden called the lawsuit the closest 
thing to the kiss of death to the state democratic party than 
anything they could do and said it would boost the chances of 
johnny isakson the republican frontrunner 
georgia has not had a gop governor since reconstruction 
young said he wants to win the democratic nomination under the 
current rules to ensure unity against the republican nominee 
charlie schroder executive director of the democratic party of 
georgia said he thinks the elimination of the runoff would be a 
travesty because candidates could win election with a small 
percentage of votes 
the biggest loser in all of this is not the democratic or 
republican party its the voters of georgia he said 
alec poitevint chairman of the georgia gop said he didnt know 
whether the republicans had anything to gain from the elimination 
of runoffs 
lt gov zell miller and state sen roy barnes two of youngs 
democratic opponents who are both white said they opposed the 
lawsuit 
i favor runoffs and i believe they are constitutional 
miller said if you read that great document youll see in 
several places where a majority vote is mentioned 
tuesdays lawsuit is the second major federal case involving 
georgia election laws the us justice department last month 
declared unconstitutional the states method of electing some 
superior court judges

eritrean rebels today appealed for a 
unsponsored referendum to determine the future of ethiopias 
northernmost province 
it is the only option to bring about a peaceful solution and 
thereby ensure the basic rights of the eritrean people to 
selfdetermination rebel radio said in a clandestine broadcast 
monitored in nairobi 
the statement by the eritrean peoples liberation front said the 
nearly 30yearold secessionist war was not merely ethiopias 
internal matter but a war of independence for which the world 
community will be held responsible 
the rebels took up arms in 1962 to press for the independence of 
eritrea province a former italian colony federated to ethiopia in 
1952 by a resolution at the united nations 
eritrean rebels say the late emperor haile selassie annexed the 
territory to his empire through bribery and threats to legislators 
who then voted to join ethiopia 
the broadcast said the liberation front calls on the united 
nations as a representative of the world community and legitimate 
organ responsible for the eritrean issue to conduct that is to 
supervise a referendum 
it described as illegitimate president mengistu haile 
mariams proposal for autonomy as an alternative to eritreas 
independence 
last year the ethiopian government agreed to peace talks with 
the rebels but said any solution to the conflict must result in a 
unified ethiopia 
in two sessions of preliminary talks presided over by former 
president jimmy carter late last year the rebels and the 
government agreed to enter into substantive talks with each side 
choosing two observers 
however the talks so far have failed to materialize because the 
united nations declined observer status on the eritrean side 
saying it could not involve itself in what it considered a member 
states internal problem 
the rebels appeal for the referendum came at a time when they 
appear to have an upper hand in the fighting 
in february the eritreans launched their largest offensive in 
africas longest continuous civil war and captured the red sea port 
of massawa one of ethiopias two harbors

word that hundreds of thousands of americans 
watch tv at work may trouble their bosses but it was welcome news 
to network executives 
an ac nielsen co study released wednesday by abc estimated 
that more than 1 million tv viewers arent counted by current 
rating methods because they watch at work in bars or other places 
and not at home 
these findings reinforce the need for improved measurement 
methods that accurately reflect how viewers really use television 
today in todays media environment abc research chief alan 
wurtzel said in a statement 
the oneweek study made in november and conducted among 4196 
people was sponsored by nbc nielsen abc and cables espn sports 
channel about 53 percent of the 4196 completed the viewing 
diaries used in the study abc said 
the study gave no margin of error 
about 36 percent of those who completed the diaries watch tv at 
work and 21 percent tune in in hotels and motels the study said 
sixteen percent watch in bars and restaurants 9 percent in second 
homes and 15 percent in other places 
nielsen whose ratings represent 921 million homes with 
televisions doesnt count viewers in such places as bars hotels 
or college dormitories 
major networks have been losing viewers to cable independent 
stations and the fox network of 129 stations cbs nbc and abc 
which once had a 90 percent share of the viewing audience last 
season accounted for a combined 65 percent

firefighters and a spring storm yet it seemingly hopped over 
individual houses 
i cant believe it took one left one took one said steven

house and looked at the unscathed home next door

its a house on a prairie a big black prairie biroth 
said 
norbert szkotnicki didnt rely on chance to save his riverside 
home he said he sneaked past police barricades to check on it and 
found part of it burning 
i got a chain saw and cut off a burning corner of the 
cabin he said then he joined a bucket brigade from the river up 
the hill to his house until firefighters arrived and saved the 
cabin 
my family has been here 110 years my grandfather built that

the world health organization today indefinitely 
deferred a bid by the pl0s selfdeclared state of palestine to 
become a full voting member averting the threat of a withdrawal of 
us funds 
the united nation agencys annual assembly adopted a resolution 
sponsored by 28 west european third world and moderate arab 
countries that urged whos directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima 
to continue his studies on the membership bid and to report 
back at an appropriate time 
by not setting a deadline the 167nation assembly in effect 
indefinitely postponed consideration of the plos bid 
the measure also urged the health organization to continue a 
special health program to help palestinians in the israelioccupied 
territories 
the agreement was a diplomatic victory for the united states and 
a new blow for the plos campaign to gain universal recognition as 
an independent state by becoming a full member of international 
agencies the plo currently has nonvoting observer status with the 
world health organization 
more than 100 countries many in the third world have 
recognized the palestinian state declared by the plos 
parliamentinexile in november 1988 this roughly encompasses the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the united states backed by most western countries maintains 
that the plo is not entitled to full membership in un 
organizations because it fails to meet internationally recognized 
criteria of statehood including control of territory 
washington is pledged to contribute 78 million to the health 
organization this year or 25 percent of the agencys regular 
budget it is also a major funder of other organization programs 
including the campaign against aids 
us officials said a cutoff of us funds would be 
devastating and nakajima had warned that all major programs 
such as the fight against tropical diseases would have to be 
slashed

the defense ministry today denied 
involvement in the secret sale of advanced soviet military 
technology to the united states for 10 years prior to the overthrow 
of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
the washington post quoting unidentified intelligence 
sources in washington and abroad reported sunday that the 
program was coordinated by the central intelligence agency 
it said the program resulted in more than 40 million being paid 
to romania through foreign middlemen and that about 20 percent of 
that ended up in swiss bank accounts controlled by the ceausescu 
family 
in a statement carried by the staterun rompres news agency the 
defense ministry said some of the technology referred to in the 
post article has never been in the inventory of the romanian 
military 
the post said the ceausescu connection was part of a larger 
weaponsbuying operation that allowed the us military to obtain 
the latest versions of soviet made weapons and air defense systems 
on monday the new york times quoted unidentified current and 
former us officials as confirming the reports 
stephen hart a deputy white house spokesman has declined to 
discuss the report saying we dont comment on intelligence 
matters 
the post said the latest version of a soviet antiaircraft system 
was among the items purchased from romania which also sold mobile 
rocket launchers and radar systems 
the romanian ministry of national defense makes it known 
that it did not know and does not know of operations like those 
mentioned the statement said 
the romanian operation ended with ceausescus overthrow and 
execution in december the post reported

also been used in the purchase of sovietmade weapons systems on

national police force 
the announcement comes at a time when many poles see the changes 
in their country lagging behind those in other formerly hardline 
communist east european nations such as hungary and east germany 
in gdansk lech walesa criticized the solidarityled government 
for failing to resolve the status of the gdansk shipyard where the 
labor movement was born nearly 10 years ago 
i want you to know that i am ashamed of the present 
government which is our government i am ashamed because it has 
not yet resolved the problem of the shipyard favorably the 
solidarity chairman said in a letter to shipyard workers 
walesa released his letter as several hundred workers demanding 
pay raises staged a brief work stoppage at the shipyard in the 
baltic port city 
the workers shut down two departments for several hours to 
protest that their average monthly salary of 63 was now less than 
the national average of 78 a month 
the workers suspended their protest pending the results of talks 
in warsaw between zbigniew lis chairman of the solidarity local in 
the shipyard and minister of industry tadeusz syryjczyk 
some 2000 of the yards 7000 workers held a rally last month 
to protest the slow pace of government decisions on the fate of the 
stateowned facility which was slated to be closed as unprofitable 
by the previous government 
the current government has decided that the shipyard will be 
sold to shareholders under new regulations that provide for 
converting stateowned enterprises into private firms 
walesas comments appeared to be part of a growing offensive to 
push for quicker action by the government led by prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki and other former top solidarity activists 
walesa has criticized the government for acting too slowly in 
implementing reforms and removing communists from key positions 
in a brief dispatch pap said the government would restore 
civilian control over the law enforcement agencies which in the 
past were organized under paramilitary lines to maintain communist 
control of the society 
the news agency said the citizens militia was to be replaced in 
three months by a newly organized police force similar to those in 
western countries members of the regular police were eligible to 
join the new department 
members of the secret police will continue to perform their 
duties until a newly created office of state protection starts to 
operate also within three months pap said 
the new office is supposed to limit its activities to fighting 
espionage and actual threats to national security under the former 
communist regime the secret police harassed and arrested 
dissidents many of whom are now members of the parliament or 
government 
secret police officers hired before august 1989 when the 
communists held power must pass a review process to determine 
whether they abused their authority before being allowed to join 
the new office 
the interior ministry previously run by uniformed officers 
along paramilitary lines is to become a smaller civilianrun 
organization pap said

a phantom inspector 11 was part of a scheme 
to falsify test reports by the biggest maker of aerospace fasteners 
and two managers over 15 years the government has charged 
a complaint filed wednesday in us district court against vsi 
corp is the largest to date in a twoyear investigation of the 
integrity testing and inspection of bolts and other parts used to 
hold engines wheels and other key aircraft components in place 
assistant us attorney bruce d carter said 
the integrity of these products is often essential to the safe 
operation of the aircraft on which they are installed the 
complaint said 
vsi a fairchild industries inc subsidiary is accused of 
skimping on tests and inspections sometimes even delivering 
substandard parts to boost profits 
carter said an initial hearing before a federal magistrate is 
likely friday 
eight previous defendants have pleaded guilty and the 
investigation is continuing he added 
the probe against vsi was triggered by a complaint from 
whistleblower tom runion shortly after he left his job in the 
metallurgical laboratory at vsis voishan plant in chatsworth 
calif carter said some bolts made at the plant are intended to 
bear loads exceeding 200000 pounds per square inch 
inadequate voishan parts were found during aircraft assembly 
and installation and were returned to the manufacturer but 
investigators do not know whether others were not caught in time 
carter said 
no accidents have been traced to voishan bolts he said 
federal investigators learned that of the government and 
civilian buyers of voishan fasteners the boeing co and northrop 
corp especially had been rejecting substantial deliveries after 
making their own tests 
boeing said in a news release wednesday that use of voishan 
materials has not compromised the integrity of boeing products 
a key development in the case was a raid on voishan last year 
in which more than 50 boxes of test report packets stamped by a 
fictitious inspector 11 were seized carter said 
james e ryan a former voishan quality assurance manager and 
aram marderian a former metallurgical laboratory supervisor for 
voishan also were named as defendants each faces a maximum 
sentence of five years in prison and a 250000 fine if convicted 
the company and managers are charged with conspiracy to commit 
mail fraud to make false statements to the government and to cheat 
the united states 
the company faces liability for false claims to the government 
plus a maximum fine of twice the gross gain or loss us attorney 
mike mckay said

an iranian diplomat said today that all 
hostages should be released including four iranians missing in 
christian east beirut 
iranian charge daffaires mohammad jawad zamanian who was 
recently appointed to the iranian embassy in beirut talked to 
reporters after meeting with various leaders and politicians in the 
southern city of sidon 
as you know we also were the victims of abduction we know 
that the four iranian diplomats are alive in east beirut he 
said we express regret for the abductions our hostages and all 
the hostages should be released 
the four iranian men were seized as they traveled by car across 
the christian enclave north of beirut in july 1982 during israels 
invasion of lebanon they are thought to have been killed in 
shelling or by their captors 
iranian officials have repeatedly called for their release and 
president hashemi rafsanjani said in october if you say they are 
not alive at least give us their bodies or show us their graves 
iran is believed to have influence over the shiite moslem 
factions holding most of the 16 western captives in lebanon the 
hostages are six americans four britons two west germans two 
swiss an italian and an irishman 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped on march 
16 1985 
president bush has thanked iran and its arab ally syria for 
helping secure the release of two american hostages frank reed 
57 on april 30 and robert polhill 55 on april 22 
bush also has offered to help iran get information on the 
missing iranians as a goodwill gesture but he refused to 
negotiate any hostage releases 
on tuesday hussein musawi the reputed mentor of one shiite 
faction said he feared a western captive would be killed if it was 
confirmed the four iranians had been slain by their christian 
captors 
if the death of the four iranians is ascertained that will 
definitely affect the hostage issue one of the kidnap groups might 
react by murdering a hostage musawi said 
he said the positive indications that accompanied the 
release of reed and polhill have diminished musawi added 
this issue has turned into a very complicated one because of the 
negative us stand the hostage issue will be frozen for a 
certain period of time 
in the past two months a conflict has emerged in the iranian 
government over the hostage issue 
leaders seeking more contact with the west have said 1990 should 
be the year of releasing all hostages but radicals argue that 
holding hostages is a means of confronting the west which the 
antiwestern faction considers a cornerstone of the 1979 islamic 
revolution

nearly 22 million americans are hardcore 
cocaine addicts more than double the official count of those who 
use the drug at least once a week according to a senate report 
released today 
this news is as alarming as it is tragic senate judiciary 
committee chairman joseph r biden ddel said in a statement 
it suggests that we have a hardcore addict problem that is far 
worse than virtually every previous estimate of its scope 
some states have extraordinarily high concentrations with 
one in every 40 people in new york considered a hardcore user 
according to the senate judiciary committee report 
the nations capital has the highest per capita rate 329 
weekly users among every 1000 washington residents the report 
said 
the findings prepared under the supervision of mark ar 
kleiman of the kennedy school of government at harvard university 
underscored a dispute between biden and a number of other lawmakers 
and the administration over whether to aim the thrust of the drug 
war against hardcore or casual users 
biden has said hardcore users should be the primary target 
while national drug policy director william bennett has advocated 
efforts directed mainly at stemming casual cocaine use 
the report expressed doubt about the official findings of the 
national institute on drug abuses household survey which 
estimated the number of americans who use cocaine at least once a 
week at fewer than 900000 
how could fewer than 900000 bring such havoc to a nation of 
250 million the report asked 
the census bureau estimates the number of americans at 250 
million the reports count of 2159000 million people who use 
cocaine once a week would wbe less than 1 percent of the population 
the committee rounded off its estimate to 22 million in the 
executive summary of the report and in a statement distributed to 
the news media thursday 
drug centers treat about 200000 hardcore cocaine addicts each 
year according to the report which added that most who are 
arrested are quickly back on the street 
it estimated there are approximately 55000 homeless addicts a 
number that does not contribute significantly to the national 
total but that was overlooked in the household survey 
the report estimated that 15 million hardcore cocaine addicts 
are arrested annually and represent about 20 percent of all 
arrestees nationwide 
this suggests that cocaine is a major cause of crime in the 
united states the report said 
the report estimated that new york had the most hardcore 
addicts with 434000 after that came california 325000 texas 
144000 illinois 142000 and florida 93000 
new york had 244 weekly users among every 1000 residents 
nevada 224 arizona 127 and illinois 122

attorney general dick thornburgh today 
suggested that mexican police deliver to american hands more of the 
suspects wanted in connection with the 1985 kidnapping and murder 
of a us drug agent 
thornburgh said us drug agents did nothing wrong last month 
when they arrested a mexican doctor wanted in the case who was 
grabbed by mexican police and whisked across the us border 
asked if he would object to a repeat of last months operation 
the attorney general said whatever actions that are carried out 
by mexican authorities in mexico are of no moment to us 
in fact the more cooperation we can get the better the 
attorney general said 
fourteen suspects wanted in connection with the kidnaping or 
murder are still at large mostly in mexico they include the 
former head of the mexican federal police and the mexican office of 
interpol the international law enforcement agency 
mexico has refused to extradite any of the suspects following a 
longstanding practice of not turning over its citizens for 
prosecution in this country 
thornburgh said he was more concerned about protecting the lives 
of american citizens overseas than about any diplomatic protests 
such as the one resulting from last months arrest of dr humberto 
alvarez machain 
the arrest produced a political and diplomatic furor in mexico 
where authorities accused the us government of violating mexican 
sovereignty six suspects in mexico have been arrested in the 
kidnaping case 
i place the integrity and the value of the life of american 
citizens no 1 said thornburgh who discussed the case last week 
with mexican authorities attending a conference in santa fe nm 
the misunderstandings that crop up on a daytoday basis 
between neighbors who are dealing with the same problem can be 
addressed and dealt with without sacrificing the determination to 
enforce the law particularly in such a heinous crime the 
attorney general said during a breakfast interview 
this case has to do with the prosecution of dr alvarez 
machain an individual who is charged with using his medical 
skills to keep alive an american citizen who was being tortured so 
that he could be tortured some more 
mexico filed a strong protest after alvarez was arrested by drug 
enforcement administration agents in el paso texas after he 
apparently was kidnapped in guadalajara and flown across the us 
border 
the attorney general noted that american courts have upheld the 
arrest of fugitives on us soil even if they were kidnapped 
overseas and brought to this country 
so long as there is no conduct outside of this country by 
other persons that shocks the conscience of the court how a person 
gets here within our jurisdiction is not a material concern 
thornburgh said 
thornburgh stressed that no dea agents were involved in the 
operation which he said was initiated by highranking mexican 
police authorities 
in an era of increased cooperation its my view that our 
people regarded this in good faith as another example of the type 
of cooperation that was being extended and its not unique the 
attorney general said 
the attorney general said he had no intention at this time 
of disciplining any dea personnel because an internal investigation 
by that agency had found no evidence department rules were broken 
alvarez among those charged with the torture and murder of 
enrique camarena is now challenging the legality of his arrest in 
federal court in los angeles

a faulty cooling valve in need of 
replacement will delay space shuttle columbias launch two to three 
weeks while nasa undertakes the first such repairs ever attempted 
on the launch pad 
columbia had been scheduled to lift off may 16 or 17 with seven 
astronauts and the 100 million astro observatory capable of 
probing ultraviolet and xray radiation 
but engineers this week spotted a problem with the valve which 
controls the flow of coolant in the shuttle 
we are obviously disappointed that we are not ready to fly 
william lenoir head of nasas space flight program said 
wednesday however this particular system is absolutely critical 
to the safety of the crew and overall mission success 
the shuttles payload bay doors were opened today and 
technicians began the long process of gaining access to the valve 
in the shuttles payload bay 
the cooling system must be drained of toxic coolant before 
workers on platforms can replace the valve assembly nasa launch 
director bob sieck said 
technicians are to start draining the system late friday a 
process that involves the lions share of work agency 
spokesman bruce buckingham said this morning 
nasa said nets would be placed over astro below the valve so 
that its scientific instruments are not damaged 
such work has never been performed at the launch pad before but 
returning columbia to its hangar for repairs would have resulted in 
a considerably longer delay 
the only unknown is how long its going to take because we 
dont have any experience base sieck said 
a two to threeweek delay is expected to have little impact on 
the rest of this years shuttle schedule sieck said 
columbias nine to 10day flight will be the 36th shuttle

estonia today proposed establishing a council of 
the leaders of the three baltic republics to coordinate policies as 
they seek independence from the soviet union government spokesmen 
said 
the proposal if accepted by baltic neighbors latvia and 
lithuania would further integrate the republics all three were 
forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
so far its just an estonian proposal said leivi sher 
spokesman for estonias supreme soviet or parliament the 
parliaments executive committee approved the measure 
also today the three republics said they signed an agreement 
for the direct exchange of agricultural supplies without going 
through central soviet organizations most transactions in the 
soviet union are channeled through central ministries or trade 
organizations the kremlin imposed a partial economic embargo on 
lithuania after it declared independence 
sher said the proposed council of baltic states would decide 
political questions asked whether the council would constitute a 
confederation of the baltic states he said it will lead to 
their integration 
the proposal would revive a council that the three republics 
formed in 1934 when they were independent between the world wars 
said valle feldman a spokesman for the estonian foreign ministry 
it would consist of the president prime minister and foreign 
minister of each republic and could make nonbinding 
recommendations to the three governments 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev opposes immediate 
independence for the baltic republics and imposed economic 
sanctions on lithuania after it declared independence on march 11 
it was unclear whether latvia and lithuania would agree to the 
proposal lithuanian spokesmen said no agreement was likely before 
the return to vilnius next week of lithuanian prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene in paris as part of a tour of western 
capitals 
mrs prunskiene told reporters in paris that lithuanian 
officials want to negotiate their independence with moscow 
according to a formula proposed by french president francois 
mitterrand and chancellor helmut kohl of west germany they 
suggested that lithuania temporarily suspend laws implementing the 
declaration of independence 
the agricultural agreement which entered into effect today 
provides that each of the three ministries must have permanent 
representatives in the other baltic republics who will perform the 
functions of coordinators and assistants in joint efforts to 
resolve agricultural issues the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
the establishment of direct exchanges of food and other 
agricultural supplies and products and the proposed council of 
baltic governments signal determination by the three republics to 
overcome kremlin opposition to their separatist aspirations 
all three republics have been seeking independence from the 
soviet union following lithuanias declaration latvia on may 4 
declared its independence saying it would take effect after an 
unspecified transition period 
on tuesday estonia dropped the trappings of soviet power 
including its flag and name invoked sections of the 1938 
constitution that declared independence and proclaimed solidarity 
with latvia and lithuania 
gorbachev has not responded to the estonian actions and is said 
to be studying latvias actions

the federal communications commission said 
today it has given a new york company permission to operate a new 
type of pocketsized telephone in houston and orlando fla that 
proponents claim could replace traditional wire or cellular phone 
service 
the new system known as personal communications networks will 
be built by pcn american inc millicom it will use highfrequency 
microwave signals to connect telephones over short distances such 
as in office buildings or neighborhoods 
like existing cellular telephones the new service will be able 
to pass off phone calls as users move from one transmitter area 
to another and because the range of the devices as little as 600 
feet is short compared with cellular phones many more 
conversations can be crammed onto existing microwave channels 
without causing interference 
this largecapacity feature is expected to make the devices 
popular and drive down their costs officials at american personal 
communications inc which earlier this year received fcc 
permission to test the new type of phones in the washington area 
told the washington post they hoped the phones ultimately would 
cost 50 to 75 
i fundamentally believe that pcns are going to be the first 
serious means of competition for local communications an atampt 
official richard b snyder was quoted as saying in todays new 
york times 
millicom told the newspaper it would spend 20 million to build 
a 25000subscriber system in houston and a 20000subscriber 
system in orlando both systems are expected to begin operating in 
two years 
cellular phones use a few large radio towers to transmit calls 
across what are known as cells the equipment automatically 
passes off calls as a caller in an automobile for instance passes 
from cell to cell 
the new pcn system will rely on refrigeratorsized lowpower 
transmitters that will transmit across a more limited area 
millicom told the times it would transmit calls from one 
transmitter to the next rather than connecting with the local

the army corps of engineers will take steps to lower river 
levels in floodbattered southwestern arkansas an aide to gov 
bill clinton said today in the central part of the state water 
levels were slowly receding after cresting at the highest point in 
47 years 
weve been notified by the corps that they are going to try to 
reduce the flow said mike gauldin clintons press secretary 
they are making a complete new assessment gauldin said 
theyre sending people down to southwest arkansas today and 
theyre going to reduce the flow over the next day or so 
heavy rain and flooding along the trinity arkansas and red 
rivers in the past two weeks have claimed 13 lives one in oklahoma 
and the rest in texas as the bulge of water has moved downstream 
to the east and south the worst of the flooding has shifted from 
northcentral texas and oklahoma to arkansas and northeastern 
texas flooding was also affecting parts of northern louisiana 
thousands of cattle were stranded and crops flooded out in 
arkansas and some homeowners shot at joyriding boaters roiling 
the water 
at a meeting with angry farmers in ashdown ark on wednesday 
clinton said a task force should look at corps management of the 
red river in the states southwest border some farmers also 
criticized the corps activities on the arkansas river which runs 
diagonally through the state from northwest to southeast 
decisions made by the corps of engineers on how fast to release 
water from the reservoirs it manages can have a crucial effect on 
who is flooded and how severely a quick release of water after a 
heavy rain increases flooding downstream while slower release can 
mean more flooding upstream 
appearing on abcs nightline wednesday with brig gen 
robert c lee the regional corps commander clinton said 
southwestern arkansas residents feel that maybe the corps could 
be holding some more water back the levees have broken there in 
places in other places theres no opportunity even to put the 
sandbags up 
if it proves impossible to hold some of the water at dams 
upstream he said were going to lose several thousand head of 
cattle and maybe the opportunity to plant rice and soybeans in this 
season 
red river valley farmers said the corps should have released 
more water from reservoirs during the winter 
they hold the water when the water should be let out and when 
they need to be able to hold the water in the spring when we have 
these big rains theyre turning it out said paul hawkins whose 
3000 acres were under water 
the areas wheat was three weeks from harvest farmers said 
lee defended the engineers procedures if not for the corps 
efforts he said the water would be eight feet deeper now than 
it is 
diana hinton a trailer park owner said red river levees had 
been neglected and were unable to hold back floodwaters 
why arent these levees being upkept she asked i just 
lost a trailer park and these people are losing their land and 
their cattle 
about 15000 head of cattle were stranded in flood waters with 
no way to get them to higher ground or to feed them said judge 
clyde wright administrator of little river county 
on the texas side of the red river the state was using a 
helicopter to feed about 1000 stranded cattle the corps brought 
30000 sandbags to shore up levees along the texas side of the 
river on wednesday where about 200 people have been evacuated from 
rural areas north of texarkana water earlier broke through the top 
of a 60footlong levee section 
jane mueller dispatcher for the texarkana office of emergency 
services said officials believe the red river crested at 3213 
feet at 1 am today by 6 am the water level had dropped to 
3206 feet seven feet above flood stage 
in arkansas joe brady of the office of emergency services said 
damage to the states roads and bridges was at least 10 million 
officials said they hadnt yet calculated damage to agriculture and 
other property 
the federal emergency management agency planned to set up 200 
telephone lines to take calls from those seeking disaster aid 
in pine bluff floodwaters crested wednesday morning at 475 
feet the highest level since 1943 when they reached 521 feet 
the water dropped to just under 47 feet by this morning but about 
300 homes remained flooded officials said 
some bitter homeowners fired shots at anglers taking advantage 
of the flood to fish for bass crappie and catfish drawn to insects 
flushed out by the rising water said boe fontaine a sheriffs 
lieutenant outside pine bluff 
these boats go by and make a wake and it wakes into the 
house fontaine said people are hot enough right now that they 
get around too close and somebodys liable to take a shot at them 
and it happened today 
health officials warned that mosquitoes carrying the 
encephalitis virus were hatching in swamped dallas neighborhoods 
which are starting to dry out after the trinity river crested there 
last week 
some residents of dallas rochester park neighborhood returned 
home hundreds of houses in the poor neighborhood were inundated by 
the worst flooding in more than 70 years 
city officials promised to build a new levee by 1993 to shelter 
the area but william andrews pastor of the independent missionary 
baptist church said he cant understand why the levee hasnt been 
built before now 
its been dirty year after year i dont know what theyre 
waiting on he said

ground victims of the terrorist bombing of pan ams 
flight 103 over lockerbie scotland have reached a settlement with 
the airline an attorney for the victims said today 
all 259 passengers and crew aboard the plane were killed when 
the jet plowed into the quiet scottish town dec 21 1988 eleven 
people on the ground were killed a dozen others were injured and 
many homes were damaged or destroyed 
about 250 lockerbie familes filed claims in dade circuit court 
because two pan am subsidiaries have headquarters here said miami 
attorney aaron podhurst 
it was negotiated over a period of time and it just 
culminated this week said podhurst who represents the lockerbie 
air disaster committee under the agreement he was prevented from 
releasing any details he said 
new yorkbased pan am spokesman jeffrey kreindler acknowledged a 
settlement but also said he could not discuss its terms 
the agreement doesnt affect lawsuits filed by the families of 
those aboard the plane podhurst said some of those suits also 
were filed in miami but the majority are in federal court in new 
york 
the passenger claims are covered by international agreements and 
are limited to 75000 unless victims can prove gross negligence 
pan am agreed that the lockerbie ground victims were covered by 
scottish law which podhurst said had no limit 
a scottish investigation into the crash is to be completed in 
september and probably will be the basis for settling the passenger 
claims podhurst said 
flight 103 was flying from london to new york when a bomb went 
off in the luggage hold 
investigations indicated a bomb may have been placed inside a 
radio in baggage put aboard the flight in frankfurt west germany 
the luggage was transferred to the pan am boeing 747 in london and 
it exploded over lockerbie shortly after takeoff 
us authorities acknowledged they had received an alert about a 
possible attack on a pan am airliner and had even warned diplomatic 
personnel to avoid using the carrier 
the lockerbie suits charged pan am had actual and constructive 
knowledge that flight 103 was subject to a specific and known 
danger of terrorist or other criminal or wrongful activities 
pan ams miami subsidiaries pan am world services and alert 
management systems were accused of failing to provide adequate 
security for the flight

a government stamp of approval is no guarantee 
a product is safe so manufacturers should not be exempt from 
punishment when an approved product causes death or injury 
consumer advocates said today 
four national consumer groups reported that more than 1300 
deaths and thousands of serious injuries in the last 10 years 
resulted from the use of drugs and medical devices approved by the 
food and drug administration 
the report was issued as the senate commerce consumer 
subcommittee held its third hearing on federal product liability 
legislation backed by the bush administration 
the legislation includes a provision to exempt from punitive 
damages in product liability cases those manufacturers whose 
products received premarket approval from the fda or the federal 
aviation administration 
there is no principled basis nor is there a need to shield 
manufacturers from punitive damages just because they have complied 
with government standards the report said 
however drug manufacturers argued today that under the proposed 
legislation injured victims would be protected and research and 
marketing of potentially lifesaving drugs would be speeded 
this defense would not prevent full compensation from being 
awarded to injured persons said richard kingham an attorney 
representing the pharmaceutical manufacturers association 
there is documented evidence that liability concerns about 
punitive damages have caused manufacturers to withdraw beneficial 
drugs from the market kingham said 
this is a disincentive to safety he added 
the study was issued jointly by consumers union public citizen 
us public interest research group and the consumer federation of 
america it cited several cases in which fdaapproved drugs and 
devices caused deaths or lifethreatening and permanent injuries 
it is documentation of the failures of the fda said pam 
gilbert legislative director for public citizens congress watch 
the report said regulatory delays are one reason agency approval 
should not be used as an excuse for corporate liability 
it said that although strong evidence linked reyes syndrome a 
rare and often fatal disease to the use of aspirin to treat 
chicken pox and flu in children it was four years before the 
government required warning labels 
in those four years approximately 3000 children developed 
reyes syndrome about 1000 children died and many of the 
surviving children suffered brain damage the report said 
the consumer groups also cited the fdas approval of the 
sedative versed used in short diagnostic surgical procedures as a 
sign that flaws in the regulatory process make the agency 
unreliable 
several serious flaws in the approval process and subsequent 
monitoring of versed resulted in 40 deaths from cardiac or 
respiratory depression in patients using the drug in the united 
states the report said 
business and industry representatives argue the liability 
exception should be included in the bill because regulatory 
agencies have more expertise than the courts to set and measure 
product standards 
allowing the courts to secondguess regulatory standards may 
result in unjustified imposition of liability robert c holland 
president of the committee on economic development told an earlier 
hearing by the subcommittee 
the ced is a research organization representing top business 
executives and presidents of several major universities

the free market and that between 500000 and 2 million east german 
workers will lose their jobs 
both west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere say a quick influx of western

maizieres governing coalition are pressing de maiziere to push 
for more social guarantees for east germans dependent on heavy 
subsidies under the old socialist system

unemployment rose from 38313 in march to 64948 last month

and textile industries

restructure its beleaguered economy before the two nations share

demanded job and benefits security 
highways linking major east and west german cities were blocked 
by convoys of dilapidated tractors and farm trucks for 10 minutes 
to an hour the blockade was the third in the past two weeks 
the farmworkers are fearful of job losses from western 
competition and the transition of stateowned land to the private 
sector 
thousands of leather and textile workers in leipzig dresden 
chemnitz cottbus erfurt and other industrial cities shut off 
their machines for an hour to call attention to their fear of 
western imports adn said

chancellor helmut kohl on thursday 
warned that east germany must restructure its beleaguered economy 
if it wants to get the powerful west german mark 
in a threehour parliamentary debate kohl also reiterated that 
he wants the question of a united germanys military attachments 
cleared up before the two nations actually merge 
kohl pressed east germany for greater flexibility in bargaining 
over the merger of their economies planned by july 2 parliament 
was debating problems facing the unity process 
he said there must be an overall agreement on restructuring the 
east german economy before east germany can replace its weak 
currency with the west german mark 
it is for me selfevident that the currency conversion stands 
in indissoluble connection with total agreement on economic 
union kohl said 
the two german nations have reached basic agreement on terms for 
replacing east germanys currency with the deutsche mark but are 
divided on some key elements of overall economic union 
kohl renewed his demand that east germany be prepared to start 
dismantling its 41yearold system of state ownership if economic 
union with west germany is going to be a success 
enormous efforts stand before us kohl said 
of course this concerns foremostly the budget of east germany 
which can and must put to use the socalled peoplesowned 
property he added 
west german officials have said private ownership of property 
and industry is crucial to creating a market economy that could 
spawn jobs and incomes in east germany 
kohl reiterated his discomfort over a soviet suggestion that 
german unity could come before all the international military 
complexities are worked out the soviet union opposes nato 
membership for a united germany but bonn and its nato allies say 
germanys membership in the western alliance is crucial 
west germany wants both processes to proceed in unison 
with each other and in close consultation with our partners and 
allies kohl said 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze suggested last 
week the external aspects of unification such as a united 
germanys military attachments would not have to be settled 
before the merger actually occurred 
he proposed that the four world war ii victors the soviet 
union the united states britain and france retain some of their 
special postwar rights for a transition period after unity 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who initially greeted 
shevardnadzes idea as a means of speeding up the unification 
process changed his tone during thursdays debate 
the german people are entitled to german unity and are also 
entitled to having the external aspects of unity cleared up without 
delay genscher said 
genscher said an understanding should be reached over the 
external aspects of german unification before this fall but he 
did not say when he thought all the special rights of the four 
world war ii allies should be actually stripped away 
genscher also said the west must ensure the soviet union is 
allowed to play an important and constructive role in europes 
future europe does not end at the polish border

the white house today disavowed comments by a 
senior administration official ruling out tax hikes at the upcoming 
budget summit and said president bush assured congressional leaders 
nothing was off the bargaining table 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the remarks widely 
understood to be by white house chief of staff john sununu did not 
reflect bushs position and that the official did not speak for the 
president 
the official was quoted as saying that the white house would say 
no to any tax increases proposed by democrats at the upcoming 
budget summit 
thats crazy declared fitzwater 
fitzwater said bush called house speaker thomas s foley this 
morning to assure him he had not changed his position 
meanwhile bush came under fire from congressional democrats for 
failing to make his position clear on the issue of higher taxes 
it is time for the president to speak said rep robert 
torricelli dnj what is it that he would bring forward the 
president waits but the nation deserves to hear 
although administration aides have asserted that negotiations to 
get under way next tuesday would have no preconditions bush 
himself has not yet spoken out on whether he will accept a tax 
increase as part of a deficitcutting package 
democratic skepticism toward the summit appeared to grow today 
after a senior administration official was quoted in todays 
editions of the washington post and the washington times as 
suggesting the white house would reject any attempt by democrats to 
propose a tax increase 
the official was identified as speaking on a plane from costa 
rica to washington with barbara bush and white house chief of staff 
john sununu the official was further described as the main white 
house link to conservatives 
sununu who is generally viewed as conservatives main pipeline 
into the white house was the only senior white house official on 
mrs bushs plane 
other passengers on the plane said that sununu was the speaker 
the official was quoted as saying were allowing them 
democrats to bring their good arguments for taxes to the table 
they were not persuasive last time and are likely not to be 
persuasive again 
but if they want to come to the table and say they put tax 
increases there it is their prerogative to put them on the table 
and its our prerogative to say no and i emphasize the no 
the comments appeared to contradict earlier white house 
assertions that nothing was off the table on budget talks 
including taxes 
fitzwater while not willing to state publicly that the speaker 
was sununu said that the official was not speaking for the 
president 
i speak for the president its as simple as that he 
declared 
the spokesman said he had spoken to bush directly today and was 
told by the president that his position is no preconditions 
as to the fact that sununu is one of the white house negotiators 
in the budget talks fitzwater said the president is the chief 
negotiator he will be responsible for all the negotiations 
period 
rep charles schumer dny said that whether the remarks on 
the plane were by john sununu or someone else we have a message 
to the whole white house dont worry democrats will not put 
taxes on the table 
after all it was the white house that called the summit the 
president that called the summit its up to the president to tell 
us one what the crisis is and number two what he intends to do 
about it schumer added 
torricelli said we have heard from his press spokesman we 
have heard from his political aides we have heard from his 
consultants but the american people have not heard from the 
president of the united states 
many democrats have voiced suspicion that bushs call for a 
budget summit was a trap to draw them into supporting an 
electionyear tax hike 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash while saying he wont 
question bushs motives put a top critic of bushs tax policies in 
charge of their negotiating team seeking a deficitreduction pact 
with the white house 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo will serve as 
chairman of the talks and will preside except when bush himself is 
in the room foley said wednesday 
white house officials say that without action the federal 
deficit could be up to 100 billion higher than the 64 billion 
shortfall allowed by law 
the president has proposed a 123 trillion budget for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 
failure to cut the deficit could force huge domestic and 
military spending cuts under the grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
that neither party wants and the democrats quickly agreed to the 
talks but there is no clear path to agreement on spending 
restraint and new revenue sources to avert the cuts

police launched an 
early morning raid today on the canadian side of this troubled 
reservation arresting 21 people on weapons and drug charges and 
confiscating about 1 million in drugs 
the raid by 100 officers from three canadian police forces 
culminated a 14month investigation hundreds of police officers 
stationed on the reservation because of recent violence helped in 
making the arrests according to peter west a spokesman for the 
ontario provincial police 
police had planned to make the raid earlier but were delayed 
by the unrest on the reserve west said 
police also raided homes in the city of cornwall just outside 
the ontario portion of the reservation west said the reservation 
is also split between quebec province and new york state 
the drug raid is the latest police action on this reservation 
that has been occupied by a force of several hundred police from 
canada and the us police sealed off the reservation to outsiders 
after a mohawk gambling war claimed two lives on may 1 
the three chiefs governing the us side of the st regis indian 
reservation which straddles the uscanadian border sent a 
letter wednesday asking cuomo to help set up a tribal police squad 
cuomo last week proposed the creation of a mohawk police force 
for the 28000acre reservation where two indians were shot to 
death may 1 
we welcome your positive approach and appreciate your offer of 
assistance as we attempt to bring order back into the daily lives 
of our mohawk people read the letter from chiefs harold tarbell 
l david jacobs and lincoln white 
cuomos response to 10 months of sporadic violence involving 
opponents and backers of gambling on the reservation drew fire 
wednesday from a member of another iroquois tribe who quit the 
governors humanities council 
you are in effect urging the mohawks to give up their 
sovereignty onondaga indian nancy johnson said in her 
resignation letter to cuomo such unrealistic paternal advice 
will only further escalate violence 
cuomo appointed johnson to the panel in 1986 
the letter asking cuomo to maintain a state police presence in 
what many mohawks consider an independent territory was an unusual 
sign of harmony among the three chiefs jacobs and white support 
reservation gambling as an economic boon while head chief tarbell

the roman catholic diocese of providence 
ordered a church high school to cancel a speech by state rep 
patrick kennedy because the democrat supports a womans right to 
seek an abortion 
the 22yearold son of sen edward kennedy said he had no 
intention of discussing abortion during his talk but diocesan 
officials told officials at prout memorial high school in south 
kingston to find another speaker for last sundays motherdaughter 
breakfast 
i felt it would be inappropriate that he speak brother 
daniel f casey diocesan school superintendent said his 
position runs opposite to what the school is teaching 
casey was quoted in thursdays editions of the providence 
journalbulletin 
a parent who helped organize the breakfast said kennedy was 
invited to speak because hes young hes aggressive and hes a 
kennedy not because of his stance on abortion 
he just seemed to be a great choice said edward h torgen 
an attorney whose wife mary ann headed the committee that 
organized the event 
kennedy who is catholic said he was angry i understand that 
the church is being very careful about who is invited to speak at 
these things but i think the manner in which it was handled 
obviously was disturbing i dont think anybody likes being 
disinvited 
kennedy said he had intended to use his speech to encourage 
students to become active in their communities and make a 
difference 
casey said he learned that kennedy was to speak through a 
newspaper notice he checked and found out that kennedy supported 
abortion rights then told prout administrators to withdraw the 
invitation however word did not reach kennedys office until 
friday two days before the breakfast 
deborah thompson cofounder of dorcas place a providence 
school that helps the illiterate spoke in kennedys place torgen 
said few of the 120 people who attended the breakfast complained 
about kennedys absence 
the flap came almost a year after kennedys father had a similar 
experience in rhode island 
the st vincent de paul society a catholic organization 
canceled the massachusetts senators appearance at its annual 
meeting in providence when abortion opponents threatened to picket

the house voted today to guarantee workers up 
to three months of unpaid leave in family emergencies ignoring a 
white house threat to veto the bill 
the house voted 237187 to approve the bill after turning back 
opponents efforts to send it back to committee the bill now goes 
to the senate 
the bill requires business and government employers to provide 
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or for the care 
of a new or ill child parent or spouse it exempts small 
businesses with fewer than 50 workers and drops earlier language 
setting various periods of leave for workers with different 
emergencies 
the vote while a victory for supporters was short of what 
would be needed to override a presidential veto though the bill 
had bipartisan support and the backing of the house democratic 
leadership more than 50 democrats voted against it 
approval came as opponents withdrew a series of amendments and 
after a 259167 vote to adopt a substitute measure sponsors said 
was a compromise aimed at drawing more support to the measure 
the bill strongly opposed by the bush administration faces an 
uncertain future in the senate the senate labor and human 
resources committee approved a similar measure more than a year 
ago but sponsors have not yet scheduled floor action and none is 
expected before memorial day 
supporters of the measure pointed to president bushs own 
campaign rhetoric opponents charged the measure would be costly 
and burdensome for small businesses 
rep bill green of new york a liberal republican who supports 
the measure quoted from remarks bush made as a presidential 
candidate and said he seemed to be supporting just such a measure 
then 
green said bush told a republican womens group in september 
1988 we need to assure that women dont have to worry about 
getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a child 
during a serious illness that is what i mean when i talk about a 
gentler nation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday that the 
president wants employers to offer guaranteed jobprotected leave 
but opposes any bill requiring periods of leave 
let me note he used the word assure green said referring 
to bushs campaign speech he didnt say we should urge employers 
to do it green said the only to assure such leaves is by 
legislation 
one opponent rep barbara vucanovich rnev charged today 
that the bill would erode the very basis of democracy by 
ordering businesses to offer a particular benefit she said it 
would actually hurt women by encouraging employers not to hire or 
promote them 
this is a wolf in sheeps clothing she said many have 
attempted to mislead congress by calling it a profamily prowoman 
bill it is anything but that 
rep james quillen rtenn said it would reduce employers 
flexibility in offering benefits to employees and do serious 
damage to many small businesses 
several supporters argued that most western nations already 
require time off for workers with new children or other family 
needs and many provide for leave with full or partial pay the 
increasing role of women in the workforce makes such protections 
important for families they said 
the bill is the second dealing with family concerns that the 
white house has threatened to veto this year and democrats hoped 
to contrast that record in an election year with bushs public 
support for family values 
a conference committee has been named to work out house and 
senate differences on a broader bill designed to help families find 
and afford child care which also is under a veto threat 
under the family leave bill employers would have to continue 
health insurance benefits for those on leave and restore a 
returning employee to his or her previous job or an equivalent 
position 
womens groups supporting the bill contend that workers 
particularly women suffer substantial earnings losses after the 
birth of a child or during illnesses because many cant return to 
their jobs at the same pay 
business groups including the us chamber of commerce oppose 
the bill saying it would be costly to employers and hurt 
productivity although the measure requires employers to offer only 
unpaid leave some opponents were concerned it could lead to later 
legislation requiring paid leave or other benefits

the leader of 95 antiabortion protesters 
who spent up to 11 weeks behind bars for refusing to identify 
themselves after their arrest vowed more protests today upon the 
groups release from jail 
the protesters finally agreed to give their names wednesday and 
were promptly freed under an agreement with the state they were 
found guilty of trespassing and sentenced to the amount of time 
they had already served 
they wanted to break us said the rev michael mchugh 
leader of the local antiabortion movement they didnt do it 
fifty to 60 protesters knelt in prayer and sang hymns this 
morning on the sidewalk in front of the planned parenthood office 
in burlington other protests were scheduled for later today 
mchugh said 
if they come on our property well take legal action against 
them rachel atkins spokeswoman for the vermont womens health 
center in burlington said today 
the 95 demonstrators were arrested in a series of sitins at two 
burlington clinics from feb 21 to april 17 most were charged with 
unlawful trespass punishable by up to 90 days in jail 
district judge matthew katz jailed them without bail because 
they insisted on giving their names as baby jane doe and baby 
john doe to represent the fetuses not allowed to come to term 
katz ruled those monikers did not constitute identification 
the demonstrators had been jailed for up to 78 days about a 
week more than they probably would have been held if they they been 
tried and convicted 
the standoff ended with an agreement between edward sutton 
deputy states attorney and daniel lynch a lawyer for the 
protesters 
the protesters gave their names addresses and birth dates and 
let themselves be fingerprinted and photographed then signed a 
statement agreeing to the basic facts of their cases sutton said 
were very happy to be out in our freedom said joan 
andrews a national leader of the antiabortion movement who was 
jailed 78 days maybe in the next weeks some children will be 
saved because of us 
lynch said the protesters accepted the deal because the state 
did not assess fines or probation as conditions of release did not 
force the protesters to plead guilty and released them all at once 
eight of the 95 protesters were from vermont the rest were from 
all over the country 
its a tremendous victory lynch said mission 
accomplished

madonna mae morgan didnt make much of an 
impact on this small northwest kansas town during her life but she 
has been the main topic of discussion since her death in march 
mrs morgans will left the city an estimated 1 million but 
the gift came with strings attached the town of about 2300 must 
raise a matching amount within two years and use the money to build 
a community center 
mrs morgan 88 was not wellknown in the town and the bequest 
caught nearly everyone by surprise 
we were absolutely stunned at first said city administrator 
jerry fear but everybody decided it was just too much money to 
pass up not many communities have this type of opportunity 
mrs morgan died march 4 at a nursing home she and her late 
husband robert had amassed their estate by investing in farmland 
the couple had no children 
everyone knew bob but hardly anyone knew her said mrs 
morgans sisterinlaw laura dechert she was a dear sweet lady 
but she was quiet 
mrs morgan was born in illinois and spent most of her life in 
northwest kansas where her husband was a postal carrier in seldon 
they moved to oberlin after he retired in 1962 
mrs dechert said mrs morgan sort of gave up after her 
husband died in 1983 and spent a lot of time indoors before going 
to the nursing home mrs dechert took care of mrs morgan for 
seven years and now lives in the morgans home 
not even her sisterinlaw knows why mrs morgan left the money 
to oberlin 
i was a little disappointed because i think she could have 
done more good by spreading it around a little i think it put 
oberlin in kind of a bind she said 
the will stipulates that construction on the municipal 
auditorium must begin within two years after mrs morgans death 
that is march 4 1992 
mrs morgans attorney kenneth clark of hill city said the 
town had talked about a municipal auditorium mrs morgan thought 
it was a good idea to have such a building which townspeople 
envision as a place for agricultural events and entertainment that 
also could have offices a kitchen meeting rooms and an indoor 
pool 
she figured if she was willing to give them most of their 
estate they would be willing to match it clark said and she 
put the twoyear deadline on it because she was a lady who liked to 
get things done 
the exact amount of money involved will not be known until the 
morgans farms are sold and other bequests are paid but attorneys 
and city officials estimate oberlin will have to raise about 1 
million 
if oberlin doesnt raise the money it will go to the shrine 
burn center in galveston texas a beneficiary of the masonic lodge 
that morgan belonged to 
the town has set aside 60000 to study the issue and plans to 
pursue state federal and arts foundation grants fear said a bond 
issue would be a last resort to raise money but the local 
community is going to have to support it somehow 
this is a town willing to take a risk said mayor idella 
frickey it is a town that gets things done and i think well 
get this thing done too 
in a time when many small farming communities are struggling 
this town nestled in the shortgrass prairie 380 miles west of 
kansas city and 230 miles east of denver appears to be thriving 
the red brick streets wind through a town with a strong business 
community and several new homes a 25 million renovation of the 
hospital and nursing home was recently completed 
the city also runs its own carnival and theater local investors 
have helped start private enterprises such as boat and bus 
factories 
frickey says she is sure conflicts will arise over plans for the 
building but she and fear acknowledge it is a pleasant burden 
how many small towns in this part of the country wouldnt like 
to have a 1 million gift fear asked were sure not going to 
give it up without a fight

rep barney frank was stunned to discover 
that his capitol hill home was being used by a male prostitute to 
sell sex according to a letter written by franks former landlady 
and released thursday 
frank released the letter in response to comments by a female 
prostitute who said the massachusetts democrat knew that stephen 
gobie was running a prostitution ring from the apartment 
the house ethics committee is investigating franks relationship 
with gobie 
the female prostitute insisted that frank knew his residence 
doubled as a brothel the woman who said she sold sexual services 
from franks apartment along with gobie reportedly is telling her 
story to the committee 
frank said the womans statements which first appeared in the 
march issue of penthouse magazine are complete lies fabricated 
stories about events which did not happen 
the former landlady mary jo daugherty gave her sworn statement 
oct 25 to the ethics committee officially the committee on 
standards of official conduct 
she said she became aware in the summer of 1987 that different 
women and on one occasion men would visit gobie at franks 
residence 
until this type of activity began to occur it never dawned on 
me that prostitution might be taking place she said noting that 
frank had moved into the basement apartment in 1983 
i called congressman frank and reported what i had observed 
mrs daugherty said he seemed stunned i never saw gobie again 
she said none of the activities occurred when frank was 
present 
it is my strong belief based on my knowledge of both 
congressman frank and mr gobie that gobie took advantage of 
congressman frank and had begun to misuse the apartment without 
congressman franks knowledge or permission she told the 
committee 
frank a homosexual has admitted that he paid gobie for sex 
when they first met however frank said he later hired gobie as a 
personal aide in an effort to turn gobies life around gobie has 
said frank knew sex was being sold from the apartment 
the investigation has proved troubling to the committee as 
members grapple with incidents involving personal behavior some 
committee members reportedly are holding out for a recommendation 
that frank be punished on grounds he discredited the house 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif has promised to introduce a 
resolution to expel frank a move that would force at least a 
procedural vote 
frank first elected in 1980 has announced hes running for 
reelection

connecticut residents would have to wait 
two weeks before buying any gun so that authorities could conduct 
criminal background checks under a bill approved by the legislature 
a national guncontrol group pushing a similar bill at the 
federal level called the connecticut vote wednesday an important 
commonsense victory but antiguncontrol forces said bill 
would do nothing to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals 
earlier this year california became the first state to enact a 
waitingperiod law 
gov william a oneill a gun owner whose administration 
recently put up 25 million in state pension funds to save colts 
manufacturing co a hartfordbased gun maker has said he would 
sign the bill if it passed 
it would probably be at least a week before the paperwork 
reaches oneills desk gubernatorial spokesman jon sandberg said 
thursday 
current connecticut law requires a waiting period for handguns 
only 
the 7666 vote in the house of representatives came after more 
than 2 hours of debate 
in no way does this impede or restrict a lawabiding citizen 
from obtaining a weapon said rep joseph s raia a city police 
officer who marshaled support for the bill 
others said the measure infringed on the constitutionally 
protected right to keep and bear arms opponents failed to attach 
several amendments that would have weakened the bill 
exempted from the waitingperiod requirements are police 
officers members of the armed services and anyone who has a pistol 
permit or hunting license 
today in a state where many of americas guns are made the 
legislature showed that common sense can prevail said sarah 
brady chair of handgun control inc 
susan misiora lobbyist for the national rifle association said 
the bill would do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals 
criminals just dont go to gun stores misiora said adding 
that a waiting period implies that youre guilty until proven 
innocent

the united states and its nato allies 
agreed today there is a diminishing need for battlefield 
nuclear weapons in its alliance arsenal given the recent political 
changes in eastern europe 
nato also welcomed the prospect of early negotiations with the 
soviet union on cutting shortrange nuclear missile forces 
the 14 defense ministers of the natos nuclear planning group 
also called on the soviet union to make substantial reductions 
unilaterally in its shortrange nuclear missile systems 
the statement came as the group wrapped up its twoday session 
in kananaskis at a rocky mountain ski resort 
the alliances statement follows president bushs recent 
decision to cancel the development of new tactical nuclear missiles 
and artillery systems designed for deployment by the nato allies 
the alliance statement did not address calls by the dutch and 
west germans for unilateral nato withdrawal of its hundreds of 
aging nuclear artillery shells which are designed to be shot on 
european battlefields at very close range in the event of an 
overwhelming warsaw pact conventional attack 
given the political and military changes now taking place in 
central and eastern europe together with the prospect of early 
signature and implementation of a conventional forces in europe 
treaty we agreed that there is a diminishing need for nuclear 
systems of the shortest range it said 
the alliance ministers welcomed bushs decision to cancel the 
planned update of nuclear weaponry and said it demonstrates once 
again the ability of the alliance to take the initiative in a 
rapidly changing situation 
the alliance ministers said they welcomed the prospect of 
early negotiations between the united states and the soviet union 
on shortrange nuclear missile systems and emphasized the 
importance of consultation within the alliance on the development 
of objectives for these negotiations 
while the alliance members agreed on the need to cut natos 
shortrange nuclear arsenal they left decisions on how deep those 
reductions should be to the leaders of the nato summit nations who 
will meet in london in early july 
the alliance ministers said that they recognized that a 
lessening need for shortrange nuclear weapons means relatively 
greater importance on substrategic nuclear weapons that offer 
both flexibility and longer range 
this appeared to be a reference to an alliance interest to shift 
a greater reliance on airlaunched nuclear weapons which are 
already based in europe and slated for upgrading sometime during 
this decade 
the ministers said they wanted their aides as well to step up 
work on a lengthy study of how to best reduce the alliances 
nuclear stockpile amid the rapidly changing political and military 
environment in europe 
it was the pacts first evaluation of its nuclear weapons 
strategy since the dramatic upheavals in eastern europe and the 
withering of their oncestrong adversary the warsaw pact 
there is scope for reductions britains defense chief tom 
king said of the tactical nuclear weapons i think there is 
general agreement on that 
there are some 1600 aging nucleartipped artillery shells based 
in west germany greece italy the netherlands and turkey they 
are designed to be shot at very close range to halt an overwhelming 
advance of warsaw pact tanks and other conventional forces 
it isnt known how many shortrange artillery shells the soviets 
possess generally the soviets have relied more on missiles in 
their tactical arsenal 
but with the recent prodemocracy revolutions in eastern europe 
and the steps being taken toward german unification the artillery 
is seen as increasingly irrelevant to some nato governments and 
their constituents

pope john paul ii taking issue with 
this populous nations family planning program told mexicans today 
that it is wrong to use contraceptives 
if in the conjugal union the possibility of conceiving a 
child is artificially eliminated the couple closed themselves to 
god and opposed his will john paul admonished a crowd of more 
than 100000 people on the fifth day of his eight day mexican trip 
the crowd at the prayer service included thousands of us 
residents who traveled to chihuahua 220 miles south of el paso 
texas 
thousands more were expected an an afternoon mass in monterrey 
100 miles southwest of laredo texas 
the pontiff spoke from a platform on a wide soccer field with 
the bare craggy peaks of the sierra madre in the background 
john paul in his homily reiterated standard roman catholic 
church policy against artificial birth control but his message had 
clear political implications in mexico where the government has 
encouraged the use of contraceptives in order to limit a 
mushrooming population of 85 million 
john paul also paid tribute to mexican women during the 
ceremony held on the date latin americans celebrate mothers day 
on wednesday night in durango john paul gave a stern lecture to 
a group of wealthy businessmen he said the poor have been hit 
hardest by mexicos economic crisis while the rich have helped 
create even more poverty through greed 
mexico despite the inherent resources that the creator gave 
this country is still very far from the ideal of justice the 
pope said wednesday noting the vast contrast between the rich few 
and the poor majority 
business must create more jobs pay fair salaries and protect 
the environment the pontiff said in the address delivered at a 
theater in durango 450 miles northwest of mexico city 
the speech followed an emotional visit to a nearby prison 
during which the pope mixed with inmates in an unscheduled visit to 
the prison yard for 20 minutes

an unusual coalition of religious groups asked 
the supreme court on thursday to reconsider its decision letting 
states outlaw the use of illegal drugs as a religious practice 
i seriously doubt these groups have ever been in the same room 
together much less have ever joined in so important an 
undertaking oliver thomas of the baptist joint committee on 
public affairs told reporters 
the april 17 high court ruling said members of the native 
american church had no constitutional right to take the 
hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious ceremonies 
officials from the american jewish congress the national 
association of evangelicals and the national council of churches 
also participated in a news conference held after the petition for 
rehearing was filed with the court 
others supporting the petition included the presbyterian church 
usa luthern church missouri synod american friends service 
committee americans united for separation of church and state and 
the christian legal society 
religious leaders were more disturbed by the courts method of 
deciding the case than by the decisions bottom line 
five members of 63 court majority agreed that religious beliefs 
cannot excuse failure to comply with otherwise valid laws 
prohibiting conduct states are free to regulate 
departing from a long series of prior cases the court did not 
require states to have a compelling reason before forcing 
someone to comply with laws interfering with religious beliefs 
the courts new reasoning said robert p dugan jr of the 
national association of evangelicals effected a sea change in 
freedomofreligion law 
henry siegman of the american jewish congress said that if the 
decision remains all americans will have reason to feel less 
free and more vulnerable under our constitution 
the court rarely grants requests for reconsideration and thomas 
acknowledged thursdays move was a long shot 
nevertheless it is our only shot he said

the united states may be mortgaging its future 
defenses by not limiting collaboration with allied nations in 
hightech weapons development according to a congressional study 
released thursday 
such collaboration makes business sense for the companies 
involved but may ultimately make the united states too dependent on 
foreign suppliers and erode parts of the us defense industrial 
base said the study by the office of technology assessment a 
nonpartisan analytical agency of the congress 
more joint weapons projects with european or japanese companies 
will mean less business for all but the largest american defense 
companies the study said 
the united states could end up with a defense industrial 
structure inadequate for the defense of the nation it said 
the study added on the other hand that erosion of us defense 
industries may not be a security risk because the united states may 
need less weaponmaking capacity as the cold war winds down and 
eastwest arms cuts are implemented 
even so the trend toward greater useuropean collaboration is 
casting doubt on americas longheld commitment to global 
superiority in weapons technology the study said traditionally 
the united states has kept this edge by focusing on military 
applications for new technologies with little regard for possible 
civilian uses 
now as defense industry competition heats up in the postcold 
war period the focus of multinational defense collaboration will 
be on dualuse technologies it said 
this might ultimately undermine the position of the united 
states as a military superpower because dualuse technologies 
would be available to many nations the study said in time 
the us military position might degenerate to the status of first 
among equals 
the study quoted an unidentified highranking military officer 
as saying if we want to stay a superpower we will invest to be 
ahead of the world in nextgeneration systems otherwise we 
are codeveloping and therefore not leading we lose the superpower 
label 
sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of the armed services 
subcommittee on defense industry and technology took a different 
view saying more us emphasis on dualuse technologies would help 
the domestic industry survive leaner times 
in light of the declining defense budgets of the 1990s we may 
need to concentrate more of our cooperation both with our european 
allies and especially with japan on dualuse technology rather 
than fullscale weapons systems he said

program to help the 17 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied gaza strip and the west bank 
john bolton us assistant secretary of state for international 
organization affairs said he hoped the decision would end attempts 
to politicize who 
who should return to life and death issues such as controlling 
aids helping to develop a vaccine against malaria and 
fostering health care everywhere he told delegates 
the plo has been campaigning to gain recognition as an 
independent state by becoming a full member of un organizations 
it currently has nonvoting observer status with who 
but dr fathi arafat head of the palestinian delegation and 
brother of plo leader yasser arafat said he did not see the 
decision as a rejection of the membership bid 
he said the plo would not give up its campaign for membership in 
international organizations 
more than 100 countries many in the third world have 
recognized the state of palestine declared by the plos 
parliamentinexile in november 1988 
the united states backed by most western countries maintains 
the plo is not entitled to full membership in un organizations 
because it does not meet internationally recognized criteria of 
statehood such as control of territory 
washington has pledged 78 million to who this year or 25 
percent of the agencys budget it is also a major sponsor of who 
programs outside the regular budget including the campaign against 
aids 
us officials said a us funds cutoff would be 
devastating and who chief nakajima had warned that all major 
programs such as the fight against tropical diseases would have to 
be slashed nakajima said he was extremely pleasedwith the 
outcome of the session 
in 1989 fears of a withdrawal of us financing prompted a who 
assembly to defer a decision until this year on the plo bid 
diplomats said fears of the us aid cutoff prompted thursdays 
decision as well 
the assembly called on who to continue its special technical 
assistance to improve the health conditions of the palestinian 
people in the occupied territories nakajima said the program 
budget was 18 million over two years 
a report to the assembly by a special committee cited high 
infant mortality rates and poor health care facilities in the 
israelioccupied territories 
the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases such as 
anaemia among pregnant women and children are increasing 
significantly it said mental diseases are presenting 
increasingly serious problems on account of the increase in 
violence in the region 
the report is to be discussed later in the meeting which began 
monday and runs for two weeks

had died 
guadarrama said the cause of the crash was under investigation

student financial aid provided by private 
colleges to attract lowincome and minority students more than 
doubled from 1970 to 1987 an association of the schools said 
thursday 
but richard rosser president of the national institute of 
independent colleges and universities said such aid cannot 
continue to grow at that pace without the colleges jeopardizing 
their own financial health and commitments to other areas of 
need 
an institute study entitled a commitment to access said 
that independent colleges and universities provided 234 billion 
from their own resources for financial assistance to undergraduate 
students in the 198788 school year a 102 percent increase 
adjusted for inflation over 197071 
the federal governments commitment to providing student 
financial assistance especially in the form of grants must be 
strengthened if lowincome and middleincome students are going to 
be allowed the choice of an education best suited for them the 
independent sector cannot do it alone he said 
more than threequarters of the growth occurred since the 
198081 school year the study said estimating that the figure 
reached 2626 billion in 198889 
in the 197576 school year federal aid was almost 3 times the 
aid provided by the institutions themselves rosser said adding 
that independent colleges and universities now provide more grant 
assistance to undergraduates than all federal student aid grants 
combined 
federal aid he said now focuses on the truly needy with 
little help for students from middleclass families the schools 
also provide little aid to middleclass students 
more than 85 percent of the aid provided by private colleges in 
198788 2 billion was awarded as grants and scholarships other 
aid was offered as loans and workstudy grants 
in the 198687 term expenses for a typical privatecollege 
student receiving aid averaged 10300 for tuition fees room and 
board an average of 7300 was provided in financial aid grants 
loans and workstudy leaving the student outofpocket expenses of 
about 3000 
the study said that on average 59 percent of all undergraduates 
attending independent colleges and universities received some form 
of institutionally provided aid in 198788 up from 44 percentin 
197071 
to finance increased student aid rosser said private colleges 
are often forced to keep faculty salaries low defer maintenance 
and cut back on purchases of library material and science equipment

stars from around the world gathered 
thursday for the 43rd annual cannes film festival but the man of 
the hour was 80yearold japanese director akira kurosawa 
his new film dreams provided a dignified and imaginative 
opening for 12 days of partying salesmanship and awardsgiving in 
the seaside city 
based on kurosawas dreams the film is eight separate segments 
including one in which a filmmaker confronts vincent van gogh in a 
wheat field and another about mountain climbers facing death in a 
blizzard 
dreams is not among the 19 films competing for the coveted 
top prize the golden palm this years entries include offerings 
from the societ union poland czechoslovakia china burkina faso 
great britain and italy 
a preview of dreams was held in the afternoon 
the 10member jury that will choose the winner of the golden 
palm is headed by italian director bernardo bertolucci and includes 
american actress anjelica huston french actress fanny ardant and 
english screenwriter christopher hampton who wrote the english 
adaptation of liaisons dangereuses 
american offerings in competition for the golden palm include 
clint eastwoods white hunter black heart based on john 
hustons filming of african queen in 1952 david lynchs wild 
at heart and an american production by english director alan 
parker come see the paradise 
the french are offering four films including jeanpaul 
rappeneaus cyrano de bergerac starring gerard depardieu and 
new wave starring alain delon and directed by jeanluc godard 
but it was dreams that created the stir 
at a news conference after the preview kurosawa said he had 
been inspired to write down his dreams by a dostoevski passage in 
which the author said dreams revealed mens deepest thoughts 
liberated in sleep 
he then decided to make a film about his dreams but he left out 
three of his best because technically they were too difficult or 
expensive enough to bankrupt the producer 
while some dreams had a nightmare quality others were 
beautiful such as one concerning the director in an imaginary 
encounter with van gogh played by martin scorsese 
akira terao was lauded for his interpretation of a younger 
kurosawa 
i was trembling at doing the different parts he said but 
mr kurosawa told me to just be natural and then i felt better 
while being natural is difficult it gave me reassurance 
nonetheless 
kurosawa fielded questions about his film with aplomb 
i think none of my many films has more than two or three 
moments of pure cinema said the director of the seven 
samurai and ran and winner of a special award at this years 
oscar ceremony in hollywood 
i wanted to have more moments of pure and perfect cinema with 
dreams but while i did my best i dont think i got much more 
than those two or three moments 
which were they asked a reporter 
thats for you to decide said kurosawa

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
thursday outlined the central banks ideas for reforming the 
nations financial system including charging banks with risky 
investments more for their deposit insurance 
in his first extensive public remarks on deposit insurance 
reform greenspan told a federal reserve bank of chicago conference 
that the issue should be high on our agenda as congress and the 
bush administration consider permitting banks to expand into 
securities and insurance 
among the specific reforms he suggested were varying deposit 
insurance premiums according to the riskiness of a banks 
investments more frequently examining banks books more swiftly 
seizing weak banks and requiring bank owners to risk more of their 
own money 
greenspan did not address such proposals as cutting back on the 
100000 peraccount insurance limiting insurance to one account 
imposing a deductible on the insurance or finding a way to 
allow large banks to fail without endangering the system 
he is proceeding gingerly but in the chairman are the 
seeds of a most radical reform of our existing financial system 
said kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers association of america which represents 
smaller banks wary of deposit insurance changes 
the treasury department is due to release its banking reform 
plan by february greenspan is expected to be a major influence in 
that plans development and in congressional debate on the issue 
next year 
greenspan appeared to reject the notion of simply doing away 
with deposit insurance and other safeguards which some freemarket 
conservatives advocate 
the united states has not suffered a financial panic or 
systemic bank run in the last 50 years in large part this reflects 
the safety net he said 
but the protection comes at a cost he said three parts of the 
safety net pose a moral hazard for bankers by allowing them to 
shift some of the risks of their actions onto the public 
they are deposit insurance the ability of banks to borrow at 
low rates in emergencies from the feds discount window and banks 
access the feds electronic payments wire which guarantees 
payments between banks 
reform of the safety net greenspan said should be considered 
in tandem with expanding bank powers 
offering banks no new powers likely would cause commercial 
banking to shrink in relationship to the rest of the financial 
system that in turn may create systemic risk similar to that 
faced in earlier years 
bank owners now risk about six cents of every dollar they lend 
however greenspan noted that in the 1800s before the creation of 
deposit insurance and the discount window bankers risked 25 cents 
to 50 cents for every dollar they loaned that encouraged them to 
use more caution 
a text of greenspans speech delivered at the chicago feds 
annual conference on bank structure and competition was released 
in washington

the president of the southern christian 
leadership conference says he will talk about the human family when 
he teaches a racerelations course to klansmen but not all his 
students may be listening 
i dont know what hes going to say but hes not going to 
change my way of thinking said roger handley a former ku klux 
klan leader in birmingham who was accused of attacking an sclc 
march in decatur in 1979 
the rev joseph lowery who organized the march is to lead the 
course saturday for the klansmen as part of a court settlement 
growing out of the bloody clash 
lowery said he plans to talk about the oneness of the human 
family and how the klansmen themselves may have been exploited by 
demagogic leadership he said he plans to sit in a circle with the 
former klansmen and attempt an informal discussion 
told of lowerys plan to make the twohour session informal 
handley said good maybe ill convert him 
handley a 44yearold disabled sheetmetal worker called the 
discussion a waste of time 
i dont believe in integration i dont believe in 
interbreeding i dont hate anybody but im not going to change my 
way of thinking on that he said 
lowery would not disclose the location of the meeting because he 
doesnt want reporters to attend 
i dont think the klan would cooperate if news media people 
were sitting in the room he said theyve got to protect their 
pride and i think theyd turn it into a circus there would be no 
serious discussion 
at best its going to be difficult to have a serious 
discussion 
one of their cyclops up in connecticut called it cruel and 
unusual punishment lowery told the birmingham postherald in a 
telephone interview i reckon it might be 
the meeting grew out of a lawsuit against the klan by montgomery 
attorney morris dees of the southern poverty law center dees said 
that in the decatur clash handley gave the order for klansmen to 
fire on black marchers 
four men two blacks and two whites were wounded in an exchange 
of gunfire 
an fbi investigation failed to bring criminal charges in 1980 
but information dees gathered led to criminal indictments for years 
later against nine klansmen including handley who served four 
months in prison 
handley said he was innocent but agreed to attend the 
racerelations course because it was a way to get out of the 
lawsuit which dees filed in us district court in huntsville

a british airliner nearly 
collided with two us air force jets thursday and two passengers 
were injured when the planes pilot made a nose dive to avoid a 
crash authorities said 
the danair british turboprop was carrying 15 passengers 
including a child and a crew of six on a flight from west berlin 
to saarbruecken near the french border 
two passengers required hospital treatment for contusions 
suffered when they were thrown out of their seats as the plane 
dived suddenly according to a statement released by the interior 
ministry of the state of rhinelandpalatinate 
a newspaper said the passenger plane missed the two fighters by 
50 feet but an air force spokesman estimated the planes were about 
500 feet apart 
a us air force statement said the incident involved two f15 
jet fighters from the 36th tactical fighter wing 
the us air force pilots and the danair captain took 
successful evasive action and reported the event to the 
authorities said a statement issued by the 36th tactical fighter 
wing at the bitburg air base 
a spokesman for west germanys federal air traffic control 
authority said the danair plane was flying from west berlin to 
saarbruecken in southern west germany at the time of the incident 
spokesman hansurlich ohl told the associated press the danair 
captain reported seeing only one military jet he said military 
jets usually fly in formations of two and it was possible that the 
danair captain did not see the second jet 
the captain sent the plane into a nosedive to avoid a crash 
and several passengers were thrown out of their seats ohl said 
the incident occurred at 1117 am 24 miles north of 
saarbruecken ohl said 
the british plane a twinengine hawker siddeley 748 was at an 
altitude of 7590 feet and was preparing to land at the time of the 
nearhit the spokesman said the plane can carry about 50 
passengers 
the saarbruecker zeitung newspaper reported that the danair 
plane missed the oncoming jets by 50 feet 
fifty feet thats impossible they would have collided air 
force capt jerry brown told the associated press we dont know 
precisely but our best estimate is that they were approximately 
500 feet apart 
the danair turboprop plane was being guided by the us air 
force air control at the ramstein air base ohl said 
airliners serving west berlin still fly through designated air 
corridors controlled by the victorious world war ii allies 
warplanes from eight nato countries fly in west german airspace 
there have been several fatal air accidents in recent years 
involving american and other allied aircraft prompting sharp

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
thursday outlined the central banks ideas for reforming the 
nations financial system including charging banks with risky 
investments more for their deposit insurance 
in his first extensive public remarks on deposit insurance 
reform greenspan told a federal reserve bank of chicago conference 
that the issue should be high on our agenda as congress and the 
bush administration consider permitting banks to expand into 
securities and insurance 
among the specific reforms he suggested were varying deposit 
insurance premiums according to the riskiness of a banks 
investments more frequently examining banks books more swiftly 
seizing weak banks and requiring bank owners to risk more of their 
own money 
greenspan did not address such proposals as cutting back on the 
100000 peraccount insurance limiting insurance to one account 
imposing a deductible on the insurance or finding a way to 
allow large banks to fail without endangering the system 
he is proceeding gingerly but in the chairman are the 
seeds of a most radical reform of our existing financial system 
said kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers association of america which represents 
smaller banks wary of deposit insurance changes 
the treasury department is due to release its banking reform 
plan by february greenspan is expected to be a major influence in 
that plans development and in congressional debate on the issue 
next year 
greenspan appeared to reject the notion of simply doing away 
with deposit insurance and other safeguards which some freemarket 
conservatives advocate 
the united states has not suffered a financial panic or 
systemic bank run in the last 50 years in large part this reflects 
the safety net he said 
but the protection comes at a cost he said three parts of the 
safety net pose a moral hazard for bankers by allowing them to 
shift some of the risks of their actions onto the public 
they are deposit insurance the ability of banks to borrow at 
low rates in emergencies from the feds discount window and banks 
access the feds electronic payments wire which guarantees 
payments between banks 
reform of the safety net greenspan said should be considered 
in tandem with expanding bank powers 
offering banks no new powers likely would cause commercial 
banking to shrink in relationship to the rest of the financial 
system that in turn may create systemic risk similar to that 
faced in earlier years 
bank owners now risk about six cents of every dollar they lend 
however greenspan noted that in the 1800s before the creation of 
deposit insurance and the discount window bankers risked 25 cents 
to 50 cents for every dollar they loaned that encouraged them to 
use more caution 
a text of greenspans speech delivered at the chicago feds 
annual conference on bank structure and competition was released 
in washington

the worst cyclone to hit india in more 
than a decade moved inland thursday killing at least 85 people and 
leaving hundreds of homes flattened and more than 90 villages under 
water 
the storm first began bashing indias southeastern coast with 
heavy rains and tidal surges tuesday and it made landfall 
wednesday evening hitting coastal districts along the bay of bengal 
with winds up to 155 mph 
by late thursday the storm lay over the inland town of 
bhadrachalam about 105 miles north of the coast wind speeds were 
decreasing as the cyclones fury weakened said officials in 
hyderabad the capital of andrha pradesh state 
united news of india said winds of 70 to 80 mph would continue 
for another three days as the storm moved inland 
the weather office said the storm was likely to move north and 
weaken gradually but that lowlying heavily populated coastal 
regions would continue to receive much rain 
tv and radio reports said the storm killed 57 people but local 
officials reported a higher death toll saying at least 75 people 
died in andrha pradesh and 10 more in neighboring tamil nadu state 
the death toll was expected to rise as rescue workers reached 
isolated villages 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said at 
least 2 million people in four districts of andrha pradesh state 
were affected by the cyclone 
tens of thousands of people were cut off from rescue workers as 
the heavy rains and towering waves left at least 90 villages under 
water the staterun television said the storm dumped more than 16 
inches of water on the coastal regions 
but late thursday rescue workers did manage to reach the 
lowlying coastal village of yedurumudi where about 7000 
residents had been marooned by the storm officials said they said 
it was a miracle that residents were not too badly affected by the 
storm 
indian news reports said residents there rejected an evacuation 
order because the village was not affected by a 1977 cyclone which 
killed more than 10000 people in southern india 
officials said casualties from the current storm were relatively 
low because early warnings gave authorities time to evacuate more 
than 150000 people from the coastal districts in 1977 few people 
were evacuated 
as the storm struck the coast the high winds and waves up to 33 
feet knocked down hundreds of thatched huts and uprooted thousands 
of trees 
residents who left the coastal town of machilipatnam which bore 
the brunt of the cyclone said the streets were waistdeep in water 
one resident who escaped to hyderabad said it rained 
continuously for 20 hours in machilipatnam 
united news of india said thousands of houses were damaged by 
gales and heavy rains that lashed the area before and during the 
cyclone many towns and villages were plunged into darkness as 
electricity lines were downed and several power stations severely 
damaged it said trains stopped running 
the news agency quoted officials as saying about 100 telephone 
exchanges were damaged disrupting telecommunications and the 
roads were littered with fallen trees 
the hardesthit districts comprising a small peninsula that 
juts out into the bay of bengal were krishna east godavari and 
west godavari united news said adding that more than 400000 
people were affected in east godavari alone 
the highest casualties were in krishna district where 24 people 
were killed the news agency said at least 33 others died in other 
parts of the state it said 
most of the deaths in andhra pradesh occurred when walls 
collapsed or when flood waters swept people away 
cyclones are the indian oceans equivalent of hurricanes they 
usually come in the spring just before the monsoon season begins

rival christian forces under gen michel 
aoun and militia chieftain samir geagea exchanged artillery and 
tank barrages in east beirut on thursday shattering a relative 
lull in the fighting 
police said four people were killed and eight wounded in the 
heavy barrages that erupted after a day of intermittent skirmishes 
with machine guns and mortars 
it was the 101st day of the inconclusive showdown between aoun 
and geagea for control of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
a daytime lull gave the exhausted population a chance to emerge 
from underground shelters to take stock of damage from the savage 
shelling of the previous two days 
but residents quickly scurried back to their shelters when the 
heavy shelling resumed 
the casualties included a moslem driver whose vegetable van took 
a direct hit from a shell hit at the midcity museum gateway that 
links east beirut with the citys moslem sector across the dividing 
green line 
the gateway was opened only minutes before being closed again 
police said 
the aoungeagea fight has killed 980 people and wounded 2572 
since it erupted jan 30 
the guns generally fell silent by midnight wednesday a police 
spokesman said but snipers manning rooftop firing nests kept most 
roads blocked in east beirut and the christian enclave northeast of 
the city 
snipers also targeted the museum gateway and few civilians 
ventured across the dividing line 
the crackle of automatic fire echoed across the museum gateway 
as a woman and three men sped on foot toward west beirut hurry 
up keep your heads down shouted a moslem soldier on the western 
side 
the four made it safely across and said they were going to stay 
with relatives 
the woman janette elia said the street where she had lived in 
furn elshubbak district was reduced to mere piles of rubble 
debris and glass shards 
geageas men fired salvo after salvo of rockets from 
multibarrelled launchers at our street mrs elia said the 
rockets came in like endless sea waves whistling and exploding 
mrs elia said she spent the whole day and night wednesday in 
the basement of her home most of the residents had already fled 
to safer areas she said 
the fighting has forced 400000 of the enclaves 1 million 
residents to flee to safer areas in lebanon and neighboring 
countries and inflicted damage estimated at 1 billion 
aouns troops and geageas fighters also used the lull to defuse 
scores of unexploded shells and rockets remove the rubble that 
blocked some streets and resupply their positions with food water 
and ammunition a police spokesman said 
they are preparing for another round of destruction the 
spokesman said the reason for the clash is still there and the 
weapons are still there theyll fight again 
the fierce shelling was apparently halted by a ceasefire call 
from maronite patriarch nasrallah sfeir both aoun and geagea are 
maronites too 
the violence had escalated wednesday when aoun imposed 
restrictions on sea outlets controlled by geagea along the 28mile 
christian coastline

china announced thursday it had released 211 
jailed prodemocracy protesters including several prominent 
academics in a move that appeared timed to head off possible us 
trade sanctions 
those released include dai qing a leading journalist cao 
siyuan director of a social science research institute and li 
honglin head of the fujian provincial academy of social sciences 
all signed petitions or otherwise showed support for the 
democratic reforms demanded last spring by hundreds of thousands of 
protesters in beijing and other cities the protests ended in june 
when the army opened fire on the demonstrators killing hundreds 
and possibly thousands 
the official xinhua news agency described those released as 
lawbreakers and said they were given lenient treatment and 
released upon completion of investigations 
it inserted the word former before the titles of ms dai and 
the others indicating they were fired while in prison 
coming back home was like a dream ms dai said contacted 
at home by telephone she said she was let out wednesday after 
10 months my kitchen is like a stranger 
she declined to speak further saying she would be arrested 
again if she talked to a reporter without permission 
we welcome this announcement said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler we are pleased that the official 
announcement provided the names of six of those released we 
believe that the interests of all parties would be best served by a 
full public accounting of the number and identity of those detained 
as well as those released 
ms tutwiler added that the chinese government has not provided 
information to date on how many people remain as detainees or as 
prisoners according to unoffical estimates 10000 to 15000 were 
detained nationwide at some point but most have been released she 
said 
the official announcement said 431 were still under 
investigation by beijing public security organs but it is not clear 
whether all of these are imprisoned she said 
none of the six listed by xinhua was a student xinhua did not 
say if any student leaders were among those released 
students at beijing university said they knew of no students who 
had recently been returned to campus 
campus sources in beijing have reported that several student 
activists were released in the past few weeks but none was a top 
leader of the prodemocracy movement 
xinhua quoted an unidentified spokesman for the public security 
ministry as saying only 431 lawbreakers involved in the turmoil 
and rebellion are still being investigated it said some are 
being dealt with by judicial departments 
the figures still leave hundreds of people unaccounted for 
china previously announced the release of 573 people during the 
winter arrests reported by the official media last summer alone 
totaled more than 2000 and arrests continued during the fall and 
winter 
few trials have been publicized although 20 executions have 
been reported in the official press sources have reported that 
several leading dissidents still in jail have finally been charged 
after months of detention despite chinese legal requirements that 
charges be filed within 45 days 
the releases came as debate begins in the united states over 
whether to renew chinas mostfavorednation trade status the 
status given to all but a handful of nations substantially 
reduces tariffs on goods exported to the united states 
as a socialist country chinas status must be renewed each 
year president bush must issue his decision by june 3 and some 
congressmen have said they favor suspending mostfavorednation 
status as a protest of chinas human rights record 
china has said suspension would set bilateral relations back 20 
years it has insisted it will not yield to foreign pressure but 
last week it ended 14 months of martial law in the tibetan capital 
in what was widely interpreted as an effort to placate critics 
martial law had been imposed to quell demonstrations against 
chinese rule 
prominent protesters from beijings democracy movement who 
remain in jail include wang dan a beijing university history major 
who was one of the top student leaders and seven other students 
named on a student mostwanted list last summer 
five students on that list are known to have escaped china and 
the rest are believed still in hiding 
also still in jail are liu xiaobo a university lecturer who 
took part in a hunger strike during the last days of protest and 
ren wanding an accountant who gave prodemocracy speeches during 
the movement he was also jailed four years in the early 1980s for 
having helped lead an earlier democracy movement

premier andrei lukanov said thursday he 
is prepared to head bulgarias next government even if his 
socialist party the former communist party is defeated in 
elections next month and forced into a coalition with the 
opposition 
the socialist party seeks a firm break with its stalinist past 
lukanov said in an interview with the associated press 
the party which changed its name last month is now dominated 
by those who want a new european socialist party who are 
resolutely antistalinist lukanov said 
bulgarias communist party draws on almost a century of 
tradition in the months immediately following novembers ouster of 
todor zhivkov after 35 years in power it retained stronger 
standing than any other communist party in eastern europe 
but the democratic opposition while still splintered has 
gained ground and is approaching the elections june 10 and 17 with 
confidence 
petko simeonov a leading opposition figure predicted tuesday 
that the newly named socialists would suffer a catastrophic 
defeat at the polls 
but lukanov an economist who is well respected by all political 
groups in bulgaria maintained the socialists will emerge as the 
strongest political force after the elections 
he stopped short of predicting a majority for bulgarias 
erstwhile communists in view of the recent electoral defeat of 
hungarys socialists who guided their country to peaceful reform 
asked if he would be willing to head a government if the 
socialists do not emerge victorious lukanov replied if the 
party considers this the right thing to do i would not have a 
personal position on it and would take the job 
but he later added this prospect does not make me happy 
several leaders of the opposition union of democratic forces say 
they would like to see the savvy lukanov stay at the helm in a 
coalition 
a coalition is necessary whoever wins we need at least for 
a transitory period a government enjoying if not 100 percent 
very massive public support lukanov said 
the political economic and legal reforms ahead of us are of 
such a magnitude of such complexity that we do not think it 
possible for anyone in a single political force to shoulder this 
he added

eugene long has enjoyed a reputation as the 
city where the peace crusade of the 1960s did not die so it wasnt 
surprising that voters declared it a nuclear free zone in 1986 
but as oregon struggles to diversify its economy to make up for 
the decline of the timber industry residents are confronted with 
paying a price for their convictions on tuesday they will decide 
whether to toughen the ordinance that bans the local manufacture of 
nuclear weapons and their components 
although eugene population 110000 is in many ways a timber 
town the presence of the 18500student university of oregon has 
given it a liberal tone not found elsewhere in oregon 
but the proposed city charter amendment has scared away the 
builders of a 15 million factory one small defense contractor 
vows to move out of the city if the nuclear free zone measure 
passes 
rohr industries earlier this year decided to build a new jet 
engine parts plant in san marcos texas rather than eugene with 
it went 250 jobs 
eugene had made the short list said jerry broening 
director of public affairs for rohr in san diego indeed we had 
selected eugene tentatively to locate the facility 
then it came to our notice that there was this pending 
stiffening of the existing nuclear free zone ordinance in eugene 
supporters launched the latest initiative after the city council 
and a special task force refused to establish an elected board to 
oversee the nuclear free zones approved by voters in 1986 and 1988 
the latest initiative would amend the city charter keeping the 
council out of the process 
a nuclearfree zone in oakland calif was declared 
unconstitutional last month in the federal governments first 
lawsuit against a such a law a federal judge said the ordinance 
interfered with exclusive federal control of national defense 
atomic energy and shipments of hazardous materials 
steve johnson the chief petitioner for the initiative to make 
the nuclear free zone part of the city charter said the oakland 
case shouldnt affect the his proposal because it does not attempt 
to directly limit decisions by the federal and state governments 
as oaklands did 
and while eugenes measure would prohibit hauling nuclear wastes 
over city streets it doesnt try to stop passage on interstate 5 
or the railroad johnson said 
johnson an adjunct sociology professor at the university of 
oregon calls the initiative a chance to force the city council to 
finally accept the will of the people as expressed in the previous 
nuclearfree votes i thought the voters got a rotten deal he 
said 
but mike schwartz cochairman of citizens against an 
irresponsible nuclear free zone said the vote is really about 
whether people want to see their economy grow 
this is camouflage that people who dont want growth are 
using said schwartz 
though nuclear free zone advocates say rohr wouldnt have been 
covered by the ballot measure broening said the company didnt 
want its future restricted in any way besides it was in a hurry 
to build its plant 
we are a subcontractor and our customers ask us to do things 
and if they ask us to do things we respond broening said we 
needed to have a plant in operation by october which was patently 
undoable if we had to wait until june for the outcome of the 
vote 
robert ellis is president of biodynamics a 10yearold eugene 
defense contractor that employs 25 people to make flight simulators 
and handle secret military projects 
ellis finds the local climate so hostile to his company that he 
plans to move it if the new nuclear free zone passes 
its 1969 in eugene he said for our children there is no 
good potential employment in eugene oregon unless you want to 
make belts 
david zupan a staffer for the organization peaceworks who is 
active on the nuclear free zone campaign figures rohrs decision 
should encourage people that the new improved nuclear free zone 
will work 
they should be relieved that a company that wants to make 
nuclear weapons is not coming to eugene zupan said 
the impression was that rohr would employ outofwork mill 
workers johnson said the fact is these are people they bring 
with them or attract from outside the area we dont have a big 
pool with specialty metal fabrication experience

jurors began deliberating thursday whether 
a man convicted of poisoning the historic treaty oak should be 
given a life sentence for the crime 
paul stedman cullen 46 was convicted in state district court 
wednesday of poisoning the beloved landmark in what authorities 
said was an occult ritual because he was previously convicted of a 
felony burglary he faces a maximum sentence of 99 years or life 
in prison the minimum sentence is five years 
cullen refused to comment as he was led from the courtroom by 
sheriffs deputies after his conviction wednesday his father 
insisted his son hadnt harmed the tree 
they convicted an innocent man said paul cullen sr 
the tree estimated to be as much as 500 years old was poisoned 
with velpar a powerful liquid herbicide early in 1989 news 
reports about the case brought international attention to the giant 
live oak tree which according to legend was the site of a treaty 
signing between stephen f austin and indians 
about twothirds of the tree is now dead foresters said but 
the remaining third is still producing leaves 
cullen was arrested in june after bragging to a woman that he 
poisoned the tree authorities said 
during the eightday trial prosecutors said cullen poisoned the 
treaty oak as part of an occult ritual to both protect a woman he 
liked and to kill his love for her 
cullens attorneys tried to portray him as a lonely loser who 
claimed he poisoned the tree to impress a woman 
thats the key to this entire case defense attorney terry 
kirk said he wanted her to think that he was somebody 
since the poisoning was discovered more than 100000 has been 
donated to to pay for extraordinary measures that were taken to try 
to save the tree velparcontaminated dirt was removed from around 
its roots the tree has been doused with spring water and elaborate 
sun screens were built to shade it

the united states is recalling its ambassador 
to romania as a signal of displeasure over intimidation and 
harassment of opposition parties the state department said 
thursday 
the recall of ambassador alan green was based on reports of 
irregularities in the romanian electoral process which raise 
questions about whether those elections will be free and fair 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
she said green will return to bucharest in time for the may 20 
elections when romanians will vote for a president and a bicameral 
parliament 
anticommunist demonstrators in romania contend the elections 
are being manipulated by the interim government in a way that could 
lead to domination by communists previously associated with the 
regime of the late president nicolae ceausescu 
government leaders maintain that they were for the most part 
dissidents who suffered under ceausescus rule 
ms tutiler said we have urged the interim romanian 
government to take more vigorous steps to maintain order and to 
protect the rights of all candidates in these elections 
among the electoral problems she cited were the incidence of 
organized acts of intimidation and harassment directed against 
some opposition parties and candidates 
we are also concerned about complaints that several major 
parties still encounter obstacles in obtaining their fair share of 
broadcast time on the publicly controlled radio and television and 
in distributing their campaign literature through the mail as well 
as problems with distributing independent newspapers ms 
tutwiler said 
she said a fair election is crucial to the further 
democratization in romania and to good relations with the united 
states 
the international human rights law group a private research 
organization issued a report expressing concerns similar to those 
of the state department 
the report said there is widespread apprehension throughout 
romania that the national salvation front which dominates the 
interim government has unfair advantages over other parties 
a law group delegation which visited romania in april said it 
could not judge the truth of the allegations but the belief that 
these advantages exist is pervasive and has created deep resentment 
in many sectors of the population the report said 
if the allegations are not promptly addressed it said there 
is a risk that the election process will be regarded by substantial 
segments of the politically active population as not being free and 
fair and therefore that the legitimacy of the elected government 
will be questioned

nelson mandela arrived thursday for his 
first visit to angola and thanked the marxist government and its 
allies for supporting his african national congress in its struggle 
against whiteminority rule in south africa 
mandela in an emotional speech to tens of thousands of angolans 
packing luandas dusty may 1 square said i pay tribute to 
comrade president jose eduardo dos santos his government and the 
angolan people for all the help they have given us 
the progress we have made in our struggle is owed largely to 
angola and we hope that one day we will be as free as you said 
mandela 
mandela shielded from the blazing midday sun by an umbrella 
also praised cuban president fidel castro and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev for helping independence movements in southern 
africa 
he described cuba as a poor country economically but said 
theres one thing where that country stands out head and 
shoulders above the rest that is in its love for human rights and 
liberty 
he said he hoped to visit havana and moscow soon 
last week the anc agreed in principle with south african 
president fw de klerk to seek a peaceful end to apartheid and 
minority rule in south africa 
but mandelas speech in luanda mixed optimism for peace with 
revolutionary rhetoric more reminiscent of the battle cries of the 
mid1970s when angola became host to at least seven major anc 
military training bases 
angolas prominent military and logistic aid to the movement 
ended in 1988 as part of a regional peace accord with south africa 
and cuba 
those usbrokered agreements also set terms for namibian 
independence the withdrawal of some 50000 cuban troops from 
angola and the end of south african support to unita rebels 
fighting angolas government 
according to mandela the anc has noted the moves afoot to 
bring about peace in angola and we support those moves 
heavy sustained applause from the crowd followed his words 
we are distressed that such a great and beautiful country is 
split from top to bottom by a civil war that has been engineered by 
south africa and other hostile powers said mandela 
he promised unspecified anc support for the angolan government 
south african troops fought alongside unita in the field against 
angolan government forces and their cuban allies from 1975 
dos santos claimed thursday that former south african president 
pieter botha offered to cease aid to unita if luanda agreed to halt 
support for the south west african peoples organization it 
recently won namibias independence elections 
south african aid to unita formally stopped with the new york 
accords but luanda recently renewed accusations that assistance 
from pretoria is still reaching the rebels the rebels also receive 
a reported 50 million in us aid 
dos santos struck a conciliatory note thursday praising de 
klerk as an advocate of peace in the region for allowing 
namibia to gain independence and for opening talks with the anc 
peace should be brought to south africa and to southern africa 
as a whole a soon as possible said dos santos 
security was heavy in luanda with troops and military police 
manning roadblocks at most major intersections 
western and african diplomats said the government could be 
concerned that unita might try to stage guerrilla attacks during 
mandelas stay 
increased rebel sabotage and bomb attacks this year have left 
luandans nervous and dependent on emergency electricity and water 
supplies 
mandelas arrival in angola came one day after de klerk started 
a ninenation european tour to gain international support for his 
attempts to reform south africa 
de klerk ordered mandelas release from prison and legalized the 
anc in february 30 years after the organization was banned

the preferential treatment the federal prison 
system gets in selling products to the government is hurting the 
nations private industry some members of congress said thursday 
this is a playing field that is obviously not level said 
rep howard coble rnc sponsor of a bill to limit the prison 
systems guaranteed share of the federal market 
coble said furniture and textile companies in north carolina are 
hurt by the burgeoning prison manufacturing program which sold 240 
different products to federal agencies last year the sales totaled 
361 million and are expected to double by 1992 the program 
employed 13000 inmates and 1400 civilians 
the prisons sold 90 million worth of furniture in 1989 a 20 
percent increase over the previous year said rep fred upton 
rmich 
industry officials believe the prisons have 23 percent of the 
federal office furniture market he said 
federal agencies must now buy products from the prison system if 
it can meet the purchasers price and delivery requirements 
upton said the growing federal inmate population could make the 
prison industries program the equivalent of a fortune 500 company 
by 1992 
to me it seems inherently unfair that private industries must 
compete for federal market share in this uncompetitive situation 
he said 
upton and rep paul henry rmich testified at a hearing of 
the house judiciary subcommittee on courts intellectual property 
and the administration of justice the panel is considering a bill 
that would have the prisons compete equally with private companies 
once the prisons obtain a 10 percent share of the federal market 
for a given product 
aside from textiles and furniture the prisons produce leather 
electronic plastic wood and metal goods and graphic products 
federal bureau of prisons commissioner j michael quinlan spoke 
against the measure at a jan 30 hearing saying the manufacturing 
program helps inmates learn job skills and defuses potential inmate 
unrest from overcrowding

southern sudan where tens of thousands 
of people starved to death in previous years once again faces an 
acute food shortage according to a report thursday 
the sudan news agency carried the report written by the 
governments relief and rehabilitation commission in cooperation 
with the united nations and western relief organizations 
the report said that despite food shortages there was no threat 
of famine 
but western relief sources said there was an imminent threat of 
starvation in northern parts of bahr elghazal and around juba 
capital of equatoria they said in some areas malnutrition was high 
among children under five years old 
the report followed a twoweek survey of the southern sudanese 
regions that have been battered by a 7yearold civil war 
christian and animist rebels in the south want autonomy from the 
moslemdominated government in khartoum 
the war led to food shortages that killed 250000 sudanese in 
1988 un figures show 
the report did not indicate this year how many people were 
affected by what it said was an acute food shortage it called 
for the transportation of food to the southern regions before the 
summer rains which begin in june 
the united nations has said 45 million southerners need 
emergency relief this onth 
laughrun said he was hoping for probation for his client 
were going to ask for it and the government prosecutors 
indicated they arent going to fight us on that he said we 
hope the judge will go along with it 
in the plea agreement the court said the sentencing guidelines 
called for a prison sentence of between eight and 14 months 
fletcher had faced a maximum term of five years and a 250000 fine 
fletcher a regular guest on bakkers old ptl club 
television show was indicted last december for lying to the grand 
jury that investigated ptls operations 
fletcher was accused of lying to the investigative panel in 
september 1987 about why he brought miss hahn to florida to meet 
bakker in 1980 he denied then that he took her to a hotel to have 
sex with bakker 
testifying later however he admitted that sex was the purpose 
of the meeting according to the indictment 
the meeting ultimately led to the demise of the 
multimilliondollar televangelism empire run by bakker and his 
wife tammy faye in nearby fort mill sc 
bakker resigned as ptl chairman when it was about to be revealed 
in march 1987 that ptl had paid miss hahn 265000 in hush money 
ptl fell into bankruptcy and a federal grand jury began looking 
into bakkers fundraising activities and spending 
bakker went on trial last year on charges he defrauded his 
followers who sent him 158 million in exchange for phony offers of 
guaranteed lodging at the heritage usa christian retreat 
in october bakker was convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy and sentenced to 45 years in prison he is appealing the 
conviction while he is serving his time at a minnesota prison 
three other ptl associates former executive vice president 
richard dortch and exbakker aides david taggart and james taggart 
are in prison for crimes they committed while working at the tv 
ministry

prime minister toshiki kaifu on thursday urged a 
radical revision of the electoral system saying it is the only way 
to reduce the power of money in japanese politics 
it is clear to me that the public wants clean 
easytounderstand politics kaifu said in a nationally televised 
news conference i will bet the fate of my administration on 
achieving this reform 
kaifu endorsed the recommendations of an advisory council to 
change japans system of multipleseat constituencies reduce 
politicians ability to raise money on their own and tighten rules 
on reporting political donations 
looking back on the recruit influencepeddling scandal it 
is the central theme of my administration to clear political 
distrust and shift elections from a race of individuals to one of 
political parties he said 
kaifu 59 came to office in august after two predecessors 
resigned in quick succession over the recruit and sex scandals 
recruit co a giant in the information industry made lavish 
donations and questionable stock sales to leading politicians 
businessmen and bureaucrats 
initially seen as a stopgap prime minister because he lacked a 
power base within the governing liberal democratic party kaifu has 
gained public support with his clean image and efforts to ease 
usjapan trade friction 
analysts express skepticism however over the possibilities of 
drastic electoral system reforms 
while some politicians are aware that electoral reforms are 
essential to wipe out money politics it is too risky for most of 
them to accept such drastic reforms said takashi inoguchi a 
political science professor at tokyo university 
kaifu said he would consult with the opposition parties to build 
a consensus for introduction of an electoral reform bill by 
november 
japan now has 130 constituencies for elections to the 512seat 
lower house most elect three to five legislators 
to win a majority the governing party must field more than one 
candidate in each constituency 
candidates from the same party thus cannot compete on policy 
issues said isao sato a law professor at tokai university and 
cochairman of the electoral review committee 
they inevitably vie for popularity by spending lavishly to 
court voters sato said that not only leads to corrupt money 
politics but also reduces the significance of policy debates 
the committee formed in june proposes creating 300 singleseat 
constituencies and having 200 members elected to nationwide 
atlarge constituencies in the powerful lower house the lower 
house can override the upper house and enact legislation on its own 
the lower house proposals would limit each candidate to having 
two fundraising groups now there is no limit and require the 
reporting of donations more than 64 the current limit is 6400 
the governing party was seriously shaken by public outrage after 
the recruit scandal came to light in 1988 
prime minister noboru takeshita and three cabinet ministers were 
forced to resign and the liberal democrats lost upper house 
elections last july for the first time in their 34year history 
liberal democrats gradually regained enough support by february 
to win a comfortable majority in national elections for the lower 
house

winter wheat production is rebounding after 
last years droughtreduced harvest in the great plains the 
agriculture department said thursday 
based on field conditions as of may 1 production could be a 
nineyear high of 209 billion bushels up 44 percent from last 
years harvest of 145 billion bushels 
the departments agricultural statistics board said the average 
yield based on current indications was estimated at 411 bushels 
per acre compared with 351 bushels last year 
in kansas for example winter wheat production was estimated at 
4602 million bushels more than double the shriveled 1989 harvest 
of 2136 million bushels both the acreage and average yield were 
up 
overall farmers are expected to have about 508 million acres 
of winter wheat for harvest this year up 23 percent from 415 
million in 1989 the board said in its report 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year 
it accounts for about threefourths of the us total wheat 
production the remainder is planted in the spring 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
association of wheat growers said the larger harvest will put us 
in a stockbuilding mode for some time in the future at least 
until something can be done about worldwide capacity for producing 
too much grain 
schwensen said the united states has made a real 
accomplishment by putting millions of acres of marginal land in 
the conservation reserve program which takes it out of crop 
production for 10 years he said around 11 million acres of that 
land has come from nations wheat base 
no other major producing and exporting nation has even 
attempted to take the initiatives that weve had to set aside 
marginal lands specifically from wheat production he said in a 
telephone interview 
the usdas first official estimate of 1990 production of all 
wheat will be issued july 12 with the first estimates for corn 
soybeans and some other major springplanted crops scheduled for 
aug 9 along with revised figures for wheat 
although no official estimates based on field surveys were 
included except for winter wheat department analysts in a related 
supplyanddemand report did project highly tentative 1990 
production of all wheat at more than 269 billion bushels up from 
less than 204 billion last year 
projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on 
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather 
the remainder of the growing season 
the 1990 corn harvest was projected at 81 billion bushels up 
from 753 billion harvested last year soybean production was 
projected at 1925 billion bushels virtually the same as the crop 
of 1927 billion bushels in 1989 
according to the supplyanddemand report the us wheat 
stockpile will be drained to a 15year low of 442 million bushels 
on june 1 the beginning of the new wheat marketing year but with 
the expected larger 1990 harvest the wheat stockpile could be 
rebuilt to about 765 million bushels a year from now 
the projected larger 1990 wheat harvest could put pressure on 
market prices which were indicated in the range of 290 to 330 
per bushel in 199091 compared with an estimated 371 this season 
if corn production turns out at the projected level of 81 
billion bushels it still wouldnt be quite enough to match 
domestic and export demand the report showed thus the us corn 
stockpile which may be around 133 billion bushels next fall 
could edge lower by oct 1 1991 
corn prices were projected at 225 to 265 per bushel in 
199091 compared with the current seasons forecast of 230 to 
240 per bushel 
looking at the global situation the analysis said prelminary 
indications point to larger crops in a number of countries and 
continued growth in use world wheat production is expected to be 
record large in 199091 the report said

a new york company said thursday it will begin 
testing within two years a revolutionary wireless personal 
telephone system in houston and orlando fla designed to compete 
with wired and cellular systems 
the lightweight walletsized phones will use highfrequency 
microwave signals to connect telephones over short distances such 
as in office buildings or within neighborhoods 
the new systems known as personal communications networks 
could be connected with pcns in other cities to provide nationwide 
communications pcn owners would need dial only a code to let the 
system know where they are at any time said j shelby bryan 
chairman of millicom inc a new yorkbased international cellular 
company 
shelby said a millicom subsidiary pcn america inc will 
conduct a twoyear test of the system in the texas and florida 
cities the federal communications commission on thursday approved 
the experiment 
company spokeswoman andrea van raalte said the test would begin 
sometime in the next two years 
officials at american personal communications inc earlier this 
year received fcc permission to test a similar type of phone but 
which would be unable to receive calls in the washington area the 
company has said when it hopes to begin testing next year 
because of the short range of highfrequency microwave signals 
as little as 600 feet the pcn unlike regular cellular service 
will be able to share space with other private microwave users 
this feature greatly increases the systems capacity and its 
attractiveness to businesses that may find pcns more convenient to 
use in an office building than wired systems 
a large number of users in small areas would greatly lower the 
cost of the phone units perhaps to 100 or less bryan said 
we can basically have many more subscribers per network so our 
cost per subscriber will be lower bryan said in a telephone 
interview 
officials at american personal communications told the 
washington post they hoped the phones ultimately would cost 50 to 
75 
the phones also will use much less power than cellular ones and 
should have battery lives of up to a week bryan said 
i fundamentally believe that pcns are going to be the first 
serious means of competition for local communications an atampt 
official richard b snyder was quoted as saying in thursdays 
editions of the new york times 
bryan commented 
well always have copper wire communications but i think 
its going to be viewed over time as kind of an oldfashioned 
technology i think we will be in direct competition to 
cellular 
cellular phones use a few large radio towers to transmit calls 
across what are known as cells in a metropolitan area the 
equipment automatically passes off calls as a caller in an 
automobile for instance passes from cell to cell 
the pcn system will rely on refrigeratorsized lowpower 
transmitters that will transmit across a more limited area like 
existing cellular telephones the new service will be able to 
pass off phone calls as users move from one transmitter area to 
another 
the british government already has selected three consortia to 
build nationwide pcn systems in britain millicom is one of the 
consortia service is expected to begin there by 1993 
we envision that by the turn of the century 25 percent of 
the population of england will be on some form of radio 
telephone bryan said

a diverse group of house members said thursday 
they will present a united front against agriculture subsidy 
programs that they consider anticonsumer in the 1990 farm bill 
the group led by reps richard armey rtexas and charles 
schumer dny includes liberals and conservatives who have two 
things in common none is a member of the agriculture committee and 
all believe government farm programs are too expensive 
schumer of brooklyn said many house members have been 
interested in change but havent banded together before to give 
each other support 
this year were working together said schumer though 
acknowledging they werent all interested in the same subsidy 
programs in general we have agreement that agriculture has 
gotten out of control 
rep claudine schneider rri said she opposed the wool 
subsidies while reps thomas downey dny and john porter 
rill spoke out against the sugar program 
others opposed the peanut program or any subsidy for farms with 
annual profits over 100000 
other congressman at a press conference to introduce the 
coalition were reps bill frenzel rminn dana rohrbacher 
rcalif and barney frank dmass 
armey said reps george miller dcalif thomas carper ddel 
jim bates dcalif robert torricelli dnj and sam gejdenson 
dconn also were a part of the group 
schumer said that rather than work through the agriculture 
committee the coalition decided the best strategy was to amend the 
farm bill on the floor 
committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas has acknowledged 
that the armeyschumer opposition to farm programs gained a lot of 
attention and will have some effect on the members 
he indicated however that plenty of support existed in the 
house for the work the agriculture committee is doing 
de la garza is not likely to send a bill to the floor that will 
be drastically amended said a committee staff member 
frank said the multibillion dollar farm bill was one of the 
last vestiges of the bad old days when differences were worked out 
by adding money to the budget 
he said urban lawmakers traditionally voted for farm programs 
without question in exchange for legislation they wanted for city 
dwellers 
frank said the government should save its money and let the free 
market regulate agriculture 
he called the government programs anticonsumer antitaxpayer 
and overregulated 
since the great depression of the 1930s the federal government 
has enacted laws to regulate the food supply and assure farmers 
certain prices for their crops every five years congress approves 
a farm bill that determines the way and degree in which tax dollars 
will be used to support farmers 
both the senate and house agriculture committees have been 
approving sections of the 1990 legislation for several weeks and 
are cognizant of the demands for reduced government support 
intense negotiations are under way in each committee over the 
programs that will regulate the big money crops of wheat soybeans 
corn rice and cotton 
the bush administration has said that support for those crops 
must be limited to 102 billion fiscal 1991

a computerized analytical center to help 
federal state and local law enforcement agencies combat drug money 
laundering and other financial crimes opened thursday 
the us drug trade alone is estimated to be a 100 billion 
per year business treasury secretary nicholas f brady said at a 
ceremony marking the inauguration of the financial crimes 
enforcement network 
if we are ever going to be successful in getting drugs off the 
streets of our cities we must hit the business side by taking the 
profit out of drug dealing brady said 
the treasury center will gather information from prosecutors and 
police around the country and overseas process it and try to 
identify potential targets for investigation 
center employees also will conduct research on money laundering 
and serve as a liaison between local state and federal officials 
some have talked about turf problems said william j 
bennett white house drug policy adviser here is another example 
of turf cooperation indeed turf harmony 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the paper trail that 
investigators once followed has become the electronic trail 
drug dealers are making a lot of money and theyre moving 
that money through sophisticated and complicated financial channels 
not only across state lines but across international boundaries 
he said 
we will be matching effort for effort the kind of 
sophistication the drug lords are imparting into their 
operations thornburgh said

my view is he sits down with the leaders of congress he gets 
them to agree to cut spending and as far as he is concerned he 
will agree to some kind of tax compromise nixon said thursday in 
a television interview with larry king on cable news network 
first if the congress agrees to it he doesnt have a problem 
because they are all in it together but if he doesnt get 
agreement he goes before the american people he has enormous 
popularity 
the purpose of popularity is not to hoard it its to use it 
and he can use that popularity to bring the congress along and let 
these lilylivered people come along with them 
nixon was asked how bush can overcome his readmylips 
campaign stance against raising taxes 
no problem at all he said he can say i believed at the 
time but the situation has changed and im dealing with it

the senate brushed aside a threatened veto by 
president bush and voted thursday to allow federal civil service 
and postal workers to take a more active role in partisan politics 
on a 6730 vote after eight days of debate the senate approved 
a wholesale revision of the 1939 hatch act which prohibits 29 
million government employees from participating in political 
campaigns 
the law would still prohibit federal workers from engaging in 
political activities on the job and from running for public office 
or soliciting campaign funds from the public 
but they could in their off time hold office in local state and 
national political organizations attend political conventions as 
delegates and solicit campaign funds from coworkers on behalf of 
candidates or federal employee union political action committees 
thirteen republicans joined all 54 senate democrats in passing 
the bill despite an intensive effort by the white house to prevent 
it from garnering the 67 votes it would need to override a veto 
hopefully we can sustain a veto senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas said before the vote congressional democrats 
have been unable to override any of bushs 10 vetoes in his first 
16 months in office 
a year ago the house passed by a vetoproof 29790 vote a 
broader bill that also would remove the prohibitions on running for 
public office and soliciting campaign funds from the public 
bushs senior advisers have said they would urge him to veto any 
change in the law as undermining the integrity and independence 
of the traditionally nonpartisan civil service 
the legislation was sought by federal employee and postal unions 
after the reagan administration filed hatch act charges against 
three union presidents for endorsing democrat walter mondale in the 
1984 presidential election 
before the final vote minority republicans tried to continue 
the current restrictions on employees of the irs intelligence 
agencies the justice department and the federal election 
commission 
certain critical agencies of this govrernment need to be 
beyond political involvement and not have any taint of 
politics or coercion said sen pete v domenici rnm 
his amendment to exempt all employees of those agencies from the 
looser restrictions on political involvement and also forbid all 
government workers from soliciting coworkers for campaign funds 
was defeated on a 5839 vote 
the senate did adopt on a 970 vote an amendment by dole that 
would maintain the current restrictions on the 240 employees of the 
federal election commission 
but republicans failed in several attempts to delete language 
from the bill that would allow federal workers to spend their off 
time soliciting campaign gifts from coworkers on behalf of union 
pacs 
dole called the provision a pot of gold for the democratic 
party citing statistics that 88 percent money raised and 
distributed by federal employee and postal union pacs in the 1988 
election went to democrats

congressional democrats reacted angrily 
thursday to a suggestion by chief of staff john sununu that white 
house negotiators would reject all taxincrease proposals at next 
weeks no preconditions budget summit 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater disavowed sununus 
remarks saying they did not reflect bushs views but the chief of 
staff was defended by vice president dan quayle 
house speaker thomas s foley said any more such incidents could 
threaten the success of these talks which are deemed of major 
importance in the face of growing federal deficit problems 
what john sununu was saying was that the president doesnt 
want to raise taxes quayle said in an interview with cable 
network news sununu was just simply reflecting what the 
presidents instincts are what his stated policies are 
for his part sununu said in a brief comment the point is 
that the position is as it always has been that no preconditions 
means no preconditions there is nothing that has to be in the 
agreement and nothing excluded from the agreement 
democrats reacted sharply to published accounts quoting a 
senior administration official later identified as sununu 
saying that bush would stand fast to his previous no new taxes 
pledge during budget negotiations 
the comments appeared to directly contradict earlier 
administration assurances that there were no preconditions to 
the highlevel talks to get under way tuesday 
sununus assertion raises the potential its all a political 
trap said house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
fitzwater told reporters the official was not speaking for the 
president in making such remarks 
president bush relayed the same message to foley by telephone 
assuring him that nothing was off the bargaining table at the 
budget summit fitzwater said 
however congress top democrats held a news conference to 
denounce sununus remarks 
it is a question of trust of whether or not agreements are to 
be honored of whether or not the administration is prepared to 
negotiate in good faith on this important matter said senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine reading a statement 
bearing the names of 11 democratic congressional leaders 
foley dwash said we view this incident as an extremely 
serious one because it could if repeated threaten the success of 
these talks 
bushs reaction to the report of sununus comments was that 
there are no preconditions he wanted me to reiterate that toyou 
today fitzwater told reporters 
bush proposed the summit last sunday to deal with a budget 
deficit that administration and other analysts say could be about 
to explode officials blame rising interest rates 
lowerthanexpected revenues to the treasury and a 
higherthanexpected cost of the savings and loan bailout 
white house officials say that without action the federal 
deficit for fiscal 1991 could be up to 100 billion higher than the 
64 billion shortfall allowed by law causing huge automatic cuts 
in programs throughout the government 
the official later identified as sununu was quoted in the 
washington post as saying were allowing them democrats to 
bring their good arguments for taxes to the table they were 
not persuasive last time and they are likely not to be persuasive 
again 
but if they want to come to the table and say they put tax 
increases there it is their prerogative to put them on the table 
and its our prerogative to say no and i emphasize the no 
asked about such an assertion fitzwater said thats crazy 
but the remarks caused an uproar among democrats already fearful 
of being trapped by the administration into supporting an 
electionyear tax increase 
rep richard durbin dill a member of the house democratic 
leadership said we feel were setting ourselves up for a sucker 
punch 
but rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways 
and means committee shrugged off the remarks and said he assumes 
higher taxes will be part of the negotiations unless george bush 
says again no new taxes 
speaking to the national press club rostenkowski said it was 
bush not sununu who invited congressional leaders to negotiate 
and thats encouraging 
still rostenkowski said i have no intention of moving on 
taxes until the president does i will not repeat the partisan 
warfare that marked last years budget debate he referred to 
bushs unsuccessful effort to win a reduction in taxes on capital 
gains 
panetta the house budget committee chairman said bush himself 
has to clearly state what the conditions for the talks are 
the time has come to hear from the president panetta said 
fitzwater said the presidents position is clear i am 
stating it it comes directly from him we will not prejudge 
anything that comes to the table in the budget talks 
asked how democrats could believe the white house was 
negotiating in good faith when he was saying one thing and sununu 
was quoted as saying the opposite fitzwater said i speak for 
the president its as simple as that 
asked if bush had reprimanded sununu for the remarks fitzwater 
declined to say adding there is no sense getting sidetracked on 
these sorts of things 
twenty republican senators led by sen connie mack of florida 
have sent bush a letter urging him to not renege on his read my 
lips campaign promise against new taxes 
he understands their position hes had a very strong position 
as well on taxes fitzwater said but the fact is that hes got 
to try to solve the deficit problem and hes got to try to keep the 
economy growing and he wants to continue economic growth and thats 
a bigger problem that requires some long term thinking and requires 
the political courage to take leadership now

residents of wisconsin illinois and michigan residents traded 
swimsuits and garden hoes for parkas and snow shovels thursday as 
freak storm brought back winter in may 
the spring shocker was worst in wisconsin where snowfall up to 
8 inches shattered records for late season snow 
some communities had to reassemble snowplows that had been 
stored for the season residents who broke out the lawn furniture 
and headed for the beach when tempeatures reached the 70s and 80s 
just two days before dug their coats out of mothballs 
we expect anything up here said police officer ron 
michelson in marquette on michigans upper peninsula it was up 
in the 80s for a while and i had my lounge out its still sitting 
on the porch getting full of snow 
the wisconsin snowstorm accompanied by sleet and wind up to 30 
mph was blamed for hundreds of accidents and two traffic deaths 
powerlines downed by wind or accumulated ice caused temporary 
blackouts in more than 40000 homes 
the storm was caused by a lowpressure system that sucked cold 
air down from canada and moisture up from the south according to 
the national weather service 
weather service specialist edmond lowe said the snowfall while 
not the latest in wisconsin history was a record for spring 
surpassing the 5 inches recorded april 30 1907 the latest snow 
ever to fall in spring in wisconsin was may 31 1889 
in hartford a city of 7000 about 30 miles northwest of

deeper than 6 inches milwaukee recorded 2 inches madison 3 inches 
and green bay 3 inches 
in michigan a may record of 128 inches of snow fell at 
marquette county airport but in downtown marquette 800 feet lower 
and close to lake superior only about an inch fell 
its terrible said bernice haapala in herman mich where 
4 inches of wet snow covered the ground my tulips were blooming 
and all that kind of stuff now thats why a person gets 
depressed 
in waukesha county west of milwaukee a nearblizzard during 
morning rush hour resulted in up to 100 accidents authorities 
said some 2500 bus riders were stranded when the service shut 
down 
flights at milwaukees mitchell international airport were 
delayed as runways were closed several times so slush could be 
cleared said greg hetzel assistant operations manager 
in washington county wis snowplows and salting trucks were 
hastily retrieved from storage and assembled 
were strictly playing catchup said frank scharrer the 
county highway commissioner 
the misery dipped south into illinois where more than 4 inches 
of snow fell wednesday night and thursday morning on chicagos 
northwest suburbs heavy rain brought out precautionary sandbagging 
crews along the des plaines and illinois rivers and a tornado 
toppled a silo in virden 20 miles south of springfield 
the storms eased in the afternoon and were expected to move out 
of the area overnight but that wasnt the last of the late winter 
clear skies mean temperatures can drop and frost warnings were 
posted overnight in many areas 
were having normal may weather whatever that is said 
weather service meteorologist jack cooley in michigan its 
normal for the weather to be abnormal

the three separatist baltic republics strengthened 
their solidarity thursday implementing an agricultural agreement 
that allows them to bypass moscow and weighing a plan to coordinate 
their government policies 
estonia proposed reviving a council of baltic states that was 
created in 1934 when the republics were independent it would 
include the president prime minister and foreign ministers of 
estonia latvia and lithuania said valle feldman a spokesman for 
the estonian foreign ministry 
estonian president arnold ruutel invited presidents vytautas 
landsbergis of lithuania and anatoly gorbunov of latvia to sign an 
agreement with him in tallinn on saturday they did not respond 
immediately 
the three governments also implemented an agreement for the 
direct exchange of agricultural supplies and products bypassing 
the central soviet ministries and trade organizations that usually 
handle such transactions the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
last month the republics signed a package of agreements to 
integrate their economies and the deals are being implemented in 
stages 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev opposes immediate 
independence for the baltic republics which were forcibly annexed 
by the soviet union in 1940 
the proposed council of baltic states would further integrate 
the republics politically but would not constitute a confederation 
said leivi sher spokesman for estonias supreme council or 
parliament it could make nonbinding recommendations on the three 
governments 
so far its just an estonian proposal he said adding that 
the parliaments executive committee approved the measure 
it was unclear whether latvia and lithuania would agree to the 
proposal lithuanian spokesmen said no agreement was likely before 
the return to vilnius next week of lithuanian prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene she was in paris as part of a tour of western 
capitals 
mrs prunskiene told reporters in paris that lithuanian 
officials want to negotiate their independence with moscow 
according to a formula proposed by french president francois 
mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl they suggested 
that lithuania temporarily suspend laws implementing the 
declaration of independence enacted march 11 
the establishment of direct agricultural exchanges and the 
proposed council of baltic states signal a determination by the 
three republics to overcome kremlin opposition to their separatist 
aspirations 
the agricultural agreement which entered into effect today 
provides that each of the three ministries must have permanent 
representatives in the other baltic republics who will perform the 
functions of coordinators and assistants in joint efforts to 
resolve agricultural issues tass reported 
gorbachev imposed economic sanctions against lithuania after the 
republic declared its independence on may 4 latvia declared its 
independence after an unspecified transition period and gorbachev 
is studying that action according to latvian officials 
on tuesday estonia dropped the symbols of soviet power 
changing its flag and name invoked sections of the 1938 
constitution that declared independence and proclaimed solidarity 
with latvia and lithuania 
gorbachev has not responded to the estonian actions 
his embargo of oil and natural gas has taken its toll in 
lithuania private automobile owners in lithuania have been 
restricted to about seven gallons of gasoline per month and 
rations for the month of may already have been exhausted according 
to the unofficial postfactum information agency in moscow it said 
rations might be reduced further in june as supplies dwindle 
further 
also on thursday 
lithuanias parliament formally took control of the republics 
radio and television under soviet law the broadcasting system 
reported to both the vilnius government and moscow however 
lithuanians have effectively controlled their own broadcasting for 
some time 
shortly after declaring independence the republic ordered one 
of the three russianlanguage channels to switch to polish 
television for the benefit of the 7 percent of lithuanias 
population that is ethnically polish 
estonian prime minister edgar savisaar will meet friday with 
soviet defense minister dmitri yazov to discuss the spring military 
draft most estonian youths up for the draft took advantage of a 
new estonian law allowing them to perform alternative service at 
home to the fury of the soviet military 
the newsletter interfax an affiliate of moscow radio reported 
that 1500 young men chose alternative service and only 800 signed 
up at draft offices

congressional backers of a proposal to 
standardize state productliability laws charged thursday that 
consumer groups have tried to thwart the legislation through a 
campaign to trash anybody who stands in their way 
the legislation backed by the bush administration and business 
representatives would create a uniform federal standard for 
imposing punitive damages in lawsuits involving products that cause 
death or serious injury 
consumer groups have said the bill would unduly limit peoples 
ability to collect for deaths and injuries that result from 
industry negligence or irresponsibility 
backers of the legislation argue that variations in liability 
laws from state to state offer potentially limitless damages and 
hinder product development and american competitiveness 
the accusations against consumer groups came as linda lipsen 
legislative counselor for consumers union outlined what she said 
were misrepresentations given at previous hearings by the senate 
commerce committees consumer subcommittee into the safety of a 
nevermarketed substitute for asbestos that was manufactured by the 
missouribased monsanto co 
the administration and the manufacturing community have 
asserted before you that the product liability system prevented a 
totally safe substitute for asbestos calcium sodium metaphosphate 
from being marketed said lipsen beginning her testimony 
before the panel 
sen john danforth rmo interrupted lipsen noting that she 
had not included her comments about monsanto or its product in the 
21page written testimony she submitted to the panel for review 
before thursdays hearing 
i think you wanted to catch people unawares said danforth 
it is a sneak attack it is a sneaky sneaky move on your part 
he added to the applause of many spectators 
lipsen responded it is not our normal course of business to 
impugn even indirectly members of this administration or 
witnesses before you 
lipsen was speaking on behalf of four organizations cu the 
consumer federation of america public citizen and the public 
interest research group 
the last two groups were founded by noted consumer advocate 
ralph nader consumers union is the nonprofit membership group that 
publishes consumer reports magazine 
asbestos is a fireretardant fiber that was used widely in 
building construction until it was found to cause cancer 
i think this is very typical of the nader organizations to 
trash people trash politicians trash businesses trash anybody 
who stands in their way added danforth 
nader who was not present at the hearing was again mentioned 
by sen jay rockefeller dwva who angrily noted an open letter 
to him from the consumer advocate the letter which questioned 
rockefellers integrity was sent to newspapers in west virginia 
according to rockefeller naders letter asked why are you 
spending your time huddled in washington with corporate lobbyists 
many of whom finance your campaign gambling with the lives and 
safety of millions of people by taking away rights to seek relief 
by supporting federal product liability law 
completing her statement lipsen told the panel it had not been 
informed in previous testimony about a 1986 review by the 
environmental protection agency that said there was reason to 
believe the asbestos substitute also could be carcinogenic 
the bill would place a twoyear limit on most product liability 
claims with the exception of a 25year limit on workers injury 
claims 
the measure also would allow separate trials or settlements of 
damage claims when a suit involves more than one company firms 
would pay damages in proportion of their responsibility for harm 
the legislation would exempt from punitive damages manufacturers 
whose products had received premarket approval from the food and 
drug administration or the federal aviation administration 
asked later about the charges levied by backers of the bill 
nader dismissed the criticisms as a side show designed to

the senate on thursday sent president bush a 
bill authorizing the governments subsidy of amtrak rail passenger 
service through the white house has threatened a veto 
the housesenate compromise approved by voice vote envisions 
more than 2 billion in federal money going to the railroad over 
the threeyear period between last oct 1 and sept 30 1992 
the actual dollar amount will be determined as part of congress 
annual appropriations process 
bush administration officials have said they would recommend a 
veto of the bill because of the high cost which it said amounts to 
about 29 a passenger and because of a provision which would 
require interstate commerce commission approval of railroad 
takeovers by nonrailroad companies

a 3 million study aimed at breaking the 
grip of poverty on the mississippi delta aims to shift government 
spending from welfare to creating jobs a commission member said 
thursday 
a report on the study prepared during the past 18 months by the 
lower mississippi delta commission will be presented to congress 
on monday 
a summary of the report shows that the commission will offer 
more than 400 recommendations that include establishing a regional 
bank for loans to area businesses improving highways and schools 
upgrading regional health care and attracting more tourists the 
commercial appeal reported thursday 
the commissions study area took in 219 counties in illinois 
missouri kentucky tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana 
the region where 209 percent of the residents live below the 
federal poverty level is one of the poorest in the country and has 
one of the highest rates for infant deaths 
former rep ed jones a commission member from tennessee said 
he doubted the report would have many immediate practical effects 
but its benefit over the long run could be substantial 
congress will slowly try to do something about it but it 
will take time jones said from his home in yorkville the 
report is going to have to be researched by the committees that 
prepare the laws for congress a lot of it will be knocked out no 
doubt about it 
jones a democrat who represented rural northwestern tennessee 
for 29 years said the report tries to refocus government spending 
because commissioners know that new federal and state spending will 
be hard to come by 
theres no new money we know that but theres money that can 
be redirected he said thirty to 40 percent of the people in 
the delta region are on food stamps or some sort of welfare if you 
could reduce that by half look at the amount of money you would 
save 
the commission financed by a 3 million appropriation from 
congress is scheduled to disband sept 30 but the report suggests 
that states in the region create a successor organization to work 
as advocate for the delta initiatives 
not only must the federal government find new ways to invest 
in the lower mississippi deltas future but other levels of 
government the private sector civic and nonprofit organizations 
must step forward the reports summary said 
among its recommendations the report calls for a regional 
development bank and communitybased loan pools using federal 
state and private funds an agriculture center in memphis to help 
educate delta farmers on the latest farm technology the addition 
of 400000 housing units for lowincome delta residents by the year 
2001 federal funding for magnet schools in each delta state a 
residential high school specializing in math and science and an 
agency to promoting tourism throughout the region 
rep mike espy dmiss said lawmakers from the region have 
formed the lower mississippi delta congressional working group to 
press their colleagues to deal with the commissions report 
weve got to get off to a fast start espy said this is 
the road map

americans took out 26 billion more in 
consumer credit than they paid off in march as borrowing to buy 
automobiles rebounded from february the government said thursday 
the federal reserve said consumer credit increased at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 44 percent up from a scant 01 
percent rise in february that represented a sharp revision from 
the 57 percent rate estimated earlier reported for february and 
made the month the weakest in a year 
credit grew at a 37 percent annual rate in january rather than 
the earlier estimate of 64 percent the fed said 
with the dampening of economic growth this year consumers are 
borrowing less the first quarter annualized rate of 27 percent 
compares with 76 percent for all of 1989 and 85 percent for 1988 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group a washington 
consulting firm said the economy has been expanding for so long 
7 years that consumers have less appetite for big ticket 
items that are purchased with loans 
i think there also has been an erosion of consumer confidence 
people are worried they read in the paper that the 
unemployment rate went up or that interest rates are going up 
people pay attention she said 
automobile loans in march advanced 18 billion a 75 percent 
annual rate after falling at a 52 percent rate in february and 
advancing at only a 17 percent rate in january 
credit card debt rose by 2 billion or a 121 percent annual 
rate in march up from a 47 percent rate a month earlier 
bank thrift and credit union loans not secured by real estate 
were down 12 billion a 72 percent rate after climbing at a 3 
percent rate in february 
borrowing for mobile homes rose 17 million a scant 09 percent 
annual rate after rising at a 17 percent rate 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of march 
at 7215 billion

the bush administration dropped its opposition 
to requiring double hulls on oil tankers thursday announcing 
support for a bill to require them on new vessels 
transportation secretary samuel skinner outlined the new 
administration position which calls for some exemptions to the 
requirement in a letter to a housesenate conference committee 
mulling over two versions of oil pollution legislation 
skinner previously opposed a house version of the bill that 
would mandate double hulls on all tankers within 15 years and said 
the administration preferred a senate bill which gave the secretary 
some discretion to require them on new vessels 
the oil industry complained that the costly retrofitting of 
existing tankers would take too many out of service 
the legislation was prompted by concern over last years alaskan 
oil spill from the singlehull exxon valdez which ran into a rock 
ledge in prince william sound 
opponents of mandatory double hulls have said the 10 million 
gallon exxon valdez spill probably would have occurred anyway and 
might even have been worse with a double hull because the ship 
could have capsized and lost all its cargo instead of 10 percent of 
it 
the new proposal would apply to tankers flying the us flag and 
foreign tankers serving us ports many foreignflag tankers are 
owned by us oil companies who register their ships under the 
flags of panama liberia and other flags of convenience to 
avoid us safety and wage regulations trade between us ports is 
reserved to usflagged ships 
the administration generally supports requiring double hulls 
on new construction of oceangoing tank vessels skinner said 
noting that a national academy of sciences study concluded that 
double hulls are safe and give better protection to the environment 
we believe that existing singleskin oceangoing tank vessels 
should be phased out after they are 25 years old beginning in 
the year 2000 skinner said 
he said this would give us and foreign tank owners about 10 
years to replace their older vessels 
the administration would not object to exemptions for vessels 
serving deepwater ports until 2015 he said unless an 
international standard for double hulls is adopted before then 
tank barges plying only the great lakes could also be exempted 
until 2015 skinner said 
this deadline is reasonable yet would serve as a strong 
encouragement to owners to build only doublehulled inland barges 
and great lakes tank vessels he said 
skinner said the new position was prompted by a compromise 
proposal by senators on the conference committee 
he said the administration would work with the committee to 
write a bill that will afford the greatest protection to the 
environment without disrupting oil supplies sending american 
refining jobs offshore or imposing unjustified burdens on the 
american consumer

kilauea volcano came to life again early 
thursday after a rest of just a few days officials said 
a bright red glow in the night sky over the east flank of 
kilauea signaled the resumption of the movement of molten rock at 
the surface in the area officials said 
civil defense spokesman rick agan had said that the glow 
appeared to indicate that the puu oo vent in the east rift zone 
began erupting 
but christina heliker a geologist at the us geological 
surveys hawaiian volcano observatory said later that the glow 
visible around that vent was from lava just below the surface that 
was moving to a second vent two miles away known as kupaianaha 
scientists and civil defense officials planned to fly over the 
rift zone later thursday to determine the extent of the activity 
and direction of any new flows she said 
a lot of glow usually means there are lava flows on the 
surface said heliker 
an earlier eruption at puu oo produced a lava flow that caused 
considerable destruction in the royal gardens subdivision the 
kupaianaha vent is the source of lava that destroyed more than 60 
homes in the kalapana gardens subdivision during the past six weeks 
the kupaianaha vent shut down monday but small amounts of lava 
were continuing to drain from the eightmile flow into the ocean 
next to harry k brown park at kalapana 
a total of 139 homes have been destroyed by lava flows since the 
original eruption began jan 3 1983 damage to public and private 
property has been estimated at more than 60 million

bankers complain their business would be hurt 
under a plan to offer college loans directly through student aid 
offices 
three large student aid organizations are joining to form 
collegecredit a new program designed to offer college students 
onestop shopping for assistance it will help aid officers to more 
easily package loans with other forms of assistance 
the partners in the joint venture are 
the student loan marketing association sallie mae a 
federallychartered shareholderowned company that buys student 
loans from lenders and collects the payments 
the college board a nonprofit group which administers 
financial aid for colleges and provides a common aid application 
form 
the teachers annuity associationcollege retirement equities 
fund a large pension plan for college and private school employees 
collegecredit plans to offer 150 million in loans through the 
college board starting in the 199091 school year teachers annuity 
is setting aside 50 million and other lenders will supply the 
rest sallie mae will buy the loans replenishing the money 
available for future loans all three groups will earn fee income 
in the process 
banks complain the program will skim off the cream of the 
student loan market degreegranting institutions leaving them 
loans to trade school and community college students which have a 
higher default rate 
this program would service the most profitable part of the 
student loan market leaving lenders with a higher concentration of 
higherrisk lowbalance loans to students said joe belew 
president of the consumer bankers association the trade group 
fighting the program 
this process will further drive lenders out of the loan 
programs ultimately denying thousands of lowincome students 
access to student loans he said 
bankers tried unsuccessfully to get sallie mae to drop the 
program now theyre lobbying members of congress and threatening 
to sue the organization 
by law sallie mae cannot originate student loans only buy 
them from others collegecredit is a scheme to circumvent the 
restriction belew said 
however gisela valandigham a spokeswoman for sallie mae said 
the company is only providing the collegecredit venture with the 
same sort of support and loan servicing assistance it already 
provides to banks 
she said sallie mae purchased 5 billion in student loans last 
year mostly from banks and the collegecredit program is not large 
enough to be a competitive threat 
aides to sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate 
labor subcommittee on education had expressed concern about 
collegecredit but pell said in a letter to the college board that 
his concerns had been eased after the program agreed to limit 
199091 lending 150 million

a car dealer criticized by jewish 
organizations said thursday hes reconsidering a sales program that 
offers discounts aimed at christians 
i dont want to give up my program but i dont like to step 
on anybodys toes said freddye action jackson part owner 
president and general manager of brown lincolnmercury 
hopefully we can come up with a program that satisfies 
everybody he said after his ninemonthold christian members 
buyers plan was called discriminatory the program offfers 
discounts to jews as well as christians 
jackson said he intended to meet next week with his business 
partners and separately with the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith which has called for an end to the discount program 
the washington post on thursday quoted william e schuling 
chairman of midatlantic cars inc of which brown lincolnmercury 
is the major dealership as saying he and jackson had agreed to end 
the program 
but jackson said i havent made a decision on it at all 
shuling told the newspaper no ones perfect everybody makes 
a mistake freddye is a preacher and a salesman he meant no harm 
a woman in schulings office said thursday he was unavailable 
for comment 
jackson started the cmbp last august but the uproar began 
wednesday to jacksons surprise after a local newspaper reported 
on the incentive program 
any time you talk about christianity people blow it out of 
proportion people take it negatively i dont know why he said 
wednesday 
jews may get the discounts because said jackson they believe 
in god jews are the only nonchristians who can participate in the 
program 
jackson spoke by telephone thursday to the antidefamation 
leagues david friedman and they agreed to meet early next week 
friedman said fundamentally he does not see anything wrong 
with the plan he doesnt understand why it would be divisive or 
potentially discriminatory 
jackson friedman said is a deeply committed person who sees 
this as a way of returning to the church money he has made as a 
businessman but he also sees this as a business proposition its 
been very successfl 
friedman added hes clearly not been sold on a number of the 
concepts i presented to him 
under jacksons program people who prove membership in a 
christian church or jewish synagogue may buy upscale lincoln 
automobiles for 600 over cost to the dealer and mercury cars at 
250 over cost 
ministers pay 400 over factory cost for a lincoln and 150 
extra for a mercury in addition the dealership donates to the 
church of the buyers choice 100 for a lincoln and 50 for a 
mercury 
friedman said the inclusion of jews doesnt change things one 
bit 
the central point is that the customer should never have in 
the back of his mind the message that youre going to receive 
better or worse treatment because of the color of your skin your 
sex or your religion friedman argued 
jackson who said he became deeply religious recalled that 
shortly after taking over the dealership last july he prayed for 
a way of giving something from the dealership 
he said he donates 10 percent of his personal income to the 
shiloh baptist church in landover md 
jackson said the cmbp was never intended to discriminate against 
anyone likening it to incentives for military personnel members 
of auto associations or employees of certain companies 
if youre not a member of a buyers plan you can still get 
the same discount you just have to negotiate he said 
ford motor co which builds lincolns and mercurys is staying 
clear of the matter 
the company knows about it but freddye jackson is an 
independent businessman john spelich a spokesman for 
lincolnmercury in detroit said wednesday 
ford motor co has not and would not structure any of its 
consumer incentive programs in this nature but we dont address 
those sort of things in our franchise agreement with our dealers 
spelich said 
an alexandria va attorney has said he filed a federal trade 
commission complaint against brown lincolnmercury ftc spokeswoman 
brenda mack said she could neither confirm nor deny that the agency 
had received it

attorney general dick thornburgh invited 
mexican authorities thursday to deliver more suspects accused of 
participating in the 1985 kidnapping and murder of an american drug 
agent 
the attorney general defended the actions of drug enforcement 
administration agents who last month arrested a mexican doctor 
wanted in the case after he was whisked across the border to el 
paso texas in an operation the mexican government has bitterly 
criticized 
thornburgh said the delivery of dr humberto alvarez machain 
into us custody was initiated by highranking mexican police 
officials who offered to help the united states arrest those 
accused of kidnapping and killing dea agent enrique camarena 
if they want to turn over more of the defendants who are 
awaiting trial in this case i think its probably unlikely we 
would certainly receive them and bring them to trial the 
attorney general said 
asked if he had any objection to a repeat of the operation that 
brought alvarez to us custody thornburgh said that were not 
dictators to how law enforcement operations take place in foreign 
countries 
so long as there is no conduct outside of this country by 
other persons that shocks the conscience of the court how a person 
gets here within our jurisdiction is not a material concern 
thornburgh said alluding to us court decisions that uphold the 
kidnapping of fugitives in foreign countries 
whatever actions that are carried out by mexican authorities 
in mexico are of no moment to us thornburgh said 
fourteen other suspects wanted in connection with the slaying 
including two former highranking mexican law enforcement 
officials are still in mexico the mexican government has a 
longstanding practice of not extraditing mexicans to this country 
alvarezs defense lawyer has alleged that the guadalajara 
gynecologist was kidnapped at gunpoint by four armed men and flown 
to texas aboard a private airplane 
the mexican government which accused us authorities of 
violating mexicos sovereignty demanded an explanation of the 
deas role in the arrest six people have been arrested in mexico 
in connection with the kidnapping of alvarez who is awaiting trial 
in los angeles 
mexico has also demanded the extradition of antonio garate 
bustamante a former mexican police officer living in los angeles 
who told the los angeles times that he directed the operation 
thornburgh said he ordered dea to investigate the circumstances 
of the arrest to counter alvarezs claims that he was unlawfully 
arrested by us authorities 
the attorney general who met last week with mexican 
authorities said in an era of increased cooperation its my 
view that our people regarded this in good faith as another example 
of the type of cooperation that was being extended and its not 
unique 
thornburgh reiterated that no drug enforcement administration 
agents were involved in bringing alvarez to the united 
states the first contact that dea had with him was when they took 
him into custody in el paso 
the attorney general said there was no evidence at this time 
that dea agents violated any regulations and therfore he had no 
plans to discipline anyone involved in alvarezs arrest 
discussing the subject during a breakfast interview he said 
i place the integrity and the value of the life of american 
citizens no 1 
this case has to do with the prosecution of dr alvarez 
machain an individual who is charged with using his medical 
skills to keep alive an american citizen who was being tortured so 
that he could be tortured some more thornburgh said

us defense secretary dick cheney 
and other nato military chiefs agreed thursday that battlefield 
nuclear weapons will be less important in a changing europe but 
failed to back a dutch call for a quick pullout of such arms 
the officials repeatedly emphasized that nato would continue to 
need nuclear weapons in its arsenal 
we think there will be no denuclearization of europe west 
germanys defense chief gerhard stoltenberg told german reporters 
cheney said the alliance may decide after careful study to make 
unilateral cuts in nucleartipped artillery shells mostly based in 
west germany 
thats entirely possible he told a news conference at the 
end of two days of talks by natos nuclear planning group talks in 
the kananaskis area about 50 miles west of calgary in the canadian 
rockies 
theres no need today to make that decision we did not make a 
decision here 
dutch defense minister relus ter beek had urged his fellow 
ministers in the north atlantic treaty organization to eliminate 
those weapons and challenge the soviet union to follow suit 
stoltenberg whose country is home to most of the alliances 
nuclear forces supported him 
with eastwest tensions easing nato diplomats increasingly 
believe they can safely cut back on both the artillery shells and 
shortrange nuclear missiles the landbased weapons are deployed 
to hit targets in east european countries now no longer 
adversaries 
in their final statement the ministers said we agreed that 
there is a diminishing need for nuclear systems of the shortest 
range 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner reported clear 
agreement to reduce or even eliminate nuclear artillery 
but he said a decision would be made only after a detailed study 
on the role nuclear weapons should play in the future 
the ministers welcomed president bushs decision last week to 
cancel plans to develop a more powerful version of the lance 
surfacetosurface missile and modernize 155mm artillery shells 
they supported his call for early negotiations between the 
united states and the soviet union on trimming their stockpiles of 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
nato agreed last spring to start bargaining but only after both 
sides agreed on an accord to slash tanks artillery troops and 
other nonnuclear forces in europe and began implementing that 
accord 
bush said last week he would be willing to speed up the 
timetable so nuclear negotiations could start as soon as an 
agreement was signed negotiators for nato and the warsaw pact are 
pushing to wrap up a deal this fall 
woerner said bush and other nato leaders will set out objectives 
for the negotiations at a summit which he announced will be held 
july 56 in london 
the alliance has a limited arsenal of landbased nuclear weapons 
there are 88 lance launchers with some 700 nuclear warheads 
according to analysts the missile expected to be obsolete in 
1995 has a maximum range of about 75 miles 
the warsaw pact has a 12to1 advantage in shortrange 
launchers according to nato estimates 
the west has about 1500 nuclear artillery shells there are no 
estimates on the soviet arsenal although analysts say the kremlin 
has tended to rely more on missiles than on artillery 
the defense ministers urged moscow to carry out substantial 
reductions in theater nuclear missiles 
under the planning nato would rely more on airlaunched nuclear 
weapons the united states is developing a tactical airtosurface 
missile known as the tasm to replace gravity bombs it would be 
launched from fighter aircraft capable of firing both conventional 
and nuclear weapons 
woerner said the tasm likely to be highly controversial in 
western europe was not discussed at this meeting 
but he said dualcapable aircraft will acquire greater 
importance as shorter range systems are phased out without 
replacement 
britains defense chief tom king said the alliance must make 
sure its nuclear deterrence is credible which means its got to 
work which means that if necessary it has to be modernized 
the ministers hold nuclear strategy sessions twice a year 
all 16 nations except france attend the sessions france is 
not part of natos joint military command iceland which has no 
armed forces attends as an observer

iraq on thursday repeated its claim that 
it legally imported electronic capacitors from the united states 
for a university project american officials say the devices can be 
used as nuclear bomb triggers 
a spokesman for iraqs foreign ministry said some of the 
capacitors displayed by president saddam hussein during a tuesday 
speech were imported from the united states in 1988 by the 
university of technology in a legal manner and in conformity with 
us regulations 
the anonymous spokesman quoted by the official iraqi news 
agency in a dispatch monitored in cyprus said the capacitors were 
imported solely for scientific research 
the state department said wednesday it was asking iraq for 
urgent clarification of saddams earlier claim that his country 
had acquired the devices 
we are certainly interested in knowing where these capacitors 
came from and what their iraqs intentions are said richard 
boucher state departments deputy spokesman 
we have not authorized the sale to iraq of any capacitors that 
would be useful in a nuclear military program boucher said 
adding that the export of such devices to iraq would violate us 
law 
he said the us ambassador to iraq april gillespie has 
asked for urgent clarification of saddam husseins comments 
saddam asserted on tuesday that iraq circumvented a us export 
ban to obtain the devices and that scientists at the ministry of 
industry and military industrialization had succeeded in producing 
two similar devices 
the iraqi president denied however that the devices were 
intended as nuclear triggers he said they are electrical 
capacitors for use in research 
saddam said the iraqimade devices were completed in march five 
days after british authorities seized a consignment of 40 usmade 
capacitors at heathrow airport near london

the first child witness in the retrial of the 
mcmartin preschool molestation case tearfully resisted testifying 
thursday but she was persuaded by prosecutors and her parents to 
go on 
the 11yearold girl then pleaded memory lapses and ended her 
testimony on an inconclusive note saying she couldnt remember if 
she was sexually assaulted by defendant raymond buckey when she 
attended nursery school 
i dont remember if it happened or not she said when asked 
if buckey touched her sexually 
to the final crossexamination question about whether she was 
sodomized she answered i dont remember 
the first mcmartin preschool trial the longest and costliest 
criminal proceeding in us history ended in january when buckey 
was acquitted of 40 counts of molestation at the familyowned 
school in manhattan beach his mother peggy mcmartin buckey was 
acquitted of 12 charges 
the jury however deadlocked on 13 counts against raymond 
buckey and the district attorney decided to retry him on eight of 
those charges involving three children 
the girl who testified thursday did not appear at the first 
trial and the jury deadlocked 111 for acquittal on the charges 
which involved her 
the child witness offered one answer that seemed to conflict 
with her earlier testimony that buckey neither raped nor sodomized 
her 
the response came after a prosecutor read from grand jury and 
preliminary hearing transcripts of testimony offered by the girl 
six years ago 
i dont recall but i remember it did happen the girl said 
when asked whether she was sexually hurt by buckey 
the prosecutor asked no further questions to clarify the answer 
deputy district attorney pam ferrero read sections of the 
transcript of a 1984 hearing in which the girl used anatomically 
explicit dolls to show that she had been raped and sodomized 
the youngster said repeatedly she couldnt remember giving any 
of that testimony nor whether any of the events related happened 
it was only at the end of the long series of readings that she 
appeared to change her mind 
during questioning by buckeys attorney danny davis she said 
she also didnt remember testifying that she was taken to a farm 
where she saw a pig killed with a knife 
i cant remember she said 
a pig killed with a knife would be pretty important to you 
asked davis 
yes responded the girl 
knowing yourself would that be something you would forget 
he asked 
i really cant remember that she said 
nor could she remember that in 1984 she described a woman 
teacher as lying on top of her nude and women teachers playing 
naked games 
i cant remember she answered repeatedly 
charges against five women teachers stemming in part from those 
allegations were dismissed after the preliminary hearing for lack 
of evidence 
ms ferrero told superior court judge stanley weisberg that the 
girls parents called her wednesday night saying the child was 
extremely reluctant to return for more questioning but the 
parents agreed to bring her anyway 
ms ferrero said the girl expressed the same desire not to 
testify when she arrived at court but was trying to be cheerful 
and agreed to cooperate 
as buckeys attorney began asking intimate questions about her 
body she suddenly announced may i be excused i have a stomach 
ache 
minutes later she was observed in the hallway sobbing in her 
fathers arms as he tried to comfort her 
after and hours recess the child returned to the witness 
stand her father was allowed to stand next to her and she clutched 
a large stuffed toy snake but during her testimony the father 
developed a nosebleed and had to leave 
oh god the girl exclaimed as he left her mother replaced 
him standing next to the girl for the balance of her testimony

us broadcast magnate ted turner said thursday 
that the chinese government felt forced to call in troops last year 
to put an end to a massive prodemocracy movement 
he also remarked that the hudnreds of thousands of students who 
occupied central beijings tiananmen square for weeks were 
breaking the law 
turner owner of the cable news network criticized the united 
states in a speech to foreign journalists for what he said was us 
interference in the affairs of other nations 
the thing that drives me most crazy and makes me most 
embarrassed is the fact that our leaders feel they have the right 
to interfere in the affairs of other countries and tell them what 
to do he said 
i personally dont feel thats done a bit of good 
turner was asked what he felt the us response should have been 
to chinas violent crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators on june 
34 which left hundreds dead and thousands wounded in the streets 
after the crackdown the united states banned highlevel 
contacts imposed economic sanctions allowed chinese students in 
the united states to overstay their visas and criticized china for 
human rights abuses beijing has repeatedly accused washington of 
interfering in chinas internal affairs 
turner said whatever we are trying to accomplish we would 
accomplish more by saying that a tragedy occurred and that we 
bleed for the students as well as for those in government and the 
soldiers who felt forced to take that action 
you catch more flies with honey 
turners cnn played an important role in showing the world the 
events of last spring when masses of students intellectuals and 
workers took to the streets every day for seven weeks demanding 
political reforms and an end to corruption in government 
when the army was called in world viewers watched tv film of 
bloodied victims being rushed to hospitals on flatbed tricycles 
columns of army tanks on beijings changan avenue and a tank set 
afire by furious students blazing in the shadow of the goddess of 
democracy erected in the square days before 
turner is in beijing for a meeting of the better world society 
a washingtonbased group of which he is founder and chairman 
on friday turner and the societys board of directors are to

walker percy whose deeply humane novels 
and essays made him a unique voice in american letters died of 
cancer thursday at his home he would have been 75 on monday 
percys first novel the moviegoer won him the national 
book award in 1962 and set the themes that would occupy him for his 
entire career modern malaise in the new south and the tenuous 
often outlandishly comic hope for human connection 
his best friend and fellow author shelby foote was in covington 
at the time of percys death at his home here on the banks of the 
bogue falaya river across lake pontchatrain from new orleans 
in jackson miss author eudora welty said im very grieved 
and very very hurt for all his family his friendship meant a lot 
to me and his work meant a great deal to me too 
services will be saturday at st josephs abbey near covington 
after moviegoer percys novels included the last 
gentleman 1966 love in the ruins 1971 lancelot 
1977 the second coming 1980 and the thanatos syndrome 
1987 
once described by critic alfred kazin as the satiric 
dostoyevsky of the bayou percy claimed to have been influenced 
more by the european existentialists especially kierkegaard than 
by fellow southerners he peddled his 1983 lost in the cosmos 
as the last selfhelp book and set out to explain why it is 
that man is the only alien creature as far as we know in the 
entire planet 
his other major piece of nonfiction was the message in the 
bottle 1975 essays on the philosophy of language 
percy revealed his thoughts in the mid50s as he contemplated 
his future after two failed novels it crossed my mind what if i 
did something that american writers never do which seems to be the 
custom in france namely that when someone writes about ideas 
they can translate the same ideas to fiction and plays so it 
just occurred to me why not take these ideas id been trying to 
write about in psychiatry and philosophy and translate them into 
a fictional setting in new orleans where i was living 
all six of his novels send uppermiddleclass southern heroes 
out in hot pursuit of those ideas 
born in birmingham ala percy was 11 when his lawyer father 
killed himself two years later his mother was killed in an 
automobile accident he and his two brothers went to greenville 
miss to live with uncle will william alexander percy his 
fathers cousin 
uncle will was the author of lanterns on the levee the 
classic treatise on the best of the old south a famed world war i 
infantry officer poet politician lawyer and planter he 
presided over a bachelor household that was a teeming crossroads of 
southern culture it was visited regularly by other poets 
politicians psychiatrists sociologists black preachers folk 
singers itinerant harmonica players percy has written the 
young ward found him the most extraordinary man i have ever 
known 
percy graduated from university of north carolina in chemistry 
and got a medical degree from columbia university in 1941 the next 
year working as a pathologist at bellevue hospital in new york 
city he caught pulmonary tuberculosis while performing autopsies 
on derelicts 
ive often said that getting a light case of tb was the best 
thing that couldve happened to me it gave me a period of enforced 
idleness said percy who spent his three years of recovery 
reading voraciously 
by the time he was well he had turned to a life of writing 
inheritance allowed him to move to new orleans and marry he 
converted to roman catholicism in 1950 he settled in covington 
with uncle wills desk in his study he raised two daughters and 
became a grandfather 
between his recovery and the publication of the moviegoer 
are 20 years that percy joked about not remembering what he did 
with 
during those apprentice years he wrote two failed novels and 
numerous articles on language and psychiatry i felt more at 
home on the psychiatric ward than anywhere else maybe it takes 
one to know one 
both his religious conversion and three years of freudian 
psychoanalysis during medical school played an integral role in his 
writing one books subtitle is the adventures of a bad catholic 
at a time near the end of the world percy won the prestigious 
campion award in 1986 from the catholic book club despite 
downplaying the role of the church in his work 
he insisted he was not a catholic writer except that his writing 
is informed by the judeochristian view of man but thats about 
it 
named by pope john paul ii as the only american on the 
pontifical council for culture percy said i understand it only 
requires one trip a year to rome i do well just to get to new 
orleans 
the seclusion of covington served him well he often gave credit 
to his original presbyterian work ethic for the discipline and 
steadiness he brought to his work mornings by the bayou he wrote 
lefthanded in a threering binder afternoons he often typed 
what hed written he said he had no terrors he had no writers 
block 
but he found it hard work he could describe the maddening 
frustration he claimed no secrets or solutions he told one 
interviewer its a question of being so pitiful god takes pity 
on you looks down and says hes done for lets let him have a 
couple of good sentences 
its a strange abject littleunderstood profession 
he is survived by his wife mary bernice two daughters mary

canadian police seized 
about 800000 in drugs and cash on strifetorn mohawk territory 
thursday and some indians complained of rampant drug smuggling by 
the reservations gambling supporters 
authorities said however that the raid was not connected to a 
violencefilled struggle over gambling rights on the reservation 
about 100 officers led by ontario provincial police seized the 
cocaine and marijuana from homes at cornwall island on the st 
regis indian reservation and in nearby cornwall ontario said opp 
spokesman peter west 
the four pounds of cocaine and about a halfpound of marijuana 
was worth nearly 1 million in canadian dollars or 800000 in 
us dollars west said 
he said 21 people were charged with drug and weapons counts 
under canadian law while 16 more were being sought police said 
about half of the suspects lived on the reservation which 
straddles the uscanadian border 
the 6 am raid came after a 14month undercover investigation 
by ontario and quebec police the royal canadian mounted police and 
new york state troopers west said 
twelve guns were seized including at least three automatic 
rifles police also seized about 32000 cash in us dollars 
reservation violence had been quelled since hundreds of new york 
and canadian police swarmed onto the mohawk land may 1 when two 
indians were shot to death in a 10monthold casino gambling feud 
the calm and the heavy police presence gave authorities the 
opportunity to make the arrests safely west said 
we figured it was better to do it now rather than waiting for 
it to quiet down and us pulling our people off he said we 
figured we had the resources there now 
mohawks who resent the police presence said authorities used 
excessive force in making the arrests 
pat martin who runs a clothing store on the reservation said 
police went to her daughters and nieces homes by mistake 
my niece is all bruised up martin said they got her up 
out of bed and made her run outside in just her nighty 
broken glass was strewn around the living room at the home of 
elvis thompson where police smashed the door to arrest him said 
thompsons girlfriend amanda adams 
police said they knocked but we got up and didnt get halfway 
to the door before they broke it down adams said 
three of thompsons brothers and two cousins also were arrested 
she said 
some tribal leaders say drug smuggling is widespread among 
gambling supporters on the 28000acre reservation where eight 
casinos and bingo halls operate on the us side all but one of 
the gambling halls has been closed since police took over the 
reservation 
harold tarbell head chief of the tribal council that governs 
the us side of the reservation said drugs prostitution and 
other crime associated with gambling is rampant 
we need the support of outside police forces to remove the 
criminal element from the reservation tarbell said in a 
statement after the raid 
tarbell who opposes gambling and the other two us chiefs 
wednesday asked gov mario cuomo to leave state police on the 
reservation until a reservation police force can be created to 
patrol the us sector 
gambling supporters call the police an invading army that is 
violating the reservations sovereignty

a study indicating there are nearly 22 
million hardcore cocaine addicts in the united states proves the 
administration has adopted the wrong strategy in the drug war the 
chairman of the senate judiciary committee said thursday 
this news is as alarming as it is tragic sen joseph r 
biden ddel said at a news conference 
biden released a report prepared by his committee that indicated 
the number of hardcore addicts was more than double an earlier 
estimate by the national institute of drug abuse 
william bennett director of the office of national drug control 
policy called bidens statement ridiculous and said it was 
designed to provide ammunition for next falls congressional 
elections 
the administration bennett said has assumed from the outset of 
the drug war that there are about 4 million hardcore addicts and 
that the national drug strategy is working 
after being at odds in separate interviews throughout the day 
biden and bennett clashed thursday night on the public broadcasting 
system show the macneillehrer newshour 
bennett told biden sharply that you are trying to discredit 
our policy and we think this is just a bit disingenous 
i dont like this rhetoric bill biden shot back i dont 
like these cheap shots about being disingenuous 
nearly one of every 100 americans is a weekly cocaine user and 
some areas of the united states have extraordinarily high 
concentrations of addicts according to the report the study 
defined a hardcore user as someone who uses cocaine once a week 
one of every 40 people in new york state uses cocaine at least 
once a week the study said the nations capital has the highest 
per capita rate 329 hardcore users among every 1000 washington 
residents according to the report 
biden said an an earlier estimate of 862000 us addicts made 
by the national institute of drug abuse was far too low 
the judiciary committee findings prepared under the supervision 
of mark ar kleiman of the kennedy school of government at 
harvard underscored a dispute between biden and a number of other 
lawmakers and the administration about whether to aim the thrust of 
the drug war against hardcore or casual users 
biden has said hardcore users should be the primary target 
while bennett has advocated efforts directed mainly at stemming 
casual cocaine use 
our consciences demand that we act our pocketbooks command 
that we do so and our safety demands that it be done immediately 
biden said unveiling a 3 billion drugfighting plan that includes 
stepped up research to find new treatments and doubling 
crimefighting grants to 900 million a year 
dr edgar adams of the national institute of drug abuse 
described the 37page report hardcore cocaine addicts 
measuring and fighting the epidemic as a good attempt to look 
at what is a very complex problem 
adams cautioned that it might be hard to figure the margin of 
error in the senate figures but praised the study because it 
restates the fact that drug abuse is a very serious problem 
the report said that only one out of 10 hardcore addicts 
receives drug treatment and that most who are arrested are quickly 
back out on the streets 
bennett said in a telephone interview that he saw no way in 
which the report contributed to the war against drugs and was 
scornful of its claim that the government had undercounted 
this is ridiculous bennett said what official estimate 
is he talking about there is no official estimate in the national 
drug control strategy we use a number larger than the one he is 
using we use 4 million 
adams said homeless invididuals were not counted in the the nida 
study 
he said the institute maintained a 95 percent confidence level 
for its estimate of 862000 hardcore addicts in households 
the committee report said 15 million hardcore cocaine addicts 
were arrested annually and represent about 20 percent of arrestees 
nationwide 
this suggest that cocaine is a major cause of crime in the 
united states it said 
the report estimated that new york state had the most hardcore 
addicts 434000 followed by california 325000 texas 144000 
illinois 142000 and florida 93000

the treasury department said thursday it had 
agreed to let bell atlantic corp and a subsidiary chesapeake and 
potomac telephone co bid on government contracts again 
the department had suspended bell atlantic and campp on april 3 
from contracting with the executive branch on the grounds the 
companies had made a material misrepresentation in competing for 
the contract in january to provide a new digital telephone system 
for treasury offices in the washington area 
we came to an agreement with them to lift the nocontracting 
order said treasury spokesman art siddon he would not elaborate 
on what the agreement was or what the misrepresentation been 
bell atlantic said it has since submitted information in 
support of its position that it did not misrepresent any fact to 
treasury 
treasury has agreed to terminate the suspension and all 
related administrative action and bell atlantic has agreed to 
reemphasize to its employees and to the employees of its 
subsidiaries the need to verify all information provided to the 
government including information supplied by subcontractors 
bell atlantic spokesman ken pitt said confusion arose over the 
type of phones the company was offering he said the subcontracting 
equipment manufacturer northern telecom had several versions of 
the phone being offered all carrying the same model number 
treasury alleged we were offering one set but really were 
offering another pitt said we submitted the manufacturers 
documentation but the manufacturers documentation had not kept 
pace with its market offerings 
siddon said bell atlantic did not lose any treasury business 
during the suspension 
the digital phone system contract at treasury is valued at 
between 60 million and 100 million treasury twice has awarded 
the contract to the american telephone and telegraph co and bell 
atlantic won appeals to reopen the bidding 
pitt said he did not know if bell atlantic was still in the 
running for the contract

thirtyfour tombs at a jewish cemetery were 
desecrated by vandals and the body of an elderly man was dug up 
and impaled on an umbrella authorities said thursday 
leaders across the political spectrum reacted with outrage at 
the desecration one of the worst such incidents ever in france it 
occurred two days after a nationwide telecast of a threehour 
documentary about nazi germany and the holocaust 
interior minister pierre joxe said several tombs in the 
southcentral town of carpentras were left in conditions so 
abominable that one cant describe them without embarrassment he 
traveled to the town to inspect the site 
i learned with horror of this criminal act president 
francois mitterrand said in a telegram to freddy haddad a jewish 
leader in carpentras 
mitterrand later went to the paris home of frances chief rabbi 
joseph sitruk to express his distress and solidarity 
ive come as one does for a family in mourning mitterrand 
said 
sitruk said a civilization that doesnt respect the dead is 
headed toward destruction of the living 
police said the body of an 81yearold man who died about two 
weeks ago was found impaled on an umbrella when the desecration was 
discovered early thursday grave markers were knocked over and 
flower pots were trampled but no graffiti were found 
it is unimaginable that such deeds are possible in france 
said joxe 
jean kahn leader of a national coalition of jewish groups said 
the desecration came at a time when racial hatred was being 
encouraged by those who promote antisemitic rhetoric and fascist 
themes 
jeanmarie le pen whose extremeright national front party has 
been accused of condoning antisemitism condemned the desecration 
as barbaric behavior 
no one claimed responsibility for the desecration and no 
arrests were reported 
carpentras with a population of about 26000 is 60 miles north 
of marseille its mayor jeanclaude andrieu described it as a 
quiet town in which the jewish community lived harmoniously 
several incidents of vandalism have occurred at jewish 
cemeteries in recent years most recently when antisemitic slogans 
were scrawled on tombs near paris late last year 
in los angeles rabbi marvin hier head of the simon wiesenthal 
center condemned the desecration as a despicable act that stains 
the name of humanity it shows that in the heart of western 
civilization there are those against us who given the opportunity 
would operate once again the gas chambers of auschwitz

israeli officials on thursday criticized the 
united states for creating an artificial storm over jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories 
foreign minister moshe arens said he was concerned by reports 
the bush administration was coordinating with arab states in 
drafting a un resolution opposing the settlement of soviet jews 
in the occupied territories 
i am troubled by the activity of the united states when the 
arab countries raise in the un security council the issue of 
immigration from the soviet union arens said on israel radio 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said recent israeli moves to build settlements in the occupied 
territories had raised some resentment in the united states 
but he added we hope that this artificial storm will be over 
very soon 
arens summoned us ambassador william brown to the foreign 
ministry wednesday night to protest the us efforts to formulate 
the un resolution 
he said the move encouraged the arab attack on the right of 
jews to immigrate to israel 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
said the united states strongly supported the immigration to israel 
we want to see immigration take place and will oppose efforts 
by anyone to block it tutwiler said 
but she added the government of israel is well aware of our 
concern that soviet jews not be encouraged to move into the 
occupied territories 
a key paragraph of the working draft composed by nonaligned and 
arab states claims settlements in the occupied territories are in 
violation of international law a stronger wording than the us 
position that contends settlements are an obstacle to peacemaking 
israeli officials said there was no policy of settling soviet 
immigrants in occupied lands and no basis to suggest settlements 
were illegal under conventions governing the conduct of occupying 
powers 
other hardline sections of the twopage document demanded the 
right of return for palestinian exiles impartial protection 
for palestinian civilians and a halt in aid that can be used for 
settlements 
the draft grew out of a march call by the soviet union for a 
debate on the settlement of soviet jews in the occupied territories 
a un vote on the settlement resolution scheduled for 
thursday was postponed with no new date set 
israeli officials said the united states should veto the 
resolution because it is part of political warfare being waged 
by arabs who were opposed to any immigration to israel 
they argued western states could not support the resolution 
without violating their stand in support of freedom of movement 
in the past the united states has vetoed most antiisrael 
resolutions but officials said this time un ambassador thomas r 
pickering has been seeking a compromise with arab states he 
proposed various changes earlier this week to soften the hardline 
sections but details were not available 
theres no doubt that at this moment we are going through a 
period of tension with the united states arens said 
despite the concerns shamirs caretaker government helped fund 
a jewish settlement in the christian quarter of jerusalems old 
city and began construction on two new settlements one in the 
west bank and one in the gaza strip 
one can say some mistakes were made by elements responsible 
for the old city settlement ahimeir acknowledged but it does 
not justify a political campaign against israel 
the old city settlers were ordered out of the building they 
inhabited after the supreme court decided it was purchased 
illegally 
more than 70000 jewish settlers live in the west bank and gaza 
strip home to 17 million palestinians 
gad ben ari spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
that assists immigrants said only about 200 of the 30000 soviet 
immigrants who arrived this year have chosen to live in the 
occupied territories

pope john paul ii on thursday 
criticized populous mexicos family planning program called for 
freedom of religious education and demanded greater parental input 
on sex education in public schools 
john paul backed roman catholic parents groups pressing for 
religious education he said they have the right to freely 
educate their children according to their own religious 
convictions and to have the laws of their country explicitly 
recognize that right 
religious schools are constitutionally prohibited in mexico 
although many exist and are tolerated despite the ban religious 
education would probably expand quickly if the ban were lifted 
however 
the pontiff noted in a speech before more than 100000 people 
that educational freedom is a right recognized by the universal 
declaration of human rights even though serious legislative 
limits still exist in some countries 
it was the fifth day of the pontiffs eightday mexican journey 
the crowd included thousands of us residents who traveled by bus 
and car to chihuahua 220 miles south of el paso texas 
the pontiff spoke from a platform on a dusty field with the 
bare brown sierra madre mountains in the background thousands in 
the audience waved flags in vatican yellow and white many wore 
straw hats and caps 
the sunny day was marred by word that a plane carrying pilgrims 
crashed near tuxtla gutierrez more than 1000 miles away in 
southeastern mexico the pope visits tuxtla gutierrez on friday 
more than two dozen were reported dead in the crash including the 
bishop of tapachula luis miguel canton marin 
may god grant the dead eternal rest and a rapid recovery to 
the injured john paul said thursday evening in the northern 
industrialized city of monterrey in a brief comment on the 
accident he spoke before a crowd there estimated at more than 
500000 by far the largest of the trip 
the pope changed his friday schedule and will visit the 
cathedral in tuxtla gutierrez to pray for the victims and offer 
condolences to their families 
in his homily at a mass dedicated to workers the pontiff again 
condemned the materialism of the capitalist system 
without denying the good results obtained where a free 
system reigns we still cannot be blinded to the defects of an 
economic system that not infrequently makes riches and consumption 
its principle engine he said 
monterrey mexicos thirdlargest city is less than 100 miles 
from laredo texas and the crowd included thousands of us 
residents the service took place in the dry bed of the santa 
catarina river 
at chihuahua the pope reiterated the churchs opposition to 
artificial contraceptives 
if in the conjugal union the possibility of conceiving a 
child is artificially eliminated the couple closed themselves to 
god and opposed his will john paul said 
the standard church message has political implications in 
mexico where since the mid1970s the government has encouraged use 
of contraceptives to limit a mushrooming population government 
health clinics distribute contraceptives and perform vasectomies 
but abortion is illegal 
the program one of the most succesful in the third world has 
helped cut the population growth rate from nearly 37 percent in 
1977 to 19 percent according to government figures 
nearly half the married women in this overwhelmingly catholic 
country use contraceptives according to international planned 
parenthood figures still the population has increased nearly 30 
percent reaching 85 million since john paul first visited in 
1979 
strong religious restrictions were written into the 1917 
constitution after liberals defeated churchbacked conservatives 
during the mexican revolution 
the pope said that by using birth control a husband and wife 
closed themselves to each other in that they reject the mutual 
giving in paternity and maternity reducing the conjugal union to 
an occasion for satisfying the egoism of each one 
the papal position has drawn fire in mexico where infant 
mortality illiteracy and malnutrition are major problems 
john paul also said sex education that ignores moral values 
constitutes an impoverishment of the person and contributes to 
obscuring his dignity 
the pope attacked elements he said violated the human rights of 
children including abortion malnutrition lack of affection 
violence and drugs 
he also paid a mothers day tribute to mexican women mothers 
day is celebrated on may 10 in latin america

lake eufaula the reservoir some call a 
gentle giant has turned into a menace as farmers and residents 
hundreds of miles away in arkansas battle floods unleashed from the 
lake because of heavy rains 
but us army corps of engineers officials criticized about the 
timing of the release of water from reservoirs are standing their 
ground were it not for reservoirs like eufaula on the arkansas 
river and lake texoma on the red river the flooding downstream 
could have been much worse they say 
decisions made by the corps on how fast to release water from 
the reservoirs it manages can have a crucial effect on who is 
flooded and how severely a tooearly release of water through the 
dams floodgates after a heavy rain increases flooding downstream 
while slower release can mean more flooding upstream if the 
reservoir fills up 
questions about the management of the reservoirs was raised anew 
wednesday when arkansas gov bill clinton met with a group of angry 
farmers and agreed with a suggestion that a study of corps efforts 
to control red river floodwaters might be in order 
but in the main said corps spokesman ross adkins the 
reservoirs have done their job this past week 
our projects operated as they were designed to we managed 
them just exactly as they were designed to operate said adkins 
what we do is capture all the water we can to minimize any 
damages downstream when mother nature dumps as much rain as we had 
the reservoirs took off a heck of a big bump that could have 
gone downstream 
if we had not been here a lot more houses and perhaps lives 
would have been lost he said 
the flooding on the trinity red and arkansas rivers was touched 
off by severe storms last week some areas of eastern oklahoma 
already saturated from a wet spring had as much as 12 inches of 
rain 
thirteen deaths were blamed on the storm most of them in texas 
marilyn quayle wife of vice president dan quayle toured 
hardhit south dallas on thursday she backed proposals to extend 
levees that protect the hardhit rochester park neighborhood 
you will be in our prayers mrs quayle told residents whose 
homes are still underwater 
complete damage figures for the region were not yet compiled 
but the red cross says as many as 600 homes in oklahoma may have 
been damaged by the flooding in texas estimated damage to 
agricultural production stands at 500 million and 700 million 
a disaster declaration was expanded thursday to cover nine north 
texas counties sixteen counties had already been declared disaster 
areas an action that leads to federal assistance and lowinterest 
loans for repairs 
in arkansas preliminary figures from six counties and one 
metropolitan area show flood damage to 251 homes and 13 businesses 
said gary talley spokesman for the state office of emergency 
services 
as the water moved downstream from here arkansas has 
experienced some of the worst flooding in decades as the arkansas 
and red rivers flowed over their banks hundreds of homes have been 
damaged 
the arkansas crested at pine bluff in central arkansas on 
wednesday and the red crested near texarkana texas at the 
texasarkansas line thursday morning but officials say rivers are 
receding so slowly and the ground is so saturated that the 
floodwaters will remain for days or even weeks 
after the rains lake texoma built in 1944 reached a record 
64476 feet almost 27 feet above the normal level and water 
roared over its spillway and down the red river for the first time 
since 1957 lake eufaula completed in 1964 also reached a record 
height 
the resulting flooding downstream led some arkansas farmers to 
unleash their frustrations at the meeting with clinton 
so many of them down there felt rightly or wrongly that the 
corps could have made different decisions over the last few months 
and there would be less flooding clinton said afterward 
one farmer asked if a task force could be established to 
evaluate the corps policies clinton said he thought that was a 
good suggestion 
but residents upstream from the lakes also have their questions 
wondering if the corps should have started to release water earlier 
jeff van cleave who runs the salty pelican restaurant on the 
shore of lake eufaula said he had to close april 27 because water 
had covered roads leading to the restaurant he wasnt able to 
reopen until wednesday 
it was a serious matter van cleave said thursday there 
were a lot of people concerned around here that they were holding 
the water back too long 
but van cleave acknowledged that eufaula is a flood control lake 
and said corps officials must concern themselves with downstream 
flooding as well as upstream problems 
i wouldnt take that job for all the tea in china he said 
at eufaula on thursday mist rose over the lake where 98000 
cubic feet of water was being released per second the amount of 
water being sent downstream was less than half the 230000 cubic 
feet per second released at the peak of the flooding last week but 
still more than twice the old record release rate of 40000 cubic 
feet per second said jim holderfield a corps supervisor at lake 
eufaula 
barbara craven a spokeswoman in the corps tulsa office said 
water was coming into the lake at up to 490000 cubic feet per 
second because of heavy rains and runoff from three rivers upstream 
without the reservoir she said people and businesses 
downstream would have had 490000 cubic feet per second come 
right at them 
by controlling the amount of water releases we bought a 
little time to prepare people downstream she said 
officials said they are more concerned with what lies ahead in 
the next six weeks typically the rainy season in oklahoma 
may is our wettest month ms craven said were looking 
at reservoirs that are filled to the brim right now were trying 
our best

series my little margie died at his desert home it was 
disclosed thursday he was 89 
farrell died of heart failure sunday at his palm springs home 
said willim broman a deputy at the riverside county coroners 
office the coroner was involved because there was no attending 
physician at the time of death 
the actor was buried wednesday at welwood murray cemetery in 
palm springs 
farrell ran an exclusive palm springs tennis club for years and 
helped to boost the reputation of the desert resort as a hollywood 
mecca he even dabbled in politics serving as the citys mayor at 
one point 
born aug 9 1902 in walpole mass farrell came to california 
in 1923 seeking a show business career he stepped into 3aday 
extra roles then leapt into stardom with a minor role in the ten 
commandments the 1923 cecil b de mille production 
farrell retired from movies after making about 10 silents and 
more than 40 talkies 
it was in the 1927 silent seventh heaven that farrell and 
janet gaynor established themselves as the screens top heartbeats 
janet and i were in the top 10 boxoffice draws for two years 
after that even into talkies he said in a 1977 interview 
we had a string of real good pictures street angel sunnyside 
up seventh heaven was the best though 
seventh heaven walked away with the best director and 
actress oscars at the first academy awards 
with the invention of television farrell was brought into 
americas living rooms as a widower father opposite gale storm on 
150 episodes of my little margie 
i had a helluva career he said in a 1977 interview the 
truth of it was i didnt get along with the studio brass they 
wanted that cagney thing all the time so i got out 
before world war ii farrell was a polo fanatic who would play 
with will rogers at the humorists sunset boulevard ranch but he 
eventually moved to the desert and concentrated on tennis

greeter and a great backslapper much better than i was he was 
the perfect fella to run the club

people living there and no paved roads said bellamy 
the farrells were first citizens of the nowthriving desert 
community 100 miles east of los angeles they were probably as much 
responsible as anyone for the growth of palm springs from an indian 
reservation into a famed playground for millionaires 
there is no doubt about it the club started the popularity of 
palm springs and everybody liked charlie said bellamy 
farrell enjoyed running the club more than show business 
the club is more fun im playing tennis all the time and 
socializing but its harder work he said before selling the

seven chinese peasants reportedly kidnapped 
shortly after they arrived in the united states for an exchange 
program apparently slipped away for some sightseeing in new york 
officials said thursday 
the massachusetts farmer who is hosting the rest of the group 
received a letter from the missing chinese police said it was the 
first contact since the farmers disappeared shortly after arriving 
at kennedy international airport on april 26 
the letter says they arranged to slip away from the airport and 
have been afraid to come forward since for fear of being deported 
as illegal immigrants said sgt thomas oreilly of the port 
authority of new york and new jersey 
the seven part of a group of 16 had been hustled into a 
waiting car at the airport according to their host molly aitken 
president of the world energy foundation she said she believed 
they had been abducted 
the port authority which operates the airport has been 
investigating the case as a possible kidnapping but officers 
suggested all along the disappearance could be a scheme to enter 
the country illegally 
federal involvement has been minimal 
the group from the fujian province in southern china was 
headed to ms aitkens farm in athol mass to study organic 
farming for 11 months 
the seven apparently wanted to see some of new york before 
heading off to rural massachusetts according to the letter 
oreilly said the letter was signed by three of the missing 
peasants and began by saying it was from all seven oreilly said 
the letter with no return address and a new york postmark 
arrived at aitkens green gables farm on wednesday and aitken 
telephoned port authority police 
investigators were always skeptical about the kidnapping theory 
questioning how three alleged abductors were able to grab seven 
people without using any weapons then stuff them into a small car 
apparently the missing chinese made contact with their friend at 
the airport and ran for the car oreilly said the letter said 
they planned to stay in town for a couple days and see chinatown 
but they have been unwilling to come forward for fear they may be 
deported or never see their families in china again 
oreilly said the port authority police havent any legal 
complaint against the seven and suggested they could smooth over 
any problems with the us immigration and naturalization service 
then their only problem would be with mainland china 
oreilly said

government workers declared an 
indefinite strike and said they would take over state offices after 
president violeta barrios de chamorro suspended a civil service law 
on thursday 
the 60000member general federation of state workers said the 
strike included immediate takeover of installations and blocking 
of access by ministers and vice ministers of the government of mrs 
chamorro 
a federation communique said the government is preparing 
general conditions for massive firing of state workers 
earlier thursday mrs chamorro ordered another devaluation of 
nicaraguas currency the fourth in three weeks and steeply 
increased prices for utilities and public services 
adding to her woes in miami the contra rebels accused lefist 
sandinista holdovers in her administration of failing to live up to 
signed agreements and announced plans to stop demobilizing 
the president ordered the value of the cordoba cut by 9 percent 
in relation to the us dollar in her second devaluation in two 
days 
she also abolished government subsidies for transportation and 
raised rates for many staterun public services 
the price of running water was doubled electricity rates went 
up 300 percent and telephone service 1300 percent 
in announcing the painful measures presidential aide 
antonio lacayo said 10 years of sandinista rule left nicaragua 
badly and seriously bankrupt 
officials say there was only 3 million in the treasury and a 
foreign debt of 11 billion when mrs chamorro took office last 
month in this country of 35 million people 
the sandinistas devalued the cordoba 41 times last year and 
eight more times before leaving office on april 25 
when the sandinistas overthrew rightist dictator anastasio 
somoza and seized power in july 1979 the cordoba was traded at 10 
to the dollar on thursday 196472 cordobas bought 1 on the 
parallel market where most of the countrys money is traded 
lacayo said the chamorro administration had no idea nicaraguas 
economy was in such a shambles consequently measures will be 
deeper sharper weightier and more painful for the people and the 
country as a whole 
inflation hit 33600 percent in 1988 but dropped to 1800 
percent in 1989 there are no reliable estimates yet for this year 
mrs chamorro ordered a 60 percent pay increase for government 
employees wednesday workers protested it was not nearly enough to 
catch up with soaring prices and labor leaders rejected it 
laborers average about 44 a month and white collar workers 
about 100 
thousands of government employees at the national legislature 
the treasury labor and foreign ministries and elsewhere staged 
wildcat strikes 
hundreds of employees blocked the ministry entrance thursday and 
refused to let construction and transportation minister jaime 
icablzeta go in because he had fired an adviser a civil servant 
jose angel bermudez of the new national federation of workers 
which claims a membership of 61000 demanded a 200 percent 
increase for all wage earners 
the council for labor action and unity immediately backed him 
it is an arm of the communist party which forms part of mrs 
chamorros 14party united national opposition coalition 
about 80 contras turned in their weapons tuesday to united 
nations troops but spokesman alejandro acevedo said in miami no 
more rebels would do that 
he said the procedure was being reevaluated this could slow 
the process of disarmament 
the rebels once backed by the united states complain that the 
demobilization agreement signed may 4 by their commanders and mrs

novelist mario vargas llosa won the first 
round of presidential elections by a slightly smaller percentage of 
the vote than previously projected according to the official vote 
count thursday 
the national election board said the centerright vargas llosa 
won 276 percent of the vote in the april 8 election while centrist 
alberto fujimori captured 246 percent the rest of the vote went 
to other candidates 
postelection projections had shown vargas llosa winning 32 
percent of the vote to fujimoris 30 percent 
the second round of elections next month pits the two 
frontrunners against each other polls indicate fujimori leads 
vargas llosa author of such novels as aunt julia and the 
scriptwriter and the green house by 3 to 8 percentage points 
the official vote tally took more than one month to release 
because the results of 52157 polling stations in this rugged south 
american country had to be transported to the capital lima to be 
individually verified 
the government had to await for the final election results to 
announce the date of the final elections officials had said it 
would probably be june 3 but many now say it may be held on june 10 
the election took place in the midst of perus worst economic 
crisis this century the government is virtually bankrupt and the 
annual inflation rate is above 2000 percent 
the balloting showed luis alva castro candidate of the ruling 
populist aprista party of president alan garcia received only 191 
percent of the vote 
traditionally strong marxist parties also faired poorly 
henry pease of the united left coalition took only 7 percent of 
the vote while his former colleague alfonso barrantes of the 
socialist left alliance finished with only 41 percent 
another 153 percent of the ballots were blank or declared 
invalid and the remainder of votes went to smaller parties 
the official results show 199 percent of the 9823062 
registered voters did not take part in the election despite the 
threat of penalties including a 50 fine that almost equals a 
months wage for the average worker 
most of the absenteeism was in zones in the countrys central 
andean mountains where the maoistinspired shining path guerrillas 
launched a violent campaign to keep voters from the polls 
it was not clear whether the high absenteeism was due to voter 
fear or sympathy with the rebels analysts said 
more than 18000 people have died in political violence since 
the shining path launched its armed insurgency on may 17 1980 the 
day before national elections ending 12 years of military 
dictatorship
