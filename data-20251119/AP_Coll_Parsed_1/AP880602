perhaps the most important thing ronald reagan 
gave mikhail gorbachev this summit was the statement that he no 
longer thinks the soviet union is an evil empire 
as a bonus to gorbachevs delight the renunciation came 
within the walls of the kremlin next to the czars gun 
reagans characterization of this vast communist nation in a 
march 1983 speech unleashed a torrent of comment in the soviet 
media at the time the start of a deep freeze in superpower 
relations symbolized by the breakoff of geneva arms talks in 
november that year 
in a nation that craves international respect reagans 
criticism was taken as an intensely personal slight 
his retraction of the comment in remarks tuesday to reporters at 
the kremlin was duly remarked upon by gorbachev at an unprecedented 
moscow news conference on wednesday a session televised across 
the soviet union with excerpts repeated on the evening news 
within the walls of the kremlin next to the czars gun right 
in the heart of the evil empire gorbachev beamed reagan had 
responded no when asked if the soviet union still deserved the 
appellation 
we take note of this added gorbachev speaking not just for 
himself but for the communist leadership of a nation of 280 
million people 
it was just weeks after reagan branded the soviet union an 
evil empire that the soviets launched one of their most 
ambitious efforts to counteract what they see as malicious american 
propaganda about a nation of which they are raised to feel 
supremely proud 
on april 25 1983 then soviet leader yuri v andropov invited 
maine schoolgirl samantha smith to visit his country and see for 
herself that his people do not want war 
in july samantha then 11 came to moscow and was given a 
topflight tour of the soviet union visiting moscow and leningrad 
and spending four days with soviet kids at an elite camp for young 
pioneers on the black sea 
loaded down with 17 suitcases of presents from soviets who 
warmed to her bright smile samantha left moscow and delivered the 
judgment moscow wanted to hear that the soviets are almost just 
like americans 
similar but less lavish efforts are expended when american 
peace groups visit the soviet union 
since reagan came to power these groups have come ever more 
regularly to the evil empire promoting peace and friendship 
with the soviets and joining moscow in denouncing the us 
president for pushing star wars and strengthened western defenses 
with arms talks dead throughout 1984 and cultural contacts at a 
virtual standstill these groups were almost the only americans 
that soviets got to see and they made sure to put on their best 
show 
the kremlin which has long financed a finely tuned expensive 
system to train some of the worlds premier athletes even gave up 
on the chance to prove soviet prowess that year at the olympics 
moscow boycotted the 1984 los angeles extravaganza that in so many 
ways epitomized the glitzy wefeelgoodagain spirit of reagans 
first term 
in january 1985 arms control talks resumed again in march 
1985 gorbachev came to power promoting new thinking in 
foreign policy and doing a rapid image makeover on kremlin 
politicians 
the new leader and his wife raisa had wowed fleet street on a 
trip to london in december 1984 astonishing britons used to dour 
dumpy russians with their lively manners good humor and handling 
of the press 
with a sure touch sometimes attributed to gorbachev ally 
alexander yakovlev now a politburo member but once a student of 
north american ways as ambassador to canada gorbachev has 
successfully projected a new image 
reforms at home greater openness to the outside world and 
improved relations with the united states have given the new image 
substance adding up to an act that apparently has changed reagans 
mind about the soviet union somewhat 
and gorbachev can show his home audience that his efforts to 
mend relations with the united states criticized at first by 
hardliners have paid dividends 
the geneva 1985 declaration he signed with reagan at their first 
summit committed reagan to saying that a nuclear war must never 
be fought and cannot be won 
the nowratified inf treaty removed the danger of pershing 2 
missiles reaching moscow in eight minutes from western europe 
with the moscow summit the soviet union is no longer the evil 
empire even in reagans book 
as the president himself explained it that description belonged 
to another time another era

the reagans did up the town moscowstyle on 
their last night here taking in the ballet at the opulent bolshoi 
theater dining with the gorbachevs at a dacha owned by the 
communist party and strolling through a moonlit red square 
with summit business over president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev seemed in good spirits wednesday night moving 
their seats closer together in the royal box the soviet and 
american first couples shared at the bolshoi and briefly clasping 
one anothers waists as they left the ballet 
but their wives who ruffled one anothers feathers earlier in 
the day during a visit to moscows tretyakov gallery appeared cool 
to one another and did not speak 
after their private dinner at the communist partyowned country 
home on the outskirts of western moscow the reagans holding 
hands made an impromptu stop at red square walking on the 
cobblestone plaza between st basils cathedral and the kremlin 
reagan described his soviet evening on the town as wonderful 
very warm and hospitable 
he said the couple stopped at red square because nancy hasnt 
seen it were leaving tomorrow and i didnt want her to miss it 
the reagans leave this morning for london where they will spend 
a day before returning friday to washington 
in the sixtiered gold and red bolshoi on sverdlov square the 
audience of about 2000 most of them soviets applauded the 
reagans and the gorbachevs both at the ballets beginning and again 
at its end the dancers also ended their performance by clapping 
for the leaders and their wives 
reagan and gorbachev waved back at the audience both grinning 
broadly 
the reagans appeared to enjoy the hour and a half of ballet it 
was the first night of pure entertainment on their schedule which 
had previously included official dinners complete with political 
toasts and journalists 
but even the last evening included a touch of patriotism 
american and soviet flags hung on either side of the royal box 
at the rear of the theater and the orchestra played national 
anthems from both countries before the ballet began 
reagan mouthed the words of the american anthem while nancy 
reagan held her right hand at her heart 
the reagans and raisa gorbachev used opera glasses to watch the 
bolshoi ballet perform excerpts from sleeping beauty swan 
lake and romeo and juliet the last excerpt was performed by 
nine ananiashvili and andris liepa winners of a 1986 world ballet 
competition in jackson miss 
the bolshoi theater founded in 1776 was the first permanent 
theater in moscow and its ballet and opera companies gained an 
international reputation in the 1950s and 1960s 
tickets cost about three rubles five dollars but are nearly 
impossible for soviets to obtain without contacts in the theater or 
luck enough to receive an allocation at their jobs

in a match marked more by good will than athletic 
prowess johns hopkins university capitalized on eight errors by a 
team of soviet engineers to take a 152 victory in the first 
baseball showdown between the superpowers 
before the historic game played at the lenin komsomol 
automobile factory stadium the johns hopkins team presented the 
soviets with souvenir tshirts and both sides clasped hands and 
hugged as western reporters in town for the summit meeting crowded 
around president reagan busy elsewhere was unable to throw out 
the first pitch 
a public address announcer chattered away about the rules of 
baseball even during play to a crowd just learning about the 
sport but the 300 or so fans still seemed to enjoy the game 
cheering lustily when the soviet team from the di mendeleyev 
institute of chemical engineering did well and whistling in 
derision when it botched a play 
johns hopkins struck immediately in the first inning when 
leadoff batter tom finegan doubled off the left field fence and 
scored on two successive wild pitches by alexei koshivoy 
the blue jays put the game out of reach in the third inning 
while leading 20 when first baseman dan durocher walked advanced 
to second on a koshivoy wild pitch and scored on a single by second 
baseman andy bernstein 
after two successive errors loaded the bases third baseman john 
horner hit a drive that eluded centerfielder alexander 
krupenchenkov and horner came all the way home to make the score 
70 
the soviets didnt get a base runner until the fourth inning and 
scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings on errant 
pickoff attempts 
it was not our best game said leonid korneyev the soviets 
third baseman 
the soviet union began its baseball program in 1987 in 
anticipation of baseball becoming an olympic sport in 1992 a 
national squad played a team from nicaragua last summer but lost 
by scores of 220 and 302 
earlier this week the johns hopkins players spent several 
practice sessions teaching the soviets the finer points of the 
game and although the blue jays praised their competitors desire 
and athletic abilities they expected the game to be a bit of a 
mismatch 
they made some outstanding plays out there said johns 
hopkins coach bob babb but they still have problems with routine 
ones 
finegan a senior from garden city ny praised the soviets 
athletic ability but noted that baseball is a unique sport you 
need to have skills that are more refined they also have not seen 
pitchers that are more refined 
johns hopkins alumnus max flaxman a moscowbased businessman 
was responsible for bringing the soviets together with the blue 
jays who had a 2612 record this year he had heard the soviets 
were seeking an american squad for some exhibition games and 
suggested the johns hopkins team 
the soviet media publicized the game and several newspapers ran 
stories that caught the spirit of good will 
a frontpage article in tuesdays editions of the newspaper 
sovietsky sport carried the headline when the score doesnt 
count

music poured from the frontseat tape 
deck anatoly kalinin snapped his fingers to the beat and his 
friends passed around cigarettes and pictures of their wives for 
the visiting americans to see 
this wasnt an impromptu gathering of youth on the arbat 
pedestrian mall but an assemblage of the usually staid graysuited 
security agents who guard soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
relaxing during a twoandahalf hour wait for president reagan 
and his wife to finish dinner at a communist partyowned dacha 
outside moscow a dozen security men bantered with their american 
counterparts showing off the zil limousines they travel in and 
joining in an american betting pool on when the reagans would 
emerge from the walled compound 
at exactly 12 midnight contended an agent identified only 
as yevgeny arguing with an american agent who insisted that reagan 
never stays out that late 
im not just taking a guess im providing you with 
information yevgeny stated knowingly 
the american stuck by his 11 pm estimate challenging well 
see whose intelligence is better 
some of the security detachment had accompanied gorbachev to 
washington in december but the agents who had never seen america 
showed the most curiosity about life in the other superpower they 
compared housing costs divorce rates and the vastly different 
attitudes toward smoking in their countries 
the zil tour was impressive for the journalists who acted as 
translators between the security squads the sleek black limos are 
usually seen flashing past at 60 miles per hour on the broad avenue 
that leads from this parklike estate to the kremlin 
this costs 100000 rubles 167000 at the official exchange 
rate here one of the soviets offered with an aim to impress 
that would rival any car salesman its got genuine karelian 
birchwood lining on the doors and all around the windows 
one of the americans who did not want to be identified said 
that the soviets were a little tense on the first day of reagans 
visit but that the two groups quickly became accustomed to working 
together on their nearly identical tasks of protecting the leader 
discipline is discipline and surveillance is surveillance 
yevgeny explained when asked how the two teams worked together 
the nattily dressed agents from both superpowers took turns 
posing for souvenir pictures 
floodlights blinked and a telephone call to the guard shack 
outside the compound at 1040 pm alerted both teams to the 
presidential partys intended departure causing moans from the 
bettors who had guessed the party would break up later 
the agents instantly snapped to attention with the soviets 
diving into the limousines and escort cars and the americans 
climbing into their wagons 
the entourage got back to business so quickly that the head of 
the american security detachment had no chance to collect his bet 
winnings his guess of 11 pm was only six seconds off the mark

nancy reagan has learned to roll with the 
punches when dealing with the uncertainties of meeting raisa 
gorbachev and has achieved more balance in their relationship the 
first ladys spokeswoman says 
the clear impression left after the two strongwilled women 
squared off in a soviet art gallery wednesday was that mrs reagan 
has become far more assertive in dealing with the outspoken soviet 
first lady 
president reagan and his wife fly to london today after wrapping 
up their summit activities here with a farewell visit to the 
kremlin and a meeting with us embassy employees they return home 
friday after the london stopover 
for the first time mrs reagan acknowledged during a tour of 
the tretyakov gallerys icons that the frosty relationship the 
focus of months of intense media scrutiny is real 
a mexican standoff the first lady said with a shrug when 
asked how the relationship stood 
elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary later 
observed they are from two totally different worlds 
under a veneer of politeness the two first ladies engaged in an 
intense competition for the spotlight 
i want to say something i want to say something now ok 
mrs reagan insisted sharply one point as mrs gorbachev attempted 
to stop reporters from questioning the american first lady 
mrs gorbachev backed away but pointedly looked at her watch as 
the first lady chatted with members of the white house press corps 
when mrs gorbachev tried to break in again and start the 
gallery tour mrs reagan rebuffed her and returned to her 
conversation with reporters 
on the surface things were pleasant enough but the delicately 
arched eyebrows and strained smiles told a far different story 
instead of strolling handinhand as they had at events earlier 
this week the two women apparently had decided to show more of 
their true feelings 
it brought to mind a similar encounter during the december 
summit in washington when mrs gorbachev dominated a white house 
tour by seeking out the press with lengthy commentaries on history 
art and political life as mrs reagan was left trying to get her 
longplanned tour under way 
during wednesdays session with reporters mrs gorbachev and 
her soviet aides kept changing the arrangements for the event 
white house aides said 
instead of meeting mrs reagan as planned by the outside door of 
the gallery mrs gorbachev had come to the special vault where 
they were to view the art and talked at length with the press corps 
mrs reagan has learned to be flexible with the soviets at mrs 
gorbachevs events mrs crispen said 
shes learned to roll with the punches mrs crispen said 
noting that mrs reagan has spoken out more in moscow than she 
did at the december summit mrs crispen said she believed they now 
had more balance and equality in their relationship 
not surprisingly the first lady said that her five days of 
exposure to the glories of russian art and architecture wont 
change her mind about the soviet system 
we have two different ways of living two different 
philosophies she said one day earlier mrs reagan had termed 
the soviet system a more controlled society than the united 
states 
asked if shed become a convert to communism during her stay 
here the first lady gave a hearty laugh saying oh no

hallmark cards will stop making 
graduation cards that emphasize drinking following protests by a 
california chapter of mothers against drunk driving the company 
said wednesay 
diane wall a spokeswoman for the kansas citybased card 
manufacturer said the company decided tuesday to discontinue 
manufacturing and shipping alcoholrelated graduation cards 
the controversy started last week in huntington beach calif 
when edison high school parents showed madd officals a card 
depicting a refrigerator filled with coors beer and a single egg 
dont go to graduation without a good breakfast first the 
card reads 
another card suggests that graduates wear loosefitting gowns so 
they can hide at least two bottles of champagne underneath 
how can a company which advertises when you care enough to 
send the very best send hallmark produce cards which encourage 
alcohol and drunken driving asked janet cater director of the 
orange county chapter of mothers against drunk driving 
ms cater said tuesdays decision was insufficient because the 
cards are still available in some stores however ms wall said 
graduation season is coming to an end and most of the cards will 
come down very shortly 
ms wall said she did not have exact figures on the number of 
graduation cards that had reference to alcohol 
hallmark offers about 600 graduation card designs and less 
than 1 percent deal with alcoholrelated subject matter she 
said it is a very small percentage 
she said the complaints that spurred the companys action came 
primarily from orange county calif

a western diplomatic source says 28 refusenik 
cases have not been resolved contrary to information from soviet 
jewish leaders that the cases were cleared for emigration as a 
result of meetings between us and soviet officials 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the jewish 
leaders had evidently misunderstood the situation 
the confusion arose over a meeting between assistant secretary 
of state richard schifter and a group of six refuseniks wednesday 
morning 
refusenik scientist yuli kosharovsky showed reporters a list of 
400 names that he said had been submitted to schifter on saturday 
for discussion with soviet officials at meetings during the moscow 
summit 
he said schifter told the group that 28 of the cases had been 
solved in the meetings taking place during the moscow summit 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
but the western diplomatic source said later that no cases had 
been solved 
other refusenik sources said more than a dozen families from 
moscow leningrad and kiev had received permission to emigrate in 
the past 10 days 
moscow refusenik bella gulko said the boris weinshtock and iosif 
pilmenshtein families of moscow had received permission to emigrate 
this week 
refusenik sergei mkrtchyan who demonstrated daily in downtown 
moscow with his wife and yearold daughter last week said he was 
summoned to the moscow visa office on saturday and was told he 
could leave the country on monday 
mkrtchyan said he knew of three kiev families who also had 
received permission to leave the country 
about 40 other refuseniks many of them accompanied by their 
children held a peaceful halfhour demonstration wednesday within 
sight of the kremlin waving banners demanding that they be allowed 
to emigrate 
an agency helping jewish emigres said in geneva on wednesday 
that the number allowed to leave the soviet union reached 1145 in 
may a sevenyear high 
the may figure was the fourth straight monthly increase and 
brought the total for 1988 to 4547 said the intergovernmental 
committee for migration 
more than 8000 jews were permitted to emigrate in 1987 a sharp 
increase from previous years but far below the peak of more than 
51000 in 1979

the relationship has never been more special so 
it is only natural that president reagan is visiting margaret 
thatcher his ideological soulmate and closest foreign ally to 
tell her about the moscow summit 
reagans twoday visit another boost to the british prime 
ministers prestige on the international stage comes six months 
after soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev stopped off to confer with 
her en route to the washington superpower summit 
todays is reagans third and probably last visit as president 
to a prime minister of whom he said recently were very good 
friends and it is a friendship i treasure very much 
he will confer with mrs thatcher at her no 10 downing st 
residence dine there tonight and make a speech friday on eastwest 
relations before returning home 
for reagan the british conservative party leader has been a 
sometimes costly occasionally reproving but superloyal friend 
she rarely criticizes him 
asked in parliament about revelations about astrology in the 
white house all she would say was i come under libra which is 
a very balanced sign 
the angloamerican bond rooted in a common language heritage 
and alliances in two world wars is the cornerstone of her foreign 
policy 
she stood alone in backing the 1986 us bombing raid on libya 
followed washington out of unesco in 1985 was the first to deploy 
us cruise missiles in europe in 1983 and last year when the 
superpowers agreed to remove the missiles she put aside her 
reservations and gave the deal a ringing endorsement 
when other european leaders in the 16nation nato alliance 
sometimes grumble about us domination mrs thatchers response 
is blunt 
shes the largest most prosperous nation in the world and 
lets be thankful she has taken a leadership role mrs thatcher 
said in a radio interview in march none of us can substitute for 
it we could all help with it 
her us policy draws opposition taunts of reagans poodle 
to which she retorts i dont think i would make a very good 
poodle i might be more a sort of bulldog 
however some analysts see her as having subtly moved into a 
prime role in nato using both her special influence with reagan 
and more recently her good relations with gorbachev to exercise 
power 
elected to office 18 months before reagan and recently 
reelected for an unprecedented third consecutive term 62yearold 
mrs thatcher is the senior stateswoman of the western world she 
shares reagans hostility to communism and belief in free markets 
she fervently believes nuclear weapons are peacekeepers after 
reagan flirted with the idea of a nonnuclear world at the 1986 
summit at reykjavik iceland mrs thatcher sped to washington to 
make sure he didnt carry disarmament too far without consulting 
his allies 
at her instigation nato leaders held a special summit before 
reagans latest meeting in moscow with gorbachev she said the aim 
was to demonstrate western unity and show that the president is 
always seen consulting his nato allies 
there have been some disagreements 
in 1982 when reagan sought to withhold usoriginated 
technology from a soviet natural gas pipeline mrs thatcher 
ordered british companies to fulfill their contracts despite the 
threat of us sanctions reagan backed off after mrs thatcher 
complained publicly she felt deeply wounded by a friend 
a year later mrs thatcher criticized the usled invasion of 
grenada to overthrow marxist coup leaders in the former british 
colony saying you just dont walk into countries like that 
more recently she has chided the united states about its budget 
deficit making disapproving comparisons with her own stringent 
policies which have produced a budget surplus 
but she has never shied away from backing the united states in a 
crisis even when it has left her isolated 
she says she has never forgotten that reagan put his entire 
latin american policy at risk to support britain in the 1982 
falkland islands war against argentina 
in april 1986 she braved uproar in parliament for allowing 
washington to use britishbased bombers in the raid on libya when 
other european allies had refused to help 
she declared i believe friendship is two ways

eugene mccarthy whose presidential 
candidacy two decades ago helped galvanize opposition to the 
vietnam war has placed himself in the running again this year at 
the age of 72 
this year the one thing we have to do is shake up the 
twoparty system and thats what i hope to do the silverhaired 
mccarthy told reporters and onlookers wednesday near independence 
hall there is no real choice between democrats and republicans 
mccarthy dismissed the expected republican nominee vice 
president george bush and his likely democratic opponent 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
there are two kinds of people who dont make good 
presidents he said vice presidents and governors 
the former senator whose antiwar campaign in 1968 helped bring 
down president lyndon b johnson is running this year on the 
consumer party ticket 
in mccarthys first campaign fellow minnesotan hubert humphrey 
won the democratic nomination and republican richard nixon won the 
election 
mccarthy also tried for the democratic presidential nomination 
in 1972 and ran as an independent in 1976 this time he hopes to be 
on the ballot in at least 30 states 
mccarthy said his latest candidacy was not a futile gesture 
sure ive lost before but i didnt feel i wasted my time and 
i expect to have a significant impact mccarthy said 
max weiner who founded the consumer party in 1967 in 
philadelphia said we think both the democrats and republicans 
have failed the country and that we are an alternative not a 
spoiler well give the voters an alternative millions dont want 
to vote for anyone and we think that mccarthy will attract them 
the party has about 4000 members almost all in pennsylvania 
its platform calls for guaranteed jobs for all americans sharp 
reductions in the military budget passage of the equal rights 
amendment and provision of affordable housing for everyone 
the partys most successful candidate to date has been weiner a 
1987 candidate for philadelphia city council weiner won 21 percent 
of the vote which was not enough for a seat 
the party affiliated itself with the campaigns of citizens party 
candidates barry commoner and sonia johnson in the 1980 and 1984 
presidential campaigns 
lance haver chairman of the pennsylvania consumer party said 
mccarthy would be formally nominated at a convention in 
philadelphia late this summer no date was announced 
haver said that he expected florence rice who founded the 
harlem consumer education council based in new york city to be the 
partys vice presidential nominee but mccarthy who says the vice 
presidency should be abolished said he expected there would be 
different running mates in different states

three major investigations in the miami area 
broke off in 1985 when wiretap information was allegedly leaked by 
us district judge alcee l hastings an fbi agent told a house 
subcommittee conducting impeachment proceedings against the judge 
there is nothing to lead me to believe that it could have been 
any other source than judge hastings agent christopher mazzella 
testified wednesday before the subcommittee on criminal justice 
mazzella said the three investigations into labor racketeering and 
public corruption had to be ended for fear of endangering the lives 
of undercover agents and informants 
he said hastings approved a 30day wiretap on july 15 1985 and 
received progress reports on it every seven days 
on aug 15 the fbi applied to hastings for an extension of the 
tap attaching an affidavit containing references to dade county 
mayor steve clark and a man named kevin waxy gordon who was a 
target of one of the probes 
mazzella who was in charge of the probes said the 
investigations became tainted when clark told gordon of information 
he said he received from hastings gordon surmised that the only 
way anyone would know the information was from a wiretap 
mazzella said the cases involved the local longshoremens union 
in zoning code cases in hialeah and police selling drugs in north 
bay village he said the wiretap was involved in all three cases 
hastings who still sits on the federal bench in miami has not 
had a chance to rebut the allegations before the subcommittee he 
refused to discuss the case wednesday with reporters outside the 
hearing room 
mazzella said he could not find any statement to a law 
enforcement officer in which hastings either confirmed or denied 
the allegations the agent said reporter bryan duffy of the miami 
herald told the fbi he discussed the allegation with hastings on 
march 25 1986 but that hastings did not say whether he was the 
source of the leak 
the impeachment proceedings against hastings stem from a bribery 
case in florida involving washington attorney william borders 
borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a 150000 bribe for 
hastings in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted 
racketeers 
in a separate trial in 1983 hastings was acquitted of the 
bribery conspiracy charges but a fivemember panel of the 
atlantabased 11th circuit court of appeals which covers florida 
concluded there was convincing evidence that hastings actually took 
part in the bribery scheme and then attempted a coverup by lying 
under oath and manufacturing evidence 
the panels findings were endorsed unanimously by the judicial 
conference of the united states the chief policymaking body of 
the federal judiciary and forwarded to house leaders in march 1987 
with the advice that consideration of impeachment may be 
warranted 
the judiciary subcommittee must determine whether hastings 
committed the high crimes and misdemeanors that warrant 
impeachment if hastings is impeached by the house the senate will 
conduct a trial to determine whether he should be removed from 
office

america will turn a sharper eye to the weather 
in the next few years with the installation of a snazzy new radar 
system jointly funded by a quartet of federal agencies 
the new radar will allow meteorologists for the first time to 
see the formation of tornadoes before they reach the ground they 
also will be better able to pinpoint the landing site of 
hurricanes predict floods and measure the flow of wind weather 
scientists say 
the first next generation weather radar installation is under 
way at norman okla with as many as 175 to follow by the 
mid1990s officials of unisys the private company building the 
system reported wednesday 
the national weather service federal aviation administration 
air force air weather service and naval oceanographic office are 
anteing up 450 million for the new system dubbed nexrad 
under development for eight years the first system was tested 
at a unisys facility in connecticut before the oklahoma 
installation expected to be operational in thefall 
oklahoma one of the nations leading areas for tornadoes will 
test the new radars unique capability to identify rotating wind 
patterns within storms according to kurt merl of unisys 
while current radar detects only the amount of moisture in the 
air the new one can follow its movement 
thus an operator seeing wind rushing away from him right next 
to a severe gust heading toward him will recognize the signature 
of a rotating movement the first sign of tornado development said 
les lemon a former national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
researcher now directing the radar development program for unisys 
radar tests have shown that movement can be seen in midlevel 
clouds before the twister reaches down for the ground this means 
warning time could be expanded to tens of minutes lemon said 
currently the national weather service issues a tornado watch 
when conditions exist which could spawn a tornado but ground 
spotters have to spot the tornadoes to issue actual warnings 
the new system could cut false alarms in half lemon added 
nexrad will replace a 30yearold radar system that provides 
only limited weather data 
merl said the nexrad installations also will be coupled with 
onground rain gauges to measure precipitation for forecast areas 
where flooding is likely a system that should improve warnings in 
floodprone areas 
in addition lemon noted that the system will be able to measure 
the winds within hurricanes within its 145mile range 
with that information meteorologists will be better able to 
predict the course of hurricanes to give warnings about where they 
will strike land and also to estimate the wind and surge of sea 
water being pushed ahead of the storm 
the systems 28foot radar dish enclosed in a fiberglass dome 
draws a profile of the air from the surface up to 70000 feet every 
six minutes lemon explained providing detailed information even 
in clear air many radars cannot detect clear air movement only 
air with water vapor or dust or some other debris to reflect the 
signal 
the radar uses the doppler effect which depends on a change in 
frequency in a radio wave the pencilthin wave is sent out at a 
constant frequency and bounces back off clouds moving air dust 
or whatever it strikes there is a subtle change of frequency in 
signals bouncing off something coming toward the radar compared to 
things moving away 
its the same principle that causes a police or ambulance siren 
to have a slightly lower pitch when the vehicle is driving away 
from listeners than it does when coming toward them 
merl also said research is under way for shortrange doppler 
radar systems at airports to detect local wind shears sudden 
shifts in wind speed and direction that have caused several 
airplane crashes in recent years

the air forces inability to keep track of its 
huge equipment and supply inventory has resulted in excessive 
purchases costing billions of tax dollars a senator says 
sen john glenn dohio on wednesday released a report by the 
general accounting office concluding that the accuracy of air force 
inventory records continues to be a problem despite improvements in 
inventory control 
the report also said the air force continues to have difficulty 
determining the causes of inventory inaccuracies and that physical 
security of the supplies needs to be improved 
glenn chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee 
said air force supply items and repair parts are worth more than 
21 billion 
while many of these parts are essential to keeping our planes 
in the air poor inventory control has resulted in excessive supply 
purchases costing billions of tax dollars said glenn the air 
force needs to straighten up and fly right when it comes to 
inventory management 
the gao study was based on audits of the air force logistics 
command headquartered at wrightpatterson air force base near 
dayton ohio and air logistics centers in san antonio texas 
sacramento calif and ogden utah 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said the air forces 
adjustment policy allows inventory records and onhand supplies to 
remain out of balance by as much as 10 percent and 4999 
air force item managers continue to adjust inventory records 
without performing adequate research to identify the primary cause 
for discrepancies the gao said the risk in this policy is 
that the records may be erroneously adjusted possibly resulting in 
apparent shortages of needed items which are actually on hand or 
excess procurements 
the gao also said the physical security at the air force centers 
in san antonio sacramento and ogden needs to be improved to lessen 
the risk of theft 
it said the storage buildings at sacramento and ogden are not 
separately surrounded by security fencing and that privately owned 
and contractor vehicles are permitted to park right next to 
warehouses at all three centers 
jack katzen a deputy assistant secretary of defense at the 
pentagon said there have been steady and significant improvements 
in inventory accuracy at the air force with accuracy rates 
approaching 95 percent 
while these improvements are commendable the department 
recognizes that problems still exist that require continued 
dedication and vigilance katzen said in a march 17 letter to the 
gao the department is pursuing its aggressive action plan to 
continue improving the process

a longheld industry axiom that a jetliner can 
fly many years beyond its initial design life if maintained and 
inspected properly is coming under closer scrutiny say some 
participants in a threeday conference on aging aircraft 
it is only one of many technical issues being debated by more 
than 350 aircraft design and maintenance experts meeting at the 
faasponsored conference that began wednesday 
the participants represent airlines aircraft manufacturers 
government and aviation safety groups all were brought together 
because of an increased concern about the safety of older jetliners 
since the inflight breakup of a 19yearold aloha airlines boeing 
737 in april 
a 20foot section of the plane tore away at 24000 feet and a 
flight attendant was swept to her death although the pilots 
managed to land the aircraft safely 
aloha airlines officials have said repeatedly that they followed 
all required inspections on the jetliner 
faa administrator allan mcartor said that until the federal 
investigation into the incident is concluded he could not say 
whether aloha violated any faa requirements in connection with the 
plane 
but mcartor said during a break in the conference wednesday that 
a key question that must be resolved in the coming months is 
whether to continue the current philosophy that relies heavily on 
inspections or shift the focus to a system of mandatory repairs or 
at some point mandatory aircraft retirement 
in the case of aloha inspectors from both the airlines and the 
faa failed to detect the cracking and corrosion that is believed to 
have caused the breakup 
i think we might find that the procedures are adequate but 
im not convinced the procedures are being done with as much 
discipline as we might expect mcartor told reporters 
he said the conference is likely to spawn additional private 
sessions among industry experts in the coming months on aircraft 
design the human pitfalls in the inspection process and whether 
new federal requirements might be needed 
rep dan glickman dkan one of several congressmen to address 
the industry group said that the aloha incident demonstrates the 
inadequacies of the faas maintenance inspection system 
glickman suggested that the faa must increase its research and 
development programs on aging aircraft and that the agency should 
buy old jetliners to determine how long they can be considered to 
be safe 
only by answering the question how long can airplanes really 
last will we be able to put into place guidelines which could 
save thousands of lives glickman told the conference 
john enders an aviation consultant for the flight safety 
foundation suggested in an interview that the aloha accident will 
prompt increased debate over whether the economic life of an 
airplane should remain as dominant a factor as it has been in 
determining when a plane should be taken out of service 
before the aloha accident generally there was a feeling that 
you can fly a plane indefinitely as long as it is properly 
maintained and inspected said enders suggesting this philosophy 
may be changing 
but william hoover of the air transport association the airline 
trade group reiterated that with proper maintenance and 
inspections aircraft can fly safely throughout their economically 
useful life 
the aloha plane was one of the oldest boeing 737s in service and 
had accumulated nearly 90000 takeoffs and landings

oliver north brought his unabashedly 
patriotic message to california on wednesday lending his 
conservative star status to the congressional campaign of an old 
white house buddy 
north the former marine lieutenant colonel who faces federal 
conspiracy charges for his role in the irancontra affair sounded 
themes of freedom military might and family values in urging 
election of conservative republican dana rohrabacher to the states 
42nd congressional district 
freedom is not free it must be won preserved and defended 
again and again north told a cheering crowd of about 100 at a 
latemorning rally at a hangar at long beach airport 
he urged voters to return a conservative majority to congress 
that will support continued military spending saying freedom is 
only as strong as its defenders 
north sporting his trademark crew cut and gaptoothed grin and 
attired in a civilian gray suit ignored about a dozen signtoting 
protesters who shouted at him as left the hangar and got into a 
waiting car 
was making his first campaign appearance ever and his second 
formal public speech since the irancontra hearings said 
rohrabacher spokesman robert rule said north was to attend 
fundraisers for rohrabacher in los angeles and pasadena then 
address a 250aperson dinner for rohrabacher at the spruce goose 
participants were invited to donate 1000 to attend a reception 
next door on the ocean liner queen mary and have a picture taken 
with north 
he was set to spend thursday campaigning for christopher cox a 
candidate in the 40th congressional district republican primary 
cox 35 of newport beach was senior associate counsel for 
president reagan from 1986 to this year when he resigned to seek 
election 
the frontrunner in the crowded 42nd district race orange 
county supervisor harriet wieder denounced norths visit as a 
mercenary effort on behalf of rohrabacher 40 whom north knew 
as a special assistant and senior speechwriter for president reagan 
from 1981 to 1988 
rohrabacher is just snuggling up to ollie and president ms 
wieder said what does ollie north know about issues in this 
congressional district 
at a news conference before north appeared wednesday 
rohrabacher rejected suggestions that voters might react negatively 
to a man facing criminal charges i think that if people in the 
district consider that ollie north is for me maybe they should be 
too he said 
the candidate said he doubted voters would object to support 
from north who was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of 
conspiracy to defraud the government for his role in selling arms 
iran and using the profits to support the contra rebels in marxist 
nicaragua

a government program aimed at training 
contractors to remove deadly asbestos from public schools is 
turning out inexperienced people who can still get by with shoddy 
work while scoffing at health concerns witnesses told a house 
subcommittee 
we cannot feel confident about the current state of contractor 
accreditation emil devito president of fidelity environmental 
insurance co said in a letter to rep mike synar dokla 
chairman of the government operations subcommittee on environment 
energy and natural resources 
devito said his princeton nj company has refused to insure 
30 of the 105 governmentaccredited contractors seeking coverage 
the accreditation program was set up by congress in 1986 in 
response to widespread reports that untrained people were doing 
removal work frequently making a bad situation worse by improper 
procedures that filled the air with asbestos fibers that cause lung 
cancer 
the 240 instruction centers around the nation are turning out 
some 2000 inspectors and contractors monthly who are certified by 
the environmental protection agency 
the 1986 law requires that school districts hire only certified 
firms and at least begin asbestos removal work by july 1989 epa 
estimates that some 30000 schools could need asbestos work 
synar said the testimony could strengthen efforts of a sizable 
number of lawmakers and local school boards to amend the law to 
delay the mandatory asbestos removal beyond july 1989 
bill kitchen of the johnstown ny school board told the 
subcommittees hearing wednesday that when he took an epaapproved 
course he encountered lackadaisical attitudes and instructors who 
questioned the proven dangers of asbestos fibers 
devito said the background of many course instructors is 
flimsy at best 
he said there is no requirement that a contractor have any 
experience meaning anyone can get into the removal business after 
five days of training 
even if the training is good devito said there is no guarantee 
that contractors will not try to boost profits by cutting corners 
because they know epa and the states cannot inspect all removal 
work 
the programs are not tough enough devito said as a 
result of the weaknesses with epas accreditation of contractors 
feic is essentially accrediting every contractor and approving each 
job the company insures 
kitchen said students at the course he took joked about health 
concerns and made comments like were going to be laughing all 
the way to the bank 
the courses themselves do not approach the subject matter in a 
serious way he maintained 
kitchen said one principal lecturer questioned health concerns 
about asbestos and that students were given an epa publication that 
espouses the asbestos industry viewpoint that there is a safe 
level of exposure to a substance that health experts say has no 
safe level 
asked by synar to comment on devitos letter assistant epa 
administrator john moore described it as disquieting 
susan vogt deputy director of the epas office of toxic 
substances said that while the agency audits an accreditation 
course once it is an unfortunate fact that epa lacks the 
manpower to do continued monitoring

legislation that would significantly reduce 
the number of lie detector tests administered by private companies 
now needs only senate approval to go to the president for signature 
into law 
the house voted 251120 on wednesday in favor of the conference 
report a compromise version of differing bills passed earlier by 
the two chambers senate approval would send the legislation to the 
president 
the office of technology assessment estimated that about 2 
million such tests were administered last year and that 90 percent 
were administered by private employers mostly to job applicants 
but also to workers under investigation 
the accuracy of test results has been questioned and so has the 
competency of some examiners twentytwo states prohibit the tests 
in the private sector and 19 regulate their private use 
the legislation would permit private sector testing of 
applicants for only two types of jobs 
those applying for security guard positions could still be 
tested and so could prospective employees who would have direct 
access to the manufacture storage distribution or sale of 
controlled substances 
the bill also has several provisions to protect the rights of 
workers subject to tests 
the bill would prohibit an employee from being discharged 
dismissed disciplined discriminated against or denied employment 
or promotion solely on the basis of the test or solely for refusal 
to take the test 
to take action against the worker an employer would have to 
have additional supporting evidence 
questions on religious or political beliefs could not be asked 
and all questions would have to be submitted to the examinee in 
writing before the examination the examinee could end the test at 
any time 
an employer could test an employee during an investigation 
involving economic loss or injury to the company 
however the employee would have to have had access to the 
property that is the subject of the investigation and the employer 
would have to have a reasonable suspicion that the worker was 
involved in the incident 
before the test began the worker would have to be given 
specific information about the incident under investigation 
only the federal government would be permitted to administer 
tests to those employed by assigned to or detailed to the 
nations intelligence agencies and to fbi contract employees 
qualification standards would be set for examiners who would 
need a license granted by the state if one was required the 
examiner also would have to maintain a 50000 bond 
the legislation would take effect six months after it became law

the navy is forecasting new job reductions at 
its eight public shipyards where employment already has dropped 9 
percent since 1985 
an unpublished naval planning document shows that the navy is 
projecting a 21 percent cutback in employment at the yards between 
now and the end of fiscal 1991 
the job figures are only estimates and are subject to change 
because of schedule shifts new work or other factors 
the may 11 document obtained this week from congressional 
sources projects employment requirements based on ship repair and 
modernization assignments for the 1989 1990 and 1991 fiscal years 
the naval sea systems command document resulted from a recent ship 
scheduling conference sponsored by the systems command which 
oversees the eight yards 
overall employment in the yards would shrink from about 71100 
now to 64050 in the fall of 1989 the workforce then would shrink 
further to 57150 the next year and 56400 the year after that the 
current 71100 figure includes about 4000 temporary and parttime 
employees 
the systems command in a statement in response to a reporters 
query said the navy has neither published employment projections 
nor announced layoffs 
however shipyard employment figures are routinely reviewed 
and working documents are prepared to determine what employment 
levels are necessary to meet fleet operational requirements the 
statement said 
exact naval shipyard employment figures will not be determined 
until the budget process is completed for fiscal year 1989 and 
beyond it said 
the eight yards have already seen their collective workforce 
trimmed by 7000 from the 78100 who were employed in january 1985 
the navy said those reductions were prompted in part by a declining 
number of ship overhauls 
some yards would see their workforce dip and then swell again 
under the projections of the may 11 document 
for example employment at the puget sound naval shipyard in 
bremerton wash is estimated to dip from 11400 to 8500 by the 
fall of 1990 before climbing back to 10000 the following year 
puget sound spokesman bruce andrae said that while he was not 
familiar with the working document the yard was pretty well 
aware of its workload over the next few years 
i think youll find were not the only shipyard where youll 
see some rather wide swings in manpower andrae said you go 
down for a couple of years and all of a sudden youve got to make a 
dramatic increase skilled labor doesnt come easily and that 
presents some challenges 
a similar pattern was projected at the norfolk naval shipyard in 
portsmouth va 
employment at norfolk whose 12700 workers make it the largest 
public yard was forecast at 11350 in the fall of 1989 9700 in 
1990 and 10900 in 1991 
employment at the philadelphia naval shipyard now at about 
8700 is projected to decline to 6800 the yard likely would lay 
off 749 temporary workers first officials said 
the long beach calif shipyard would suffer the least 
disruption to its workforce with its employment remaining between 
5000 and 5250 during the three years 
the mare island yard in northern california would see its 
workforce drop to 10000 in the fall of 1989 followed by a loss of 
another 3800 workers and then a gain of 1300 to bring it back up 
to 7500 
hawaiis pearl harbor yard which employs about 6100 now would 
drop to 4000 
among eastern yards charleston sc would go from about 8600 
to 6200 the portsmouth nh yard would remain at about 8000 
workers until 1991 then dip to 5800 at the end of 1991

a woman has given birth to a healthy child 
produced from a frozen embryo that was conceived in a laboratory 
dish with sperm from her husband and an egg donated by her sister 
doctors said wednesday 
the birth in may at the university of medicine and dentistry of 
new jersey is believed to be the first of its kind in the northeast 
and one of 10 in the world the doctors said 
the procedure was used because the unidentified mother a new 
york city woman in her 30s suffered premature ovarian failure and 
was unable to become pregnant said dr cecilia schmidt director 
of the center for fertility and reproductive technology 
doctors retrieved several of the sisters eggs using a new 
ultrasound procedure that does not require surgery the eggs were 
fertilized in vitro with sperm from the womans husband 
after an initial pregnancy attempt failed the remaining embryos 
were frozen and kept at 190 degrees below zero celsius one embryo 
was thawed three months later and implanted producing the healthy 
baby

vice president george bush said in a published 
interview that two of the nations wellknown and outspoken 
conservatives are fringe elements whose support isnt necessary for 
victory in the presidential election 
bush interviewed by the new york times at his oceanside retreat 
in kennebunkport maine on wednesday shrugged off the influence of 
richard a viguerie a writer and directmail specialist and 
howard j phillips head of the conservative caucus 
theres only one or two that polarize and viguerie and howie 
phillips are two of them it doesnt matter in terms of total 
vote the vice president said in the interview published in 
thursdays editions of the times 
there is only a handful of richard vigueries out there said 
bush the allbut certain republican presidential nominee 
asked if he had to do business with viguerie to win the 
election he said i dont believe that 
the fact that he viguerie doesnt agree with me on a lot of 
things or has opposed me for many years that doesnt bother me one 
iota said bush viguerie the vice president said gets his 
name in the paper by criticizing other republicans all the time 
a viguerie spokeswoman carolyn melenick said wednesday night 
that viguerie would have no immediate comment on bushs remarks 
viguerie said last month that he would vote for bush 
bush also told the newspaper he would be meeting soon with 
attorney general edwin meese bush said over the weekend that the 
two had met recently and meese said he would not do anything to 
harm bushs presidential campaign 
the attorney general is under investigation by an independent 
counsel and the democrats have been using the issue to attack bush 
i think hes been made aware by the polls and by a lot of 
public comment that there is the danger that this matter if it 
stays exactly the way it is could not only adversely affect me 
but affect others as well bush said of meese 
bush was also asked if he agreed with president reagans 
contention made at the superpower summit in moscow that soviet 
bureaucracy rather than kremlin policy was apparently responsible 
for delays in granting exit visas or refusal to grant them at all 
the newspaper said the vice president did not answer directly 
but said the united states and the soviet union have fundamental 
differences on human rights 
there is a long way to go before they have lived up to 
provisions of the helsinki final act he said adding that the 
united states was committed to broad objective standards on 
human rights

an explosion about 300 feet 
underground in a coal shaft wednesday killed 31 miners and trapped 
26 who were given little chance of survival 
about 30 rescue workers used large drills early thursday to bore 
through tons of debris in an urgent effort to reach the trapped 
miners 
the explosion scorched the ground on the surface where eight 
men were critically injured the blast also blew the roofs off at 
least three work buildings at the mine knocked down sheds and 
shattered windows 
early thursday hessiche rundfunk radio quoted authorities as 
saying 31 bodies had been found raising by 15 the number of dead 
that had been earlier confirmed 
twentysix other miners were still trapped 330 feet below 
ground the frankfurtbased radio station said dieter wickert a 
spokesman for the company that owns the mine said the latest 
confirmed count hed heard was 29 dead 
rescue authorities could not be immediately reached to comment 
on the radios figures 
gottfried milde hesse state interior minister said 57 miners 
were in the shaft when the blast occurred at midday at the mine 
near borken 70 miles northeast of frankfurt 
he said there was little hope of finding any others alive about 
onethird of the men were foreigners including 14 turks he said 
family members and friends of the missing men went to the mine 
and clung to each other for support as they waited 
its horrible my husband is down there said ingrid henke 
35 my daughters aged just 1 and 2 
a woman who would not give her name but said that her husband 
was not in the shaft added all the women in this part of town 
are doing their best to comfort each other 
around them was the mangled wreckage of the steel beams sheds 
and fences blown away by the explosion 
erwin braun head of the hesse state mining board said all 
indications pointed to a gas explosion caused by a buildup of coal 
dust radio reports said the accident may have been caused by 
detonation of 4400 pounds of explosives stored in the mine 
the lignite coal mine belongs to preussen elektra of hanover 
one of the largest west german utility companies 
mayor bernd hessler of borken told a news conference 16 bodies 
had been found milde the state interior minister said rescue 
workers were leaving the bodies where they found them in the shaft 
and moving on to search for others 
wives and children watched from nearby as workers rushed to 
reach the miners and pump oxygen into the shaft 
many family members were crying some had brought small baskets 
filled with food a sign they planned for a long night of waiting 
dense smoke engulfed the area after the blast at about 1230 
pm half an hour before the change of shifts hundreds of rescue 
workers rushed to the mine and several helicopters were brought in 
gerhard heinz an engineer said the explosion occurred at a 
depth of between 200 and 460 feet it critically injured eight 
miners on the surface and left the ground scorched

flustered city council members closed a 
loophole in a pornography ordinance after topless dancers began 
smearing themselves with transparent grease to slip out of a 
requirement that they cover up 
before it was amended tuesday the ordinance specified what 
parts of dancers bodies had to be covered but didnt say the 
covering had to be opaque 
some of the girls were covering their breasts with 
vaseline or grease said brenda nichols assistant city attorney 
there were reports that other dancers used seethrough fabric 
and clear adhesive tape to skirt the ordinance tuesdays council 
action banned all such clear coverings 
the council also amended the ordinance to make sure adult 
entertainment establishments are at least 1000 feet from homes 
schools churches parks or other adult businesses 
the amendment went into effect immediately 
those who still want to see strippers can easily cross an 
international bridge to ciudad juarez mexico where nude dancing 
and prostitution are legal 
mike gibson a lawyer who represents some of the adult 
businesses here said city council simply is trying to stamp out 
adult businesses in el paso 
if you comply with the first ordinance they pass they change 
it to make sure no one can comply he said with the new 
definition of the type of covering you might as well set up 
outside a swimming pool and charge admission to it

republican politicians say the moscow summit 
has presented vice president george bush with one of his best 
chances yet to establish a more separate identity from president 
reagan and reassure conservatives in his own party 
there comes a time and i would say to him this is the time 
said eddie mahe a gop political consultant 
conservative republicans were especially displeased with 
reagans statement wednesday that the soviet bureaucracy and not 
policies of the soviet leadership may be the reason so many 
russian dissidents are barred from leaving the soviet union 
i respectfully disagree with the presidents statement said 
rep jack kemp rny human rights problems are endemic to the 
soviet system not just the bureaucracy but the fundamental nature 
of government 
i think that bush could reassure conservatives by 
demonstrating that he is totally realistic about the soviets 
said roger stone a consultant who worked on reagan presidential 
campaigns in 1980 and 1984 as well as on kemps unsuccessful bid 
for the 1988 gop presidential nomination 
at a news conference in moscow near the close of his summit with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev reagan suggested that problems 
soviet citizens are having getting exit visas were caused by the 
bureaucracy rather than government policy 
i just have to believe that in any government some of us do 
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy said the president 
apparently at pains to avoid direct criticism of his soviet hosts 
reagan said he thought gorbachev was attempting to overcome 
these bureaucratic barriers 
bush took a fairly neutral tack when he was asked about the 
presidents remarks the new york times which interviewed him 
wednesday asked him about it and said in todays editions that 
the vice president did not respond directly 
instead he noted that the united states and the soviet union 
have fundamental differences on human rights and added 
there is a long way to go before they have lived up to provisions 
of the helsinki final act 
but the reagan comments brought quick reaction from human rights 
observers as well as other politicians back home 
its really hard to know where reagan was coming from on 
that said dawn mann a fellow at the center for strategic and 
international studies an independent policy research institute 
the fact that there still are several hundred prisoners of 
conscience is not attributable to bureaucratic snafus 
rep gus yatron dpa chairman of the human rights 
subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee defended the 
president and said he thought reagan was trying to be polite 
i can think of no one in congress or the administration who 
feels that moscows repressive policies are not the results of the 
repressive nature of the soviet government he said i would 
want to give the president the benefit of the doubt 
rep gerald solomon of new york the senior republican on 
yatrons subcommittee said he thought reagans approach could help 
open the way for loosening of soviet emigration policy 
that gives wriggle for gorbachev to react and without 
confrontational demands he said im confident that it will 
work 
but within the political community the reagan comments were 
viewed far differently 
extreme conservatives were apoplectic 
hes certainly become americas no 1 apologist for the soviet 
union said richard viguerie who has taken to criticizing reagan 
for being soft toward the soviets 
who is he kidding asked juliana pilon of the conservative 
heritage foundation it just isnt true 
mahe said of reagans comments those sentiments would not 
really reflect george bushs sentiments he said they could give 
bush an opportunity to demonstrate to voters an area where he and 
the president disagree 
what this provides him is an opportunity to say well i 
respect the president but i cant find myself in agreement on those 
things he said 
i would tell him bush the opportunity is at hand lets 
jump on it added mahe 
reagans clearly trying to be kind to his hosts said stone 
but its an unrealistic position

former attorney general griffin bell says a 
former ef hutton branch manager didnt try to hide his 
involvement in a checkkiting scheme that led to the companys 
guilty plea to criminal charges in 1985 
bell a defendant in a defamation suit filed by a former hutton 
branch manager criticized by the report he wrote disputed the 
plaintiffs claim that the check overdrafting was authorized by 
company executives 
while some branch managers said they were authorized by hutton 
superiors to overdraw accounts plaintiff john m pearce never said 
that anybody authorized him to do that bell testified wednesday in 
us district court 
i asked him about paying a penalty he said he didnt think he 
should have to pay a penalty because he was a manager and not an 
account executive bell said recalling his interview with 
pearce one of eight branch and regional executives cited for 
wrongdoing in the former attorney generals report 
he quoted pearce as saying why dont you take it out of my 
bonus 
pearce claims that bell a private attorney in atlanta who was 
president carters first attorney general negligently ignored 
evidence that the check kiting scheme was approved by huttons top 
management in new york 
pearce who ran branches in bethesda md and st louis claims 
that bell defamed him in the report and at a sept 5 1985 press 
conference held to discus the findings of the threemonth 
investigation 
bell was hired by hutton after the firm pleaded guilty may 2 
1985 to 2000 counts of mail and wire fraud stemming from the 
check kiting scheme 
the company now part of shearson lehman hutton inc agreed to 
pay a 2 million fine and reimburse banks for millions of dollars 
in interest lost when branch offices wrote checks against money 
that had not been deposited in their checking accounts 
bell strongly defended his investigation saying he didnt cite 
any top officials for wrongdoing because all he could prove was 
that senior executives didnt monitor the activities of branch and 
regional offices 
i thought i could catch a high person but i never could 
bell said 
bell acknowledged that he was suspicious of high officials 
including former hutton president george l ball but there was no 
evidence that any top hutton official intentional sanctioned any 
check writing practice that was later found to be illegal he said 
im not going to put my name on something charging somebody 
with wrongdoing if they hadnt met the test if they did not have 
the intent to do something wrong bell testified 
i never found anybody on a high level at hutton that knew what 
was going on bell said 
the problem was they didnt have any controls at all bell 
said hutton just letting people go wild doing whatever they 
wanted to do 
he credited the investigations he and the justice department 
conducted with changing overdraft procedures of major corporations 
bells report recommended that thomas p morley huttons 
money mobilizer be relieved of any duties involving the 
companys banking activities 
thomas p lynch a vice president whom bell identified as the 
chief financial officer was also forced to resign for failing to 
keep adequate controls

a federal judge says the reagan administration 
can require government workers to sign secrecy pledges 
us district judge oliver gasch in a may 27 ruling made public 
this week struck down a congressional provision that would have 
barred the administrations action taken during the first 10 months 
of this year 
gasch said the provision contained in a spending resolution 
passed by congress last december unconstitutionally intruded on the 
presidents power to protect government secrets 
with a tug of the purse strings section 630 of the spending 
resolution establishes a precedent unrestrained by discernible

instead of mending nets and readying his 
boat for the salmon season fisherman kevin hogan spends these days 
gathering petitions worrying and pondering bankruptcy 
hogan 36 got a costly firsthand look at the federal 
governments zero tolerance antidrug program on may 11 when 
customs service agents seized his new 140000 fishing boat after 
allegedly finding 17 grams of marijuana in a crewmans jacket 
today the lanky bespectacled boat owner is caught in a 
standoff with customs officials one he says could cost him 
everything hes worked for in the past 15 years and is particularly 
annoying because of his reputation as an opponent of drugs and 
alcohol in the fishing industry 
i stand to lose it all in this deal hogan said recently 
from his tinsided home on a hillside above homer everything 
all 400000 of my net worth 
under the reagan administrations zero tolerance policy 
customs and coast guard officers have seized boats and arrested 
people for even tiny amounts of illegal drugs found during searches 
the policy initially was applied in international waters but 
after an uproar over the seizure of the 25 million yacht ark 
royal on which less than a teaspoon of marijuana was found in 
international waters the administration decided to apply the 
policy outside the 12mile territorrial limit only to suspected 
drug smugglers 
customs officials acknowledge that hogan knew nothing of the 
marijuana aboard his vessel the hold tight but refuse to 
relinquish it until hogan pays a 10000 fine and fires the 
crewman who is also his nephew minh van le 
its outrageous i havent been charged with anything and here 
theyve seized my boat my means of production hogan said i 
cannot believe i dont have any rights in this thing i dont even 
think this would happen in the soviet union 
more than 1000 people in this fishing community located on the 
southern kenai peninsula more than 100 miles south of anchorage 
have signed petitions supporting hogan a former homer city council 
candidate 
the council last week passed a resolution urging customs 
officials to exhibit some sense of proportionality in hogans 
case 
i feel the drug sellers and users should be taken on 
strongly councilman john kosch said but i dont see the 
government telling you who to hire im astounded the government 
would try to impose that 
john elkins acting director of customs regulatory procedures 
and penalties division in washington dc wrote in a letter to 
the agencys anchorage office that hogan was negligent in not 
detecting and reporting the marijuana 
it is our view that kevin hogan was as owner and master 
responsible for the actions of crew members elkins said 
hogan bought the vessel in washington state last november it 
was delivered unfinished feb 1 and he says he worked 18hour days 
to get the 40foot fiberglass vessel ready for a 24hour halibut 
season that started may 23 
he headed for alaska with three crewmembers including his 
21yearold nephew on may 8 hogan said he warned the crew about 
the zero tolerance program 
engine problems forced the hold tight to stop briefly in canada 
for repairs hogan said when he routinely reported that stop to 
customs agents in ketchikan his boat was searched 
i wasnt worried because i thought the boat was clean hogan 
said but agents found the marijuana and le was given a summons 
i dont think it would have gone this far if i had yelled and 
screamed and fired my nephew on the spot hogan said i think 
thats what they wanted but my family has always stood by me and 
im going to stand by my family 
hogan said he asked that his boat be released so he could make 
the halibut opening they sat on it until the season was over 
he said ive been working for 15 years to get to that 24hour 
opening and i missed it 
that cost him a 40000 catch he was counting on to pay the 
mortgages on the hold tight and his old boat the 32foot tonga 
the seizure could also cost him the 100000 he expects from the 
salmon season which begins in late june he says he cant use the 
tonga to fish because he already has accepted a down payment from 
people intending to buy it 
i have to fish it one way or another he said i have 
bills to pay

george bush will use advice he 
aquired in four days of issues talks to help forge policies for his 
general election campaign but advisers suggest hes in no rush to 
spell out details 
a group of economic advisers emerged from a meeting with the 
vice president on wednesday with words of support for his plan for 
a flexible freeze on federal spending but with few new details 
the plan designed to wipe out the budget deficit by 1993 
depends on an optimistic economic outlook and a reduction in 
interest rates by at least 2 percentage points participants in the 
session said it would not raise taxes 
bush met on tuesday and wednesday with the economists and held a 
similar session last friday and saturday with domestic policy 
advisers he has also met with some republican governors and 
members of congress 
bush pollster and campaign strategist robert teeter said that 
bush found the talks very helpful in formalizing his economic 
plans but is not ready at this time to further define his 
positions 
bush will hold more such sessions back in washington including 
ones dealing with education and training programs for dislocated 
workers teeter said 
the vice president planned to take the day off today with 
nothing on his schedule besides a coast guard safety check of his 
powerboat and will return to washington on friday he has been 
here at his seaside vacation retreat since last thursday 
and one of the chief topics has been finding ways to project an 
image apart from his close identification with president reagan 
i think george bushs ardent supporters are anxious for him to 
step away from the administration so the voters can see him as they 
the supporters know him said bush staff chief craig fuller 
i dont know that that means staking out a lot of different 
positions as much as it means trying to communicate to voters the 
strengths of george bush fuller said 
bushs proposal for a modified spending freeze won solid support 
from economists who advised him this week all of whom are bush 
backers 
we all concluded that a flexible freeze is the right way to 
go that is indeed doable said former deputy treasury secretary 
richard darman now a consultant with shearson lehman bros in new 
york 
darman said bush would contrast his plan with what he called the 
massachusetts mirage of michael dukakis a dig at the 
democratic frontrunners management of his states economy 
bushs plan depends on a reduction in the budget deficit that is 
occuring anyway and a fastrising surplus in the nations social 
security trust fund and no downturn in economic growth the 
economists conceded 
harvard economist martin feldstein who in the past has 
advocated tax increases to reduce the federal deficit told 
reporters hes joined the ranks of true believers in the bush plan 
if bush is elected financial markets will rally on the 
assumption that the deficit will be attacked seriously said 
feldstein a former chairman of president reagans council of 
economic advisers 
the markets will respond and bring down interest rates another 
notch 2 percentage points and that will get us down and get us 
within inches of budget balance in 1993 said feldstein 
democratic critics as well as many private economists argue 
that it is unlikely the budget deficit 150 billion last year can 
be eliminated without some form of new taxes 
bushs proposed flexible freeze would keep overall spending 
except for social security payments at levels in the budget 
approved by congress for fiscal year 1989 plus inflation 
the freeze would be flexible because some spending could go 
up but it would have to be offset by identical reductions in other 
areas 
however so far bush has not provided details on which programs 
he would like to cut and which ones he would like to see expanded 
there have to be choices feldstein said i assume the 
vice president is going to wait until he sits down with congress to 
negotiate those details 
bush himself said earlier in the week that he didnt feel any 
compulsion to give 20point programs on everyting 
and new hampshire gov john sununu a key bush supporter told 
reporters you will see in the campaign the detailed plans on how 
to deal with each of these issues but the clock will not be set by 
those who ask the question the clock will be set by the 
candidate

their faces red from weeping 
relatives of the victims of the borken coal mine blast headed home 
early today after waiting for hours for news that their loved ones 
were alive 
the news never came 
by early today rescue workers had pulled 31 bodies from the 
mine after the explosion midday wednesday hessiche rundfunk radio 
reported 
another 26 miners were still trapped 330 feet underground and 
hopes were dimming that they would be found alive 
wives children and parents of the missing miners gathered at a 
mine company building wednesday night to wait together 
i dont see how anyone could have survived said 60yearold 
gerhard hettmanczyk whose soninlaw alfred wiremba was among the 
missing he headed home late wednesday after waiting several hours 
on the mine grounds 
others followed hettmanczyk weeping or trying to hold back 
their sobs 
at the mine floodlights illuminated about 300 rescue workers 
who were handling large cables for drills used by teams of diggers 
inside the cables also powered ventilators that were pumping fresh 
air into the mine shaft 
the explosion blew the roofs off at least three company 
buildings and kicking up a dark cloud of dust that lingered over 
the landscape 
strewn over the site were heavy steel rollers from a conveyer 
belt blown apart by the blast 
the air is very bad in there said klaus hausmann a 
blackened miner who was helping outside things do not look so 
good everything is blocked off 
naturally we knew that a miners job can be dangerous but we 
never thought this would happen said werner henke an elderly 
man who was waiting near the mine in the house of his son dieter 
who was among the missing 
work will go on here after this over said otto kraft a 
mine worker who was above ground when it happened but were 
never going to be able to forget this horrible disaster

theatergoers gave their regards to broadway 
buying a record number of tickets during the 198788 season despite 
having fewer productions to choose from 
during the season which ran june 1 1987 to may 29 253 
million worth of tickets were sold to more than 81 million 
theatergoers the league of american theaters and producers said 
wednesday 
the previous season ticket sales were 209 million and 
attendance hit 7 million for 40 broadway productions the 21 
percent increase in ticket sales and 16 percent increase in 
attendance occurred despite a drop in the number of productions to 
32 during the 198788 season 
this was a more balanced season between musicals and plays 
said george wachtel the leagues research director last season 
we seemed to have three musical megahits me and my girl les 
miserables and starlight express that focused attention on 
broadway and set us up for where we are now 
twelve new musicals opened during the 198788 season compared 
with 11 the previous year 
the phantom of the opera the andrew lloyd webber musical 
that opened with a record 19 million advance sale gave the 
biggest boost to the season 
it was joined by several other strong musical shows including 
sarafina a surprise hit from south africa a revival of the 
cole porter musical anything goes and chess a big british 
musical that is doing well at the box office despite mostly 
negative reviews 
theres a lot of choice on broadway which is probably why 
there are so many people going said wachtel 
there were eight new plays on broadway down from 13 the 
previous season but of the eight only one serious money 
closed quickly five others are still running including the four 
strong tony nominees for best play a walk in the woods by lee 
blessing joe turners come and gone by august wilson m 
butterfly by david henry hwang and speedtheplow by david 
mamet 
the eight plays that have opened this year are the fewest 
number in the entire history of the broadway theater said rocco 
landesman president of jujamcyn theaters which owns five broadway 
theaters granted they are of a high quality if you feel like i 
do that the play is the lifeblood of the broadway theater thats a 
very worrisome statistic 
if production was down ticket prices were up the 50 ticket 
for a musical is now the norm rather than the exception a 40 top 
ticket for a play on weekend nights is also not unusual with such 
productions as m butterfly macbeth and broadway bound 
charging that amount the average paid admission according to the 
league was 3110 up from 2986 for the previous season 
wachtel was optimistic about the 198889 season among the 
possibilities are several big musicals including legs diamond 
starring peter allen and a revival of the merry widow starring 
cleo laine as well as two neil simon comedies 
in terms of attendance i think we will do very well because 
the last three weeks have been extraordinary wachtel said we 
have the momentum to keep going a lot of that may be tourism the 
weakness of the dollar the pickup we usually get from tourism 
during the summer is happening earlier 
landesman said he wants to see theatergoers attending more than 
just the big musical hits like phantom or les miserables 
id like to see more people spread out among more 
productions said landesman because the producing situation is 
so tough now a lot of things dont go to broadway unless they are 
proven or established you want to have a situation where there are 
a lot of things going on some good some bad and some ugly

with opening arguments in former gov evan 
mechams criminal trial just hours away the arizona supreme court 
was deciding today whether to let them begin 
attorneys for mecham and his brother willard made a 
lastminute bid wednesday for dismissal of charges that they 
concealed a 350000 campaign loan 
the high court was asked to otherwise return the charges to a 
state grand jury or delay the trial so the justices could consider 
the matter further 
the court was expected to issue a decision before todays 
scheduled start of opening arguments in maricopa county superior 
court 
the mechams attorneys argued wednesday before the supreme court 
that the grand jury that indicted the pair jan 8 was lied to and 
was discouraged from calling witnesses or reviewing transcripts of 
earlier testimony 
assistant attorney general william schafer iii countered that 
the grand jurors were neither misled nor discouraged from seeking 
any information they wanted 
chief justice frank x gordon jr who presided over the state 
senate trial that resulted in the firstterm republican governors 
impeachment did not participate in wednesdays proceeding 
mecham was removed from office april 4 because of his senate 
conviction on two unrelated impeachment charges 
he faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six counts 
of perjury willful concealment and filing false documents willard 
mecham his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer faces three similar 
counts and up to 9 years in prison if convicted 
lower courts have refused previous defense motions to dismiss or 
remand the charges for a new determination of probable cause 
mecham long has contended the 350000 loan in 1986 from tempe 
developer barry wolfson was properly reported as part of a 465000 
lump sum that was listed as a contribution from himself 
accountant roger brown told a lower court tuesday he testified 
before the grand jury that the 465000 was the only instance in 
which contributions from different sources on different days were 
lumped together on financial reports 
that man lied before the grand jury mechams attorney 
michael scott told the supreme court on wednesday 
willard mechams attorney joe keilp said there were other 
instances in his clients primitive manual bookkeeping system 
where various contributions were lumped together 
schafer responded that brown had said those were contributions 
made either from the same source or on the same day there are no 
inaccuracies in browns testimony he said 
keilp argued there was a continuous pattern of prosecutorial 
manipulation of the jurors misinstruction misdirection 
usurpation of power and subtle intimidation of a brandnew and 
inexperienced grand jury 
he said the jurors were discouraged from reading the more than 
500 pages of transcripts of testimony heard by a previous grand 
jury 
scott told the high court that one juror asked why they had not 
heard testimony from wolfson or mechams former chief of staff jim 
colter another asked how they should go about calling a witness 
scott said 
those questions were not answered by the prosecution they 
were deflected scott said 
schafer said no juror specifically asked prosecutors to call any 
witness

mikhail s gorbachev says his former protege 
boris n yeltsin will be summoned to explain why he criticized the 
ruling communist partys no 2 man yegor k ligachev in 
interviews with western news media 
we in the central committee must ask comrade yeltsin and 
request explanations what is he talking about and what is comrade 
yeltsin after it means his opinion differs from that of the 
central committee of the party the soviet leader said wednesday 
gorbachevs remarks continued an unprecedented public airing of 
discord in the soviet leadership which tries its best to present a 
unified image on domestic and foreign policy 
the comments were a sensation not only for the foreign reporters 
who solicited them at a news conference but also for the millions 
of soviets who watched the session live on soviet television and on 
tape late at night 
asked about yeltsins call for ligachevs resignation in a 
british broadcasting corp television interview monday gorbachev 
said 
as for comrade ligachev and his resignation no such problem 
exists either in the central committee or in the politburo and 
thats it you may proceed from this assumption 
yeltsin 57 was ousted as moscow party boss in november and 
from the ruling politburo in february after he made an angry speech 
during a meeting of the partys 300member policymaking central 
committee 
in an unexpected twist yeltsin told abc news on tuesday and cbs 
news on wednesday that he had not called for ligachevs resignation 
i simply said that in the style of work of comrade ligachev 
there are certain aspects with which i disagree he told cbs 
that is true particularly on the social problems and that was 
it and there was no talk of his ligachevs departure 
he added comrade ligachev is in the politburo and im 
convinced he will stay in the politburo undoubtedly 
in the bbc interview yeltsin said ligachev should step down 
because processes in the party are too slow because the party is 
still lagging behind because the process of democratization is not 
developing and comrade ligachev is the main person 
responsible 
gorbachev forcefully sought to quell rumors of friction between 
himself and ligachev believed to head a conservative faction on 
the politburo ligachev 67 oversees communist party ideology 
responding to a question from a british journalist gorbachev 
said wednesday that he had neither seen the interviews nor read a 
text of them 
we plan to talk with comrade yeltsin because he is a member of 
the central committee of the communist party he said 
gorbachev offered some details of the oct 21 central committee 
meeting at which yeltsin gave a speech leading to his ouster 
besides yeltsin 27 other committee members spoke said 
gorbachev and the opinion of all 27 speakers was that the 
generalizations made by comrade yeltsin regarding the central 
committee its secretariarat and the politburo were wrong and his 
statement was recognized as being politically erroneous 
the towering whitehaired man was fired nov 11 as moscow party 
chief removed feb 18 as a candidate or nonvoting politburo 
member and stripped may 4 of his job on the presidium of the 
supreme soviet the countrys parliament 
his current post is first deputy chairman of the state building 
committee

president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev have sent their geneva representatives agreements on a 
couple of thorny issues to serve as a catalyst for framing an arms 
treaty they were unable to write at the summit 
one settles part of the dispute over cruise missiles carried on 
airplanes the other sets the stage for keeping track of elusive 
mobile missiles 
the two weapons would be part of a strategic arms reduction 
treaty start to reduce overall us and soviet strategic arsenals 
by 30 to 50 percent how to verify that no weapons were hidden and 
retained is one of the hardtoresolve issues still on the table 
the substantial additional common ground cited in a windup 
summit communique included counting all existing longrange 
airlaunched cruise missiles as nuclear weapons and distinguishing 
between bombers that carry them and those that do not 
on mobile missiles the two sides agreed to restrict them to 
designated territories so they could be counted more easily but 
the dimensions of the areas were not set 
edward l rowny the senior us arms control adviser said 
there was a lot of room before the issues are completely 
settled 
and he said we didnt get anywhere on two other problems 
monitoring cruise missiles aboard warships and persuading the 
soviets that the us antimissile research program can be squared 
with the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
i would hope that before the year is out that we could 
eliminate the differences that still exist reagan said although 
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough 
gorbachev told reporters it is still possible to sign an 
agreement in this administration reagan said conversations 
are still going on and they are still being discussed and i say 
progress is still being made or we wouldnt be talking as we are 
he has less than eight months remaining in office and he told 
gorbachev at the outset of their talks that the us strategic 
defense initiative was not on the bargaining table 
besides modest progress on start the two leaders inched ahead 
on other arms control issues 
they exchanged ratification protocols for the intermediate 
nuclear force pact to eliminate mediumrange nuclear missiles 
which was signed at the washington summit last december 
during the summit gorbachev and reagan also signed two lesser 
arms control agreements one requiring at least 24 hours advance 
notification before ballistic missile tests and another to tighten 
verification procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 
150 kilotons 
on the start treaties us officials said they had restated 
opposition to deployment of soviet ss24 and ss25 missiles 
it is the position of the united states that such missiles 
should be banned unless the united states and the soviet union can 
reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective 
verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear 
weapons carried by such missiles us officials said in a 
briefing paper for reporters

prime minister lee kuan yew has offered to 
apologize to washington if an international forum determines that 
an expelled us diplomat was acting within diplomatic guidelines 
when he met an opposition leader 
lee told parliament on wednesday that allegations the united 
states meddled in singapore politics should not be allowed to harm 
longterm relations beween the two countries 
he said his country was not condemning the criminal designs of 
an enemy but regretting the misdemeanors of a friend 
the tone of lees comments contrasted with the often strident 
rhetoric in earlier parliament sessions deputy prime minister goh 
chok tong on tuesday threatened to cut the number of diplomats in 
the us embassy unless washington mended its ways 
lee referred to e mason hendrickson former first secretary of 
the embassys political section who the government asked to leave 
early last month hendrickson was accused of encouraging several 
lawyers to run against the governing peoples action party in the 
next general election 
washington rejected the allegations insisting that 
hendricksons actions were within accepted diplomatic bounds and in 
turn expelled a singapore diplomat of equivalent rank from the 
united states 
on wednesday lee suggested a neutral committee of three experts 
in international law be named to determine whether hendrickson and 
three state department officials acted legitimately as diplomats 
or whether they have interfered in the internal affairs of 
singapore 
if the committee determines that hendrickson and the state 
department officials were acting with normal diplomatic guidelines 
lee said singapore will withdraw its protest and apologize to the 
state department 
us embassy spokesman richard gong declined to comment on lees 
remarks 
lee said his countrys senior diplomats in the united states say 
that many state department officials would prefer this island 
republic of 26 million people move from what they consider to be 
an authoritarian political system based on consensus to a 
pluralistic democracy based on a multiparty system as found in 
the west 
therefore state department officials have criticized 
singapore as not moving forward in liberalizing and democratizing 
as in taiwan and korea i am only too aware of how very 
different we are from korea and taiwan singapore does not have one 
race one language one culture and nearly one religion we are 
multiracial even though our 75 percent chinese were originally 
from east asia 
lee said he took full responsibility for the rearrests last 
month of eight dissidents originally detained a year ago without 
charge as well as the arrest of two lawyers involved in the 
dissidents cases and the ouster of hendrickson 
singapore alleged that hendrickson and the state department 
officials had dealings with a lawyer francis seow 
seow 59 a former solicitor general and president of the law 
society was arrested on may 6 he had been representing several of 
the dissidents

for years martha chappel has had the desire 
to see one of her four boys make it to graduation day 
her wish came true wednesday night her only surviving son 
willie jackson received his completion certificate from cold 
spring school a school for mentally and physically handicapped 
children 
a rare disease hunters syndrome killed her three other sons 
before they could graduate 
im so excited i can hardly stand it said mrs chappel who 
swore never to send her children to an institution after she saw 
the life her brother endured in one 
the fatal inherited disorder causes mental retardation and 
physical abnormalities such as dwarfism deafness heart defects 
and arthritic joint pain there is no cure or therapy for the 
disease which affects only males 
willie who also has the disease is a dwarf moderately 
retarded and deaf in one ear 
the life expectancy of children with hunters is 15 years 
willie is 18 
hes gone against the odds already this boy has been so close 
to death you could almost see it but hes so strong said his 
stepfather waller chappel 
mrs chappels son adrian died when he was 5 in 1976 followed 
by eddie in 1979 at age 15 and ernie in 1981 at age 18 
graduation day was a big event at the chappels white frame 
house on the citys west side 
when willie arrived home from school wednesday his main 
interest was the graduation cake 
i want the cake now he repeatedly told his mother after 
sitting on the couch waiting patiently for almost two hours 
mrs chappel didnt know her first two boys had hunters until 
after willie was born 
i kept thinking ill have a girl and ill tell her not to have 
children ive always wanted a lot of kids thats been my goal 
since i was little she said 
mrs chappel is not bitter she says she feels fortunate in many 
ways to have been blessed with four loving boys and caring friends 
and relatives 
willie hugs me and tells me he loves me they all have taught

martin mull has sent a 75 check to mayor 
william h hudnut as atonement for a putdown of the hoosier capital 
attributed to the comedian in a magazine 
the 75 was prorated from the 1500 mull received for the story 
in philip morris magazine titled why baseball is better than 
football in which the first of his 20 reasons was ill never 
have to go to indianapolis 
mull who appears in commercials for a downtown indianapolis 
shopping mall later issued a tongueincheek apology in which he 
said he meant to say annapolis because who in their right mind 
would want to go to annapolis 
dennis callahan mayor of marylands state capital then 
demanded an explanation from melvin simon amp associates the 
development company that owns claypool court mall and uses mull in 
its commercials 
simon said he was bewildered by mulls statements that the 
comedian did not speak for the company and that his future use in 
commercials was under review 
meanwhile the check arrived in the mail wednesday and hudnut 
endorsed it to st nicholas youth center an indianapolis 
organization favored by simon 
indianapolis is home of the national football leagues colts but 
does not have a major league baseball franchise

jesse jackson kicked off his final campaign 
swing through california with a visit to the watts ghetto where he 
told a rally im a man of the people 
where you struggle i will struggle jackson said to a few 
hundred people who gathered wednesday in will rogers park and 
cheered his every phrase 
in the face of his fading prospects to win the democratic 
presidential nomination jackson urged people to vote for him next 
tuesday the last day of the primary season 
but jackson also leaned heavily on his antidrug antiviolence 
message and themes of hope that go beyond his presidential campaign 
today in what promised to be a dramatic encounter jackson was 
meeting with members of the rival crips and bloods gangs campaign 
aides said they believed it would be the first time the rival gang 
leaders got together 
as a grown man i will never be afraid of children i will 
talk with you anywhere jackson told the watts rally 
in his speeches wednesday jackson also criticized reagans 
comments in the soviet union about american indians in which the 
president referred to the primitive conditions in which they 
live and said some got rich off oil 
jackson called reagans remarks illinformed and an affront to 
all americans 
jackson said us policy toward native americans has lacked a 
key ingredient of profound and sustained respect for them 
jackson also said president reagan made a mistake in saying that 
the lack of human rights in the soviet union is more a matter of 
bureaucracy than policy 
mr reagan is caught up in the romance of russia not the 
reality jackson said in response to a reporters question about 
reagans characterization of the human rights problem in the soviet 
union during his fourth summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
jackson said that reagans assessment was an error in his 
judgment 
the lack of human rights in the soviet union the lack of 
freedom of press freedom of religion freedom of immigration is a 
matter of policy it is not just a matter of bureacracy 
i hope mr reagan will not make anymore errors of that 
magnitude he told reporters 
jackson was spending the night with a single mother and her 
three children who live in the nickerson gardens housing project of 
watts 
im going to stay in nickerson gardens tonight because im a 
man of the people he said 
but first he attended a hollywood fundraiser featuring kris 
kristofferson willie nelson martin sheen helen reddy rita 
coolidge and other performers 
as tuesdays primary nears with california offering the largest 
delegate prize in the country the jackson campaign is launching 
its 700000 tv ad blitz for the final days of the campaign 
featuring four spanishlanguage ads and three english ads developed 
for california 
some of the ads began airing tuesday others will start today 
campaign spokeswoman pam smith said the campaign has bought 
60000 worth of tv and radio time for the spanish ads hoping to 
cut into the popularity frontrunner michael dukakis enjoys among 
californias large hispanic population 
polls in california have shown jackson far behind dukakis who 
is on the verge of sewing up the nomination but jackson insisted 
wednesday that he can win the state and urged voters not to be led 
to thinking their vote wont count 
jackson also vowed to go to the democratic convention in atlanta 
this summer and fight for his platform goals he said some have 
termed his proposals radical but that im not going to change my 
plan just because you put a label on it 
jackson also said he had telephoned his rival with good wishes 
for kitty dukakis who entered a boston hospital wednesday night 
for tests after a preliminary diagnosis of herniated discs in the 
neck area 
jackson said he reached the governor instead of his wife but 
said they did not discuss the vice presidency or anything 
politically significant

a predecessor of the aids virus could have 
infected primitive human ancestors more than 20 million years ago 
and evolved as modern humans evolved researchers say 
a determination of the entire genetic code or sequence of an 
aids virus found in an african green monkey suggests that the virus 
did not jump recently from monkeys to humans the researchers said 
in an article published today in nature the british scientific 
journal 
some researchers have suggested that these monkeys may have been 
the source of the human aids virus 
a team led by masanori hayami of the university of tokyo found 
that the african green monkey aids virus differed from the two 
known human aids viruses in several important respects 
if the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times 
the viruses would be identical or nearly so said carel mulder a 
biologist at the university of massachusetts medical school in 
worcester 
it is impossible that humans were infected in any recent time 
with this virus mulder said in a telephone interview 
the japanese researchers and mulder say that the evidence now 
suggests that each species could have its own version of the aids 
virus 
two aids viruses have been identified in humans they could have 
evolved in isolated populations in different places the japanese 
researchers reported 
humans and monkeys are descendants of primitive primates that 
may have lived 20 million to 30 million years ago the japanese 
researchers believe that an aidslike virus infected those 
primitive primates 
as those creatures evolved into humans and various species of 
monkeys the parent aids virus evolved into the different forms 
seen today the researchers speculated 
no aids virus is known in apes which are more closely related 
to humans than are monkeys 
dr norman letvin a primate specialist at the harvard medical 
school said of the japanese research this is yet another piece 
of data in support of what i think should now be accepted that a 
jump of the virus did not occur 
asked why the virus has only recently been observed to cause 
disease letvin said that it could have existed for a long time 
only in isolated populations and that it might also have evolved 
into its present diseasecausing form in comparatively recent times 
the virus that hayami and his colleagues studied was isolated 
from a wild african green monkey obtained in kenya their 
determination or sequencing of the viruss genetic code shows 
that it lacks some genetic material carried by the human aids 
viruses 
the two human aids viruses are hiv1 which is almost 
exclusively responsible for the worldwide epidemic of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and hiv2 which is mostly limited to 
west africa but is now slowly beginning to spread 
researchers disagree over whether hiv2 causes disease 
the african green monkey virus lacks the socalled r gene 
present in hiv1 and hiv2 the japanese researchers report in 
addition the african green monkey virus does not appear to make 
monkeys sick 
researchers are trying to determine the function of the r gene 
mulder said

president reagan today invoked an obscure russian 
proverb in his farewell to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
mr general secretary if you will permit me just one more 
proverb reagan said i think a very old and popular saying you 
have here about last sunday the day of our arrival spoke to the 
promise we have seen fulfilled at this summit in this moscow 
spring 
then in halting russian the president said troitsa ves 
les postroitsya 
literally the proverb translates into english as holiday of 
the trinity and the whole forest will blossom 
this is a reference to the old russian orthodox holiday of 
trinity celebrated on the last sunday in may and the fact that 
birch trees a symbol of russia are green then auguring a good 
summer

whether theyre shipped across town or across the 
country transplanted kidneys work equally well in patients 
following surgery dispelling arguments that widespread 
organsharing deflates shortterm success experts say 
the main gain is in the long term because of the ability to 
provide bettermatched kidneys for patients said dr paul 
terasaki professor of surgery at the university of california los 
angeles 
for patients extremely sensitive to donor organs sharing is 
their only hope for a successful kidney transplant said terasaki 
who keeps an international kidney transplant registry 
you cant find a perfect match unless you have access to 
numerous organs he said wednesday at the annual meeting of the 
american society of transplant physicians and the american society 
of transplant surgeons 
some transplant doctors say shipping donor kidneys to the best 
possible candidate damages the organs because of the increased 
amount of time outside the body others including terasaki 
contend all kidneys should be shared because of the vastly improved 
results when the tissue of the donor and recipient is matched as 
closely as possible 
since last fall the nations transplant centers and organ 
procurement agencies have had to share kidneys in which all six 
antigens or genetic markers have been identified and perfectly 
matched with a potential recipient the socalled sixantigen 
organs account however for only a tiny fraction of the total 
number of kidneys donated 
terasaki said he analyzed 6250 kidney transplants to determine 
whether early success rates were compromised by how far the organs 
were sent 
of the total 2338 organs remained in the hospital where they 
were procured and 1422 were shared within 50 miles terasaki said 
the remaining 2490 were sent more than 50 miles away 
the transplanted kidneys that were not transported at all 
functioned immediately after surgery in 857 percent of the cases 
compared with 744 percent of those shared within 50 miles and 835 
percent in those sent farther terasaki said 
a year after surgery the transplanted kidneys were functioning 
in 79 percent of the cases that involved no sharing terasaki said 
seventyeight percent of the locally shared kidneys were working 
properly as well as 76 percent of the kidneys shared over greater 
distances 
longterm success was considerably better in kidneys that were 
shared and transplanted into the bestmatched candidates than in 
those that were not shared and poorly matched according to 
terasaki 
dr john mcdonald president of the american society of 
transplant surgeons said terasakis findings hopefully will end 
the debate over whether kidneys should be shared 
i think the argument not to put kidneys in the patients who 
are the best match gets weaker and weaker i dont really think you 
can support that very much longer on scientific grounds mcdonald 
said 
about 13000 people are awaiting kidney transplants in the 
united states virtually all awaiting are on dialysis 
about half are considered highly sensitive to transplants 
because of a previous transplant pregnancy blood transfusion or 
other circumstances that result in an unusually large amount of 
cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream said dr lawrence g 
hunsicker president of the american society of transplant 
physicians the group includes twice as many women as men 
as many as a fourth of the approximately 6500 patients 
considered sensitized in fact are not because of an antibody 
known as igm that sometimes is misidentified in blood tests as an 
antitransplant substance terasaki said the patients consequently 
are passed over for kidney transplants since doctors presume their 
chances are poor 
theyre waiting unnecessarily terasaki said

the british government today lost a 
twoyear court battle to stop a former intelligence officer from 
publishing his memoirs in australia and was ordered to pay an 
estimated 900000 in legal costs 
in a unanimous decision the high court of australia finally 
rejected the british governments attempt to stop publication of 
the book spycatcher by peter wright a 20year veteran of the 
mi5 counterespionage service 
arguing that britains catchall official secrets act committed 
wright to lifelong secrecy britain also sought to seize profits 
from sales of the book 
unspecified legal costs estimated by lawyers at more than 
900000 were awarded to wrights publisher by the canberra court 
which upheld lower court decisions that had all favored the 
publisher 
wright 73 was delighted and planning a quiet celebration 
on his horse farm in tasmania said his lawyer malcolm turnbull 
britains deputy high commissioner in canberra malcolm dougal 
told independent radio news after the hearing we still believe 
that a crown servant has a duty of obligation a duty of 
confidentiality to the government we are naturally disappointed 
dougal told the british network that it was up to london to 
consider whether to continue the fight in other countries 
spycatcher has been banned in britain and colonial hong kong 
by government legal action another hearing in the continuing fight 
to maintain the ban in britain takes place before house of lords 
judges on june 13 
despite the bans the book has sold more than 14 million copies 
worldwide and 250000 copies in australia 
carol bennetto spokeswoman for octopus publishing group which 
controls wrights publishers heinemann said in london today 
when this all started almost three years ago we were worried 
that peter would never see the fruit of his labors being published 
because he has been so ill it is delightful that he now can 
wrights book easily available in britain in uspublished 
copies describes how the british intelligence community bugged and 
burgled its way around london snooping on individuals politicians 
and foreign embassies 
it alleges that rightwing intelligence officers plotted in the 
1970s to destabilize the labor government of then prime minister 
harold wilson 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons that 
the book threatened national security but wright said he hadnt 
revealed any secrets jeopardizing britain 
in its ruling the court said the british government had not 
sought to enforce private rights or private interests in a foreign 
state 
it said britains primary interest had been to ensure the 
continued secrecy of mi5s operations and to protect national 
security 
the judges said it was tempting to suggest that because of the 
close relationship between britain and australia an exception 
should be made to enable britain to enforce its law in australian 
courts 
but the court said there are no manageable standards by 
which courts can resolve such an issue and its determination would 
inevitably present a risk of embarrassment in australias relations 
with other countries

us women have higher rates of unplanned 
pregnancies and abortions than women in many other industrialized 
countries according to a study 
the study by the alan guttmacher institute a new yorkbased 
organization that examines fertility issues also found that us 
women relied more on abortion and less on contraception to limit 
births than women in most other western nations 
us women of reproductive age averaged 256 pregnancies and 
076 abortions according to the study only greece and ireland 
showed higher pregnancy rates at 433 and 323 respectively 
among the nations studied 
greece also had a higher abortion rate 224 as did italy 
080 the study of all countries in western europe plus australia 
new zealand canada and the united states appears in the current 
issue of the institutes family planning perspectives 
the lowest pregnancy rates were in west germany with 164 and 
the netherlands with 168 the lowest abortion rates were in 
ireland with 015 and the netherlands with 018 
abortion is outlawed in ireland and belgium although abortions 
are still relatively easy to to obtain in belgium the researchers 
said 
the study found that 512 percent of pregnancies in the united 
states in 1983 were unplanned compared with 318 percent in great 
britain and 17 percent in the netherlands 
many contraceptives used in europe and elsewhere are not 
approved for use in the united states said dr jacqueline d 
forrest vice president for research of the institute the more 
contraceptive choices available the more likely a woman will find 
one that she will use consistently she said 
in addition the study found that us women are less likely to 
use birth control pills or intrauterine devices than women in other 
developed countries ms forrest said these are the most effective 
forms of birth control 
the researchers said some method of contraception was used in 
1982 by 54 percent of us women between ages 15 to 44 that level 
ranked low and was similar to that of portugal and spain 
birth control techniques used by 37 percent of us women 
included pills iud or male or female sterilization a medium 
level compared with the other countries that ranking is largely 
due to the widespread use of sterilization in the united states for 
women older than 30 the researchers said 
the study used the most recent data available the us abortion 
rates are 1983 figures

powerful new xray beams 100 times 
brighter than any ever produced are not the kind your dentist would 
use unless he wanted to look at the atoms in your teeth 
these xrays are 10 million to 100 million times more powerful 
than the ones used by dentists arthur bienenstock director of 
the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory said wednesday as he 
discussed the breakthrough research 
the intense narrow beams achieved by the stanford scientists 
who worked with researchers from other labs have enormous 
potential for medicine and industry bienenstock said 
scientists will be able to look at the structure of proteins 
too small for standard techniques he said the modern era of 
genetic engineering arises from our ability to determine atomic 
arrangements in proteins 
the xrays also could be used to study chemical reactions as 
they occur and surfaces of everyday industrial materials subject to 
corrosion or wear and tear and they could be used to study 
superconductors and semiconductors to detect defects at the 
molecular level 
every order of magnitude in the qualities of a light source 
results in new in most cases unexpected unanticipated science 
said herman winick deputy director of the lab 
synchrotron radiation the electromagnetic radiation emitted by 
electrons forced into curved paths by magnetic fields is the most 
powerful source of vacuum ultraviolet radiation and xrays 
the new xrays winick said approach the performance level 
anticipated for synchrotron radiation labs in design and 
construction in europe japan and the united states scientists at 
these labs which are expected to be operating by 1995 hope to 
study the molecular structure of materials and human tissue 
a typical size of an atom is about 100 millionths of an 
inch bienenstock said and these xrays allow you to see 
arrangements on that scale 
the team at stanford which included the stanford linear 
accelerator center the argonne and brookhaven national 
laboratories and the lawrence berkeley laboratory achieved the 
new xrays during a 12day run last december the results were 
reported recently at a meeting of the american physical society in 
baltimore 
the increase in xray brightness was reached using a bunch of 
electrons whipped at nearly the speed of light around a 13 mile 
ring during the december run the ring was operated at 71 billion 
electron volts 
the scientists made the bunch extremely small with magnets that 
focused the electrons so the xrays appeared to be emitted almost 
from a single point 
the electrons were then sent through a wiggly path using magnets 
with alternating polarity each time the path wiggled the electrons 
gave off radiation to produce greater brightness

president reagan stopped by one of americas most 
hassled embassies today saluting diplomats and staff who have 
lived through a spy dust scare soviet bugging alleged 
security breaches by marine guards and a fire 
amid it all the blossoming of superpower relations and the 
radical changes in soviet society ushered in by mikhail s 
gorbachev have dramatically increased the workload of americas 
official eyes and ears in the soviet union 
an american diplomat said the embassy workers were grateful to 
reagan for taking the time to have breakfast with them and their 
families 
he has these embassy visits wherever he goes but in moscow in 
particular hes certainly aware of the unusual difficulties weve 
had the diplomat said speaking on condition he not be 
identified 
the biggest jolt to the comfort and convenience of the folks at 
no 1923 tchaikovsky street came oct 22 1986 when the kremlin 
retaliated for us expulsions of soviet diplomats it ordered 260 
soviets to stop cooking cleaning driving translating and 
answering phones at the moscow embassy and us consulate in 
leningrad 
diplomats had to do their own driving cleaning and other 
chores donna hartman the wife of thenambassador arthur hartman 
took over the gardening at her residence 
we did what we had to do it wasnt heroic but it is somewhat 
satisfying in knowing we survived it recalled one diplomat who 
mopped floors and carried supplies around the embassy for six 
months 
gradually the embassy has bounced back becoming a more 
efficient operation by necessity 
the diplomatic staff was cut to make room for american staff 
support under a sovietimposed personnel ceiling of 225 the 
government brought in a los angelesbased company pacific 
architects and engineers to run the embassy it now has 84 support 
employees 
the diplomat said the arrangement has worked well 
the pacific architects and engineers people meshed in very 
well she said 
but some officials traveling with reagan say privately that the 
embassy diplomats remain overworked and havent been concentrating 
enough on their main duties filing cables back to washington on 
whats going on in the soviet union they also complain that the 
embassy didnt prepare well enough for the reagangorbachev summit 
embassy spokesman richard gilbert admits the staff is having 
trouble coping 
we need more hands at a time when ussoviet contacts are 
exploding the number of hands is limited by other than the 
personnel practices of the us government he said in reference 
to the sovietimposed staff limit 
the diplomats are feeling under extra pressure since hartman was 
succeeded by john matlock who is described by embassy press 
officer michael hurley as a hard taskmaster 
the summit itself and the frequent visits by secretary of state 
george p shultz have been an extra load on the staff hurley said 
these visits prevent us from doing what were here for 
looking at soviet society and explaining it to people back home 
he said 
in addition to the withdrawal of the soviet employees the 
embassy has faced these problems in the recent years 
in 1985 the embassy annnounced it had found traces of a 
chemical dubbed spy dust that soviet agents were alleged to be 
using to track american diplomats it turned out the substance was 
not believed to be hazardous 
last spring a scandal erupted over charges that us marine 
guards had allowed soviet agents inside secret areas of the 
embassy many of the charges fizzled but marine sgt clayton 
lonetree an embassy guard in 1985 and 1986 was convicted of 
espionage for giving the kgb the identities of cia agents and the 
floor plans to the us embassies in moscow and vienna 
also last spring us officials revealed that the uncompleted 
191 million new moscow embassy office building was riddled with 
hidden kgb listening devices government investigation panels have 
recommended the top floors of the building be stripped off 
fire broke out feb 17 in an unoccupied fifthfloor residential 
section of the aging main office building two us congressmen who 
inspected the building in april of last year had called it a 
firetrap and unsafe by accepted standards for general working 
conditions 
and off and on for 25 years the soviets have bombarded the 
embassy with microwave radiation despite intense investigation no 
one in the american government is willing to say whether the 
purpose is espionage interference with us intelligencegathering 
operations or an attempt to affect the health minds or behavior 
of americans working in the embassy lowpower microwave signals 
continue to be detected

a federal judge early today denied a request that 
he release an anticommunist cubanamerican who was convicted in 
this country as a terrorist but is considered a hero by opponents 
of cuban leader fidel castro 
us district judge william hoeveler rejected orlando boschs 
petition for parole after reviewing more than 700 classified and 
unclassified documents 
hoeveler made no mention of his proposal wednesday that bosch be 
released from jail and put under house arrest pending a government 
decision on whether to expel him 
the proposal drew immediate opposition from the immigration and 
naturalization service 
the judge said today that the government has a legitimate and 
bona fide reason wanting to expel bosch the petitioner has 
failed to demonstrate that the attorney general has acted in bad 
faith he ruled 
bosch has been in jail since february when he returned to the 
united states he fled the country in 1974 while on probation for a 
1968 bazooka attack on a polish ship that had been involved in 
trade with cuba 
his case now goes to the regional commissioner of the ins in 
dallas 
boschs attorney hank adorno was expected to appeal hoevelers 
order to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
bosch remained in custody today without bail at the federal 
metropolitan correctional center south of miami 
last week a chanting crowd of 200 cubanamericans gathered 
outside the federal courthouse to demand his freedom 
hoeveler said wednesday that his housearrest proposal might 
ensure domestic tranquility 
but assistant us attorney patricia kenny representing the 
ins said releasing bosch would send the wrong message to the 
community 
terrorism is terrorism no matter how long ago it took 
place she said

israeli human rights activists 
accuse their nations soldiers of systematic brutality in the 
occupied lands and say such tactics are prolonging the 
sixmonthold palestinian uprising 
in one case an arab resident of this isolated village said 
soldiers pelted him with rocks for two hours last month as he sat 
handcuffed in a pit two handsized spots of dried blood were 
visible in the pit several days later 
in another village arabs alleged troops forced them to remove 
roadblocks as they tried to evacuate a 15yearold shot by soldiers 
in a clash intentionally wasting crucial minutes of the boys 
life the youth died the same day 
in a third case a 70yearold man claimed troops threw him into 
a 12footdeep well in his garden and closed the lid the man who 
suffered sprained ankles and a fractured lower back said he sat in 
two feet of cold water for six hours before being rescued 
the army said initial investigations proved the allegations in 
all three cases to be unfounded adding that soldiers were cleared 
of wrongdoing 
army officials acknowledged that some soldiers have brutalized 
palestinians but described these cases as exceptions 
parliament member dedi zucker of the liberal citzens rights 
movement disagrees there are too many cases to describe them as 
exceptions 
such incidents he said this week deeply affect the 
palestinians he quoted an unnamed senior defense official as 
telling legislators harassment and maltreatment by soldiers 
were to blame for prolonging unrest 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip have 
been protesting israeli rule since dec 8 more than 200 
palestinians and two israelis have been killed in the upheaval 
zucker has asked the defense ministry to check 10 complaints 
including three in which troops are accused of beating arabs to 
death in the gaza strip and israels civil rights associations 
have forwarded 17 complaints mainly concerning brutality 
neither received detailed responses and the justice ministry is 
now reviewing army and police investigation methods 
one widely publicized case occurred may 18 during an army raid 
of arura mohammed awad 23 said he was arrested and handcuffed in 
nearby hills where soldiers placed him and two other villagers 
into fourfootdeep stone pits 
there were about 20 to 25 soldiers who pelted me and the 
others with stones he said in an interview at his home after 
two hours a soldier yanked him up by his hair when he couldnt 
stand up because most of his body was covered by stones awad said 
daoud suleiman farradni a doctor at ramallah hospital who 
examined awad later that day said the mans face legs and waist 
were swollen and covered with bruises 
army officials said an initial check showed no wrongdoing by 
soldiers but that an official inquiry was launched after arabs 
filed formal complaints 
gen amram mitzna the west bank military commander visited 
arura today where he questioned two of the palestinians who said 
they were pelted army radio said 
the radio said mitzna declined to comment after he spoke to the 
villagers saying the appropriate conclusions will be drawn by 
army investigators 
in another case arabs in the west bank village of azmut claimed 
soldiers on may 16 purposely delayed evacuation of alaa edin 
thabet 15 after he was shot in the neck during a protest 
villager murad mohammed amer 25 was quoted by the liberal 
haaretz newspaper as saying soldiers forced him and others 
transporting the youth to remove roadblocks delaying the group for 
15 minutes 
soldiers then allegedly took over the car to drive the wounded 
youth to a military base near nablus where no one paid attention 
to thabet for more than a halfhour amer was quoted as saying 
an army spokeswoman said no more than 10 minutes passed from 
the time the officer got into the car until an army doctor saw the 
boy but she added that the boy was dead on arrival 
the spokeswoman said azmut residents told army investigators the 
delay was caused while villagers searched for a car to evacuate 
thabet she denied that soldiers forced those evacuating the youth 
to remove roadblocks 
the third incident took place april 26 in tulkarem also in the 
west bank subhi yussef abed jarrad 70 said soldiers threw him in 
a well while he was irrigating his garden at dawn 
jarrad was interviewed lying on a cot in his home a brace 
around his lower back and a bandage around his right foot 
a doctor who treated jarrad said the injuries suggested the man 
was thrown because there were no scratches on his skin 
the army said no soldiers were in the area at the time but an 
official said jarrads family was involved in a feud and certain 
evidence points to young men from another clan 
army officials denied allegations they are not investigating 
such claims of brutality 
many cases are difficult to investigate there are not enough 
facts not enough witnesses said an army spokeswoman a lot of 
palestinians talk to journalists but then are not willing to stand 
behind the story and to talk to investigators 
some allegations have proved false as well 
in one case relatives of 5yearold yasmine samira ismael 
claimed soldiers threw boiling water on her during a jan 13 raid 
of the familys home in the bureij refugee camp in gaza 
but yasmines mother later told the associated press the girls 
cousin accidently dropped the water on her when he became 
frightened during the raid

a convicted sex offender could face a more severe 
sentence if he tests positive for the aids virus after the state 
court of appeals refused to overturn a lower court ruling requiring 
the test a prosecutor said 
steven g farmer a 34yearold former flight attendant took 
the test wednesday he was convicted in april of two counts of 
patronizing a juvenile male prostitute and two counts of sexual 
exploitation of a minor 
deputy prosecutor rebecca roe contended that farmer knew he had 
tested positive for the virus when he had contact with the two 
prostitutes including sexual intercourse with one of them 
jurors who convicted farmer were not told he was believed to 
have the virus for acquired immune defiency syndrome which attacks 
the bodys immune system and can be transmitted through sexual 
intercourse 
on tuesday court of appeals commissioner william ellis upheld a 
may 24 superior court ruling that farmer submit to the test before 
his sentencing tuesday 
ellis said there was a legitimate concern that farmer who is on 
courtsupervised release would continue to engage in the same 
sexual conduct 
defense attorney michael iaria appealed ellis decision but a 
threejudge appeals panel later upheld the ruling 
by court order the test results will not be made public but 
ms roe has said that if farmer tests positive for the virus she 
would use that information to argue that farmers conduct is an 
aggravating factor that warrants a 10year sentence 
the standard sentencing range is between two years seven months 
and three years seven months 
iaria argued the test would violate a state law barring 
mandatory tests for the aids virus 
however ellis said the law limits health officials not judges 
joining iarias attempt to block the order were the american 
civil liberties union of washington and the washington state 
privacy lobby

mikhail s gorbachev prodded by soviet 
journalists at his first moscow news conference touched on 
subjects once taboo past kremlin intransigence at arms control 
talks and the pain endured by mothers of soviet boys missing in 
action from the afghanistan war 
gorbachevs meeting with the local press on wednesday was an 
illustration of the effects of glasnost or openness on the 
staterun media which have traditionally served to embrace 
official policy and spread it to the masses 
soviet newspapers and the journalists who work for them are far 
from challengers or adversaries of the kremlin leadership but 
gorbachevs encouragement of the soviet press to take a closer look 
at the nations problems in hopes of speeding their resolution 
has taken hold and changed the relationship between the press and 
the leadership it serves 
it would have been unthinkable before the current reforms were 
introduced in early 1985 for a soviet journalist to even mention 
the war in afghanistan at such a public forum 
when a correspondent for the weekly newspaper literaturnaya 
gazeta rose to address gorbachev he asked about the fate of 300 
soviet soldiers reportedly taken prisoner by afghan rebels and 
forced into pakistan 
without as much as a flicker of discomfort gorbachev responded 
with the sincerity of a concerned father that we will do 
everything so that our people return home 
the most delicate questions were posed by foreign reporters who 
outnumbered the soviet journalists at the exchange by at least two 
to one the visitors also were allowed the bulk of the hourlong 
questionandanswer period when foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
i gerasimov selected two dozen journalists to address the leader 
from the sea of 300 observers raising their hands 
the press conference format was looser and the selection of 
questioners more random than at white house press conferences 
where the seating and start of questioning is preordained 
gorbachev deftly handled even the most sensitive queries about 
his relationship with kremlin ideologist yegor k ligachev with 
whom he is reputed to be in dispute about the pace of reforms and 
the inflammatory remarks of boris n yeltsin the ousted moscow 
party chief who on monday called for ligachevs resignation 
the five soviet journalists selected to pose questions asked 
gorbachev about afghanistan american conservatives hesitant to 
improve superpower relations the shift from soviet to american 
footdragging on arms control the relationship gorbachev will have 
with the next us president and the voice each nations people 
have in forming foreign policy 
gorbachev misunderstood a question by usa magazines valentin 
berezhkov a former diplomat and us affairs expert whose 
experience dates back to the leadership of dictator josef v 
stalin berezhkov served as a translator at the 1945 yalta 
conference 
i tried during my latest meeting with media representatives to 
talk about the power of conservatives gorbachev began but was 
interrupted with a whisper from foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
you mean youre talking not about our conservatives but their 
conservatives gorbachev asked berezhkov prompting laughter 
throughout the auditorium 
melor sturua an izvestia correspondent who reported from 
washington until he was expelled in 1983 in a titfortat exchange 
acknowledged in his question that the verification issues being 
considered by the geneva arms negotiators were initially hampered 
by the soviet side 
gorbachev agreed with his assessment and went on to criticize 
the current problems as a result of american stubbornness but 
qualified his remarks by warning listeners not to spoil your 
impressions of the summits overall success 
the soviet leader declared the press session the first such 
meeting here approximating a white house press conference a 
useful event hinting that other exchanges could be offered in the 
future

sen edward m kennedy says his family is 
disturbed by the decision to establish a museum in the dallas 
building from which lee harvey oswald is believed to have shot 
president john f kennedy 
however kennedy dmass said family members will not try to 
block the opening of the 35 million exhibit on his brothers 1963 
assassination 
the familiy has taken the position that the only memorial 
should be the kennedy library in boston with its outreach 
capabilities in terms of inspiring people to service kennedy 
said wednesday 
the dallas museum is expected to open by nov 22 the 25th 
anniversary of the assassination 
organizers say the museum will allow the thousands of tourists 
who visit the site to have access to the former texas school book 
depository building 
organizer conover hunt described the exhibit as lowkey and 
said it will not contain violent or gruesome artifacts 
the sixthfloor corner window from which oswald was believed to 
have fired the shots will be inaccessable but visitors will be 
able to see it through a glass partition hunt said 
people are in dealey plaza 24 hours a day seven days a week 
365 days a year and there is no place for them to get 
information hunt said this is especially a problem with our 
international visitors they expect america to have access to its 
history good or bad they consider it an integral part of a 
democracy 
planners expect the exhibits to attract about 500000 visitors 
annually the museum called the sixth floor was organized by 
the dallas county historical foundation 
the warren commission determined that oswald fired at kennedy 
from the sixth floor of what is now the dallas county

in neighboring azerbaijan that they want annexed to their republic 
an organizer said 
the soviet government meanwhile canceled a statesponsored 
press trip to armenia without giving a reason the ethnic 
strifetorn southern region is closed to foreigners

reported that armenian emigration from the soviet union is headed 
for an alltime high in 1988 following a new sharp increase in may 
regina boucault spokeswoman for the committee said 5305 
armenians have been allowed to leave since january including 1501 
in may alone

highest total since 1977 when the committee began monitoring the 
family reunification program financed by the united states

four years in a labor camp for his writings circulated in the 
intellectual underground

the supreme soviet to consider their demand at a june 15 meeting

strike that has shut down mass transit and factories for about a 
week continued according to homizuri 
intourist the soviet travel agency for foreigners advertised a 
special trip to yerevan for reporters covering this weeks summit 
meeting between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the trip scheduled from friday to monday was to have been the 
first opportunity for foreign journalists to visit the troubled 
region since demonstrations and rioting broke out 
on wednesday the official news agency tass carried a foreign 
ministry announcement that said the trip was canceled it gave no 
reason 
strikes and street rallies began in the region in february and

reporters have an absolute right not to 
reveal confidential sources during legal proceedings the state 
supreme court ruled in throwing out a 45 million libel judgment 
against the philadelphia inquirer 
the unanimous opinion filed tuesday lets stand a superior court 
ruling that reaffirmed pennsylvanias shield law and reversed a 
1983 verdict won by richard a sprague a lawyer and former first 
assistant district attorney in philadelphia 
the supreme court upheld the lower courts ruling that spragues 
libel suit against the inquirer be retried 
the suit involves several 1973 articles that reported 
allegations of sprague participating in an illegal wiretapping 
scheme 
other articles raised questions about whether sprague as chief 
of the homicide division of the district attorneys office in 1963 
extended preferential treatment to the son of former state police 
commissioner rocco urella sr in a homicide case 
sprague denied both sets of allegations 
during a sixweek trial in 1983 common pleas judge charles a 
lord ruled the jury had to disregard any evidence presented by the 
inquirer based on confidential sources 
rather than divulge the reporters sources the newspapers 
attorneys chose not to present the evidence 
the shield law enacted in 1937 states that no reporter shall 
be required to disclose the source of any information procured or 
obtained by such person in any legal proceeding trial or 
investigation before any government unit 
the superior court ruled in 1986 that the shield law gave the 
newspaper the statutory right to withhold the identity of its 
sources and ordered a new trial 
writing for the supreme court chief justice robert nc nix jr 
said the shield laws language is in no way ambiguous and 
agreed with the superior court that lord had committed an error by 
barring the inquirers evidence 
however nix differed with the superior courts broad 
interpretation of the law saying that just because evidence based 
on confidential sources is admitted doesnt mean its reliability is 
guaranteed 
the plaintiff is free to introduce rebuttal evidence andor 
argue that the record does not disclose any evidence to support the 
reliability of the information nix wrote

a man arrested on charges of 
sexually assaulting a 3yearold claims to have molested 200 to 300 
children in the past 20 years police said 
law enforcement agencies in the denver metropolitan area are 
investigating the claims made by rodney o bailey 44 police in 
this denver suburb said 
bailey was arrested may 19 on charges of sexually assaulting a 
girl in a vehicle in his garage april 12 after the child wandered 
into the yard where he and his wife were working police said he 
was freed on 5000 bail 
in a statement to police bailey a machine operator for a 
bottling company said he molested 3 to 8yearold boys and girls 
throughout the metropolitan area mostly in toy departments of 
large stores police said 
he would look for a child left alone approach them strike up 
a conversation and then fondle them said detective jan brace 
he estimated between 200 and 300 there could be more that 
was strictly an estimate 
police said they believe many of the cases in which bailey 
claims to have been involved never were reported 
it is not unusual that small children wouldnt have told 
anyone about these incidents because of fear brace said 
bailey had two previous arrests in 1979 he pleaded guilty to 
sexually assaulting a woman and in 1981 he was accused of 
harassing a 4yearold girl records showed the outcome of that 
case could not immediately be determined

the use of asbestos to make silver jewelry and 
whiten moccasins for ceremonial dances is responsible for an 
outbreak of a rare form of lung cancer among new mexican indians 
doctors report today 
doctors from us public health service began an investigation 
after finding that the incidence of malignant mesothelioma a form 
of lung cancer associated with asbestos was 1000 times higher 
than expected at one indian pueblo 
five people all from the same village had the disease between 
1970 and 1985 
dr richard j driscoll and other researchers reported their 
findings in the new england journal of medicine 
four of the victims were silversmiths the researchers found 
that they typically used asbestos mats which they called pounding 
boards to insulate their work tables against the heat of torches 
and molten metal 
all five also participated in ceremonial dances before the 
dances the indians used asbestos to whiten their buckskin leggings 
and moccasins 
the researchers said efforts have been made to educate indians 
about the hazards of asbestos and to find alternative materials for 
silversmiths and ceremonial dancers

directors of the fourthlargest investor in 
the seabrook nuclear power plant have voted to pull out and 
opponents of the stalled project say that could spell its doom 
a plant spokesman said he was confident the project would 
survive wednesdays decision by the board of directors of the 
massachusetts municipal wholesale electric co which has an 116 
percent stake in seabrook 
the electrical cooperatives eightmember board voted 
unanimously to withhold its june 1 payment of 16 million toward 
building and maintaining the new hampshire project 
the cooperative said the strain the project has put on relations 
with massachusetts has hurt customers the cooperative comprises 34 
municipal electric systems and supplies power to 28 electric 
departments in massachusetts and eight in other northeast states 
the action came less than a week after new york state reached an 
agreement with long island lighting co to abandon the 53 billion 
shoreham nuclear plant which also has never gone into commercial 
operation 
it reflects the bottomline reality that seabrook is a 
teetering financial dinosaur about to become extinct said rep 
edward j markey dmass a seabrook opponent 
i believe theres a major funding problem for the project and 
it is so grossly uneconomic right now that this may be the end of 
it said bob backus a lawyer for the seacoast antipollution 
league which has fought the project since its inception 
seabrook spokesman rob williams disagreed our detractors have 
said from the beginning that each hurdle we face has meant the end 
of the project and each time they have been wrong he said 
the rest of the owners remain committed and the bottom line 
remains the plant is very much needed for new england 
however seabrooks top three owners indicated that they 
wouldnt pick up the cooperatives share one public service 
company of new hampshire has filed for protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law 
public service company has a 36 percent share united 
illuminating of new haven conn has a 175 percent piece and 
eastern utilities associates of rhode island has 12 percent 
under a plan approved by the board the massachusetts 
cooperative plans to ask the other owners to assume its 
construction and maintenance costs or to buy its shares outright 
under the joint ownership agreement 
the matter could come to a head in eight months when the grace 
period for overdue bills is up and the other investors exhaust the 
money the cooperative has deposited in a prepayment fund 
general manager gary l hunt acknowledged that cooperative would 
lose the 875 million it has already invested in the plant which 
cost 54 billion to build but lacks the approved evacuation plans 
required for commercial operation 
hunt also acknowledged that the cooperative could be paying off 
the bonds issued for the seabrook investment for the next 30 years 
the cooperative will pay 91 million yearly for its longterm 
seabrook debt in 1989 and 15 million to 20 million annually to 
support the idle plant 
but he said the project was a losing business proposition even 
if the plants license is eventually approved 
the alienation that seabrook has caused between mmwec and the 
commonwealth of massachusetts has had adverse consequences for 
massachusetts public power electric consumers 
gov michael s dukakis has refused to authorize taxexempt 
financing for the project hunt said 
hunt predicted serious rate increases for some participants on 
top of the participants already high rate levels caused by 
seabrook

more than a third of 1023 patients treated at 
a hospital for serious accidents used marijuana before being 
injured according to a study 
another third of the patients at the university of marylands 
shock trauma center drank alcohol before being hurt and 165 
percent had used both marijuana and alcohol the study said 
to me it was rather startling to see that an illicit drug 
matched in use by a legal drug said dr carl a soderstrom a 
surgeon who headed the research project at the maryland institute 
for emergency medical systems 
patients were unaware of the study which used blood samples 
the research was reported in the june issue of the journal archives 
of surgery 
if this is borne out in other studies across the country it 
puts a new slant on the safety of marijuana use dr edward j 
cone of the johns hopkins addiction research center said wednesday 
theres a common misconception that marijuana is a safe 
drug cone said but the statistics coming out of that study 
clearly show that people who are using marijuana are involved in 
accidents at a much higher rate than you would expect 
cone said the incidence of marijuana use among the injured was 
phenomenally high 
the study showed that 347 percent of the 1023 patients had 
used marijuana and 335 percent were under the influence of 
alcohol ninetytwo percent of the patients survived 
about twothirds of the patients were involved in traffic 
accidents the rest were injured in assaults or falls and other 
accidents 
about 73 percent were men and 584 percent were 30 or younger

vice president george bush said in an interview 
published today that two of the nations wellknown and outspoken 
conservatives are fringe elements whose support isnt necessary for 
victory in the presidential election 
bush interviewed by the new york times at his oceanside retreat 
in kennebunkport maine on wednesday shrugged off the influence of 
richard a viguerie a writer and directmail specialist and 
howard j phillips head of the conservative caucus 
theres only one or two that polarize and viguerie and howie 
phillips are two of them it doesnt matter in terms of total 
vote the vice president said in the interview published in 
todays editions of the times 
there is only a handful of richard vigueries out there said 
bush the allbut certain republican presidential nominee 
asked if he had to do business with viguerie to win the 
election he said i dont believe that 
the fact that he viguerie doesnt agree with me on a lot of 
things or has opposed me for many years that doesnt bother me one 
iota said bush 
viguerie the vice president said gets his name in the paper 
by criticizing other republicans all the time 
if he wants to go around attacking conservatives hes going to 
dig himself a deeper hole viguerie said early today in response 
to bushs comments i want all of us to unite behind him and run 
a conservative campaign all we want to do is hold his feet to 
the fire that ronald reagan lit in 1980 
if he doesnt run a polarizing election hes history if 
he doesnt run a campaign to polarize that polarizes the country 
along liberal and conservative lines then he has no chance of 
winning vigurie added 
viguerie who said he plans to vote for bush said he thought 
bush was reacting to presssure that he select a conservative as his 
vice presidential running mate 
i suspect the vice president doesnt feel comfortable with 
pressure to campaign as a conservative he said im sure the 
conservatives will be insistent on a conservative vice president 
and a conservative platform he added

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
challenged president reagan at their windup summit meeting over the 
wording of the final communique and they were going at it pretty 
heavy until the end white house chief of staff howard baker 
revealed today 
talking with reporters on the presidents plane as reagan flew 
from moscow to london baker also pronounced the us delegation 
satisfied with the results of the summit which concluded wednesday 
baker said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further on 
arms control but added we came out just about where it was 
predicted we could come out it would have been nice if we could 
have gone any further but nobody expected us to go any further 
asked why reagan appeared so fatigued over the past couple days 
baker said were all tired i guess but most of us are more 
tired than he is i dont think that fatigue played any role in the 
summit 
im sure hes tired and i guess he looks tired baker said 
of the president 
baker described gorbachev as a strong leader and said he 
demonstrated the same image in private as he did at his nearly 
twohour news conference where he was feisty and appeared entirely 
in command 
in talks with reagan gorbachev goes on at some length but he 
does not filibuster he says what he says and he doesnt back up 
and say i meant to say so and so baker recalled 
he comes out of the box saying what he meant baker said 
unlike earlier summits baker said that reagan did not share 
with gorbachev his store of jokes about life in the soviet union 
he told him some lawyer jokes and i didnt like that joked 
baker an attorney 
he described the scene at the final reagangorbachev meeting on 
wednesday morning about six hours before the summit communique was 
released to the press 
as the meeting ended all of us stood up including the 
president and the general secretary and the president and general 
secretary continued to pursue their conversation 
they were going at it pretty heavy and i was proud of the 
president they were face to face and going at it pretty heavy 
until the end 
baker explained that at the first meeting on sunday gorbachev 
had given reagan some papers describing items that he wanted to 
discuss over the next three days 
baker said the president gave it only a cursory look and that 
gorbachev quoted a phrase from the documents about peaceful 
coexistence 
reagan said something like that looks all right to me and 
the documents were passed on for review by secretary of state 
george p shultz and the staff of the national security council 
baker said 
gorbachevs document would have put the two leaders on record as 
believing that no problem in dispute can be resolved nor should 
it be resolved by military means they regard peaceful coexistence 
as a universal principle of international relations 
equality of all states noninterference in internal affairs 
and freedom of sociopolitical choice must be recognized as the 
inalienable and mandatory standards of international relations 
the soviet draft said 
at his spaso house news conference in moscow wednesday reagan 
was asked why he took issue with the peaceful coexistence 
language 
reagan said that he liked the whole tone of the draft 
language 
but the president also said that aides studying the draft 
communique saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in 
there that would not achieve the general thought of what was being 
proposed 
us officials were suspicious about the language feeling it 
was too imprecise 
the us objections were brought to the attention of the soviets 
early on and negotiations began at the staff level on alternative 
language baker said 
and indeed it was our impression that alternative language 
had been agreed to for the departure statement he said and it 
was at the last meeting that the general secretary came back and 
made another run at trying to get his original language in and the 
president held his ground 
i dont think he gorbachev was playing a trick i think he 
was just making a run for his original formulation baker said 
in the end the compromise language negotiated by the staff 
omitting the words peaceful coexistence was included in the 
communique 
baker said the talks in moscow were more freeflowing than 
in washington and that there was more energy in the 
conversations 
they talk more freely when they disagreed they would say so 
more quickly he added

european newspapers today declared the moscow 
summit a success despite the absence of major advances on arms 
control 
editorialists applauded president reagans performance and his 
disavowal of his earlier characterization of the soviet union as 
an evil empire 
west german chancellor helmut kohl sent a message of thanks to 
reagan after five days of summit talks with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland said in a 
statement 
with this fourth summit and the signing of the inf 
intermediaterange nuclear missile treaty we are facing a 
historic watershed in european and international postwar history 
we have ahead of us a radically changed picture both in 
dialogue and in climate between the two superpowers what has 
happened now makes new breakthroughs possible in eastwest 
cooperation brundtland said 
sir michael howard a senior oxford university historian wrote 
of reagan in the times of london it has been a brilliant 
performance he is truly a remarkable man and his place in 
history is certainly assured 
also in london the leftleaning guardian commented theres a 
pretty durable foundation of contact in place 
it said when mr reagan in another era talks of evil 
empires and builds policies based on fear and mistrust then his 
voters to an extent share that fear and mistrust believe that 
the russians are coming to get them 
such beliefs cant easily be sustained when their frontparlor 
screens are filled by those same russians not to mention the newly 
converted mr reagan expressing quite other sentiments 
italys largest newspaper leftleaning la repubblica in rome 
differed with the guardian 
things did not go well for mikhail gorbachev one could 
clearly see he was disappointed very disappointed the 
ideological disparity between the two camps surfaced more clearly 
in moscow than in the previous summits it said 
in paris the leftist daily liberation said mikhail gorbachev 
and ronald reagan have but very thin concrete results to add to the 
essential dossiers of disarmament and regional conflicts 
but it said this routine summit was nevertheless not 
ordinary reagan who just several years ago could be imagined as 
saint george slaying the red dragon of the evil empire made a 
skillful crossing to moscow which he was visiting for the first 
time 
reagan knew how to suppress his firstclass anticommunist 
image but at the end of the summit the kremlin chief was 
unable to hide the fact that he was waiting for more liberation 
said 
the conservative le figaro said the success of the moscow 
summit is paradoxically that it did not have major results 
this rendezvous appears to have confirmed that americansoviet 
relations have found their cruising rhythm 
the basler zeitung an independent swiss paper said it 
ushered in a new kind of coexistence which has deservedly been 
celebrated in moscow 
the old coexistence was a highly unpredictable matter full 
of political misunderstandings full of nuclear risks the new 
coexistence is to be different calculable solid 
crisisresistant

a man accused of serving in a pronazi execution 
squad that killed tens of thousands of jews and other civilians in 
latvia during world war ii says he will fight a move to strip him 
of his us citizenship 
valdis w didrichsons 74 concealed his membership in the 
latvian security auxiliary police when he applied for citizenship 
according to a justice department complaint filed in us district 
court 
didrichsons refused to comment on the case wednesday except to 
describe himself as a retired civil engineer who moved here nine 
years ago from chicago and to say i will fight 
his attorney peter berzins said he didnt know whether 
didrichsons was a member of arajs kommando as the execution unit 
was known 
membership and whether he participated or knew of activity are 
two separate things berzins added 
the unit formed to assist in persecuting and killing people 
considered racially undesirable or enemies of nazi germany 
murdered tens of thousands said neal sher director of the justice 
departments office of special investigations 
the founder victor arajs died recently in west germany while 
serving a life term for mass murder 
assisting in persecution makes a person ineligible to immigrate 
to the united states and requires revocation of citizenship the 
denaturalization case against didrichsons is the first step in a 
process that could lead to deportation 
a native of latvia didrichsons entered the united states in 
1950 and became a us citizen in 1956 latvia is now part of the 
soviet union 
doug schwartz manager of didrichsons apartment complex said 
didrichsons lived alone never caused problems paid his rent on 
time and was very gregarious 
didrichsons recently underwent surgery for cancer berzins said 
adding that he was awaiting medical records to determine the 
seriousness of the illness 
berzins said it is difficult to view arajs kommando in its 
historical setting 45 years later he noted that in 1941 and 1942 
the soviet union and nazi germany were fighting in what was then a 
neutral country that had been occupied by the soviets 
people pull strings and jump or face execution themselves 
he said certainly the free choice of a person at that time is 
severely impacted 
konrads kalejs of chicago who is now on trial in a similar 
proceeding and mikelis kirsteins of syracuse ny who is facing 
trial served with didrichsons in the auxiliary police unit in 
1941 the government said

a sculptor unveiled his four bronze flying 
pigs atop a city bicentennial monument but to the relief of some 
theyre a weathered green not pink 
i changed my mind artist andrew leicester said 
the green and lean pigs top the entrance sculpture at 
bicentennial commons at sawyer point a new park near downtown and 
along the ohio river 
the pigs measure 4 feet from tail to wing tip they stand on 
their hind legs on bright blue replicas of riverboat smokestacks 
their wings are spread and stomachs taut and slim 
theyre pigs of the 80s very trim said carol scott a 
visitor from connecticut who was among a small group of people to 
watch wednesdays unveiling 
three pigs covered with black cloth were lifted into place 
tuesday night by a mechanical lift the fourth was flown in 
wednesday on a us coast guard helicopter and lowered into place 
there were many many times i thought they would never make 
it said dennis barrie director of the contemporary arts center 
which commissioned the 600000 sculpture 
the artwork contains 17 elements depicting cincinnatis history 
and its river heritage the pigs celebrate the citys heyday in the 
1880s as porkopolis the midwests hogbutchering capital 
leicester originally planned to cover the bronze hogs with 
copper plating to achieve a lifelike rosy color but there wasnt 
enough time so he opted for bronzes natural patina of green he 
said 
theyre more subdued more traditional much more 
appropriate said leicester who was born in england and lives in 
minneapolis if you want pink pigs go to a department store not 
an artist 
pink pigs would have been too much agreed don scott 
another connecticut visitor and former cincinnatian 
some cincinnatians had complained the pigs would make the city 
look foolish they flooded local newspapers and city council with 
letters and calls of protest 
the council tried to settle the dispute in january by conducting 
a hearing to air the gripes council members donned plastic pig 
snouts for the raucous gathering and one woman even cradled a 
piglet 
but the mediation failed when the councils attorney said the 
councilors were powerless because the sculpture already had been 
properly approved

bakker has several times in the past said that he and his wife 
tammy should have a chance to salvage the failing ministry they 
built before his downfall in a sex scandal last year but ptl

in bankruptcy court 
bakker went to heritage usa on tuesday to talk with attorneys 
and ptl officials on behalf of developer roe messner who claims 
ptl owes him 14 million 
some of bakkers longtime supporters gave him a warm reception 
and that energized his efforts to regain control of ptl said jim 
toms one of bakkers lawyers 
he had not talked with some of these people for 15 months and 
was very encouraged toms said wednesday 
on tuesday bakker told reporters he might try to buy ptls 
assets when they are liquidated but refused to say where he would 
get the money on wednesday bakker said he intended to open an 
office near heritage usa and go on television to ask for money 
we need a very large space especially because of the amount 
of mailing well have to do said bakker he said a marketing 
firm has told him he has 1 million willing financial supporters 
well start over again getting individual air stations he 
said we may offer to purchase time on the ptl network we 
started with one station and well start again 
bakker then left for his home in gatlinburg tenn in a black 
lincoln borrowed from the leader of the bring bakkers back movement 
bakker left ptl after charges that jessica hahn a church 
secretary was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with 
him his departure was followed by revelations about a lavish 
lifestyle and he was defrocked by the assemblies of god

a teenage arab prostitute shot and killed an 
18yearold jewish seminary student with a pistol before dawn today 
in a park near israels parliament building authorities said 
police chief yossi yehudai said the girls motive was unclear 
the 17yearold israeli citizen was arrested later and confessed 
he said 
in a landmark decision a court in the city of ramle convicted 
four israelis of violating a law that bars contacts with the plo 
the judges ruled that the four leftwing activists acted 
illeglly when they met a 15member plo delegation in costinesti 
romania in november 1986 
amnon zichrony an attorney for the four told the associated 
press they were the first people convicted of an israeli law passed 
in 1986 that bars unauthorized contacts with members of 
terrorist groups israel considers the palestine liberation 
organization a terrorist group 
zichrony said his clients latif dory yael lotan reuven 
kaminer and eliezer feiler would appeal the decision they face a 
maximum threeyear sentence 
judge avraham baiser rejected defense arguments that the plo was 
not a terrorist organization saying the acts of terrorism have 
not ceased although here and there we do hear some different talk 
the jerusalem attack came a day after prime minister yitzhak 
shamir warned palestinian underground leaders to end their 
6monthold uprising against israeli rule in the occupied lands 
the israeli killed today was the third since arabs in the 
territories revolted on dec 8 army figures say 207 palestinians 
have been killed 157 of them shot to death by soldiers 
city police spokesman rafi levy described the shooting as a 
terrorist attack apparently related to the uprising in the lands 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war 
however he said other motives for the shooting were being 
investigated including insanity 
levy identified the victim as eliezer shlesinger 18 a student 
at shaarei chesed a religious seminary near the park where the 
shooting occurred 
the girl whom police declined to identify because she is a 
minor went to the park with two clients at about 130 am levy 
said 
they encountered two seminary students who were there by 
chance she spoke to them and then suddenly took out a pistol and 
fired levy added 
shlesinger was hit by five bullets and killed the other student 
was unhurt but reportedly being treated for shock 
levy said a security officer who passed by the park and heard 
the shots grabbed the girl as she fled the scene she later 
admitted to the shooting after questioning he said 
yehudai said the girl lived in jerusalem and spoke fluent hebrew 
a fellow student said shlesinger went to the park with a friend 
to get fresh air after a long day of studying 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc was chosen wednesday 
to be his partys candidate to lead the country if likud wins the 
november general election 
do we still have to prove that we have the power to cut off 
every hand that is raised against us if we havent proven it 
already we will have to increase the pressure shamir told party 
delegates 
also wednesday a military source said the army had started to 
negotiate with arab village leaders in the occupied lands 
promising them rewards if they ensure calm 
defense minister yitzhak rabin meanwhile met with four 
palestinians from the occupied gaza strip his third such meeting 
in a week a defense official said 
the participants discussed political issues such as a final 
settlement for the occupied territories during the twohour 
meeting said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
authorities refused to name the palestinians who participated in 
the meeting saying their lives might be in danger if the 
information was disclosed 
israel television said army officials on wednesday met with 
leaders of several villages near the west bank town of jenin 
the report said leaders of the village of yamun reached a 
cooperation agreement with the army the report did not elaborate

greeting comrades lets go to the videotape 
of the farm equipment 
no its not the stuff that great nielsen ratings are made of 
but its good enough to pull in 150 million viewers a night in the 
soviet union 
vremya the soviet news show also picked up a few million 
american viewers this week thanks to the discovery channel which 
ran it each night of the summit meeting between president reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the discovery channel available on cable in about 32 million 
households supplied a running translation with the newscast the 
show as they see it soviet nightly news was introduced by 
hodding carter 
if american viewers were surprised by what they saw quite 
possibly so were soviets 
though stodgy farm equipment stories and use of still 
photographs instead of videotape illustrated a continuing lack of 
sophistication in soviet television there were segments of monday 
nights edition of vremya that suggested major changes in 
soviet tv coverage since the advent of glasnost gorbachevs policy 
of openness 
for instance there was a report on a meeting between president 
reagan and dissidents the fact that it was reported at all was 
surprising though it was described rather snidely by a commentator 
as not objective he added however that the soviet union 
might learn something about human rights from the united states 
other segments included coverage of nancy reagans meeting with 
cute moscow schoolchildren who sang its a small world after 
all the soviet segment was hardly distinguishable from american 
coverage of similar events suggesting fluff is the same the world 
over 
vremya opened with the biggest and seemingly dullest story 
of the day the status of arms negotiations described by a 
stylishly dressed anchorwoman in a droning official commentary 
much of the reporting on the reagangorbachev meetings was 
traditional the coanchors the man and woman do not acknowledge 
each others existence read official communiques that included 
long lists of those present at official events 
it hardly was exciting television but important to soviets who 
closely follow the rising and falling fortunes of various officials 
as indicated by their public appearances or disappearances 
there was virtually no contribution from reporters on the scene 
though there was videotape from a banquet the gorbachevs threw for 
the reagans 
carter explained that much of the banquet coverage was cut 
because vremya ran 35 minutes longer than its usual 40 minutes 
to include the speeches by gorbachev and reagan in their entirety 
american viewers would long since have switched to wheel of 
fortune 
but in the past soviet tv cameras were forbidden to show such 
scenes as the flowerdecked tables at the gorbachev banquet and a 
waiter could be seen carrying a bottle of wine despite gorbachevs 
policy of antialcoholism 
before gorbachev came to power the wives of soviet leaders were 
rarely shown on television but raisa gorbachev was seen 
prominently sitting just in front of reagan at the banquet reading 
from the text of his speech as he delivered his remarks a later 
segment treated her as an important soviet official in her own 
right as she dedicated a statue symbolizing peace 
while the soviet and american leaders talked so did vladimir 
posner and nbc anchor tom brokaw for vremya it is a small 
world after all because as every tv journalist soviet or 
american knows when youre stuck with what is basically a nonews 
event what do you do 
interview each other

the city has decided its all right if 
steers wear the pants at rodeos 
animal rights activists had asked the livermore area recreation 
and park district board to ban use of electric prods and the steer 
dressing event at the livermore rodeo 
odd animal events are the main issue not the rodeo said 
paul miller from the peninsula humane society 
but the board wednesday decided to allow both the prods and the 
steer dressing event in which cowboys chase steers and try to 
dress their hind legs in a pair of blue jeans 
many rodeo events dont represent what is done on the ranch 
and should be stopped said doll stanley a member of the fund for 
animals 
the standingroomonly crowd at the agency meeting included more 
than 100 flagwaving rodeo fans and only a handful of animal rights 
activists the cowboys in the crowd greeted the decision with 
cheers 
if im ever reincarnated send me back as a rodeo animal 
said jack roddy a professional rodeo cowboy 
kim baker 18yearold president of the california high school 
rodeo association said of the activists efforts this is the 
first step and next year it will be something else it seems 
eventually rodeo is just going to die

president reagans statement that indians 
were given reservations to humor them undermines us criticism 
of the way the soviets treat their minorities an indian 
businessman said 
its just another one of his scary remarks another in a long 
series of political and mental lapses walter bressette a 
chippewa indian said wednesday 
it belies a real lack of any understanding of american 
history said james schlender executive administrator of the 
great lakes fish and wildlife commission 
reagan in remarks to soviet university students during the 
moscow summit said maybe we made a mistake in trying to 
maintain indian cultures 
maybe we should not have humored them in that wanting to stay 
in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe we should have said 
no come join us be citizens along with the rest of us reagan 
said

out their religion language and customs 
indians prefer to live among one another and to practice our 
own religion said thunder of madison

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini today 
appointed parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani acting 
commanderinchief of irans armed forces irans official media 
reported 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said the 
move had been proposed by president ali khamenei who is also 
chairman of the supreme defense council which determines irans 
strategy in the war against iraq 
khomeini has held the title of commanderinchief but overall 
strategy has been determined by khamenei rafsanjani who is 
khomeinis respresentative on the supreme defense council and 
other leaders 
khomeinis decision followed two serious iranian defeats in the 
7yearold iraniraq war and major gains by radicals and militants 
in twostage parliamentary elections in april and may that 
strengthened rafsanjani 
tehran radio also monitored in cyprus said khomeinis decree 
said that rafsanjani was taking over command of irans forces at a 
time when imperialist america in collaboration with east and 
west and the reactionary states of the region are trying to 
confront islam and iran and prevent the victory of the islamic 
revolution 
the radio said khomeini noted i hereby want all the dear 
people of iran and military forces to be patient and resistant and 
stand against the conspiracies of global arrogance 
global arrogance is the phrase iran uses to describe the 
united states and its allies 
khomeinis move clearly strengthens rafsanjanis position in the 
government and indicates that khamenei apparently has been edged 
out 
a major shakeup in irans military command had been expected 
since the iraqi army pushed the iranians out of their important 
bridgehead east of iraqs southern port city of basra in a 
lightning assault on may 25 
the iraqis recaptured the faw peninsula south of basra in a 
twoday assault april 1618 driving the iranians back across the 
shatt alarab waterway two years after they seized the dusty finger 
of land 
those defeats cost the iranians their main footholds on iraqi 
soil and were seen as major military setbacks at a time of 
political uncertainty in tehran and apparent economic problems 
after the loss of faw khomeini replaced the armed forces chief 
of staff brig gen ismael sohrabi with a littleknown officer 
col ali shahbazi and promoted him to brigadier general 
western military analysts said at the time that more heads are 
expected to roll 
shahbazi 42 a regular army officer has a background in 
guerrilla warfare and has commanded armored units 
rafsanjanis appointment came as military analysts expected the 
tehran hierarchy to reassess its strategy of attrition against iraq 
following their twin defeats 
the iraqis had expected the fighting in both cases to take 
several days but to their surprise the faw assault took less than 
36 hours and the iranians were rolled back from their positions in 
10 hours 
irans official media has reported tens of thousands of 
basij or volunteers have been dispatched to the front in 
recent days but there was no clear evidence of any major single 
buildup along the 730mile war front

the third announced us nuclear weapons 
test in less than three weeks rocked the nevada desert today and 
registered distinctly on seismic equipment atop hotels and casinos 
here 110 miles from ground zero 
the device buried 2000 feet below the desert floor was 
detonated at 6 am in the fifth such test of the year at the 
1350squaremile nevada test site 
the test was conducted within hours of the close of the moscow 
summit where nuclear testing was among the topics discussed the 
soviets and the united states formally agreed to monitor each 
others tests beginning this summer 
the blast had an explosive force of up to 150 kilotons or the 
equivalent of 150000 tons of tnt the atomic bomb that destroyed 
hiroshima had a yield of 13 kilotons all tests are listed as less 
than 20 kilotons or 20 to 150 kilotons 
managers of highrise buildings in las vegas are warned when 
tests are expected to reach near the upper limit such a warning 
was issued tuesday 
the blast measured 53 on the richter scale the equivalent of a 
moderate to strong earthquake at the national earthquake 
information center in golden colo 
everything appears normal energy department spokeswoman 
barbara yoerg said as she monitored the blast from a point 31 miles 
from ground zero nothing is coming out of the ground 
the success of the underground tests is measured in part by 
the ability to prevent radiation from leaking into the atmosphere 
doe seismic equipment atop the golden nugget and mint hotels in 
downtown las vegas and the el rancho hotel on the las vegas strip 
recorded the blast distinctly said ms yoerg 
security guards at several las vegas hotels said they did not 
feel any motion from the blast as they often do with large 
detonations

a us missile cruiser today watched an 
iranian navy frigate stop board and then escort away a cypriot 
cargo ship apparently suspected of carrying warrelated cargo for 
iraq 
us navy officials who reported the incident in the southern 
persian gulf said the iranian ship tentatively identified as the 
1540ton frigate alborz was acting within maritime law that 
allows for visit and search in international waters 
there was no confrontation or exchange of radio messages between 
the american warship the 9400ton vincennes and either of the 
other two vessels according to lt cmdr mark van dyke a us 
navy spokesman officials on the vincennes watched the incident 
from two miles away 
the cypriot ship identified by gulfbased shipping executives 
as the 10000ton cargo vessel vevey did not request assistance 
and did not appear to be in any distress van dyke said 
however he said it was the closest that any american and 
iranian warships have come to each other in the gulf since april 
18 when us ships and aircraft sank or disabled six iranian craft 
in a series of clashes in the southern gulf and the strait of 
hormuz 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
the vincennes had the others in view as the iranian frigate 
stopped the cypriot ship launched a small boat that put a search 
party on board and then escorted her off in a northeasterly 
direction van dyke said 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit in london said the vevey was 
carrying italian marble powder and chips to kuwait and the saudi 
arabian port of jubail 
lloyds said the cypriot vessel apparently was boarded by 
eight iranians and was being escorted to bandar abbas a major 
iranian port and naval base in the strait of hormuz 
tehran considers both saudi arabia and kuwait to be allies of 
iraq and frequently attacks ships bound to or from ports in those 
countries it also regularly stops and searches vessels that it 
suspects of carrying warrelated materiel and sometimes takes the 
ships into detention 
the vincennes a sophisticated electronics warfare ship and the 
most powerful ever deployed by the united states to the gulf was 
on its first week of patrol duty in the area some 25 miles 
northeast of dubai

president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev bade 
farewell at the kremlin today concluding a summit long on good 
will but short of achievement gorbachev said they had moved 
superpower relations from a dangerous track to a safer one and 
reagan expressed hope for an era of peace 
ending the first visit to the soviet union by an american 
president in 14 years reagan said he had been moved by the 
reception he got in moscow gorbachev took the occasion to prod 
reagan to move faster on the issues facing the two superpowers 
the talks completed the most frequent superpower summits in 
history four in just 30 months underscoring the dramatic 
turnaround in ussoviet relations since the first meeting in 
1985 dwight eisenhower and richard nixon each had three summits 
with their soviet counterparts 
air force one took off from vnukovo airport in a light drizzle 
at approximately 1115 am local time reagan arrived at londons 
heathrow airport just after 1130 am local time the president 
had meetings scheduled there with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher gorbachev faces by months end the convening of the 
first communist party conference since 1941 
secretary of state george p shultz who flew separately to 
brussels belgium to brief americas nato allies called the talks 
a good realistic businesslike summit meeting and defense 
secretary frank carlucci flew to tokyo an unnamed japanese defense 
ministry official quoted carlucci as saying the united states had 
asked the soviets to urge north korea to exercise restraint during 
the upcoming summer olympic games in seoul 
the meetings here produced renewed vows by leaders to improve 
eastwest relations and put into force the firstever treaty to 
eliminate nuclear weapons but tensions over regional conflicts 
lingered and reagan and gorbachev did not advance prospects for a 
longrange missile treaty in any substantive fashion 
the reagans said goodbye to the gorbachevs in the same kremlin 
hall where americas first couple was greeted on sunday walking 
along the same red carpet in the hall of st george after brief 
remarks the four chatted amiably and then parted company a moment 
later 
raisa gorbachev presented nancy reagan a bouquet of roses in 
what perhaps will the last encounter for two first ladies whose 
relationship never was warm 
this is an emotional moment for mrs reagan and me the 
president said telling the gorbachevs he had seen and learned much 
about this moscow spring 
reagan said he was impressed with the soviet people he 
encountered 
at first they were curious faces but as time went on the 
smiles began and then the waves he said and i dont have to 
tell you nancy and i smiled back and waved just as hard 
gorbachev thanked reagan for cooperation openness and a 
businesslike approach to the talks that we have had here 
but the communist party general secretary also said there were 
missed opportunities at the moscow summit 
our dialogue has not been easy gorbachev said but we 
mustered enough realism and political will to overcome obstacles 
and divert the train of ussoviet relations from a dangerous 
track to a safer one it is however so far been moving much more 
slowly than is required 
 
as reagan traveled to great britain white house chief of staff 
howard baker told reporters aboard air force one that gorbachev had 
challenged the president at their windup summit meeting over the 
wording of the final communique 
baker said the two leaders were going at it pretty heavy until 
the end among other things the us side disagreed with some 
language in the communique that was used in the context of a 
broader embrace by both countries of the concept of peaceful 
coexistence 
baker said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further on 
arms control but said we came out just about where it was 
predicted we could come out it would have been nice if we could 
have gone any further but nobody expected us to go any further 
in an interview on abctvs good morning america shultz 
said we had lots of things that were worked out and weve had 
some very realistic strong discussion where we didnt agree and 
thats in the nature of this case i think its a sign of 
maturity and perhaps greater stability that we can wrangle on 
these things and agree on other things 
their work done on their final night in moscow the reagans 
went to the bolshoi ballet with the gorbachevs and dined privately 
with their hosts at a dacha in the countryside outside moscow 
then the reagans took an impromptu stroll through red square 
which was brightly illuminated by mobile floodlights brought in by 
networks to provide a backdrop for their evening newscasts 
i didnt want her to miss it reagan said holding hands 
with nancy 
reagan and gorbachev actually concluded their formal talks 
wednesday reporting scant progress on arms control and none on 
human rights disputes 
after five days in moscow reagan will have tea with queen 
elizabeth ii at buckingham palace and dine with mrs thatcher at 
no 10 downing street on friday reagan will deliver a postsummit 
speech summing up eastwest relations then return to washington 
on his arrival at heathrow airport reagan was greeted by 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe and a light drizzle from 
overcast skies after shaking hands and waving to a small crowd 
under the watchful eyes of police guards armed with submachine 
guns the reagans boarded a helicopter and flew to the winfield 
house residence of us ambassador charles h price ii in regents 
park 
despite the lack of major agreements gorbachev called their 
meetings a blow to the foundations of the cold war reagan went 
to extraordinary lengths to praise the soviet leader seemingly 
absolving the kremlin leadership for erecting barriers to 
emigration he blamed the emigration walls on the soviet 
bureaucracy saying any government has that kind of problem 
arriving today at winfield house in london the 35room mansion 
where he will stay reagan was asked what he meant in moscow when 
he seemed to blame the bureaucracy for restricting emigration 
i dont think i made it that definite but that is some of the 
problems there just as there are in our country he replied i 
was answering a question a specific question that is not to say 
that it was not all just a bureaucracy 
asked whether gorbachev himself might be responsible for the 
repressive laws reagan responded i was trying to put out that 
sometimes cases of that kind do not get that far up the ladder 
while the two leaders deepened their relationship the 
longrumored feud between their wives flared into the open 
mrs reagan and mrs gorbachev dropped all pretense of the 
handholding relationship that had been portrayed earlier in the 
week and competed for the spotlight in a duel that mrs reagan said 
ended in a mexican standoff

a lawyer for a former professor suing to become 
the fifth woman to receive tenure in harvard business schools 
history pressed on with the trial today rather than accept a delay 
to gather more evidence 
us district judge douglas p woodlock on wednesday ruled that 
harvard withheld key documents in the sexdiscrimination case and 
he recommended suspending the nonjury trial so the attorney for 
barbara bund jackson could question professors who abruptly 
withdrew support for her tenure bid in 1981 
my fundamental view is that cases should be decided on the 
merits and evidence worth submitting when possible woodlock said 
today 
but the attorney evan t lawson said today we simply dont 
have the emotional resources let alone the financial resources to 
embark on what we see as being an extremely complicated and lengthy 
procedure 
closing arguments then began in the trial now in its eighth 
day jackson contends that she was denied tenure because of her sex 
and that lessqualified men than her received tenure 
during testimony a professor said the schools faculty voted 
477 to support her bid for tenure but two days later backed her by 
only 2927 tenure decisions at harvard are submitted to the 
faculty to gauge support for the professor the actual decision 
rests with the university president 
lawson had filed a motion seeking to sanction harvard for 
failing to provide evidence about the vote under a court order 
requiring that the university turn over all documents relating to 
jackson 
he asked the judge to bar harvard from using the second vote to 
prove its contention that jackson was denied tenure solely because 
her academic performance was below standard but the judge denied 
the request today 
suspending the trial would have required testimony from 
professors who switched their votes and would have pushed the case 
well into the fall attorneys for both sides said 
lawson maintained that testimony by a harvard professor shows 
that business school dean john h mcarthur lobbied the faculty to 
switch votes to oppose jackson who began teaching at the school in 
1973 
jackson resigned in 1984 after she was denied tenure a second 
time in 1983 
at issue is the question of academic privilege the right of a 
university to keep confidential the names of professors involved in 
judging candidates for tenure 
in recommending suspending the trial woodlock said its a 
pattern of limitations placed on proof limitations by 
destruction limitations by late disclosure and limitations on 
proof by this privilege 
in her suit jackson also alleges the school destroyed documents 
requested by her to support her claim that lessqualified men 
received tenure from 1974 to 1984 harvard said the destruction was 
inadvertent 
harvard attorney allan a ryan jr indicated the school might 
risk being held in contempt of court and refuse to provide the 
names of the professors to preserve their academic privilege 
the school claims that failing to provide the 1981 votes was an 
oversight and that lawson never specifically requested the results 
jackson 44 now a private marketing consultant first applied 
for tenure in 1981 
after failing to gain tenure jackson was given a threeyear 
extension on her appointment she submitted new academic work for 
review but in 1983 was rebuffed again she sued in 1984 
three of the business schools 90 tenured professors are women 
four women have received tenure in the business schools 80year 
history the first in 1961

a teacher of marxismleninism today renewed calls 
for the publication of nikita s khrushchevs 1956 secret 
speech denouncing stalin and said it is a secret only from soviet 
communists like himself 
if the party is keeping secrets from communists in the pages 
of its history that are not state secrets then it is clear that it 
doesnt serve the unity of the party said v rusakov dean of 
the philosophy and scientific communism department at sverdlovsk 
agricultural institute and a member of the party 
rusakovs comments appeared in an article published in todays 
editions of the sovietskaya kultura newspaper it appeared to be 
the latest example in the leaderships campaign to open up the 
pages of soviet history 
khrushchevs address to the 20th party congress held three 
years after the death of josef v stalin in 1953 detailed the 
dictators actions in the 29 years he served as soviet leader 
western historians estimate that 20 million soviets were killed 
in political purges carried out under stalin and in the drive to 
collectivize agriculture 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness on selected topics stalins 
crimes are no longer a taboo subject and the name of khrushchev 
who was ousted as leader in 1964 is appearing more frequently in 
the press 
the call by rusakov to publish khrushchevs denuncation of 
stalin is not the first in october prominent soviet scientist 
vitaly i goldansky also said khrushchevs report known in the 
west as his secret speech because it was delivered behind 
closed doors should be published 
rusakov said the text of khrushchevs speech was leaked almost 
immediately in the west 
all the world a long time ago read the secret report by ns 
khrushchev but an overwhelming majority of soviet communists 
dont know this document which so radically changed the evaluation 
of the development of the party and the state the educator wrote

rose cipollone had a form of lung cancer not 
usually associated with smoking a tobacco company lawyer told a 
jury hearing final arguments today in a lawsuit against three 
cigarette makers 
lawyers representing mrs cipollones widower must convince 
you that cigarettesmoking caused rose cipollones lung cancer 
not that smoking causes cancer in general lorillard inc attorney 
robert northrip argued in the closely watched product liability 
case 
in his summation he noted the testimony of medical experts for 
the defense who said mrs cipollones cancer bore all the signs of 
atypical carcinoid which they contend is not statistically 
associated with smoking 
experts for the plaintiff testified mrs cipollone had small 
cell carcinoma which is tied to cigarettes and argued that 
atypical carcinoid also results from smoking 
antonio cipollone accuses lorillard philip morris inc and 
liggett group inc of misleading the public about the dangers of 
smoking and contributing to his 58yearold wifes death in 1984 
after 40 years of smoking 
on wednesday liggett attorney donald j cohn said mrs 
cipollone had a right to smoke knowing the risks and a maker of 
her cigarettes has a first amendment right to say smoking is not a 
proven cancercause 
mrs cipollone enjoyed smoking and that was why she continued 
to smoke and she didnt want anyone to tell her not to do it 
cohn who represents liggett group inc told jurors in the 
courtroom packed with about 150 spectators 
in the us district court lawsuit against liggett lorillard 
inc and philip morris co antonio cipollone contends they misled 
the public about the dangers of cigarettes 
if the jury awards the 64yearold retired construction worker 
damages which are not specified it would be the first time a 
tobacco company has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by 
smokers and their families 
attorneys for the other companies were scheduled to present 
summations today 
the case filed in 1983 is one of fewer than a dozen smoker 
liability lawsuits to reach a jury and other lawyers bringing 
similar actions say a cipollone victory could spur a new wave of 
litigation smoking opponents argue that a defeat for cipollone 
might permanently stifle such lawsuits because of the effort time 
and expense put into the case by his side 
the case was expected to go to the jury monday 
cohn called mrs cipollone an intelligent strongwilled person 
who was used to making decisions for herself and family she 
did what she wanted to do 
the case rests on the simple proposition that if you believe 
the testimony of rose cipollone and her family that she smoked 
cigarettes because she wanted to and because she liked to even 
though she knew the risks then the jury should return a 
verdict for liggett and myers cohn said 
cohn returned often to her own testimony given in 1984 and read 
to the jury and noted her response during an interview with an 
addiction expert who reminded her of the first surgeon generals 
report on smoking in 1964 
i didnt want to hear it i liked to smoke i liked the way i 
looked it gave me something to do 
cipollone says the companies through inadequate research and a 
failure to publicize what they knew about the dangers of smoking 
should be held liable for damages in his wifes death 
however cohn asserted that the companies had a first amendment 
right to express their belief that smoking has not been proven to 
cause cancer 
there was a raging controversy about smoking and health in the 
press and in a free country people are entitled to express an 
opinion and that was what was going on he said 
through a series of pretrial rulings and a major decision last 
month by the trial judge h lee sarokin most of cipollones 
claims were cut from the lawsuit 
the jury must still determine whether each company intentionally 
misrepresented claims about the health consequences of smoking and 
whether each conspired to do so as for liggett the jury will 
consider claims that the company failed to warn the public about 
the risks of its products and whether liggett violated its 
warranty duties 
mrs cipollone smoked liggetts cigarettes before 1966 the year 
warnings were put on cigarette packs the courts have ruled that 
the warnings preempt failuretowarn claims after that year 
both sides presented dozens of witnesses including company 
executives company researchers physicians medical experts 
advertising and marketing experts and cipollone family members

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis canceled todays debate with jesse jackson and was 
returning home to boston to be with his wife who was to undergo 
surgery a spokesman said 
dukakis who flew to california late wednesday for campaign 
appearances and then the debate in los angeles hoped to resume his 
schedule by saturday said campaign spokesman mark gearan 
gearan said kitty dukakis would be operated on friday for two 
herniated cervical disks in her neck 
he said there were no other problems beyond the disks he said 
mrs dukakis underwent tests recently while in california and her 
doctors in boston decided an operation was required after reviewing 
the results 
mrs dukakis 53 was admitted to massachusetts general hospital 
wednesday night she told told reporters at logan international 
airport as she arrived in town that she had begun to experience 
numbness in her hands and fingers about a month ago and called a 
family doctor 
he and i felt at that time it was just stress she said 
adding that her symptoms worsened in recent weeks 
her husband had resumed his california campaign earlier today 
five days before the states big primary 
dukakis has been campaigning this week in new jersey which also 
holds its primary on tuesday along with new mexico and montana 
the massachusetts governor is far ahead of jackson in the 
nationwide delegate tally and is heavily favored to win the 
primary here 
in recent days however dukakis has been engaged in a delicate 
minuet with jackson over his rivals role in the fall campaign 
dukakis who says he wont pick a running mate until after the 
final primaries june 7 lauded jacksons strong campaign 
hes somebody who has done a remarkable job has great gifts 
and great strengths i respect and admire him a lot dukakis told 
reporters in boston 
the massachusetts governor was questioned about jacksons role 
one day after jackson said in new jersey that he felt he had 
earned consideration for the second spot on the ballot 
asked if that was so dukakis responded because he has done 
so well of course he does 
he added that all of the democratic presidential candidates had 
earned the standing within the party to be considered for the 
ticket 
but when asked if jackson deserved any special consideration by 
virtue of having compiled the secondhighest number of delegates 
dukakis answered with a blunt no 
in a speech on wednesday dukakis stressed his commitment to 
expanding opportunities for higher education calling it a 
prerequisite for full participation in the nations economic future 
we need a president who will end the annual assault on pell 
grants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students dukakis 
said we need to put our smartest investment bankers and college 
administrators to work helping states to create college opportunity 
funds 
speaking at the states newest community college in bostons 
roxbury section the traditional core of the citys black 
community the governor called for a new nationwide college loan 
program 
we can develop an approach based on the same principles as 
social security that will keep faith with the next generation he 
said 
dukakis said his program would provide tuition loans to needy 
students after graduation students would repay the loans through 
payroll withholding thus ensuring that the governnment would not 
be saddled with unpaid loans

if nothing else the moscow summit was a public 
relations triumph for mikhail s gorbachev 
although it produced little progress on arms control the 
reagangorbachev summit showed the soviets at their best under the 
intense scrutiny of 5000 soviet and foreign journalists who 
crowded central moscow 
soviet officials were accessible and doggedly spontaneous 
everhovering kgb agents were usually young and welldressed 
streets were swept clean and restaurants offered two moscow 
rarities attentive service and fresh vegetables 
even the weather cooperated it didnt start raining until 
president reagan was ready to leave vnukovo airport 
veteran moscow observers said the soviets in style if not in 
substance are increasingly emulating the west 
one littleknown reason why the new soviet image appeals to 
americans is that soviet officials have frequently but quietly 
sought pr advice from americans 
us imagemakers responded with a variety of suggestions they 
said security agents should wear lighter less drab colors and 
soviet officials should favor opencollared shirts instead of ties 
and try to be more accessible 
they also suggested that soviet analysts establish eye contact 
because as one public relations specialist explained it 
connotes trust 
the soviets certainly dont want to give americans the credit 
but there is no denying that some things went off very well because 
of both our input and their observance of us at the previous three 
summits said john s kavulich chairman of a washington dc 
marketing firm that has worked with the soviets since 1986 
officials from gorbachev on down werent running away from the 
television cameras they were stepping up to them kavulich said 
the soviets usually carried off media events with a flair and 
they reinforced the idea that they have a sense of humor 
in a move clearly intended to appeal to westerners the official 
soviet news agency tass sold summit tshirts buttons records and 
tapes for foreign currency it was the first time that tass had 
lent its name to a commercial enterprise 
some observers suggested the soviets might even have worked some 
magic with the weather using chemicals to disperse rain clouds as 
they did in 1986 for the goodwill games and the 1985 opening of the 
world youth festival 
there were some glitches hours after president and mrs reagan 
arrived sunday for the fiveday summit they took an unscheduled 
stroll along moscows pedestrian mall on arbat street 
soviet agents obviously were unprepared for presidential 
spontaneity forcing themselves between the reagans and the soviet 
crowd the agents jostled the president and the startled first lady 
as well as journalists and passersby 
the soviets knew the reagans would have some spontaneous event 
to match gorbachevs walk along connecticut avenue during the 
washington summit in december kavulich said 
agents on the street were told to let the president approach a 
crowd of muscovites if he wants but apparently for the agents 
acting as a wedge between soviets and foreigners was almost a 
reflexive action he said 
nevertheless as one us diplomat said privately the soviets 
are probably patting themselves on the back they went every night 
into homes throughout america and as each night passed they 
became more familiar and more welcome guests

democrat michael dukakis cut short a california campaign trip 
and canceled todays debate with jesse jackson to return to boston 
where his wife faced surgery to relieve neck pain jackson was 
meeting today with juvenile gangs in los angeles while republican 
george bush relaxed in maine 
bush has been making few public appearances in recent days while 
president reagan has been at the summit in moscow however bush 
did hint in an interview published today that embattled attorney 
general edwin meese iii could be hurting his candidacy 
both dukakis and jackson had flown to california wednesday night 
for campaigning in the days leading up to next tuesdays primary 
the last and biggest delegate prize of the long primary season 
however dukakis was flying right back to massachusetts after a 
single morning campaign appearance today said spokesman mark 
gearan 
gearan said kitty dukakis would be operated on friday for two 
herniated cervical disks in her neck she had felt pain and 
numbness for about a month he said and doctors believed it was 
a degenerative condition rather than the result of a single 
injury 
mrs dukakis 53 was admitted to massachusetts general hospital 
wednesday night she told told reporters her symptoms had worsened 
in recent weeks 
bush was spending a final full day today at his oceanside 
retreat in kennebunkport and the only order of business was having 
his boat checked for safety by the coast guard 
the vice president has been holding strategy sessions with 
advisers all week and one of the key topics has been possible 
issues on which bush will set himself apart from his popular boss 
reagan has given his full support to meese who is under 
investigation by an independent counsel but bush in an interview 
with the new york times hinted that if meeses woes continue the 
matter could be a campaign liability for him the democrats have 
been using the issue for months to attack him 
i think hes been made aware by the polls and by a lot of 
public comment that there is the danger that this matter if it 
stays exactly the way it is could not only adversely affect me 
but affect others as well bush said of meese in the interview 
published today 
bush said over the weekend that he had met recently with meese 
and the attorney general had promised not to do anything that would 
harm his campaign meese said monday in a cable news network 
interview however that he believed the justice departments 
record would be an asset to any republican candidate 
bush told the times he expected to meet with meese again soon 
dukakis who has an allbut insurmountable delegate lead has 
been beset by questions all week about jacksons role in the fall 
campaign both men have said jackson will play a major but as yet 
undetermined part in the expected race against bush 
jackson campaigning in new jersey on wednesday asserted for a 
second day in a row that he has earned consideration as a potential 
running mate 
dukakis agreed with that but balked when asked if jackson in 
view of his demonstrated votegetting ability had any special 
claim on the no 2 spot 
no the massachusetts governor said flatly but he also said 
of his rival i respect and admire him a lot 
jackson who drew overwhelming black support in the primary 
contests has been stressing that the party needs him in order to 
win the general election 
party officials appear mindful of that democratic national 
committee chairman paul kirk announced wednesday that a 15member 
platformdrafting panel would be headed up by rep william gray of 
pennsylvania a jackson supporter 
however dukakis was predicting he could draw genuine and 
deep black support in his own right 
the governor who started off the week by meeting with black 
supporters made a campaignstyle visit on wednesday to a community 
college in the predominantly black roxbury section of boston 
there he cited a groundswell of black backing for his candidacy 
i sense it he said 
jackson meanwhile was marching through the los angeles ghetto 
of watts which was torn by riots in the 1960s where you 
struggle i will struggle he told cheering supporters wednesday 
night 
jackson was also meetig today with members of the rival crips 
and bloods gangs the bloody battles of los angeles gangs were 
dramatized in the recent movie colors 
campaign aides said they believed it would be the first time the 
rival gang leaders got together 
while dukakis and jackson prepared for the primary finale a 
past democratic presidential contender jumped into the race 
former sen eugene mccarthy whose campaign two decades ago was 
a rallying point for opponents of the vietnam war announced his 
candidacy on wednesday in philadelphia mccarthy 72 is running on 
the consumer party ticket in his fourth presidential effort 
he ran as a democrat in 1968 and 1972 and as an independent in 
1976 
this year the one thing we have to do is shake up the 
twoparty system and thats what i hope to do he said 
mccarthy dismissed the likely republican and democratic nominees 
there are two kinds of people who dont make good presidents 
vice presidents and governors he said 
meanwhile dukakis economic policies came under fire from the 
bush camp 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman who met with 
the vice president on wednesday emerged to ridicule the 
massachusetts miracle the economic boom in his state that 
dukakis frequently cites on the campaign trail darman called it 
the massachusetts mirage

farm exports posted their highest levels in 
more than three years in march as the us agricultural trade 
balance ran in the black for a fifth straight month usda 
economists say 
agriculture is making an important contribution to the trade 
balance of the united states agriculture secretary richard e 
lyng said wednesday in a speech to the national press club before 
the figures were released 
he predicted export sales this year of around 33 billion and a 
farm trade surplus of perhaps 12 billion 
exports in march soared to 148 million tons valued at 33 
billion compared with 114 million tons valued at 24 billion the 
same month a year earlier it was the best monthly performance 
since december 1984 
the nations agricultural trade surplus in march was 138 
billion also the largest since december 1984 it was the fifth 
straight month that the nation has posted a surplus of 1 billion 
or more 
usda said fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through march totaled 
773 million tons valued at 178 billion it said that represented 
an increase of 136 million tons and 33 billion from the same 
period last year 
soviet purchases have accounted for 68 percent of the volume 
increase this year 
department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988 exports 
totaling 1455 million tons and valued at 335 billion that 
represents an increase over initial estimates the higher forecasts 
are due to additional sales of animal products as well as wheat 
feeds and fodders and soybeans 
animal products are likely to set a record of 56 billion 
attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides skins red 
meats and fats the department said 
the department also said exports are likely to be 16 million 
tons and 56 billion higher than fiscal 1987 it attributed the 
bulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitor 
nations and the export enhancement program 
the eec established by congress in 1985 pays exporters in 
government surplus commodities to ship american grain overseas 
estimated us agricultural imports meanwhile were increased 
from 205 billion to 21 billion it said imports for march 
totaled 195 billion a gain of 35 million or 2 percent over 
the comparable figure for march 1987 it also was 24 million or 1 
percent over the february level 
the volume of imports was virtually unchanged since last year 
with fruit juices nursery products and alcoholic beverages 
actually posting declines usda said it said however the lower 
dollar raised the overall import bill

agriculture secretary richard e lyng is 
calling on european community trade negotiators to come up with 
their own plan to phase out farm subsidies if they dislike the 
american version 
weve been unable to get the european community even to state 
what the outcome should be lyng said at a national press club 
luncheon wednesday 
he said the united states is not insisting on its plan to phase 
out all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 and is perfectly 
willing to sit down and be involved in negotiations but that 
thus far european trade officials have indicated little interest in 
such bargaining 
they wont come up with any sort of proposal he said 
he expressed hope however that some progress could be made in 
montreal in december at the midterm meeting of the uruguay round of 
negotiations aimed at updating the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade 
we must make this work because the alternatives are so bad 
lyng said he said the current system of subsidies is harmful to 
european and american farmers as well as the economies of 
developing nations but he said the united states could not act 
unilaterally 
our farmers are willing to compete with farmers anywhere but 
they do not want to compete with the treasuries of foreign 
governments he said 
lyng also shrugged off european criticism that the united states 
has increased wheat production when europe has been reducing its 
own wheat production 
i have been unable to detect any reductions in european 
production he said he said the united states already has idled 
acreage equivalent to all of the farmland in france and spain 
together while the reductions they are talking about are 
pipsqueak when they are compared to our reductions 
the administration recently changed the acreage idling 
requirement for participants in the wheat program from 27 percent 
to 10 percent

with one bullet during a brief exchange of gunfire between his 
bodyguards and a christian militia patrol in east beirut on 
thursday police reported 
a us embassy spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the ambassador and all his escorts are fine he refused 
to elaborate 
in another development the shiite moslem amal militia on 
thursday denied it has custody of three american professors and an 
indian professor kidnapped in 1987 
a police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity in line 
with regulations said one bullet hit the hood of kellys 
armorplated dark blue chevrolet in an accidental exchange of 
automatic fire 
he said the gunfire occurred around noon when kellys lebanese 
and american bodyguards in two escort cars fired in the air with 
automatic rifles apparently to make way for the ambassadors 
convoy in a trafficjammed street in the sin fil neighborhood 
kellys motorcade was heading to the heavily guarded us 
embassy compound in the suburb of aukar north of beirut 
the spokesman said a militia patrol from president amin 
gemayels rightist phalange party which was in the area opened 
fire in the air too in an effort to stop kellys convoy to check 
what was happening 
kellys bodyguards fired three bullets at the phalangists in a 
white mercedesbenz and the patrol fired back no casualties were 
reported among the phalangist militiamen he said 
kellys car was hit with one bullet in the hood and the convoy 
continued on its way to the embassy the spokesman added he did 
not elaborate 
hassan youssef foreign relations spokesman for the 
syrianbacked amal militia said a report by the times of london 
that the four kidnapped professors were believed to be in amals 
hands was untrue and totally baseless 
the four are americans robert polhill jesse turner and alann 
steen and indian mithileshwar singh they were kidnapped on the 
campus of beirut university college jan 24 1987 
the times also said that amal leader nabih berri had scheduled a 
news conference for this week and that there is understandable 
speculation that this may be to announce the hostages release 
amals standard policy denounces kidnapping youssef said 
an underground faction calling itself islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine claimed to have abducted the four educators 
and has demanded israel free 400 arab prisoners 
fourteen other foreigners are held hostage in lebanon six 
americans three britons a west german an italian an irishman

correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god were wounded in a brief 
firefight with rival shiite moslem militiamen in south beirut on 
wednesday night

in a fiveminute exchange of fire with members of the amal militia 
in south beiruts shiyah district syrian troops intervened and 
brought the firefight to an end the spokesman said 
the clash was the first reported between the two sides since 
syria deployed 2400 troops in south beirut on friday and saturday 
ending three weeks of clashes between the two rival militias that 
killed nearly 300 people and wounded 1000 
amal arabic for hope accused hezbollah of provoking the clash 
and said the three wounded shiite militiamen were armed with 
silencerequipped pistols 
hezbollah said amal militiamen opened fire at the three 
unarmed hezbollahis as they drove to shiyah to check on their

workers digging feverishly through 
tons of debris pulled 12 bodies from a coal shaft rocked by a 
fierce explosion and officials said they were certain all 57 miners 
had been killed 
today gottfried milde the hesse state interior minister said 
36 bodies had been found in the shaft among those killed was an 
18yearold on his first day at work 
it was west germanys worst mining accident in more than 26 
years 
at least 14 of the men trapped were turkish immigrant workers 
some of the victims had survived the blast but died when their 
emergency masks ran out of oxygen officials said 
family and friends had kept an allnight vigil in this mining 
town 70 miles northeast of frankfurt waiting for the latest word 
on wednesdays disaster which officials attributed to a methane 
gas buildup 
today rescue workers used extrasensitive listening devices 
searching without success for any signs of life or tapping 
the chances of finding any survivors have sunk to zero said 
hesse state mining director wolf boettcher 
erwin braun head of the hesse state mining board told 
reporters today that the explosion was caused by a methane gas 
buildup and said he feared none of the 57 miners who were 330 feet 
underground during the blast had survived 
rescue work is being hindered by heavy damage and rescue 
teams can proceed only with oxygen masks he said explaining 
that there was still the danger of a methane gas buildup in the 
mine 
braun said carbon monoxide levels inside the mine had receded 
but were still severe 
some of the dead were found with their miners breathing masks 
on he said which means they survived the blast and apparently ran 
out of air the breathing devices provide about three hours of 
oxygen 
other miners were killed by the explosion itself and will be 
hard to identify because of the extent of their injuries braun 
said 
the blast blew the roofs off at least three work buildings at 
the mine knocked down sheds and shattered windows eight miners on 
the surface were critically injured by flying debris 
my son dieter is down there hes been a miner for 20 years 
said werner henke an elderly man who was waiting overnight at his 
sons house 
god let him be alive he has two small children henke 
brushing away tears told the associated press 
in a building not far from the mine shaft wives and other 
relatives of the missing workers were consoling each other but 
even they expressed little hope their loved ones would be saved 
that was an incredible explosion said 60yearold gerhard 
hettmanczyk whose soninlaw alfred wiremba was among the missing 
i dont see how anyone could have survived said the somber 
hettmanczyk who was going home after waiting hours for good news 
three rescue workers were being treated at a hospital after 
inhaling fumes from carbon monoxide that was released in the blast 
but their lives were not in danger mayor hessler said 
about 30 rescuers worked inside the mine through the night 
hundreds of others worked under floodlights above ground pumping 
fresh air into the shaft and acting as support for the rescue teams 
the air is very bad in there said klaus hausmann a 
blackened miner who was helping outside things do not look so 
good everything is blocked off 
most of the miners in the shaft at the time of the blast were in 
their 30s and 40s and some of them were turks officials said 
some relatives of the missing began leaving the mine area late 
wednesday night as hopes faded 
about 170 people had been employed at the browncoal mine owned 
by preussen elektra of hanover one of the largest west german 
utility companies 
the mine is set in a field with the nearest homes about 500 
yards away

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on thursday 
appointed parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani acting 
commanderinchief of irans armed forces after major military 
defeats on land and sea 
the appointment increased the political power of the man 
iranians call the shark irans official media monitored in 
nicosia reported that khomeini who has held the title of 
commanderinchief gave rafsanjani full authority to take over 
control of military affairs 
rafsanjanis appointment followed a disastrous confrontation 
with the us navy in the persian gulf and two defeats on the 
battlefield in which the iraqis drove the iranians out of their two 
main footholds inside iraq 
tehran radio said in a commentary it is hoped that this 
transfer of power will be the beginning of major developments on 
the battlefield 
the islamic republic news agency said president ali khamenei had 
asked khomeini to appoint rafsanjani as the only suitable person 
to be assigned this important responsibility to manage affairs 
in a decisive manner 
khamenei is chairman of the supreme defense council which with 
khomeinis approval decides irans military strategy in the war 
against iraq 
rafsanjani 53 is khomeinis representative on the council and 
has long been considered the most powerful figure in iran after 
khomeini 
khomeinis decision to hand over military power to one of his 
closest aides raised speculation that the revolutionary patriarchs 
health is deteriorating khomeini is 87 and has long been reported 
to be in poor health 
rafsanjani is now wellplaced to emerge as the kingmaker in the 
power struggle already under way that will climax when khomeini 
dies 
khomeini has designated ayatollah hussein ali montazeri as his 
successor but montazeri does not have a significant power base and 
is opposed by many iranian leaders 
it is widely believed that rafsanjani and his allies will be the 
power behind the throne in the postkhomeini era big gains by 
radicals backed by khomeini in twostage parliamentary elections 
in april and may at the expense of conservatives helped bolster 
rafsanjanis political influence 
rafsanjani nicknamed the shark because of his political 
acumen is expected to seek to galvanize irans military 
dispirited after its defeats and the nations 50 million people 
who appear to be growing weary of the war 
this appointment is highly significant were going to see a 
whole new ball game now hansheino kopietz a military analyst 
with the londonbased international institute for strategic 
studies said in a telephone interview 
khomeinis decree said rafsanjani was ordered to set up a 
general command headquarters and organize the full coordination 
of the armed forces the revolutionary guards the security forces 
and volunteer mobilization forces 
that suggested an intensified effort to weld irans military 
forces into a more cohesive force than they have been 
deeprooted rivalry between the increasingly powerful 
revolutionary guards corps and the regular army still tainted by 
its links to the late shah have bedeviled military strategy for 
years 
rafsanjani is closely linked with the 350000man revolutionary 
guards known as pasdaran its main commanders mohsen rafiqdoust 
and mohsen rezai are both staunch rafsanjani supporters 
diplomats with contacts in tehran reported that the relative 
ease with which the iraqis overran the iranians in the faw 
peninsula of southern iraq april 18 and at a bridgehead east of the 
port city of basra on may 25 was a severe jolt to the iranian 
hierarchy 
rafsanjanis appointment came as military analysts expected the 
tehran hierarchy to reassess its strategy of attrition against iraq 
following irans twin defeats 
changes had been expected to accelerate after radicals and 
militants many of them rafsanjanis allies made major gains in 
the parliamentary elections 
khomeinis decree as broadcast by tehran radio stressed the 
need for complete unity in the armed forces and the need to 
reorganize logistics militaryrelated industry and training toward 
specific objectives 
rafsanjani declared iran was at war with the united states 
last month after the us navy sank or disabled six iranian 
vessels including two frigates in clashes in the persian gulf on 
april 18 
after the loss of faw khomeini replaced the armed forces chief 
of staff brig gen ismael sohrabi with a littleknown officer 
col ali shahbazi and promoted him to brigadier general 
western military analysts said at the time that more heads are 
expected to roll but the iranians have not announced any other 
command changes 
khomeini said in a speech read out at the inauguration of the 
new parliament last week that the war would be decided on the 
battlefield not the negotiating table that indicated the 
revolutionary patriarch was determined to avenge the faw and basra 
defeats 
us defense department analysts said in washington that iraqs 
victories meant it was now conceivable that iraq having gone onto 
the offensive after years of static defense could break the 
stalemate in the ground war

eli lilly amp co has not closed the door to the 
use of its herbicide spike in a state department program to 
spray south american coca bushes a house subcommittee chairman 
said today 
rep glenn english whose house government operations panel is 
reviewing the battle against illegal drugs said he spoke to 
company representatives after the state department criticized the 
company during a hearing wednesday 
he said lilly officials have objected to use of the chemical 
tebuthiuron known as spike because they have not done the 
proper testing of application by air over a wide section of 
countryside they have no data they have not seen data from the 
state department and cannot assume responsibility or liability 
ted mckinney a spokesman for the indianapolisbased company 
had no immediate comment on englishs statement 
but he did say that the chemical is applied both by air and on 
the ground in the united states 
he described tebuthiuron as a broadspectrum soilapplied 
herbicide for brush and weed control on noncropland pasture and 
rangeland the herbicide is approved for use in grazing lands 
wildlife openings along ditchbanks and utility rights of way it 
is safe for humans livestock wildlife and the environment when 
used according to label directions 
english an oklahoma democrat said 
we will continue discussions we need to acquire a herbicide 
against coca bushes as quickly as possible at this point my own 
perception is the door is open discussions will continue and 
hopefully a solution can be found to this particular problem 
englishs statement was toned down considerably from his comment 
wednesday that lilly was a deserter in the war on drugs 
the congressman later clarified his remarks to say there had not 
been proper aerial testing in the cocaproducing region of peru 
where the chemical would be sprayed he said the area has 
considerable groundwater and therefore is much different from the 
dry brush areas where it is used in the united states 
he added that the company also was concerned that the coca area 
in peru may not be in friendly hands and you may not have a 
pilot totally concentrating on the accuracy of spraying 
at wednesdays hearing ann b wrobleski assistant secretary of 
state for international narcotics matters criticized lilly for 
deciding to withhold the herbicide from the spraying program even 
though it has been manufactured for more than 15 years has been 
proven safe by us standards is widely available in this country 
and has been sold to the interior department 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said wednesday we 
think the shortterm impact is serious the department wanted to 
test the chemical for use in eradicating the coca crop focused 
mainly in perus huallaga valley she said the chemical is used in 
the united states for clearing brush 
mrs oakley said lilly apparently was worried about possible 
retaliatory measures by traffickers or terrorists the company 
also came under pressure from environmentalists who were concerned 
about the ecological impact of the herbicide 
meanwhile the subcommittee was told by agencies fighting the 
drug war on wednesday that the effort is troubled by delayed 
equipment and financial woes 
the coast guard said its boats and planes often sit idle because 
the agency is short of money 
the customs service said the entire us border with mexico 
remains a haven for airborne drug smugglers because of delays in 
installing four of five radar balloons 
also coast guard surveillance planes have cracks in their wings 
and may be grounded this summer new or modified planes authorized 
by congress have not yet been delivered construction of three new 
command control communications and intelligence centers for the 
drug war are behind schedule 
english blamed the customs service for the delays in installing 
the radar balloons along the mexican border to detect airborne drug 
smugglers only one of the five balloons called aerostats is in 
operation 
this is a terrible failure he told william rosenblatt the 
customs service enforcement chief you are costing us dearly 
theres no sense of urgency about this thats the problem 
coast guard commandant paul a yost said his new fast patrol 
boats and many of the agencys airplanes are operating at only 55 
percent of last years levels due to lack of money 
he said it was ironic that congress is ready to spend huge sums 
for an escalation of the militarys role in the drug war but cant 
find 60 million to get his vessels in the water and planes in the 
air full time 
turn me loose and dont give my mission away he told the 
committee 
rosenblatt blamed the radar balloon delays on problems with site 
selection environmental concerns competitive bidding and 
bureaucratic roadblocks from other federal agencies 
when he explained how he spent four months seeking competitive 
bids for the balloons in an effort to save money english said 
in effect you cost us a heck of a lot of money because air 
force awacs surveillance planes have had to patrol the mexican 
border to pick up the slack english said that an awacs costs 
7500 an hour to operate

the united states rejected kremlin leader mikhail 
s gorbachevs request to include the words peaceful 
coexistence in a closing summit statement because the phrase is 
imprecise and it was a soviet slogan during the cold war us 
officials said thursday 
white house chief of staff howard baker said that reagan and 
gorbachev disagreed over use of the phrase and that the pair was 
going at it pretty heavy until the end 
nikita khrushchev used the phrase to describe his efforts to 
improve relations with the west following the death of josef stalin 
in 1953 but stuck with it despite the heightened tension of the 
berlin and cuban missile crises 
it seems as if there are two dictionaries when the united states 
and the soviet union analyze the meaning of peaceful coexistence 
a senior official who spoke to reorters on condition that she 
not be further identified said that shortly after reagan arrived 
in moscow last sunday gorbachev handed him a plain white piece of 
paper on which were written the following words 
proceeding from their understanding of the realities that have 
taken shape in the world today the two leaders believe that no 
problem in dispute can be resolved nor should it be resolved by 
military means 
the statement continued they regard peaceful coexistence as a 
universal principle of international relations equality of all 
states noninterference in internal affairs and freedom of 
sociopolitical choice must be recognized as the inalienable and 
mandatory standards of international relations 
reagan liked the sound of the words but the veteran 
sovietologists who advise him remembered that the soviets were 
proclaiming similar principles in international affairs in the 
context of hungary in 1956 czecholovakia in 1968 and afghanistan 
in 1979 and that the soviets countenanced the declaration of 
martial law in poland in 1981 
baker talking to reporters who accompanied reagan to london 
thursday aboard air force one described the scene at the final 
reagangorbachev meeting about six hours before the summit 
communique was released to the press 
as the meeting ended all of us stood up including the 
president and the general secretary and the president and general 
secretary continued to pursue their conversation 
they were going at it pretty heavy and i was proud of the 
president they were face to face and going at it pretty heavy 
until the end 
at his spaso house news conference in moscow wednesday reagan 
was asked why he took issue with the peaceful coexistence 
language 
reagan said that he liked the whole tone of the draft 
language 
but the president also said that aides studying the draft 
communique saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in 
there that would not achieve the general thought of what was being 
proposed 
us officials were suspicious about the language feeling it 
was too imprecise 
the us objections were brought to the attention of the soviets 
early on and negotiations began at the staff level on alternative 
language baker said 
and indeed it was our impression that alternative language 
had been agreed to for the departure statement he said and it 
was at the last meeting that the general secretary came back and 
made another run at trying to get his original language in and the 
president held his ground 
i dont think he gorbachev was playing a trick i think he 
was just making a run for his original formulation baker said 
in the end the compromise language negotiated by the staff 
omitting the words peaceful coexistence was included in the 
communique

a yale history professor 
with a passion for americas national parks told their 
superintendents today they are stewards of the worlds greatest 
university 
i take the national park service of any society as a series of 
symbols about what a people chose to take pride in robin winks 
told 300 national park service managers on the second day of an 
extraordinary fourday conference 
these are the testimonials the building blocks that americans 
believe they have done historically you begin to get into a heart 
of a people by viewing what they have chosen to preserve said 
winks who has visited 315 of the 342 units of the national park 
system and is a frequent participant in park service training 
sessions 
every superintendent in the national park system is president 
of a small university keeping the flame of an historical event of 
which we are proud winks said you are stewards over what i 
view as the single greatest university of the world 
on wednesday park managers at the first such conference in 12 
years said americas national parks are in better condition than 
ever 
superintendent bob barbee park service director william penn 
mott and others agreed that budget constraints have forced them to 
find new solutions to old problems such as deteriorating 
maintenance and substandard housing 
environmental and citizens groups have said threats to the 
parks include logging oil drilling pollution and commercial and 
residential development near parks 
i get tired of all this chicken little stuff barbee told 
reporters weve made a lot of improvements 
there is more control and management of the resources and some 
people dont like that because they dont like control but the 
good side of that is we are more sensitive to the integrity of 
the resources than we have ever been said barbee whose park 
yellowstone was the worlds first national park 
i would contend that in yellowstone national park 
biologically today we are in better shape than we were 75 years 
ago he said 
he noted that 75 years ago a dairy herd slaughterhouses 
garbage dumps and other things needed to support staff and park 
visitors produced tons of pollution 
as late as 1970 80000 pounds of wet garbage pizza crusts 
and slop was available to bears in open dumps now there are zero 
pounds of wet garbage the dumps are gone its all hauled long 
distances out of the park barbee said 
he said yellowstones physical plant is also in better shape 
than its ever been even though an estimated 300 million is 
needed to repair deteroriated facilities 
at grand canyon national park wild burros were once a problem 
said superintendent dick marks 
today there are no burros in the park the big horn sheep are 
making a comeback and conflicts between people on the ground and 
those making canyon overflights are being worked out marks 
said 
during the farranging session with reporters mott denied 
accusations by critics in environmental groups and congress that he 
may have held back his best professional advice because of 
admininstrative opposition 
no one not even interior department secretary donald hodel 
has personally throttled me on what i personally feel said mott 
the administrations commitment to the parks system was one of 
the issues discussed earlier in the day 
william horn assistant secretary of the interior for fish 
wildlife and parks said he was tired of a continuing drumbeat of 
critics claiming the administration is antipark and committers of 
sins 
he pointed out that the administration has proposed a 734 
million operating budget for the park service for the next fiscal 
year compared to 391 million in 1980 
that constitutes the largest operating budget in the history 
of the national park service and represents 29 percent 
postinflation real growth over the past seven years horn said 
further the park service employs 16414 people the highest 
level in its 72year history horn said 
these numbers bespeak a commitment to a firstclass national 
park system he said

republican conservatives questioned thursday 
what vice president george bush hoped to gain politically by 
attacking two newright activists whom he called selfappointed 
spokesmen who have been critical of him for years 
the objects of bushs attack richard viguerie and howard 
phillips said they still hope he defeats democrat michael dukakis 
in the fall presidential election 
with george so far down in the polls i was wondering why he 
was wasting his time and energy shooting at me instead of shooting 
at mike dukakis said phillips chairman of the conservative 
caucus 
if he wants to go around attacking conservatives hes going 
to dig himself a deeper hole said viguerie a conservative 
fundraiser and former publisher of conservative digest 
recent national polls have said dukakis is leading bush by 
margins ranging from six points to 16 points among voters 
conservatives have urged the vice president to step up his 
attacks on the massachusetts governor and portray him as a liberal 
out of step with the national mood 
viguerie and phillips also have been sharply critical of 
president reagan since he took office more than seven years ago 
they have complained that reagan has abandoned much of the 
conservative agenda 
only wednesday viguerie described reagan as having taken 
leave of his senses for suggesting in moscow that the problems 
soviet citizens were having emigrating to the west were caused more 
by bureaucratic problems than government policy 
interviewed by the new york times at his summer home in 
kennebunkport maine bush said of viguerie the fact that he 
doesnt agree with me on a lot of things or has opposed me for many 
years that doesnt bother me 
theres only one or two that polarize and viguerie and howie 
phillips are two of them it doesnt matter in terms of total 
vote 
when asked if he needed to court the two newright activists 
bush said there are some people that are almost selfappointed 
spokesmen that will make a claim for that i dont feel that at 
all 
bush said viguerie gets his name in the paper by criticizing 
other republicans all the time 
i think its kind of sad said rep robert dornan of 
california a conservative supporter of bush i was hoping he 
wouldnt react to their earlier goading i thought the whole 
thing was calmed down and wed all be pulling together on one 
team 
dornan said viguerie was absolutely correct in urging bush 
to get tougher on dukakis 
if george doesnt paint dukakis as the liberal that he is and 
establish himself as a conservative then the electorate is going to 
opt for a change said dornan 
it doesnt serve george bush any useful purpose to attack 
people who have constituencies that might support him said lyn 
nofziger former white house political director 
at the same time nofziger noted that phillips has been a 
vicious attacker of ronald reagan over the last seven years 
hes not running against dick viguerie and hes not running 
against howie phillips hes running against probably mike dukakis 
and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball said nofziger 
phillips asked how much of a following he has said bush does 
not have to worry about me i only have one vote he said 
conservative caucus has several hundred thousand supporters 
even though im not a great fan of the vice president or his 
policies i genuinely hope he succeeds said phillips 
i want all of us to unite behind him bush said viguerie 
who added that if bush doesnt run a polarizing election hes 
history if he doesnt run a campaign to polarize that 
polarizes the country along liberal and conservative lines then he 
has no chance of winning

image may have overwhelmed substance here this 
week but american officials believe the moscow summit will be 
remembered for building a foundation of openness and trust for 
future ussoviet relations 
military issues are the most important and here progress was 
thin said one american participant in five days of summit talks 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
it was uncertain whether arms talks will result in agreement on 
a new treaty drastically reducing strategic nuclear weapons before 
reagan leaves office in january that is the two leaders condition 
for holding a fifth and final summit meeting this year 
but there has been a sea change in atmospherics the us 
official said privately he noted that we are talking with them 
across the board from missile cutbacks to cultural exchanges 
if we are going to build a future relationship these will be 
the building blocks he said 
another us diplomat with years of experience in soviet affairs 
said the americans are feeling more confident about the 
relationship after the summit he too spoke only on condition 
he not be identified 
kremlin spokesmen made their own upbeat assessment of 
glasnostera summitry 
if someone had told me three years ago that we would have such 
relations with the united states i would have said it was a 
fantasy said georgy arbatov head of the usacanada institute 
in moscow 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said on a british 
broadcasting corp interview that we do have progress but we 
could have even more 
to television viewers the summit may have seemed designed to 
produce scenes of reagan and gorbachev clasping hands and grinning 
at each other 
there were some tv images unfavorable to the soviets kgb 
agents roughing up the white house press corps a few hours after 
reagan arrived police sealing off the apartment of a jewish 
activist whom reagan intended to visit 
there also were favorable soviet images an aging reagan 
alongside a brighteyed gorbachev more than 10 years his junior 
gorbachev urging a faster pace in arms control negotiations while 
reagan counsels caution 
behind the images us and soviet aides were busy bargaining 
over a far wider range of issues than their predecessors during the 
days of eastwest detente in the 1970s 
we are finding greater openness than we have in the past 
said the american official 
negotiators made only marginal progress this week on a proposed 
treaty to reduce us and soviet arsenals of longrange nuclear 
weapons by as much as 50 percent they talked too about two 
lesser agreements that would tighten verification procedures under 
a 1974 accord limiting nuclear explosions and require advance 
notice of ballistic missile tests 
the two sides also made little headway on resolving differences 
over afghanistan central america and other regional conflicts but 
they signed a handful of agreements on minor issues such as 
maritime rescue and radar navigation 
in all the talks the us official said the soviets blamed 
past mistakes on old thinking and tried to use what they called 
gorbachevs new thinking to make things work 
among the summits littlenoticed achievements in the view of 
american participants was overcoming initial soviet objections to 
a cultural agreement to exchange as many as 1000 high school 
students from each country 
in the past the soviets had objected to allowing soviet 
students to stay in american homes and americans to stay with 
soviet families said one us official 
he said the exchange students could become of the next 
generation of us and soviet foreign policy experts

about 200 capitalists converged thursday on 
beijing for a weekend of caviar on the great wall boat rides on an 
imperial pleasure lake and a display of opulence not seen in this 
spartan socialist capital since 1949 
the participants from 21 countries are spending 4300 each to 
enjoy such western luxuries as a masked ball and champagne 
breakfast at sites of past chinese imperial glory 
for 5200 more 100 of them will spend 10 days touring chinas 
most famous scenic spots 
the weekend event dubbed the return of marco polo after the 
13th century venetian adventurer was organized by a french group 
calling itself the committee to save venice and the great wall 
headed by public relations agent daniel vial 
the proceeds were intended to help restore the great wall 
reduced in many sections by weather and war to a heap of stones 
and to preserve the art and architecture of venice italy 
but vial said chinese officials are charging such high fees for 
transportation food site rentals and services that most of the 
ticket receipts will be needed to cover expenses 
he cited a 54000 charge by beijing municipal authorities to 
rent a section of the great wall for four hours saturday so the 
guests can lunch there on caviar and champagne 
im not sure they chinese officials got exactly the concept 
of a charity vial told a news conference this week they 
charge us the maximum 
the number of highpaying guests also is less than half what was 
expected vial acknowledged he said chinese delays in confirming 
arrangements made it impossible to advertise far enough in advance 
the organizers now say any funds to help the great wall or 
venice will have to come from the final event of the weekend a 
sothebys auction sunday of donated modern western and chinese art 
and rare objects 
sothebys has estimated the 67 items including a 1777 bottle of 
cognac a pottery jug painted by picasso and a painting by deng 
lin the daughter of senior leader deng xiaoping should fetch 
695400 to 869000 
however auctioneer julian thompson chairman of sothebys 
international said no one is really sure what to expect it will 
be the first auction of western art in china since the communist 
takeover in 1949 
the cheapest item in the sale is expected to be a sevres 
porcelain cup valued from 215 to 320 about how much an average 
chinese factory worker earns annually 
despite uncertainty about how much will be reaped for charity 
plenty of cash wiil flash during the weekend 
the guests will be ferried about in black red flag limousines 
entertained by chinese acrobats and singers fed on caviar french 
cuisine and brandy and allowed to party at some of chinas most 
sacred national monuments 
they will boat at the luxurious 19th century summer palace and 
hold a venetian masked ball and watch fireworks at the diaoyutai 
state guesthouse 
they will breakfast at the temple of heaven where the emperor 
offered sacrifices for a good harvest dine in the forbidden city 
the imperial palace in beijing and watch chinese and western 
performers saturday night at the great hall of the people 
the guests gathered thursday night at the weekends first event 
a cocktail party in the garden of the glassplated sheraton hotel 
serenaded by chinese musicians playing ancient instruments 
an american businessman asked why he was willing to pay so 
much said with a shrug to have fun 
we are not in beijing now said a frenchman who like the 
american spoke on condition of anonymity its as if we are in 
san francisco 
organizers said several european and arab nobility signed up for 
the weekend but most of those at the party seemed to be involved 
in business with china 
hundreds of police will shield the guests from contact with 
ordinary beijing residents among whom the main topic of 
conversation lately has been 30 to 60 percent increases in the 
prices of pork eggs and sugar 
former foreign minister huang hua when asked at the cocktail 
party if such displays of wealth were appropriate in impoverished 
china call income differences an objective reality 
we are trying to make our country prosperous he said we 
need all kinds of help

was being held in the box elder county jail in lieu of 75000 bail 
he was to be arraigned thursday on one count each of aggravated 
sexual abuse of a child child kidnapping and aggravated 
kidnapping all firstdegree felonies said a secretary to box 
elder county attorney jon bunderson 
frank james harvey 45 elma wash was convicted of kidnapping 
and sexually assaulting the child and was sentenced to 16 years in

the new chief of the justice departments 
criminal division said thursday he looks forward to the release of 
a report detailing attorney general edwin meeses ties to 
scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
project 
i think it will be much better for all concerned when that 
report is issued the sooner the better for the department and for 
the attorney general edward sg dennis jr the former us 
attorney in philadelphia told reporters 
independent counsel james mckay will conclude a yearlong 
invesitgation of meese by filing a report in the next week of two 
with threejudge federal appeals court panel which is expected to 
issue it publicly later this month 
dennis said issuing the report will be very good because right 
now you just have a lot of speculation he said making the report 
public will give meese an opportunity to respond to any allegations 
in detail meese has said he wants to respond to all the 
information in the report to clear the air 
dennis who is in his first week on the job as acting assistant 
attorney general said morale in the criminal division is good 
despite meeses legal problems and a wave of departures from the 
justice department in the past two months 
its not easy in a situation where you do have controversy and 
uncertainty to be without someone to kind of keep the divisions 
oar in the water said dennis a former chief of the narcotic and 
dangerous drug section at the department 
dennis sidestepped when asked whether colleagues urged him not 
to take his new assignment my feeling is basically if there 
werent problems thered be no need for lawyers he said 
thats basically what we do deal with controversy and problems 
dennis said that since he already knows many people in the 
criminal division and is a known commodity his nomination 
has done a great deal to perhaps calm any concerns 
dennis said he has spoken briefly to his predecessor william 
weld who quit in protest march 29 out of concern that meeses 
continued tenure was hurting the justice departments operations 
morale and public image 
dennis said he will probably have lunch with weld soon in a 
recent conversation he said weld didnt say why he resigned 
dennis didnt ask him why and weld didnt offer dennis any advice 
mckays report is expected to raise questions about meeses 
ethical conduct that will be examined by the justice departments 
office of professional responsibility in the coming months sources 
familiar with mckays investigation have said 
mckay also has been examining meeses meetings with regional 
bell telephone company executives while holding 14000 in phone 
stock and has been delving into a washington real estate family 
providing funds for a job for meeses wife ursula and leasing 
buildings to the justice department

the staterun broadcasting 
company charged thursday that pressure by blacks prompted us 
presidential hopeful michael dukakis to accuse south africa of 
terrorism 
the accusation by dukakis the likely democratic nominee had no 
factual basis and was quite openly a capitulation to threats that 
black voters support would depend on his making such a 
statement said the south african broadcasting corp in an 
editorial 
it was the latest in a wave of attacks by rightwing and 
mainstream news media on us politicians campaigning to toughen 
sanctions against south africa 
several commentators have suggested that south africans should 
shift attention to europe and the far east and abandon hope of any 
constructive us dealings 
a johannesburg brokerage firm davis borkum hare reported 
thursday that one proposal in congress would force the sale of 7 
billion of usheld shares in south africas mining companies the 
report said us citizens held 142 percent of all south african 
mining shares as of jan 1 
south africa has developed appropriate counterstrategies to 
combat the african national congress guerrilla movement the 
broadcast commentary said a progoverment johannesburg newspaper 
the citizen said south africa will be in for a lot of trouble 
if the massachusetts governor becomes president 
dukakis has been easily swayed by the likes of the rev jesse 
jackson and archbishop desmond tutu and he will do everything he 
can to try and strangle the south african economy the citizen 
said in an editorial wednesday 
but this son of immigrant parents should know that south 
africans have deepseated roots in this country that go back more 
than three centuries and they will not give in to us demands nor 
submit to us sanctions it said 
dukakis has accused south africa of terrorist acts but has not 
called it a terrorist state as jackson has urged him to do 
tutu leader of the anglican church in southern africa praised 
dukakis during a recent us trip and endorsed sanctions pending in 
congress 
progovernment media have denounced the black cleric saying he 
has no mandate and ignores the harm which sanctions might inflict 
on blacks 
an accurate assessment of black views on sanctions is difficult 
to obtain because the 26 million blacks cannot vote in national 
elections or referendums and public advocacy of sanctions is 
forbidden under emergency regulations 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
business day a johannesburg newspaper reflecting the views of 
moderate business executives has carried several articles 
assailing the us proposals the sanctions would cut off virtually 
all bilateral economic activity except for trade in certain 
strategic minerals 
the newspaper reported that the proposals include a section that 
says the united states should not provide advice to south africa in 
the event of a nuclear accident

california gov george deukmejian has 
said at least 100 times that he couldnt accept the republican 
nomination for vice president because he would have to turn over 
his office to the democratic lieutenant governor 
the governors protests notwithstanding he remains an 
attractive vice presidential prospect as george bush tries to keep 
california with its 47 electoral votes in the gop column in 
november 
as ive said many times now deukmejian said of the vice 
presidency a few weeks ago i dont expect even to be asked but 
if i was asked if i am asked i cannot accept it 
if i were on the national ticket and that ticket was to be 
successful it would mean turning over the entire executive branch 
of california state government to the other party which im not 
about to do 
california voters who cast separate ballots for governor and 
lieutenant governor have saddled deukmejian with a democrat in the 
no 2 spot in state government leo mccarthy mccarthy however is 
running this year for the us senate and would not necessarily be 
deukmejians successor but that doesnt ease the governors 
problem because the next person in line is another democrat state 
senate president pro tem david roberti 
but deukmejian continues to fan speculation with comments such 
as these to a texas gop fundraiser im still hoping that 
somebody might come along and figure out a way i could be vice 
president and at the same time let the republicans hold onto 
control of the statehouse in california 
the importance to bush of winning california is enormous and it 
is clear that bush needs help in the golden state despite ronald 
reagans lasting popularity here although california has ended up 
in the gop column in eight of the last nine presidential elections 
a californian has been on the republican ticket either for 
president or vice president in six of those races 
the most recent presidential election in which there was not a 
californian on the gop ticket was the 1976 race between republican 
gerald ford and democrat jimmy carter in which ford carried 
california by a scant 17 percent 
although the prospect of deukmejian turning the california 
statehouse over to a democrat is strongly opposed by state 
republican party leaders california voters have given pollsters 
mixed signals that they would probably be more inclined to vote for 
bush if deukmejian were on the ticket with him 
in a late may survey mervin fields california poll reported 
bush trailing dukakis by 53 percent to 40 percent but field said a 
bushdeukmejian ticket narrowed that margin only to 5141 against a 
dukakisjohn glenn ticket and that a bushdeukmejian ticket led 
dukakissam nunn and dukakisjesse jackson tickets by 2 and 7 
points respectively 
on the positive side deukmejian is the son of immigrant parents 
who arrived from armenia nearly penniless at ellis island in the 
early 1900s a background that could help counter the ethnic appeal 
of democrat michael dukakis and add a humble background to balance 
bushs image of eastern wealth and preppiness 
the 59yearold deukmejians other political assets include a 
strongly favorable rating in his home state 61 percent positive 
to 31 percent negative in a may survey he has a scandalfree 
reputation as a family man and hardworking administrator and a 
political image as a fiscal conservative and lawandorder former 
attorney general 
his most noteworthy achievement as governor was pulling the 
state through the crisis of a 15 billion deficit inherited from 
democratic predecessor jerry brown without a general tax increase 
deukmejian faces a similar crisis this year a revenue shortfall 
estimated at 23 billion over two years he has been criticized 
for his proposed solution a package of spending cuts dipping into 
treasury reserves and 800 million in new state income tax revenues 
that he insists are an adjustment or correction and not a 
tax increase 
his greatest liability may be what even his friends concede is a 
bland speaking style and image a problem that also plagues bush 
altogether deukmejian a native of menards ny has spent 26 
years in public office in california 16 in the state legislature 
where he was senate gop floor leader for six years prior to his 
1978 election as attorney general he was elected governor by 
93000 votes in 1982 and reelected by a landslide 17 million vote 
margin in 1986

mikhail s gorbachev stood eyeballtoeyeball this 
week with soviet journalists who tested the uncharted bounds of 
glasnost and he never blinked 
never had a kremlin leader held a news conference on home 
territory until wednesday when gorbachev agreed to take questions 
from 300 soviet and foreign reporters and government officials here 
for his summit talks with president reagan 
the five soviet journalists chosen to ask questions were polite 
and ideologically acceptable but they raised issues that could 
never have been addressed publicly by soviet citizens only three 
years ago 
articulate and in easy command of the occasion gorbachev deftly 
handled such sensitive topics as war losses in afghanistan past 
soviet stubbornness at arms negotiations and the need for a greater 
degree of democracy in soviet society 
by white house standards gorbachevs news conference was windy 
it lasted two hours and disorganized the order of the two 
dozen questions was more random than under the white house formula 
which awards the first query to a wire service reporter at news 
conferences that seldom last longer than a halfhour 
soviet journalists are still committed advocates of official 
policy but their reporting on the summit and the questions they 
asked gorbachev reflected a freer attitude 
gorbachev talked openly about the oncetaboo subject of internal 
disputes within the kremlin leadership he explained his problems 
with footdragging conservatives until foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze whispered that the soviet journalist was asking about 
american factions that are hesitant about improving superpower 
relations 
you mean youre talking not about our conservatives but their 
conservatives gorbachev asked magazine editor valentin berezhkov 
the auditorium erupted in laughter 
the reporters questions and gorbachevs responses would have 
been unthinkable before the soviet leader introduced his reforms in 
early 1985 
when a correspondent for the weekly newspaper literaturnaya 
gazeta rose to ask gorbachev about the fate of about 300 soviet 
soldiers reportedly seized by afghan rebels and held captive in 
pakistan 
without a hint of discomfort gorbachev responded with the 
sincerity of a concerned father that we will do everything so 
that our people return home 
the most delicate queries were posed by foreign reporters who 
outnumbered their soviet counterparts by at least 2to1 and were 
allowed to ask the most questions 
gorbachev gave a selfassured response even to the most 
sensitive questions about his relationship with kreqeooooowgor 
k ligachev who is reported to be challenging 
gorbachev over the pace of reforms and the inflammatory remarks of 
boris n yeltsin the ousted moscow party chief who called monday 
for ligachevs resignation 
gorbachev did not fully answer some questions such as whether 
the june 28 party conference could prove contentious but he never 
refused outright to respond to a query 
melor sturua a correspondent for the government newspaper 
izvestia who was expelled from washington in a titfortat exchange 
in 1983 commented during one question that the soviet side had 
hampered negotiations over verification procedures during arms 
talks at geneva 
the soviet leader agreed with sturuas assessment but 
attributed current difficulties to american intransigence 
gorbachev told the reporters he had enjoyed the opportunity to 
talk with them hinting that his first moscow news conference might 
not be his last

vice president george bush says the memories 
are still fresh from four decades ago when he played first base for 
yale university in baseballs college world series 
bush the likely gop presidential nominee played for the yale 
team that finished second in the series in 1947 and 1948 losing to 
california the first year and to southern california the next 
he reminisced about the experience and recalled a fatally 
flawed bit of strategy in a recent letter to the omaha 
worldherald which had asked about his college world series days 
the 1988 series begins friday its 39th consecutive year here 
the 1947 and 1948 series were in kalamazoo mich 
the 1948 tournament was the highlight of my college baseball 
experience bush wrote 
we had great college pitching he said frank quinn was a 
real star he signed right after the 48 season with the red sox 
for a big bonus dick manville another pitcher was majorleague 
material too 
competition really is great bush told the newspaper 
being part of a winning team is a thrill teamwork is very 
important fitness of course matters 
i still clear the head by running two miles and riding an 
exercycle on bad days i have always loved sports 
bush also recalled some yale strategy that backfired in 1947 
we walked the eighth hitter to get to the ninth hitter bush 
told the worldherald that turned out to be their pitcher 
jackie jensen later of red sox fame strode to the plate and hit 
one thats still rolling out there

a 2000foot tv tower collapsed today 
killing two maintenance workers and apparently trapping a third in 
the wreckage police said 
its just a tangled pile of metal said cl harlan a 
dispatcher with the missouri state highway patrol in macon they 
are getting cutting torches in there to try and cut it out 
the maintenance crew was working at about 500 feet when the 
tower as high as a 200story building gave way around 10 am 
authorities said 
the bodies of two of the workers were found within an hour of 
the collapse the patrol said colony is about 25 miles from the 
iowa and illinois borders and 200 miles northwest of st louis 
the patrol said the cause of the accident was not immediately 
known winds were calm when the tower belonging to ktvo in 
kirksville fell said kurt sweeney station news director 
the transmission tower went up in september and was one of the 
tallest in the nation visible from more than 30 miles authorities 
said jerry heilman ktvo general manager said the workers were 
replacing more than 1000 structural braces 
i cant even venture a guess as to what happened said 
heilman at this point i dont know why it fell it was very 
tragic that human life was lost 
martha huber who lives about a quarter mile from the tower 
said she looked out her window and saw the structure falling it 
did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area but tore down 
several trees witnesses said 
i heard it and it sounded like a jet taking off said ms 
hubers sister elizabeth huber 
the workers were employees of structural system technology inc 
of mclean va and had been working in colony for several weeks 
ktvo was off the air following the collapse an fm radio station 
that also broadcast from the tower krxl in kirksville was working 
on reduced power authorities said 
the tower was the maximum height allowed under federal aviation 
administration rules said sharon scott public service specialist 
for the federal communications commission in kansas city

in the beginning play was hard work you ran 
you wrestled you clambered up cliffs with your bare hands 
then came video games you walked over to the tv picked up the 
joystick and let donkey kong climb the wall still too much work 
couch potatoes rejoice the wireless joystick a device that 
will allow you to sit in your lazboy more than 20 feet from the 
tube while playing after burner is coming 
its really the ultimate stick said carl eisenberg head of 
us operations of camerica ltd which will market the freedom 
stick 
the arcadestyle stick bounces an infrared beam around a room 
linking up with a receiver at the television set 
the manufacturer says the signal is not interrupted when someone 
walks by there are no wires it is compatible with all game 
systems it works whether it is aimed at the ceiling the floor or 
up to 90 degrees from the screen 
this is not the first time such a mechanism was marketed a few 
years ago a wireless joystick that used radio waves failed because 
the signal was easily disrupted interrupting countless games of 
pac man 
albert leung associate professor at simon fraser university in 
british columbia canada began developing the technology for the 
infrared joystick in 1981 said david harding president of 
camerica 
leungs research was proceeding apace when the video boom went 
bust instead of video games people bought computers with 
videogame capabilities 
but harding said this has changed in the past year with the 
development of cheaper more sophisticated video games at the same 
time parents found that computers were expensive playthings and 
game sets grew more attractive 
the freedom stick will cost 6995 harding and eisenberg said 
videogame makers are working to develop their own versions of the 
wireless device

this absolutely blew my mind dr james c 
caillouette said i thought something awful was happening to me 
everytime i went into an examining room i had a patient with 
ovarian cyst 
eventually the los angeles gynecologist said the lights 
began to go on and he concluded there was a connection between an 
outbreak of functional or noncancerous cysts among his 
patients and a new type birth control pill he had been prescribing 
for them 
sold by three of the six major us pharmaceutical companies 
that make birth control pills the socalled multiphasic pills that 
went on the market in 1984 actually were not new chemical 
formulations but rather new packaging of existing drugs in various 
strengths 
although caillouette didnt have overall estimates of how many 
millions of women are taking the multiphasic pills he said the 
introduction of the pills was accompanied by the most aggressive 
marketing program he has seen in 29 years of practice by 1987 he 
said nine of every 10 new birth control prescriptions were for a 
multiphasic 
largely through the efforts of caillouette the food and drug 
administration has ordered the three companies to intensify their 
postmarket studies of the pills the agency is airing the issue 
before an advisory committee on friday 
specifically the fertility and maternal health drugs advisory 
committee will be asked whether it believes it is possible to 
determine at the present time if monophasic and multiphasic 
formulations of oral contraceptives have different associations 
with the occurrence of functional ovarian cysts 
the panel also will be asked whether it is willing to express a 
preference between monophasic and multiphasic pills in a 
monophasic prescription the same dosage is taken each day of the 
21day cycle in a multiphasic the dosage varies with a woman 
taking perhaps 35 microgram pills on certain days of the month 20 
micograms on other days and 10 micograms on still others 
the rationale given by drug companies for developing the 
multiphasic pills was to minimize any sideeffects by providing the 
lowest total dosage possible over the onemonth cycle 
it has been presumed based on studies that birth control pills 
reduce the likelihood of functional ovarian cysts rather than 
increase them that is why caillouette was so surprised when it 
dawned on him in early 1986 that each of seven patients who had 
developed cysts during the previous four months had been taking 
multiphasic pills 
he recalled one patient in particular who had three operations 
in three months to remove the cysts and we kept putting her back 
on the triphasic pill beause she said with the others that she had 
breast tenderness premenstrual syndrome and all of that 
i believed what i was being told caillouette said in a 
recent interview we knew that with patients on birth control 
pills functional cysts were suppressed after three surgeries in 
three months the lights began to go on 
so caillouette put that patient and others with cysts back on 
singledosage birth control pills the cysts went away and i 
thought this is what is supposed to happen he said but 
something is going on with these phasic pills 
caillouette who also is a professor at the university of 
southern california school of medicine decided to present his 
seven case studies during a west coast medical meeting and 
following my presentation physicians got up from the audience and 
presented an additional 11 cases 
he published his findings in a medical journal last summer and 
began getting still more calls and letters from other physicians 
and patients having similar experiences with multiphasic birth 
control pills 
caillouette said he now knows of 68 cases in which there is a 
potential link between multiphasic pills and functional cysts 
caillouette said he believes development of the multiphasic 
pills was a business decision on the part of the three companies 
to enter into new patent protection on birth control pills 
but rather than develop new formulations he said the companies 
either mixed or matched pills that were off the shelf or in 
some instances merely repackaged pills of varying strength into new 
monthly prescriptions 
they came out with a new patent with what they advertised to 
the public as a new kind of birth control pill he said i 
think it was improper i think they misled the public they misled 
the physicians into thinking they had a new mousetrap when in fact 
all they were doing was mixing and matching stuff that was off the 
shelf 
representatives for the three companies ortho pharmaceutical 
corp wyeth laboratories inc and syntex corp all denied in 
separate telephone interviews any improprieties in winning approval 
of the multiphasic pills and said they were cooperating with the 
fdaordered reviews

more than onethird of the patients at the 
university of maryland shock trauma center used marijuana several 
hours before sustaining their injuries a study has found 
another third had been drinking alcohol before they were hurt 
and 165 percent had been both drinking and smoking marijuana 
according to the study appearing in the june issue of archives of 
surgery 
to me it was rather startling to see that an illicit drug 
matched in use a legal drug said carl a soderstrom a surgeon 
who headed the research team from the maryland institute for 
emergency medical systems 
the suggestion is that the use of this drug alone and in 
combination with alcohol may be the reason why they got hurt and 
ended up hurting someone else soderstrom said 
the study based on leftover blood samples collected from july 
29 1985 to may 8 1986 provided a phenomenally high number of 
positives for marijuana said dr edward j cone of the johns 
hopkins addiction research center at francis scott key medical 
center 
theres a common misconception that marijuana is a safe drug 
but the statistics coming out of that study clearly show that 
people who are using marijuana are involved in accidents at a much 
higher rate than you would expect cone said 
soderstrom said more studies need to be done since the 
marijuana use rate he detected was four to 10 times as great as the 
rate reported in previous studies of car crash victims in canada 
and north carolina 
soderstroms study is based on blood samples from 1023 patients 
treated at the shocktrauma center about two thirds had been 
involved in car crashes while the others suffered their injuries 
in falls assaults and accidents 
about 73 percent were men and 584 percent were 30 or younger 
the results showed 347 percent of the patients tested had used 
marijuana and 335 percent were under the influence of alcohol 
soderstrom said that of 393 drivers admitted 1 in 6 had both 
marijuana and alcohol in their systems more than threequarters of 
those who drank registered bloodalcohol levels equal to or higher 
than the 01 level commonly used to determine drunkenness 
soderstrom said blood sample testing or radioimmunoassay 
rarely registers positive levels more than four hours after use of 
marijuana

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev stressed 
thursday there will be no changes in his countrys human rights 
policies despite president reagans emphasis on this issue during 
the moscow summit 
hours after reagan left moscow at the end of the fiveday 
summit gorbachev told several hundred peace activists the soviet 
union will not accept any advice on how we run our affairs 
we do not need anyone elses model we do not need anyone 
elses values he said 
reagan highlighted human rights by meeting with dissidents and 
jewish refuseniks during his visit to moscow and by stressing the 
issues of freedom of expression and economic creativity in speeches 
and his talks with gorbachev 
but reagan also ran into trouble with some refuseniks for 
remarks he made later in the visit seeming to absolve gorbachev of 
responsibility for jewish emigration restricrtions 
gorbachev the soviet communist party leader told a news 
conference wednesday he was not filled with admiration for 
reagans meeting with the dissidents and refuseniks 
but thursday he told the several hundred peace activists 
gathered in the circular blueandwhite sverdlov hall in the 
council of ministers building of the kremlin that he felt the need 
to respond further 
we are far from imagining our country perfect in all 
respects gorbachev said he said that problems which reagan 
mentioned do take place but this is not the situation this is 
not an overall picture of soviet society 
i told the president that we have our own view of the human 
rights situation in his own country gorbachev said he said the 
two countries told a working group formed to tackle the problem 
that were open and ready for any discussion on this matter 
about 4500 jews have been allowed to emigrate so far this year 
and more than 8000 left in 1987 those figures are much higher 
than they were in previous years but far below the peak year of 
jewish emigration of more than 51000 in 1979 
about 40 peace activists from the united states western europe 
and elsewhere praised gorbachev for his role in completing the 
superpower treaty banning medium and shorterrange nuclear 
missiles reagan and gorbachev exchanged instruments of 
ratification for that treaty wednesday 
hes the statesman weve been waiting for said marty 
coleman of pasadena california who gave gorbachev a small toy 
from her granddaughter to give to his granddaughter oxana 
the 57yearold general secretary laughed and chatted like an 
american politician on the stump with others who walked up to the 
wooden dias where he sat to present him with a solarpowered watch 
an american indian peace pipe a chicago bears football team 
sweatshirt and other gifts 
with gorbachev were two key advisers politburo member alexander 
yakovlev and communist party central committee secretary anatoly 
dobrynin a former ambassador to washington 
the soviet leader said that in his four summit meetings with 
reagan the content of what we have achieved is immense but 
that more progress could have been made 
he criticized once more reagans star wars program for a 
spacebased shield against nuclear attack we should drag the 
americans away from the realm of military space to peaceful 
space gorbachev said 
the two sides made little progress on that issue during the 
summit and it remains one of the main obstacles to an agreement to 
cut longrange nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent 
among the human rights problems the soviets say exist in the 
united states is the situation of american indians 
at the request of russell red bear an american indian present 
at the meeting gorbachev autographed a copy of his book 
perestroika for former american indian movement leader leonard 
peltier 
peltier was convicted in 1977 of murdering two fbi agents and is 
jailed at leavenworth prison in kansas peltier insists he is 
innocent and soviet media cite his case as an example of what they 
say are human rights abuses in the united states 
reagan answering a question from a soviet student said the 
united states may have made a mistake when it humored indians 
by giving them reservations instead of integrating them into 
society 
indian representative anthony gonzales of san francisco told 
gorbachev that reagans remarks at moscow state university tuesday 
were typical of american racism 
gorbachev told the peace activists that each society must be 
able to choose its own course without outside interference he 
said long experience of russians and other soviets with 
christianity is proof that they can understand themselves and their 
society without advice from others

four zoo workers have become moms to a 
marmoset abandoned by her real mother and thanks to their tender 
loving care little eliza seems to be thriving 
the 2ounce 6weekold pygmy marmoset with the 4inch tail was 
dropped by her mother when she was just 3 days old 
with two other offspring to care for the mother julia didnt 
retrieve her thumbsized baby but the keepers at folsom childrens 
zoo rescued eliza and placed her in an infant isolette to increase 
the tiny monkeys chances of survival 
nightly one of the four surrogate parents lugs home the 
50pound isolette and caters to elizas hunger every two hours with 
a specially mixed baby formula dripped through a syringe 
zoo director john chapo says he expects eliza will be reunited 
with her family in a few weeks the father miguel and mom julia 
have been in isolation and out of public view since midmarch 
during the pregnancy and infancy of the three offspring eliza and 
two yet unnamed babies 
last year the pygmy pair gave birth to triplets but all three 
died chapo said 
this time the zoo didnt want to take any chances since only 
about 90 pygmy marmosets were in captivity around the world at the 
end of last year according to the international species inventory 
system chapo said he wanted to make sure all three monkeys 
survived

a proposed mandatory drugtesting program for 
airline workers prompted sharp criticism thursday from airline 
labor unions which argued there is no evidence of a problem in the 
industry to warrant it 
the union officials were among witnesses who testified at a 
public hearing on a proposed federal aviation administration 
regulation that would require a broad range of drug tests 
including random screening of tens of thousands of pilots flight 
attendants and other airline employees 
representatives of airline management backed the regulations as 
did administration officials 
the drugtesting program is crucial in our effort to establish 
a drugfree aviation system said transportation secretary jim 
burnley who conducted the hearing with faa administrator allan 
mcartor 
the proposed regulations call for preemployment tests 
postaccident tests tests if drug use is suspected and a system of 
random tests of employees 
burnley and mcartor have repeatedly called for a drugtesting 
program in aviation and last year began random testing of 
transportation department employees in a variety of safetyrelated 
jobs including air traffic controllers 
we are concerned that the department may ahve already 
decided on the main elements of this proposal especially random 
testing said raymond woolfolk representing the 40000member air 
line pilots association 
he said the union is uncompromisingly opposed to random drug 
testing of pilots because no evidence has been shown that such 
tests are needed or that they will be able to identify the small 
number if any of drug users in the industry 
to locate that one pilot many thousands of tests would have 
to be given woolfolk said instead of eliminating drug 
abuse the mandatory testing will merely spawn resentment 
opposition and litigation 
capt cr paty of the allied pilots association which 
represents pilots at american airlines complained that commercial 
aviators are being singled out while private pilots in whom more 
of a drug problem has been documented are not subject to the 
testing 
regulations are proposed to monitor our conduct while pilots 
in the general aviation sector whose statistics reveal some measure 
of drug abuse are left unregulated paty said in a written 
statement 
representatives of flight attendants unions also opposed the 
rule as did groups representing private pilots and air taxi 
operators 
societys drug problem should be dealt with by reasonable not 
intrusive means targeting specific highly visible groups without 
cause is not reasonable said brian moreau vice president of the 
independent union of flight attendants 
the pilot and flight attendant groups suggested that instead of 
mandatory random testing the faa help the industry develop a 
voluntary detection and rehabilitation program for drug abuse 
similar to the program the industry for years has used to deal with 
alcoholism 
but the drugtesting regulation received the endorsement of the 
air transport association the trade group for the major airlines 
we support as we have from the beginning the goals of the 
proposed testing rule the justification clearly must be the 
protection of public safety said james landry the trade 
associations general counsel 
the faa plans to hold further hearings on the drugtesting rule 
in denver on june 7 and san francisco on june 9 a final rule is 
likely before the end of the year

the return of michael manley to power in jamaica 
wouldnt mean a repeat of the tumultuous procuba policies that 
marked his leadership in the 1970s the socialist opposition leader 
said during a miami visit 
manley 63 will lead his peoples national party in elections 
this year against the jamaican labor party of prime minister edward 
seaga an ally of president reagan who has rebuilt the economy 
around trade and tourism 
polls by jamaican sociologist carl stone who has accurately 
predicted all island elections for 12 years have consistently 
given manley a solid lead over seaga whose nononsense style has 
overshadowed his economic recovery program 
seaga defeated manley in 1980 with the economy deteriorated and 
tensions high over the heavy involvement of cuba and radicals in 
the manley government 
but manley calling himself more mature and wiser after years of 
analyzing his governments failings has met in recent years with 
vice president george bush secretary of state george shultz other 
us officials and jamaican and international business leaders to 
outline his plans for a new approach 
i think that what happened then was that a situation was 
allowed to escalate that should never have happened manley said 
in an interview tuesday 
were quite clear we would have diplomatic relations with cuba 
as part of the third world part of the hemisphere part of the 
region etc but we do not ever intend again to allow the 
relationship with cuba to become internally divisive or a source of 
trouble with washington 
weve had many discussions about this with the state 
department and i dont anticipate its going to be a problem 
said manley who blamed us economic hostility and cia activity 
for undermining his government in his 1982 book jamaica 
struggle in the periphery seaga broke relations with cuba 
the main problem where cuba was concerned was that as our 
relationship developed and the pressure was put on us we allowed 
ourselves to become irritated and to become defiant manley said 
asked what cuba can offer his nation manley replied nothing 
in any direct sense their model of economic development is a 
marxistleninist model and were firmly rooted in parliamentary 
democracy human rights rule of law and the private sector these 
are so vastly different its hard to consider what one can 
contribute to the other 
seaga supporters warn that manleys rhetoric covers up his 
continued dedication to leftist principles and the influence of 
radicals within his party 
manley though pointed to increased business investment in 
jamaica in the past year although it is almost universally 
conceded that short of a miracle we will form the government 
that he said shows the private sector is confident about his 
commitment to working with it an area he concedes he handled 
poorly during his last government 
manley said his economic plan would promote national 
selfreliance while shifting away from heavy taxation of the 
productive side of the economy into the consumptive side heavy 
emphasis on creating new businesses far more collaborative nature 
between private sector and importantly revitalization of 
caricom the caribbean community a regional common market of the 
former british west indies 
elections are expected any time between july and november 
manley said he and seaga have made progress in peace talks 
aimed at avoiding a repeat of the violence that left hundreds dead 
in the 1980 election campaign

the house today overwhelmingly approved and 
sent to the senate a catastrophic health insurance bill designed to 
protect medicare beneficiaries from the financial devastation of a 
prolonged acute illness 
the bill the most sweeping expansion of medicare in its 23year 
history includes the programs firstever outpatient prescription 
drug benefit 
approval by the senate is likely after its memorial day recess 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen has said he will 
recommend that president reagan sign the legislation despite 
earlier administration misgivings that the bill is too broad 
the house voted for the bill 32872 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the ways and means 
committee called the plan a good reasonable and responsible 
agreement and said he expected approval by the president 
under the legislation the outofpocket deductible for doctor 
bills covered by medicare the amount paid by each recipient 
before government aid takes over all costs will wind up somewhere 
between 1320 a year and 1400 
the hospital benefit is already set full 365 dayayear 
coverage after a oneday deductible that rises along with average 
hospital costs the 1988 deductible is 540 
once fully implemented in 1993 the new prescription drug 
benefit will pay 80 percent of those costs after a 655 deductible 
by contrast medicare now pays no more than 80 percent of doctor 
bills no matter how high they climb and only 60 days of full 
hospital coverage after a oneday deductible 
the only prescription drugs now covered by medicare are a 
handful of particularly expensive ones such as antirejection 
medication for organ transplant patients 
all of the additional benefits are to be paid for by additional 
charges to medicare enrollees the charges will be a blend of flat 
monthly premium increases deducted from social security checks and 
an additional sliding scale supplemental premium charged the 
estimated 40 percent of the elderly to be subject to federal income 
taxes 
the additional flat premium will start at about 4 a month in 
1989 climbing to 1020 in 1993 
the socalled supplemental premium tantamount to an income tax 
surcharge is expected to total an additional 22 a year for each 
150 of income tax owed in 1989 climbing to an additional 42 a 
year on each 150 of tax liability by 1993

fallen television evangelist jim 
bakker just finished with a whirlwind visit to his old ptl 
ministry stomping grounds may want to buy back the smoky mountain 
retreat he left last year his attorney said thursday 
bakker and his wife tammy faye spent two days visiting the 
television ministry they left a year ago amid a sex scandal then 
drove wednesday to a house they used here 
probably the first thing they did was dust off the books 
theyve been gone nine months said ryan hovis an attorney with 
offices in rock hill and columbia sc 
he said he did not know how long the bakkers would stay or what 
exactly they would do there are some meetings weve got to have 
sometime soon in charlotte nc so theyll be there for that 
hovis said 
bakker got a warm reception from some longtime supporters 
tuesday and wednesday when he visited the heritage usa theme park 
at ptls headquarters in fort mill sc about 150 miles east of 
here 
bakker who wants to begin a new television ministry said hes 
looking for a secluded house in the region wants to open an office 
near heritage usa and may ask for air time on the ptl network 
bakker has several times in the past said that he and his wife 
should have a chance to salvage the ministry but ptl officials 
have always ruled it out 
the ministry is up to 130 million in debt and a reorganization 
plan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approval 
in bankruptcy court 
on tuesday bakker told reporters he might try to buy ptls 
assets when they are liquidated but refused to say where he would 
get the money 
hovis said the gatlinburg house which has a 12foot stone and 
wroughtiron security wall and a swimming pool still belongs to 
ptl creditor roe messner a wichita kan contractor 
the bakkers bought the house in 1987 and later deeded it to 
messner but i think eventually theyll want to buy it back 
the attorney said 
meanwhile a recently formed investment group that is seeking 
ptls assets said it has abandoned efforts to secure a 25 million 
letter of credit 
family entertainment america inc a partnership of realestate 
developers mortgage bankers political strategists and a former 
ptl broadcasting executive is instead seeking partners to raise 
cash said company spokesman kerry moody in laguna beach calif 
bakker left ptl after charges that jessica hahn a church 
secretary was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter his 
departure was followed by revelations about a lavish lifestyle and 
he was defrocked by the assemblies of god

drought has clamped down hard on georgia farmers 
threatening crops such as peanuts soybeans and corn state 
officials said thursday 
this has got to be treated as a major drought on a a par with 
the 50s the 30s and three other major droughts dating back to 
the 1840s state climatologist gayther plummer said thursday 
all crops and pastures are in a stressful situation if rain 
doesnt come soon theres a chance well be losing the crops 
said jerry midden agricultural statistician for the georgia crop 
reporting service 
one after another governments around atlanta have tightened 
restrictions on outdoor water use to conserve the dwindling supply 
in lake lanier the areas primary water resource 
the atlanta area is 54 inches or 23 percent short on water 
for the year according to the national weather service 
the northeastern part of georgia is running 50 percent of 
normal rainfall or slightly less in some places for the first 
five months of 1988 said plummer in a telephone interview from his 
office at the university of georgia 
the southern half of the state is adequate to short on 
rainfall plummer said 
midden said the latest crop report shows 30 percent of the state 
has adequate soil moisture 52 percent is short and 18 percent is 
very short 
row crops such as peanuts soybeans and corn are in serious 
trouble midden said lack of moisture causes slow germination and 
poor stands theyre sitting in the dry soil and withering away 
georgia is the nations largest peanut producing state and its 
1987 crop was valued at 500 million 
tobacco is transplanted early and by now has developed a full 
root system making it more tolerant of the drought he said the 
peach and winter wheat harvests already are under way 
because of dry pastures georgia agriculture commissioner tommy 
irvin has gotten permission for farmers to graze livestock on land 
set aside under the conservation reserve program of the food 
security act of 1985 normally that land must lie fallow 
this additional pasture and hay should give our farmers some 
needed relief irvin said wednesday without additional feed he 
said farmers could be forced to sell off their herds leading to 
a shortage of feeder cows later in the year 
plummer said the southeast goes through a fiveyear wshaped 
drought cycle every 25 to 30 years its a dry period followed 
by a short wet period then another dry period with gradually 
increasing rainfall he said 
the lefthand bottom of the current w was in 1986 
our current drought is not yet as intense as the 54 
drought he said the drought is not as deep as the 54 but we 
are broader than the 54 the w has a broader bottom to it we 
are into this thing a little longer than we have been on the five 
previous occasions 
he said he expected a wetter period to recur in the early 1990s 
dekalb county in atlantas eastern suburbs on wednesday became 
the latest to tighten water use restrictions banning outdoor water 
use between 5 pm and 11 pm mondays through fridays and from 
midnight fridays through midnight sundays 
the water consumption was going up instead of going down 
said gus monroe deputy director of the water and sewer division 
we have to do something to slow down water consumption

a communist party member on thursday called for 
the publication of a secret speech nikita s khrushchev gave in 
1956 that detailed dictator josef v stalins crimes against 
society 
if the party is keeping secrets from communists in the pages 
of its history that are not state secrets then it is clear that it 
doesnt serve the unity of the party said v rusakov dean of 
the philosophy and scientific communism department at sverdlovsk 
agricultural institute 
the article by rusakov a teacher of marxismleninism was 
published in thursdays editions of the sovietskaya kultura 
newspaper 
it appeared to be the latest example in the leaderships 
campaign to open up the pages of soviet history and break down the 
barriers erected by those who are clinging to the old policy of 
guarding and controlling all information 
khrushchevs address to the 20th party congress held three 
years after the death of josef v stalin in 1953 described the 
dictators crimes in the 29 years he served as soviet leader 
about 20 million soviets were killed in political purges carried 
out under stalin and in the drive to collectivize agriculture 
according to estimates by western historians 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness on selected topics stalins 
crimes are no longer a taboo subject the name of khrushchev who 
was ousted as leader in 1964 is appearing more frequently in the 
press 
the call by rusakov to publish khrushchevs denunciation of 
stalin is not the first in october prominent soviet scientist 
vitaly i goldansky also said khrushchevs report known in the 
west as his secret speech because it was delivered behind 
closed doors should be published 
the withholding of the information from soviets was 
ridiculous rusakov said since the text of the speech was 
leaked almost immediately in the west 
all the world a long time ago read the secret report by ns 
khrushchev at the 20th party congress of the cpsu communist party 
of the soviet union but an overwhelming majority of soviet 
communists dont know this document which so radically changed the 
evaluation of the development of the party and the state the 
educator wrote 
he said the whole nation not just party members awaits the 
publication of khrushchevs report as well as the documents of all 
party congresses conferences and plenums 
rusakov said that was necessary for historical research which 
he said was a part of glasnost he said the documents should also 
be put before the public to overcome the stereotypes and myths 
which were created and indoctrinated into the consciousness of the 
people 
he called for an accounting of how people were politically 
repressed and who was responsible 
this is the sole means to avoid the gossip rumors and 
illintended falsification of the internal life and history of the 
party he said

dies used to strike the most valuable coin 
minted by the government are missing a treasury department 
official acknowledged thursday 
the secret service is investigating the disappearance in january 
of 24 dies for the obverse or front of 1ounce gold bullion 
eagles said michael brown a spokesman for the us mint they 
were lost or stolen while en route between mints in san francisco 
and west point ny he said 
the eagle has a face value of 50 but the sales price currently 
460 to 470 fluctuates with the price of spot gold the dies 
which are 5inchlong cylinders the width of a coin are worth 
about 40 each brown said 
he said the missing dies likely would be of little use to 
counterfeiters because all were for one side of the coin 
but rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
subcommittee that oversees the mint branded the loss the second 
such mishap in two years unpardonable 
in the first incident 44 dies used to strike the 1 statue of 
liberty commemorative coins disappeared in april 1986 on their way 
to the royal canadian mint in ottawa only one was ever recovered 
it turned up last year in the possession of a canadian coin dealer 
at a coin show in atlanta 
after the 1986 incident the mint began hiring armored cars for 
crossborder shipments but continued to use overnight mail services 
for delivery within the united states 
normally employees of the delivery service sign for the dies at 
each transfer point but brown said a clerk at the san francisco 
mint apparently failed to complete a shipping form requiring that 
they were shipped as ordinary freight as if they were a crate 
of oranges annunzio said in a recent speech on the house floor 
someone apparently figured out that a package going from one mint 
to another mint would be valuable 
annunzio said he would grill mint officials on the subject at 
budget hearings conducted by his subcommittee later this year 
i intend to find out why security for dies was so deliberately 
lax he said losing dies once because of slack shipping 
procedures is inexcusable losing dies a second time is 
unpardonable 
brown said about 75000 dies are shipped around the country each 
year they are made in philadelphia and sent to regional mints 
depending on production schedules dies used to mint proof 
coins for collectors are sent to san francisco for a special 
polishing process 
beginning in late april the mint began using armored cars for 
domestic as well as crossborder shipments he said 
i think our records pretty good obviously it was a 
mistake and we dont like them to happen and we moved quickly to 
make sure it doesnt happen again he said 
the clerk has not been disciplined brown said but were 
working on that process right now 
however annunzio noted that the change in shipping procedures 
came three months after the eagle dies disappeared 
the mints footdragging on switching to a secure method of 
shipping dies is inexplicable he said in the floor speech 
delivered may 25 and first reported in thursdays editions of the 
washington post 
was the mint trying to pinch pennies quite frankly i do 
not have the answers he said

responded by saying the strike did not damage to the economy 
this is a oneday strike that was forced on the workers by the 
professional unions and i heard that many workers were 
dissatisfied with the strike call he said 
the strike came just after negotiations passed a major hurdle 
when unions agreed to end the linkage between wages and economic 
indicators said ministry spokesman yitzhak feinberg 
such linkages in the past have been blamed as contributing to 
high inflation rates 
the unions represent workers in variety of workplaces and salary 
levels they have not stated specific figures but they want raises 
of at least 10 percent monthly salaries now range from 435 to 
1850 
the government maintains the economy now is stable so even small 
raises are unnecessary inflation last year was 20 percent which 
is low by israeli standards

secretary of state george p shultz 
told the nato allies thursday that the failure to reach a strategic 
arms agreement at the moscow summit was a blessing in a curious 
way because it allowed more attention to be focused on human 
rights and other issues 
the allies in turn cheered what they called a broad 
improvement in eastwest relations 
shultz met with european foreign ministers and other alliance 
officials for about two hours before flying to london to join 
president reagan he plans to leave friday on a new mission to the 
middle east to push his plan for arabisraeli peace talks 
i certainly feel and i believe all my fellow foreign 
ministers felt the outcome was a very good one shultz said at a 
news conference 
he said the two leaders had scored advances in numerous areas of 
arms control including negotiations to ban chemical weapons cut 
longrange nuclear missiles and reduce eastwest conventional 
forces 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister told 
reporters after meeting with shultz that his government was pleased 
with the summit results despite the lack of a big breakthrough in 
arms control 
we share his opinion that it was a successful and substantial 
summit genscher said through this summit the americansoviet 
relationship got a new stability a new perspective 
other alliance officials were equally upbeat 
what is important is the judgment that shultz gave that the 
political climate of the meeting was a substantial success 
italian foreign minister giulio andreotti told reporters 
lord carrington the nato secretary general underscored the 
emphasis reagan put on human rights issues during the summit as 
well as the progress reported in various areas of arms control 
all these are elements of an increasingly stable relationship 
between the united states and the soviet union which can only 
benefit the alliance carrington said 
in his news conference shultz discounted gorbachevs comment on 
wednesday that the summit could have achieved more in arms control 
always its possible to achieve more but it simply wasnt 
possible to work through all of the difficult issues and i think 
we all recognize that he said 
shultz said that absent a major arms control breakthrough the 
superpowers were able to give more attention to three other main 
agenda items human rights bilateral relations and regional issues 
such as the angolan civil war 
he called this a blessing in a curious way 
the absence of anything like that has caused people to reflect 
on what may be the more important meaning of what the president 
the general secretary and others have managed to put together 
here shultz said 
people can see more clearly than otherwise that the 
superpower relationship now proceeds on the basis of an 
established fourpart agenda 
shultz declined to rule out a ussoviet agreement on 30 
percent to 50 percent reductions in strategic or longrange 
nuclear weapons before reagan leaves office next january the main 
stumbling block is soviet objections to reagans strategic defense 
initiative for developing a spacebased defense against ballistic 
missiles 
its possible were going to work hard on it shultz said 
negotiations are scheduled to resume in geneva on july 12 
genscher said he told shultz that the europeans were 
particularly eager to see a strategic arms accord since the soviet 
longrange missiles can be targeted on european as well as american 
territory 
andreotti said shultz told the nato meeting that gorbachev had 
demonstrated at the summit a determination to want to conclude 
initiatives with this administration to the maximum extent 
possible

president reagans special arms control 
adviser began an asian trip thursday to brief leaders on the 
summit and a top state department official planned a similar visit 
to two of moscows tightest adherents 
edward l rowny the arms control official told japanese 
foreign minister sousuke uno the summit was a triumph of 
realism according to an account issued by rownys office 
rowny who in the past has been outspoken in his criticism of 
soviet motives said progress on strategic disarmament was made at 
the summit but lets remember that the soviet negotiators always 
seek to cripple us in areas where they fear we might utilize our 
comparative technological advantages 
whenever they move away from such positions and agree to truly 
equitable measures they are not being motivated by philanthropy 
rather they are responding to patience firmness and solidarity on 
the part of the allies 
rowny was scheduled to brief chinese leaders on saturday and 
planned to go to australia and south korea for similar meetings 
the state department announced meanwhile that deputy secretary 
john c whitehead will visit east germany austria hungary 
yugoslavia west germany and the netherlands during a trip to 
europe beginning friday to review the results of the summit 
and discuss other issues 
east germany and hungary are soviet allies and provide troops to 
the warsaw pact forces in eastern europe 
since reagan first met soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in 
geneva in 1985 the united states has made a practice of sending 
toplevel officials on postsummit trips to eastern europe to make 
sure the soviets allies get the us perspective on how the 
meetings went 
there are no plans for whitehead to meet kurt waldheim the 
president of neutral austria during talks in vienna waldheim has 
been barred from entry to the united states because of his 
activities as an officer in the german army in world war ii and 
us diplomats are under orders to avoid contacts with the austrian 
president

mr general secretary and mrs gorbachev this is an emotional 
moment for mrs reagan and me we have been truly moved by the 
warmth and the generous hospitality that we received from all of 
our soviet hosts during this brief visit but most especially from 
the two of you 
during this meeting as in all of our previous meetings i 
appreciated and valued our exchanges and the long hours of hard 
work that we and our experts put in to make progress on the 
difficult issues we face but this meeting has added something else 
for mrs reagan and me 
our time here has allowed us to know if only briefly your art 
treasures and your people artists writers individuals from all 
walks of life people who were willing to share with us their 
experiences their fears their hopes 
mr general secretary it is fitting that we are ending our 
visit as we began it in this hall named for the order of st 
george i would like to think that our efforts during these past 
few days have slayed a few dragons and advanced the struggle 
against the evils that threaten mankind threats to peace and to 
liberty and i would like to hope that like st george with gods 
help peace and freedom can prevail 
mr general secretary if you will permit me just one more 
proverb i think a very old and popular saying you have here about 
last sunday the day of our arrival spoke to the promise we have 
seen fulfilled at this summit in this moscow spring 
truly then troitsa ves les postroitsya holiday of the trinity 
and the whole forest will bloom 
and now if i might just conclude on a personal note earlier 
this week at moscow state university i mentioned to the young 
people there that they appeared to my eyes exactly as would any 
group of students in my own country or anywhere else in the world 
so too did nancy and i find the faces young and old here on the 
streets of moscow 
at first more than anything else they were curious faces but 
as the time went on the smiles began and then the waves and i 
dont have to tell you nancy and i smiled back and waved just as 
hard 
mr general secretary i think you understand were not just 
grateful to both you and mrs gorbachev but want you to know we 
think of you as friends and in that spirit we would ask one 
further favor of you tell the people of the soviet union of the 
deep feelings of friendship felt by us and by the people of our 
country toward them 
tell them too nancy and i are grateful for their coming out to 
see us grateful for their waves and smiles and tell them we will 
remember all of our days their faces the faces of hope hope for 
a new era in human history an era of peace between our nations and 
our peoples

<TEXT>
esteemed mr president and mrs reagan one hour from now you 
will be leaving moscow in the first place i want to thank you and 
your colleagues for cooperation openness and a businesslike 
approach to the talks we have had here i believe that both of us 
have every reason to regard this meeting and your visit as a useful 
contribution to the development of dialogue betwen the soviet union 
and the united states 
mr president you and i have been dealing with each other for 
three years now from the first exchange of letters to the 
conclusion of this meeting weve come a long way our dialogue has 
not been easy but we mustered enough realism and political will to 
overcome obstacles and divert the train of ussoviet relations 
from a dangerous track to a safer one 
it has however so far been moving much more slowly than is 
required by the real situation both in our two countries and in 
the whole world but as i have understood mr president you are 
willing to continue our joint endeavors 
for my part i can assure you that we will do everything in our 
power to go on moving forward now with the vast experience of 
geneva reykjavik washington and moscow and backed up by their 
achievements we are in duty bound to display still greater 
determination and consistency that is what the soviet and american 
peoples international public opinion and the entire world 
community are expecting of us 
i hope you will have pleasant memories of your stay in this 
country mr president mrs reagan when you return to america 
please convey to the american people best wishes from the peoples 
of the soviet union 
over the past three years our two nations have come to know 
each other better they have now taken a really good look in each 
others eyes and have a keener sense of the need to learn to live 
together on this beautiful planet earth 
i wish you a good journey back home mr president and mrs 
reagan to you and to all members of the us delegation i wish 
good health goodbye

prime minister margaret thatchers government 
thursday lost a threeyear court battle to block australian 
publication of a former intelligence agents memoirs 
mrs thatchers expensive crusade against peter wrights 
spycatcher had prompted protests that the government was 
infringing on freedom of the press 
australias highest court the sevenjudge high court in the 
capital of canberra ruled against britain in its final bid to 
suppress the book 
the judges accepted britains contention that wright was bound 
by a lifetime oath of silence about his 25 years with the mi5 
counterespionage agency but they said australian courts had no 
jurisdiction to enforce a british security regulation 
they unanimously rejected the british governments attempt to 
seize all profits from spycatcher to prevent further 
publication of the book in australia 
about 240000 copies of the book had been sold in australia 
after lower courts ruled in wrights favor and publishers william 
heinemann released 200000 paperback copies immediately after 
thursdays verdict 
the judgment also releases nearly 36 million in royalties to 
the 73yearold wright who lives on a horse farm in tasmania and 
is said to be in poor health 
the publicity from mrs thatchers campaign against the book 
accounts for much of the books stunning commercial success 
more than 14 million copies have been sold in 40 countries 
including the united states despite the governments continued ban 
in britain and hong kong 
the british taxpayer is left with an legal bill estimated at 
36 million in the australian case alone the government was 
ordered to pay an estimated 900000 in legal costs 
wrights book frequently smuggled into britain by tourists and 
britons returning from overseas describes his 20year career in 
the mi5 counterespionage service 
it alleges that the security service eavesdropped on foreign 
embassies burgled offices stole documents plotted assassination 
attempts and discussed how to bring down harold wilsons labor 
party government in the 1970s 
mrs thatchers attempt to suppress the memoirs dates from 
september 1985 when an australian court granted a temporary 
injunction against the book 
the subsequent hearings prompted newspapers in britain to 
publish extracts of spycatcher and the government immediately 
clamped down creating a confrontation over press freedom 
the government maintains it has pursued the case to uphold the 
principle that former security officers are bound by a lifetime 
oath of silence about their work to relax the rule officials 
argue would seriously undermine national security 
lawmaker tam dalyell of the opposition labor party said the 
government was squandering public money on its legal challenges 
it was obvious to many lawyers and politicians many moons ago 
that this australian decision would happen dalyell said 
it was political obstinacy and stupidity on behalf of the 
government the government must now abandon all other 
proceedings relating to this book around the world 
the government still hopes to block spycatcher in britain 
where it has banned the book and brought a halfdozen court cases 
to prevent newspapers from publishing extracts 
on june 13 the nations highest court the fivejudge law lords 
of the house of lords is to decide whether to overturn a ban 
imposed on publication of extracts from spycatcher in three 
newspapers the sunday times the observer and the guardian 
conservative michael mates said the principle confidentiality on 
which the government based its case should be defended to the last 
and i think the government has been entirely right to do that 
difficult and embarrassing as it has been he said in an 
interview with independent television news

the house appropriations committee voted 
approval thursday of a 300 billion military spending bill that 
gives president reagan far less than he wanted for his star 
wars antimissile defense 
the voice vote action sends the bill to the floor of the 
democraticcontrolled house where it is expected to be considered 
next week 
the bill appropriates 2995 billion for the pentagon for the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 which would be a reduction from the 
current defense budget of 301 billion 
the bill appropriates 35 billion for the strategic defense 
initiative as star wars is formally known reagan had sought 49 
billion for the program which has a 39 billion budget for the 
current year 
the bill appropriates money already authorized by the house last 
month in a separate pentagon measure 
the appropriations bill did not contain a series of arms control 
restrictions added last month by democrats to the authorization 
bill 
those restrictions eliminate all but the smallest nuclear tests 
require adherence to the unratified 1979 salt ii nuclear arms 
treaty and ban spending money for any star wars tests that violate 
the existing interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty 
the restrictions were dropped from the legislation approved 
thursday hiefly because of a jurisdictional fight within the house 
between the appropriations committee and the armed services 
committee which oversees the authorization bill 
under house rules the appropriation bills are only supposed to 
involve amounts of money and not include policy issues such as 
arms control the armed services committee had objected to adding 
the arms control restrictions to the appropriations bill 
rep norman dicks dwash a member of the appropriations 
committee and a supporter of the restrictions said i think you 
might see the arms control amendments added on the floor 
my instinct is that it helps to have them on both bills 
appropriations and the authorization bill said dicks i would 
support adding them on the floor 
rep vic fazio dcalif said we didnt add the arms control 
provision basically because of a jurisdictional question

two years after its chief heart surgeon was 
courtmartialed the bethesda naval hospital has come under new 
criticism for failing to follow physician credentialing procedures 
officials said thursday 
an internal investigation has concluded the latest problem did 
not jeopardize patient care and the competence of any doctors 
never was called into question at the maryland facility the 
officials added 
but the finding that there was a procedural failure in the 
hiring and credentialing of a physician at the navys premiere 
hospital nonetheless has attracted highlevel attention one of 
the officials said 
the criticism is contained in an interim audit report by the 
navys inspector general the report was prompted by a complaint 
from the current head of bethesdas cardiothoracic unit 
the navy said thursday it would not release the interim audit 
report but several officials agreed to discuss the matter on 
condition they not be identified 
the issue is a particularly sensitive one for bethesda because 
of the case of dr donal m billig the former chief heart surgeon 
billig was courtmartialed and convicted in 1986 of involuntary 
manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three patients that 
conviction was overturned in april by an appeals court however 
and billig received an honorable discharge 
one of the key issues raised by prosecutors during the 
courtmartial was that billig hid a visual handicap from his 
superiors and that military recruiters failed to investigate his 
background adequately 
in the latest case the sources said the inspector general found 
the navy failed to adequately review the patient survival record of 
a heart surgeon who was returning to bethesda after five years in 
private practice as the head of the howard university hospital 
cardiothoracic unit 
ironically the surgeon involved dr reginald peniston was a 
prosecution witness against billig 
the officials said thursday that penistons credentials were not 
reviewed formally by a new panel of naval officers before his 
appointment to the hospital penistons appointment was finalized 
in february with orders given to him to report for duty in march 
peniston who was assigned temporarily to the cardiothoracic 
unit at walter reed army medical center early in may did not 
return a phone call thursday to discuss the matter 
the inspector general launched the investigation after a 
complaint was filed by cmdr edward woods the current head of the 
bethesda cardiothoracic unit

police said thursday they recovered six 
paintings by joan miro and arrested eight suspects in a theft two 
months ago from the fundacion miro museum in barcelona 
a painting believed to be the work of 19th century french artist 
henri toulouselautrec also was recovered police chief enrique de 
federico told reporters 
ferran cardenal civil governor of barcelona returned the miro 
paintings to the museum 
on wednesday police in milan italy arrested antonio jorge 
carrancio of spain in connection with the april 5 museum breakin 
de federico said carrancio 32 was in italy seeking buyers for 
the miro works which included gouaches pastels and oils from the 
spanish artists early period 
also on wednesday police arrested a 36yearold uruguayan luis 
anibal medina 36 and two suspects in barcelona 
police found three miro paintings and the work attributed to 
toulouselautrec in a sealed tube buried near a cottage outside the 
city de federico said authorities did not know where the fourth 
painting had come from 
the other three paintings were in a hollow wall in a fruit 
warehouse owned by carrancios parents in the northern city of 
palencia the police chief said and parents and two carrancio 
brothers had wee arrested 
investigators began following carrancio and medina the day after 
the theft when a witness provided the license number of a van 
registered to one of them de federico said 
carrancio set off an alarm when he broke into museum but escaped 
because the lone unarmed night watchman called police instead of 
confronting the thief police said medina allegedly was waiting 
outside in the van 
according to de federico both men have police records and are 
not specialists in art theft

consumers lack adequate information to 
evaluate the quality of care from doctors and hospitals according 
to a congressional study released thursday 
the study by the office of technology assessment prepared at 
the request of rep james scheuer dny said there now is no 
single source readily available to the consumer to evaluate the 
quality of care and what little information is available is 
difficult to collect and understand 
such evaluations could be created the report said if congress 
would act to require the data to be collected and released to the 
public 
we have all kinds of hightech medical equipment now but when 
it comes to information for consumers on the quality of medical 
care we are still in the ice age scheuer said in releasing the 
report what information is available is inadquate and frequently 
incomprehensible 
scheuer said he will conduct hearings to determine the best way 
to evaluate the qualilty of work by doctors and hospitals and then 
will push for a legislation requiring that this information be 
distributed to consumers 
were trying to develop a system to give consumers information 
that they need he said we know now that there are valid 
indicators to assess both hospitals and doctors 
the ota report said quality of care information could be used 
not only by individual consumers but also by companies and labor 
unions that are selecting hospitals physician groups and health 
maintenance organizations 
doctors could find the information on other doctors useful in 
deciding on referrals and in hiring staff physicians at hospitals 
or hmos 
for now the report said consumers rely mostly on the 
suggestions and experiences of friends and families to select 
doctors and hospitals

fresh from the splendors of the kremlin president 
reagan and his wife nancy went to buckingham palace for tea with 
the queen thursday and smiled aside all invitations to compare the 
virtues of east and west 
standing on a red carpet in the marblecolumned grand entrance 
hall of the 600room palace the president was asked by a reporter 
whether he was happy to be out of moscow and back in london 
let me put it very simply im very happy to be in london 
he replied smiling wryly 
mrs reagan whose prickly relationship with raisa gorbachev was 
evident during this weeks moscow summit was asked whether she was 
happy to be seeing queen elizabeth ii rather than the soviet 
leaders wife 
im very happy to see the queen at all times she replied 
with a big smile 
the hourlong tea in the queens audience room overlooking the 
45acre palace gardens was a meeting of old friends the reagans 
were guests of the royal family at windsor castle in 1982 and the 
62yearold monarch stayed at the reagan ranch in 1983 reagan 
attended a buckingham palace dinner during the 1984 economic summit 
the reagans arrived at the palace two minutes late getting out 
of their limousine at the glassedin grand entrance where prince 
charles and princess diana returned in a horsedrawn open carriage 
after their 1981 wedding extravaganza 
inside the hall the queen hatless and wearing a sapphireblue 
silk dress stretched out her hand and said nice to see you 
again how are you mr president 
reagan in a blue suit and red and blue striped tie and the 
first lady wearing a silk twopiece dress and matching shoes in 
her favorite color of red chatted with the queen while posing for 
photographers 
then the queen led them along the giltandwhite marble hall 
lined with sculptures and paintings mainly of her greatgreat 
grandmother queen victoria to the audience room where she 
receives prime minister margaret thatcher for her weekly audience 
it was just tea for three since the queens husband prince 
philip had a previous engagement in suffolk 
the reagans greeting was watched by about 50 members of the 
queens household who stood behind a red rope in the marble hall 
outside the palace police said about 1500 people gathered 
cheering and waving as the reagans drove by the president and his 
wife waved back as they swept through the iron gates 
we got a beautiful warm smile it was worth the 2hour 
wait said barbara lee of minneapolis minnesota 
barbara black of camarillo california said i live about 
30 miles from reagans ranch and i dont bother to visit him and 
here i am half way around the world standing in line waiting to get 
a vague glimpse of him 
justine griffin a scot who waited outside the palace also was 
enthusiastic about the american president 
i think hes a good bloke she said 
after tea the reagans went their separate ways 
the president went to the foreign office where he was officially 
welcomed by mrs thatcher and a band of welsh guards playing the 
national anthem and irving berlin hits 
the first lady returned to the us ambassadors residence 
winfield house to meet with prince charles who flew back to

the remains of the bunker where adolf hitler 
committed suicide were destroyed to make room for a housing project 
in east berlin the staterun east german news agency reported 
thursday 
for the new building project the former bunker site was 
cleared over the past few months with numerous blastings and with 
wreckage collection teams the adn news agency report said 
during world war ii hitler and other nazi officials often used 
bunker complexes in berlin then the capital of germany to direct 
the war and seek protection for allied bomb attacks 
to avoid capture when the war ended hitler and his companion 
eva braun killed themselves in the chancellory bunker which was on 
what now is part of the construction site in east berlin 
in recent years the site next to the berlin wall was only a 
pile of rubble that had become overgrown with grass and weeds 
adn said apartments for about 3000 people will be constructed

the standard of living of workers in other 
major countries has risen four times as fast as the us standard 
of living in the past 15 years according to a new study on 
american competitiveness released thursday 
the report prepared by the council on competitiveness 
concluded that the united states had lost ground not only in terms 
of living standards but also in the related areas of international 
trade productivity and investment 
in an increasingly global economy others are either fast 
gaining on us or have surpassed america in the areas that will 
determine future competitive success said michael porter a 
harvard university economics professor who served as a consultant 
on the study if we continue along the path weve been on since 
1972 we could lose the competitiveness battle altogether 
the council is a coalition of executives from industry 
organized labor and higher education who got together in 1986 to 
help american companies compete more effectively in world markets 
the new report is certain to heighten the debate in the 
presidential campaign over whether the united states is becoming a 
secondrate economic power critics of reagan administration 
policies point to the countrys status as the worlds largest 
debtor nation to highlight their contention that a string of record 
trade deficits during the 1980s shows that america has lost the 
ability to compete internationally 
the reagan administration has dismissed such concerns 
contending that the countrys trade deficits have begun to improve 
and the united states is currently enjoying the longest peacetime 
expansion on record 
but the councils report argued that the administrations 
position neglects longterm economic trends that paint a more 
distressing picture 
we would hope that both presidential candidates will have 
strong programs to propose in this area porter said this will 
give the america people a benchmark with which to grade the quality 
of each candidates proposals 
the council presented what it called a competitiveness 
index which it said measured americas performance against its 
competitors in global markets 
the report said in all four areas it surveyed the united states 
had lost ground compared with the worlds six other large 
industrial democracies japan west germany britain france 
canada and italy these nations and the united states meet annually 
for economic summits including an upcoming session this month in 
toronto 
among the reports conclusions 
since 1972 the united states standard of living has grown only 
onefourth as fast as the average standard of living of the other 
summit countries when compared with americas two biggest 
competitors west germany and japan the difference is even more 
striking american workers standard of living has risen only 
onehalf as fast as the average west german and only oneseventh as 
fast as the average japanese because of these developments the 
councils standard of living index dropped to 789 which is 211 
points below its 1972 level of 100 
traditional measures of the standard of living focus on total 
output divided by the population however the council said it 
divided output by the number of workers to reflect the fact that 
more and more american families find they must have two incomes to 
keep up financially the councils living standard also included 
the countrys trade deficit on the grounds that this represented 
money borrowed from foreigners that would eventually have to be 
paid back 
despite the boom in american export sales last year americas 
share of world exports stood at 10 percent last year below the 12 
percent share the country had in 1972 this pushed the trade index 
down to 826 percent of its 1972 base this was still an 
improvement from 1986 when the index fell to 745 before the 
weaker dollar began to boost us export sales 
productivity the output per worker showed the most lost 
ground the councils measure for productivity dropped to 687 
percent of its 1972 base since 1972 manufacturing productivity in 
japan has increased eight times faster than in the united states 
while average productivity growth in the six summit countries has 
been more than four times as fast as in america 
longterm us investment including spending for research and 
development capital equipment and education came out best in the 
ranking at 962 down only 38 percent from the 1972 level

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis cut short his california campaign thursday and 
canceled his final debate with rival jesse jackson to return to 
massachusetts and his wife kitty who faced back surgery friday 
morning 
she feels good shes obviously a little apprehensive 
dukakis said after talking with his wife by telephone before 
leaving san francisco 
mrs dukakis surgery was decided upon after her doctor in 
boston nicholas t zervas examined results of tests done last 
saturday while she was in los angeles 
she was admitted to massachusetts general hospital wednesday 
night for further tests and hospital spokesman martin bander said 
she was experiencing considerable increasing discomfort 
because of the worsening of the condition we feel it 
important to operate now zervas said 
mrs dukakis had complained for about a month of a numbness in 
her hands and pain in her neck said mark gearan campaign press 
secretary for the massachusetts governor 
the surgery is to correct two herniated cervical discs in the 
neck area of her back gearan said he said no other medical 
problem was discovered 
i think everything is ok and is going to be ok but dr zervas 
felt it was better to operate now and not wait a few days 
dukakis told reporter 
bander the hospital spokesman said the operation involved 
taking a bone graft from mrs dukakis hip to replace a portion of 
bone in her back that is pressing against her spinal cord 
the plan is to remove the discs compressing on the spinal 
cord the bone graft taken from the hip will be split and fused 
into the vertabrae to replace the two areas from which the discs 
will be removed bander said 
dukakis said he regretted having to cancel campaign appearances 
but this is obviously the most important thing he said he 
hoped to resume campaigning saturday or sunday if everything is 
ok 
his debate with jackson was to have been the last debate by the 
democratic presidential candidates of the primary season both 
dukakis and jackson were campaigning toward the june 7 primaries in 
california new jersey montana and new mexico 
jackson in los angeles said im available to debate any 
time he said of dukakis his excuse is certainly an acceptable 
one i do fervently hope the debate can be rescheduled 
among the other campaign events canceled was a scheduled stop in 
montana and a meeting with supporters in des moines iowa 
mrs dukakis surgery was scheduled for 730 am edt at 
massachusetts general with a surgical team led by zervas chief of 
neurosurgery at the hospital 
gearan said doctors described her medical problem as a 
degenerative condition apparently not caused by an injury she 
has been wearing a neck brace 
dukakis arrived in california from massachusetts only wednesday 
night he attended just one public event a meeting with school 
children on a san francisco beach before leaving 
dukakis first met privately with environmentalists at a 
restaurant the cliff house overlooking the rocky pacific coast 
where seals played in the ocean he then walked down to a beach 
where he spoke informally to 45 elementary school pupils about the 
environment and the importance of using biodegradable products that 
will not leave lasting pollution 
on another subject at a news conference dukakis said the 
summit meeting just concluded in moscow wasnt dramatic but 
produced a series of small steps that are encouraging 
obviously theres some disappointment theres not a start 
strategic arms reduction agreement but that doesnt mean we 
cant have one he said

scientists have identified the precise 
target where the aids virus latches onto cells it destroys another 
step toward a drug to combat the fatal disease 
for the first time we have fairly precisely defined the 
structure on the cell surface to which a virus binds this is a 
primary step in the infective process said protein chemist 
stephen bh kent research team leader at the california institute 
of technology 
once the virus target called a binding site was 
identified by caltech molecular biologist bradford jameson the 
studys chief author he and his colleagues manufactured crude 
synthetic copies of the binding site 
the studys coauthors at the university of alabama then found 
that in the test tube the fake binding sites acted as decoys to 
attract the aids virus they overwhelmed aids virus particles so 
the virus couldnt latch onto real binding sites on t4 white blood 
cells the main cells infected and destroyed by the virus which 
cripples the immune system 
if scientists can create more sophisticated versions of the fake 
binding site those might work as a drug to treat or cure acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome or to carry viruskilling drugs to the 
aids virus 
the same method might be used to create drugs to fight other 
viruses rheumatoid arthritis and rejection of transplanted organs 
jameson said 
this is the first step toward a secondgeneration drug that 
could be available in 10 years and be more effective than drugs now 
under development to combat the aids virus kent said adding we 
do not want to give people false hope 
kent is exaggerating the length of time a little bit said 
dr mathilde krim a founder of the american foundation for aids 
research if things go very well id say two years until it the 
drug would be made available to people with lifethreatening hiv 
aids virus infection 
krims foundation funded the 120000 study which is being 
published friday in the journal science other coauthors included 
ortho pharmaceuticals researchers in raritan nj 
scientists previously knew the aids virus infects t4 white blood 
cells by binding to cd4 a protein on their surface caltech 
researchers identified the exact part of that protein to which the 
aids virus binds and determined that it looks like a loop 
protruding from the protein 
to my knowledge it is the first time a binding site has been 
identified with such precision for any virus krim said by phone 
from new york its a wonderful accomplishment 
it will enable people to get a handle on the mechanism by 
which a virus can infect a cell jameson said 
in december researchers at philadelphias smith kline amp french 
laboratories south san franciscos genentech inc and bostons 
dana farber cancer institute said they manufactured synthetic cd4 
proteins in testtube experiments the fake proteins acted as 
decoys preventing the aids virus from infecting t4 cells 
the fake binding site copies made by jameson kent and caltech 
biology chairman leroy hood stopped aids infection the same way 
kent speculated that a drug made only of fake binding sites rather 
than fake whole cd4 proteins should last longer in the bloodstream 
and be more effective in stopping aids 
a major obstacle is that either fake cd4 proteins or fake 
binding sites might serve not only as decoys for the aids virus 
but as decoys for macrophages cells that carry invading germs to 
t4 cells so they can be destroyed by the immune system 
so a drug meant to prevent aids from destroying the immune 
system might actually prevent the immune system from performing its 
job kent said 
but krim said that risk should be much lower if fake binding 
sites rather than fake cd4 proteins are used in a drug and that 
such risk would be acceptable in treating severely ill aids 
patients 
kent said drugs could be developed against other viruses if 
scientists identify precisely binding sites on cells those viruses 
attack then make fake binding sites to prevent the viruses from 
reaching their intended targets 
such drugs might be useful even if they harm the immune system 
those drugs might be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other 
autoimmune diseases in which the body is attacked by its own 
immune system and to prevent the immune system from rejecting 
transplanted organs krim and jameson said

swedish monitors said thursday they 
have detected radiation indicating that a nuclear power plant in 
the soviet union routinely discharges clouds of radioactive 
particles 
the levels are still harmless but they illustrate a poorer 
security thinking than we have in sweden said larserik de geer 
of the defense research agency foa 
he said a study of wind directions and radiation levels at 
different monitoring stations pointed to the ignalina plant in 
lithuania as the source of the radiation 
he said the plant 400 miles southeast of stockholm has made four 
large discharges of radioactive particles every year since it 
started operations at the end of 1983 
each discharge from ignalina contains 10000 times more 
radioactive material than a swedish nuclear plant discharges over 
an entire year he said 
the guideline in sweden is to discharge as little as 
possible de geer said in a telephone interview we pointed it 
out to the soviet nuclear authorities in 1986 but they denied such 
discharges were made at ignalina sweden has been on higher alert 
against radioactivity since the 1986 accident at the chernobyl 
plant 720 miles southeast of here sent clouds of contamination 
over vast areas of northern sweden 
the worlds worst nuclear accident killed at least 31 people 
near the plant

allen h neuharth chairman of gannett co 
inc said thursday that world leaders such as cubas fidel castro 
and south africas pw botha have been mistreated by us 
reporters whom many heads of state now view as the new ugly 
americans 
neuharth answering questions after a speech at the national 
press club said that although he has no sympathy with cuban 
communism or with south african racism leaders such as castro and 
botha have a legitimate complaint 
botha and castro have been mistreated by the press because 
reporters have not let them be heard fairly he said 
all world leaders have the right to present their point of 
view without some reporter especially a reporter from this 
country acting like judge and jury confronting and convicting and 
then spreading news of that conviction said the 64yearold 
chairman and founder of the internationally circulated newspaper 
usa today 
since february neuharth has visited 19 countries and 
interviewed 15 heads of state in the newspapers jetcapade 
reporting venture 
neuharth who is midway in the tour with members of his staff 
who fly aboard a private jetliner said he believes he has gained 
access to a wide variety of world leaders including castro and 
botha because his newspaper is informational rather than 
confrontational 
in the eyes of some leaders the ugly american is no longer 
the wealthy cameraladen tourist in bermuda shorts he or she is 
the arrogant nikoncarrying reporter from a big usa newspaper 
neuharth said 
i hope we will not be tempted to start or stop wars dethrone 
presidents or kings or elect them i dont think thats our role 
he said in announcing that 5yearold usa today would once again 
not endorse a us presidential candidate 
he said however he has no quarrel with the newspapers 
editorial board decision to call for the resignation of attorney 
general edwin meese iii 
neuharth said attempts to curtail press freedom are unfortunate 
but they go with the territory as the usa press exerts greater 
influence around the world 
unless we are sensitive to different political systems and 
philosophies unless we try to report international issues from al 
perspectives not just ours we run the risk of perpetuating 
worldwide the same image of arrogance some of us suffer from here 
in the usa he said 
worldwide i think its extremely important that the media 
from the usa practice informational journalism not 
confrontational journalism we should inform not indict he 
said 
if we do that foreign leaders and their people will talk to 
us and share their problems and their hopes if we dont theyll 
resent us and try to shut us out 
neuharth said usa todays circulation and advertising revenue 
are at an alltime high with average daily paid circulaton of 16 
million more than 105 ad pages published last week and weekly 
revenues of 37 million 
he predicted that the newspaper which had its first profitable 
quarter at the end of 1987 would either show a profit or a 
marginal loss for all of 1988 
gannett owns and operates 90 daily newspapers 35 nondailies 
10 television stations 16 radio stations and the largest outdoor 
advertising operation in north america according to a company news

martha chappels sole surviving son has just 
graduated from high school even though he suffers from the 
congenital illness that killed his three brothers becoming the 
first of her children to live long enough to reach that goal 
god has not given me children to keep forever she said 
thursday he gave them to me to love and care for they are a 
loan 
willie jackson 18 graduated this week from cold spring school 
a public school for mentally and physically handicapped children 
one son adrian died when he was 5 in 1976 followed by eddie 
in 1979 at 15 and ernie in 1981 at 18 
the cause each time was a rare inherited disorder known as 
hunters syndrome which causes mental retardation and physical 
abnormalities there is no cure or therapy for the disease which 
strikes only males and can cause dwarfism deafness heart defects 
and arthritic joint pain 
he knew all his brothers and that they died in the hospital 
and he becomes very upset when we go to a hospital said mrs 
chappel 
the life expectancy of children with hunters is 15 years 
willie is a dwarf and is moderately retarded and deaf in one ear 
this boy has been so close to death you could almost see it 
but hes so strong said his stepfather waller chappel 
mrs chappel didnt know her first two boys had hunters until 
after the third willie was born 
in the beginning it was like a shock to me i cried for 
days mrs chappel said i kept thinking ill have a girl and 
ill tell her not to have children ive always wanted a lot of 
kids thats been my goal since i was little 
there have been times when ive been frustrated but whenever 
things got rough i had friends and relatives to help me over the 
hump mrs chappel said 
because of the disease willie has a small esophagus and 
difficulty breathing he tires easily and can walk only about a 
half block at a time 
for the last six or seven months weve been spending about 
500to600 a month for his medical expenses we have to have 
oxygen and had to get a wheelchair weve had to struggle but the 
time with willie and the other boys has been worth it mrs 
chappel said 
the graduation was one of the highlights of my life said 
mrs chappel hes the first to live long enough to accomplish 
it 
she hopes to enroll willie in a day adult program for the 
handicapped so he can continue associating with other youngsters 
he knew something exciting was going on at the graduation 
all the people and receiving a certificate he knew there was some 
sort of special conglomeration taking place but i think hell be 
kind of sad when he learns what it means that he wont be seeing 
the teachers and children every day mrs chappel said hes 
always looked forward to the bus rides to school

a strong earthquake shook the western 
island of cephalonia thursday for the third time in two weeks but 
there were no reports of damage or injuries police said 
the athens seismological institute said the tremor measured 5 on 
the richter scale its epicenter was in the ionian seabed off 
cephalonia about 195 miles from athens 
we felt the tremor around lunchtime but people didnt bother 
to leave their homes and there were no damage reports said a 
police officer on cephalonia speaking on condition of anoymity 
tremors measuring 58 and 53 on the richter scale shook the 
island on may 18 and may 21 but caused no damage 
buildings on cephalonia have been constructed to withstand 
tremors of 7 on the richter scale ever since the ionian islands off 
western greece were hit by a devastating quake in 1953 
the richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
a quake measuring 5 on the richter quake can cause considerable 
damage and quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage

only 15 children remained in the national 
spelling bee today after the sixth round as the complexity of words 
began drawing gasps from the audience and sighs of relief from 
competitors lucky enough to survive 
thirtyseven youngsters were eliminated in the contests sixth 
round bringing to 129 the number who found thursdays words too 
arduous to master 
a record field of 200 contestants on wednesday began the bee 
which is sponsored by scripps howard newspapers 
that field had included iris liu of muncie ind the youngest 
hopeful ever to make the national finals in their 61year history 
iris a thirdgrader whose parents moved to this country from 
taiwan in 1979 and operate a bookstore in muncie ind stumbled on 
waywiser an instrument used to measure distances 
she spelled it as weighweiser then pivoted and walked 
quickly from the stage with her hands folded in front of her pink 
frilly dress when informed that she was wrong 
iris who turns 9 on june 20 cried into a tissue outside the 
hotel ballroom where the bee proceeded 
her mother clara comforted her then turned to a reporter and 
said she knows lots of difficult words so the easy words she 
missed 
robert pryor 11 from washington dc had apparently 
recovered from a nervous stomach that had so weakened him that he 
had to be helped to the microphone on wednesday 
but with a bee official standing behind him the son of a 
computer analyst was eliminated today when asked to spell 
fidgetiness nervous movement 
ohhh he moaned as he learned his fate from the judges 
fiftysix hopefuls were eliminated in the first day of the 
competition 
wednesdays rounds featured a spelling error by bee officials 
themselves 
they began distributing to reporters a list of words that had 
been asked in the first round when one journalist pointed out that 
a word appeared to be misspelled indeed hitchhike had come 
out hitchike on the bees list and officials stopped handing 
it out while they penned in the missing h on all 300 copies 
when the event began wednesday there were 102 girls and 98 boys 
from 47 states the virgin islands the district of columbia 
puerto rico guam and mexico in the running 
none of them was yet 15 years old even though contest rules 
permit entrants who have not reached their 16th birthdays are not 
yet in the ninth grade and have not won previously 
last years winner was stephanie petit 13 from bethel park 
pa who correctly spelled staphylococci a bacteria in that 
contest in which there were 185 entrants it took 876 words before 
a winner was declared 
there were 485 words offered wednesday 
websters third new international dictionary copyright 1986 
which seemingly weighs as much as some of the contestants is used 
as the final authority by the judges 
competitors are eliminated as soon as they misspell a word a 
judge clangs a desk top bell to let each errormaker know that for 
him or her the contest is over 
when only two contenders are left the rules change if a 
contestant misspells a word his or her opponent is asked to spell 
it correctly if the opponent can correctly spell the misspelled 
word and one additional word a winner is declared 
contest officials estimate that 8 million to 9 million children 
competed in local tournament that produced the 200 hopefuls who 
traveled to washington for the finals 
the event offers 1500 and other prizes to the winner 
scripps howard also gives 1000 to the second place finisher 
750 for third place 500 for fourth 400 for fifth 300 for 
sixth 200 each for seventh through 10th 100 each for 11th

a halfdozen women prisoners held in an 
isolation unit in an underground kentucky federal prison are being 
treated so inhumanely that they may be permanently psychologically 
harmed a federal judge was told thursday 
a lawyer argued that the women all serving long terms in the 
federal correctional institution in lexington ky had to disrobe 
in rooms visible to guards shower in stalls without curtains did 
not have recreation equipment in the exercise yard went without 
heat in freezing weather and were shackled hands and feet whenever 
they were taken out of their unit 
attorney michael deutsch said most of the five women he 
represents had been placed in the special unit because of their 
political beliefs not for their prison behavior and that the 
purpose was to destroy these women 
deutsch appeared before us district judge barrington d parker 
seeking to have the women removed from the high security unit and 
to have it closed the bureau of prisons has said it intends to 
shut down the unit in july when a new medium and highsecurity 
facility for women will be opened in marianna fla 
john c cleary representing the bureau of prisons said that 
the women were transferred into the unit because they posed a 
risk of external assault on the prison he said there is no 
medical evidence to support an accusation that they have suffered 
psychological harm 
there is no question that its constitutional to prevent 
prison escapes he told the judge at no time were the 
political beliefs of these women taken into account in transferring 
them to the high security unit 
the arguments will continue next tuesday 
last week the soviet news agency trud said that the fbi was 
conducting experiments on female political prisoners at the 
kentucky institution and exerting psychological pressures aimed 
at breaking the will of the prisoners 
there was no reference to such activity in deutschs 
presentation 
but he said the women are suffering from restricted 
environment syndrome from sensory deprivation freefloating 
anxiety and depression 
one inmate susan rosenberg was in court she is serving a 
58year term for possessing weapons and explosives in connection 
with a 1985 police raid in new jersey and is one of seven recently 
indicted in the 1983 bombing of the us capitol 
another of the inmates is sylvia baraldini convicted of 
racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a 16 million brinks 
armored car heist in nyack ny that left a guard and two police 
officers dead ms rosenberg was linked by law enforcement officers 
to the same bungled brinks robbery 
deutsch said that ms baraldini had been in prison for more than 
four years with only one minor infraction that of cutting to the 
wrong side of a food line on her record 
he said she was sent from prison in pleasanton calif to the 
newly opened isolation unit in kentucky in 1986 without being told 
why as for ms rosenberg he said her status as a sympathizer 
with terrorist groups was inexplicably elevated to that of member 
in letter exchanges between prision officials 
there is no need to have these women in this unit deutsch 
said there is no evidence they were involved in any escape 
attempt or that they were plotting to escape 
deutsch told parker that the women were sent there after a 
call for bodies to fill this unit 
the unit can house 16 women but has not had more than six he 
said adding what has happened is this they realize they are 
running an unconstitutional unit and they are closing it down

the united states conducted its third 
nuclear test in less than three weeks thursday just hours after 
the conclusion of the moscow summit 
nuclear testing was one of the issues addressed in moscow with 
the soviet union and the united states formally agreeing to monitor 
each others tests this summer in joint verification experiments 
the test shook the nevada desert and registered on seismic 
equipment atop hotels and casinos here 110 miles from ground zero 
the blast measured 53 on the richter scale of ground motion at the 
national earthquake information center in golden colo 
soviet scientists who are setting up monitoring equipment at the 
nevada test site were at mercury nev 52 miles from ground zero 
at the time of thursdays blast the soviet scientists also were on 
hand for two previous tests may 13 and may 21 
the test was the fifth announced blast this year and the 680th 
announced test since the program moved to the nevada desert in 
january 1951 
the nuclear device was buried 2000 feet beneath the surface of 
pahute mesa a rocky patch of desert in the far northwest corner of 
the 1350squaremile test site 
the blast had an explosive force of up to 150 kilotons the 
atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima had an explosive yield of 13 
kilotons all tests are listed as less than 20 kilotons or 20 to 
150 kilotons with advance notice given for tests at or near the 
upper limits such a notice was issued tuesday 
the force of the blast produced a gentle swaying motion at the 
regency towers highrise condominiums in las vegas according to 
energy department spokeswoman barbara yoerg 
everything appears normal ms yoerg said as she monitored 
the blast from a control point 31 miles from ground zero nothing 
is coming out of the ground 
the success of underground tests is measured in part by the 
ability to prevent radiation from leaking into the atmosphere 
ms yoerg said she did not feel any ground motion at the control 
point doe personnel monitoring such blasts often experience a 
rocking motion following detonation 
doe seismic equipment atop the golden nugget and mint hotels in 
downtown las vegas and the el rancho hotel on the las vegas strip 
recorded the blast distinctly according to ms yoerg a 
similar reading was obtained at scottys castle in death valley 60 
miles from ground zero

a federal judge thursday refused to release 
convicted anticastro terrorist orlando bosch while he appeals an 
immigration service order expelling him from the country 
us district judge william hoeveler reviewed 700 documents 
many of them classified intelligence reports linking bosch 61 to 
two violent anticommunist groups before denying bond 
bosch returned to the united states in february after spending 
11 years in venezuelan jails successfully fighting charges he blew 
up a cuban jetliner in 1976 killing all 73 aboard he had fled 
florida in 1974 while on probation for a 1968 miami bazooka attack 
on a polish ship that had previously stopped in cuba 
the federal parole commission saying it had no objection to 
boschs being freed turned his case over to the immigration and 
naturalization service 
bschs attorney hank adorno said he had a right to live in 
miamis exile community where he has received strong support from 
many anticastro cubans in light of the fact that he has 
renounced his ways of fighting communism and fighting castro 
but the ins started proceedings to deport him calling him an 
undesirable alien with terrorist connections the agency said he 
would not be sent to cuba but did not specify a country where he 
would go 
the agency said bosch has a history of leadership and 
involvement in terrorist groups and activities including a role 
in two groups responsible for more than 50 bombings in the united 
states and latin america 
terrorism is terrorism no matter how long ago it took 
place said assistant us attorney patricia kenny representing 
the ins freeing bosch would send the wrong message to 
terrorists she said 
bosch is being held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center south of miami 
boschs daughter myriam lashed out at the decision to keep her 
father in custody blaming it on the reagan administrations desire 
to reach a global accommodation with the soviet union and its 
allies 
cuba does not want him free she said that is why my 
father is behind bars 
attorneys for bosch said they planned to appeal to the federal 
appeals court in atlanta but his daughter said the judge had been 
the familys last hope 
hes going to die in jail ms bosch said bitterly why 
dont they just send him back to cuba 
early thursday hoeveler abandoned a compromise that he had 
proposed earlier to allow bosch to remain under house arrest while 
appealing his expulsion 
hoeveler made no reference to that proposal in his eightpage 
order rejecting the petition for parole the order said the 
government has a legitimate and bona fide reason for wanting to 
expel bosch 
under federal law the ins can hold an alien pending disposition 
of deportation proceedings provided it is acting in good faith 
the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the attorney 
general has acted in bad faith the judge said therefore he had 
no power to overrule the ins decision to keep bosch in custody 
his deportation case now goes to the regional commissioner of 
the ins in dallas for a recommendation

the six chicago suburbs that lost all or 
part of their telephone service in a may 8 switching station fire 
should have service restored by this weekend officials said 
thursday 
about 35000 illinois bell customers had their service disrupted 
when the station which houses computerized equipment that connects 
local and long distance calls was damaged in the blaze 
the costs of the outage continued rising not only for 
businesses whose phone service was cut off but also for local 
governments forced to pay for overtime and emergency equipment 
ive gotten very close to illinois bell officials over the 
past few weeks said hinsdale village manager ronald ruskey 
im learning about the telephone business 
the fire also disrupted service at several automatic teller 
machines sears roebuck and cos catalog sales phones and 
offtrack betting parlors crews at the federal aviation 
administrations control center in aurora were forced to go to a 
backup phone system delaying some flights to chicagos ohare 
international airport by two hours 
the total cost to communities and businesses could exceed 100 
million officials said and they said bell would be asked to help 
pay for it 
bell spokeswoman laura littel said the phone service should be 
restored for customers by 1201 am sunday more than a week ahead 
of schedule about half the 35000 customers were switched over to 
the new system last friday 
there may be a few bugs but were hoping for the best ms 
littel said 
for governments the fire meant extra overtime and equipment to 
connect emergency services the estimated costs ranged from 13000 
at burr ridge to 65000 at clarendon hills 
ms littel said the exact cause of the fire is still being 
investigated the illinois commerce commission hired an annapolis 
md firm forensic technologies international corp to 
investigate 
we do know that its possibly electrical in nature she said 
bell which has promised customer rebates for the disrupted 
service is facing lawsuits from several businesses the businesses 
contend bell was negligent in unstaffing the hinsdale station and 
for having no direct telephone link with the local fire department 
at the time of the fire 
in addition illinois attorney general neil hartigan has filed a 
complaint with the icc asking the comission to order bell to pay 
for financial losses

the air force said thursday a new program of 
testing its bases for the natural radioactive gas radon had turned 
up two facilities inside the united states and three outside with 
unacceptably high readings 
both of the bases inside the united states are located near 
colorado springs colo the us air force academy and peterson 
air force base 
one of the three bases outside the country is andersen air force 
base on the island of guam the air force said it would not 
identify the other two overseas bases until it had notified the 
host countrys government 
the service said in a statement it was launching a more 
extensive radon survey of all habitable structures and preparing to 
take quick corrective action at the academy and peterson and 
andersen bases because of radon readings above the level of 20 
picocuries per liter of air 
the environmental protection agency considers radon levels of 
four picocuries or less per liter of air acceptable the air 
force said for a level of radon above 20 picocuries the epa 
recommends that corrective action be taken within several months 
the service said that at 49 other bases around the world it had 
discovered one or more structures with radon levels between four 
and 20 picocuries per liter in those cases every habitable 
building at the bases will be screened for the next year to 
determine which ones need repair work to reduce radon levels below 
the four picocurie standard 
the air force said 33 of those 49 bases were located in the 
united states the other 16 are located in foreign countries and 
will be publicly identified in the near future following 
notification of host countries 
all told the air force said it had taken 4404 air samples at 
135 major bases and found 211 or 48 percent at a level above 
four picocuries 
the epa has found levels above four picocuries per liter in 14 
percent to 20 percent of the houses they have tested nationwide 
it added 
the service declined to speculate on why the radon levels at the 
two colorado facilities and on guam were unacceptably high 
the air force became the first of the military services last 
december to launch a test program for radon the army has since 
followed suit and the navy and marine corps are considering such a 
move 
radon is a colorless odorless natural product of decaying 
uranium in the soil medical research has indicated that exposure 
to high levels of radon over extended periods may increase the risk 
of lung cancer 
results of commercial testing in communities throughout the 
united states coupled with concern about the health of air force 
members and their families prompted the decision to test the 
service said last year in announcing the program 
the air force has said it will launch a mitigation program 
for those buildings where radon levels exceed the recommended epa 
standards sealing foundation cracks or installing new ventilation 
systems 
the service estimated last year it would spend up to 26 
million on the testing and up to 30 million on repair work the 
air force said thursday it now appeared those figures would be 
overstated but added it did not have new estimates available

a television tower more than twice as tall as 
the eiffel tower collapsed thursday killing two maintenance 
workers seeking to strengthen the structure and leaving one 
missing authorities said 
the 2000foot tower was reduced to a tangled pile of metal 
said cl harlan a missouri state highway patrol dispatcher 
workers used torches thursday afternoon to cut through the 
debris in search of the third man 
i dont think theres any hope of anyone who was on that tower 
surviving said patrol sgt ron lenzini 
the center section of the tower fell with such force that it 
went into the ground he said its so far down that they have 
digging equipment out there 
colony is about 25 miles from the iowa and illinois state lines 
and 200 miles northwest of st louis the tower belonged to ktvotv 
in kirksville 
the three workers were in a baskettype carrier at the 500feet 
level when the tower collapsed the patrol said 
martha huber 15 who lives about a quarter of a mile from the 
tower witnessed the collapse 
i saw the buggy or thing they run up the tower in and i saw 
this coming down and part of the tower with it she said you 
couldnt see much because the dust was flying so much i saw some 
of the cables snapping and we called the ambulance right away 
many of the 30 heavy cables that supported the tower snapped 
when it collapsed witnesses said 
the tower did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area but 
tore down several trees she said 
jerry heilman ktvo general manager said the workers were 
replacing more than 1000 structural braces 
they were employees of structural system technology inc of 
mclean va and had been working in colony for several weeks 
peter kizer president of ktvos parent company federal 
broadcasting of southfield mich was en route to the scene to 
speak with station personnel and the media heilman said 
the tower was erected in september at a cost of 25 million and 
was one of the tallest transmission towers in the united states 
authorities said by comparison the famed eiffel tower of paris is 
984 feet tall 
the towers unusual height was intended to expand ktvos viewing 
area said kurt sweeney station news director it increased the 
stations audience from 40000 households to about 120000 
officials said 
i heard it the collapse and it sounded like a jet taking 
off said elizabeth huber ms hubers sister 
ktvo went off the air about 950 am heilman said the station 
could be off the air anywhere from two days to two weeks 
the tower was the maximum height permitted under federal 
aviation administration rules said sharon scott public service 
specialist for the federal communications commission in kansas city

boeing commercial airplanes would oppose any 
effort to set a mandatory retirement age for jetliners even though 
such a requirement could boost sales of new planes a company 
spokesman said thursday 
it would be arbitrary and we dont think it would be 
necessary jack gamble a spokesman for the seattlebased 
aerospace company said during a break in a federal aviation 
administrationsponsored conference on aging aircraft 
on wednesday faa administrator allan mcartor raised the 
possibility of mandatory airplane retirement but gamble said 
boeing and other aircraft manufacturers have found nothing to 
suggest that jetliners cant fly safely for years if they are 
properly maintained 
we could be selfish and say it would be good for us gamble 
said of mandatory aircraft retirement but it is good equipment 
mandatory retirement just wouldnt make any sense he said 
the average age of the world airline fleet has increased from 
eight years in 1980 to nearly 12 years in 1988 said gamble by 
2005 the average age of jetliners is expected to be 15 years 
gamble said that boeings commercial planes are built to provide 
at least 20 years of economical service 
the faa called the threeday conference as a result of increased 
concern about the safety of older jetliners since the inflight 
breakup of a 19yearold aloha airlines boeing 737 in april 
a 20foot section of the plane tore away and a flight attendant 
was swept to her death although pilots were able to land the 
aircraft safely 
gamble said that even before the aloha incident there was 
increasing industry interest in aging plans and that boeing began 
looking at the problems as early as 1983 
since january 1987 gamble said boeing has been conducting an 
informal survey of 50 of its older planes owned by 33 airlines in 
19 countries 
there have been no surprises he said of a preliminary 
analysis of the survey 
in addition boeing recently put a 737 it purchased from 
piedmont airlines after an accident through an extensive series of 
tests that simulated more than 200000 takeoffs and landings 
we didnt find anything unexpected said gamble adding that 
some small cracks were found in the airplane after the test but 
they were easily fixed 
the aloha plane involved in the recent accident had undergone 
about 90000 landings and takeoffs

the most powerful us warship in the 
persian gulf stood by on thursday when irans navy stopped boarded 
and escorted away a cypriot freighter apparently suspected of 
carrying warrelated cargo for iraq 
us navy officials said the guided missile cruiser vincennes 
was two miles away and did not get an appeal for aid that could 
have caused the first direct confrontation with iran since april 
18 six iranian vessels were knocked out that day including two 
sister ships of the frigate involved in thursdays incident 
it also was the closest brush since the united states adopted a 
new policy allowing navy ships to intervene in attacks on neutral 
commercial ships flying flags of other nations the rule requires a 
victim to be a nonbelligerent in international waters that 
requests assistance 
lt cmdr mark van dyke a navy spokesman said the iranian ship 
was tentatively identified as the 1540ton frigate alborz and 
acted within maritime law that allows for visit and search in 
international waters 
it halted the cypriot motor vessel vevey in the southern gulf at 
about 930 am van dyke said the cypriot ship did not request 
assistance and did not appear to be in any distress 
he said the 9400ton vincennes remained two miles away and had 
no radio exchanges with either vessel 
the vincennes had the others in view as the iranian frigate 
stopped the cypriot ship launched a small boat that put a search 
party on board and then escorted her off in a northeasterly 
direction van dyke said 
there was no communication between the merchant and the us 
warship and no indication the vevey tried to make contact during 
the incident 25 miles northeast of dubai he said 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit in london said eight iranian 
naval personnel boarded the 10000ton freighter and it was taken 
to the iranian port and naval base at bandar abbas in the strait of 
hormuz 
its listed cargo was italian marble chips and powder bound for 
saudi arabia and kuwait the report said 
iran considers saudi arabia and kuwait to be allies of iraq 
with which ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime has been at war 
since september 1980 most commercial ships it has attacked were 
traveling to or from those countries 
iranian gunboats regularly stop and search merchant vessels to 
search for warrelated cargo that could be bound for iraq 
the vincennes based in san diego arrived in the gulf last 
weekend on the first assignment to the gulf of an aegistype 
cruiser equipped with advanced long range radar surveillance and 
missile systems 
three other us warships left the gulf thursday home ports on 
the east coast the missile cruiser wainwright and missile frigates 
jack williams and simpson all played prominent roles in operation 
praying mantis april 18 
staying behind in a dubai drydock is the missile frigate samuel 
b roberts which struck a mine april 14 that incident led to the 
retaliation four days later 
the iranian frigate involved in thursdays incident was one of 
two believed operational after the april 18 encounters the frigate 
sahand was sunk by american bombs and missiles and the fourth 
sabalan was severely damaged

a continental airlines dc10 aborted its 
takeoff at los angeles international airport thursday because the 
pilot thought a justlanded jet had not cleared the runway 
officials said 
the dc10s tires automatically deflated but no one was hurt 
when continental flight 43 to honolulu carrying 148 passengers and 
about 15 crewmembers came to a stop said airline spokesman ned 
walker in houston 
walker said the pilot felt a delta air lines jet hadnt 
adequately cleared the runway but federal aviation administration 
spokeswoman elly brekke said the delta plane was off the runway and 
had come to a stop on a taxiway 
ms brekke said the continental pilot took the extra margin of 
safety in the 955 am incident passengers deplaned on a 
taxiway but did not use emergency exits or equipment 
neither walker nor ms brekke knew how far into the takeoff the 
airliner had gotten before the abort but the faa spokeswoman said 
the jet had reached at least 100 knots or 115 mph they did not 
know the actual distance between the planes 
captain did a good job in reacting quickly when he saw the 
other aircraft said walker who would not release the names of 
the crew 
ms brekke initially reported that four of the dc10s tires 
blew after the abort but later she and walker explained that the 
tires have a safety plug that melts when heated to a certain 
temperature letting the tires deflate rather than explode

the following is a list of the air force bases 
in the united states at which one or more readings for radon gas 
were found to exceed the environmental protection agencys 
recommended standard of 4 picocuries per liter or air 
any reading above 20 picocuries per liter is considered 
sufficient to trigger detailed 30day and oneyear testing of all 
habitable structures at a base and immediate repair work 
any reading of 4 to 20 picocuries per liter triggers a oneyear 
detailed sampling of all habitable structures followed by repair 
work as required 
the air force said thursday that sampling at five bases had 
produced readings above 20 picocuries per liter while sampling at 
49 bases had produced readings of 4 to 20 picocuries 
of the bases with readings above 20 picocuries three of the 
bases are in the united states or a us territory and two are in 
foreign countries of those with readings of 4 to 20 picocuries 33 
bases are in the united states and 16 in foreign countries the air 
force said it would not identify any of the bases overseas until 
the host countrys government is notified the air force said

it wouldnt have the lovable personality of 
r2d2 but an artificial intelligence system being developed for the 
air force would perform many of its tasks including alerting a 
pilot to key points in an air battle 
the pilots associate program a version of which was 
demonstrated thursday at lockheed aeronautical systems co was 
initiated by the air force because of the proliferation of 
highspeed hightech weapons and aircraft systems said maj ron 
van der weert director of the program 
todays pilot is inundated with information about his plane 
other planes radar installations hoping to hit him with 
surfacetoair missiles and other threats 
in the heat of battle theres a tendency to get overloaded 
with everything thats taking place said van der weert a 
graduate of the flight weapons school the air force version of the 
navys top gun school 
lockheed and mcdonnell aircraft co working independently under 
air force contracts hope to take advantage of advances in 
artificial intelligence to produce a computer that would focus the 
pilots attention on the most critical decisions while handling 
lower priority matters itself like the vacuum cleanershaped 
sidekick of star wars hero luke skywalker 
for example in a central european battle scenario demonstrated 
thursday the pilots associate copes with an overheating radar 
system while the pilot is firing missiles at an enemy bomber all 
the while the computer is giving the pilot a display of the 
missile ranges of the most threatening enemy fighters 
major new threats prompt the computer to talk aloud lockheeds 
model in fact sounds like a woman with a southern accent 
the ability to pick out the biggest threats is made possible by 
artificial intelligence the computer considers the pilots planned 
flight path and the capabilities and behavior of enemy aircraft and 
draws conclusions it may suggest avoiding some planes or attacking 
them depending on the orders for each mission 
and instead of merely telling the pilot that fuel has been lost 
the computer would indicate whether the plane has enough to carry 
out the original mission and suggest a new flight path if 
necessary that flight path would take into account the delicate 
task of weaving among enemy ground radars to prevent them from 
gaining a good enough fix to launch a missile 
van der weert said that would replace educated guesswork by the 
pilot 
but van der weert emphasized the pilots associate would 
replace neither the pilot nor on twoseat planes the navigator 
the pilot could overrule any action proposed by the computer in 
some cases simply by ignoring it martin broadwell lockheeds 
program manager noted that the computer would adjust to the 
pilots rejection going to work on new proposals consistent with 
the pilots decisions 
as smart as the new system is it must overcome the 
notoriously slow characteristics of artificial intelligence 
computers said lockheed program manager jack barnette 
the 30minute simulated flight replayed on video monitors for 
reporters thursday actually took nearly three hours for the system 
to process but broadwell said that meets the goal for this point 
in the systems development

jesse jackson met with members of los angeles street gangs in an 
extraordinary campaign spectacle on thursday while fellow democrat 
michael dukakis cut short a california campaign trip to be at his 
ailing wifes side 
dukakis canceled a debate with jackson and flew home to be with 
his wife kitty for surgery that one of her doctors described as 
not emergency but urgent dr james r lehrich said surgeons 
would remove two herniated discs that are pressing dangerously on 
her spinal cord and could if left untreated cause paralysis 
vice president george bush pronounced himself a refurbished 
candidate after four days of skull sessions with aides and 
outside advisers in kennebunkport maine and said he wont change 
tactics just because he trails dukakis in the polls 
ive never felt more relaxed never felt more convinced that 
were on the right track bush said at his vacation home after a 
coast guard check of his powerboat he said he would make his 
differences plain with his likely democratic opponent after the 
democratic convention in july 
with his armed secret service guards in attendance jackson met 
privately with members of the bloods and an affiliated group the 
bounty hunters later jackson told reporters that the gang members 
talked of how they could buy any type of weapon 
they can buy the very latest guns no id jackson said 
the combination of drugs guns and money creates a kind of unholy 
alliance 
jackson said he hoped the meeting would be the first of many 
aimed at ending gang violence which killed 205 people in los 
angeles last year its not a matter of signing papers he said 
jackson has finished second in more than 30 primary and caucus 
contests this year and one of the prime topics of speculation in 
democratic circles is whether he is owed special consideration when 
it comes time for dukakis to select a running mate 
dukakis himself said no to that question on wednesday and party 
chairman paul kirk seconded the idea in a speech in milwaukee on 
thursday kirk said jackson is entitled to fair consideration 
but no more 
at the same time he praised jackson for running a 
constructive campaign i think it will help in november 
dukakis canceled his california schedule and left for boston to 
be with his wife saying this is obviously the most important 
thing 
at massachusetts general hospital where her surgery is to be 
performed dr lehrich said it was not certain what caused mrs 
dukakis problems we have seen no trauma unless you consider 
that she has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot 
mrs dukakis 53 has been a student and teacher of modern dance 
for three decades 
lehrich said mrs dukakis has suffered numbness and altered 
sensations in her hands and feet 
dukakis who said he might resume campaigning over the weekend 
if his wifes operation went smoothly picked up 21 additional 
delegates during the day bringing his total to 1768 in the 
associated press count he is expected to achieve a nominating 
majority of 2081 by the time the votes are counted tuesday night 
in the final democratic primaries of the year in california new 
jersey montana and new mexico jackson has fewer than 1000 
the massachusetts governors campaign announced the beginning of 
a television advertising campaign in california with a commercial 
seemingly designed more for the general election campaign than the 
primary battle with jackson it claims striking achievement in 
dukakis drive to reduce crime in massachusetts and said the 
governor did it with hard work integrity leadership we could 
use some of thatin the white house 
bush tried to explain his comments in a new york times interview 
in which he assailed two new right activists who have been critical 
of him 
thats a longstanding feud with two individuals who dont have 
any following bush said the fact that i have been constantly 
attacked by two individuals doesnt have anything to do with votes 
if it did i wouldnt be the likely nominee of the republican 
party 
but some conservatives questioned the vice presidents tactics 
hes not running against dick viguerie and hes not running 
against howie phillips hes running against probably mike dukakis 
and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball said lyn 
nofziger a former political aide to president reagan 
in the new york times interview bush criticized viguerie a new 
right fundraiser and phillips chairman of the conservative 
caucus as polarizing influences on the party 
when asked if he needed to court the two newright activists 
bush said there are some people that are almost selfappointed 
spokesmen that will make a claim for that i dont feel that at 
all

nicaragua with rebels and a nicaraguan soldier was captured and

the crude manipulation of the facts contained in your note 
reveals the real aim of this campaign which is to try to create 
an incident between honduras and nicaragua and to damage peace 
talks between the sandinista government and the ussupported 
rebels known as contras 
acts that occurred in nicaragua are being presented as if they 
occurred on honduran soil and the armed forces of honduras 
takes upon itself crimes that in reality have been committed by the 
contras he said 
during the 6yearold nicaraguan civil war the contras have had 
bases in southern honduras from which they have launched attacks 
across the border the contras and sandinistas have agreed to a 
temporary truce during which they are trying to negotiate a 
permanent ceasefire

snarled deliveries and piledup trash in 
offices testify to the newest problem facing mayor art agnos 
already plagued by a 180 million city deficit 
labor officials representing 1767 striking janitors say the 
9dayold standoff which has been marked by vandalism and some 
arrests may be headed for a citywide labormanagement showdown if 
it isnt defused soon 
effects of the strike and a labor boycott are increasingly 
evident in the downtown area to tourists and workers who frequent 
the 204 affected buildings including most major office complexes 
paper and garbage are scattered all over downtown trash bins 
are overflowing and employees in business suits can be seen lugging 
heavy packages that teamster drivers refuse to deliver inside 
pickets are posted around the clock and a few windows have been 
broken and eggs smeared on the fronts of buildings where janitors 
continue to defy the strike 
labor leaders say they will step up the protests and may further 
tighten supply lines if contract negotiations remain deadlocked 
trash haulers building engineers construction workers elevator 
repair personnel delivery people and longshoremen are all honoring 
the strike although the san francisco port remains open 
we see this as an important dispute because it is so 
visible chuck mack president of teamsters joint council 7 said 
thursday the council represents 30 union locals and 65000 members 
from santa rosa south to salinas encompassing the entire san 
francisco bay area 
the outcome of this dispute is going to set the tone for other 
negotiations in the city and maybe even the bay area over the next 
few years said mack 
the 3500member local 87 of the service employees international 
union working without a contract since february launched the 
strike may 24 
the janitors rejected a proposal by the san francisco building 
maintenance contractors association for a threeyear freeze of 
their 1125 hourly pay and changes in job assignments the 
janitors say will cost them money 
the janitors want a 50cent hourly raise in each year of a 
proposed threeyear contract as well as the continued right to a 
leave of absence 
the 11 maintenance firms in the association also are seeking a 
twotier pay system in which new hires would get less than current 
employees 
disgruntled janitors contend they cant keep up with the areas 
high living expenses under the current proposal and claim 
managements hard bargaining stance may be masking an attempt at 
unionbusting 
the contractors in turn maintain that only new york janitors 
make more than san franciscos they say they offer job security 
and maintained benefits 
marc intermaggio representing the building owners said they 
remain absolutely firm in their commitment to stem the rise 
in these outrageous wages 
contract talks continued thursday for a third straight day since 
resuming a week after the walkout began but local 87 
secretarytreasurer eric hall said there had been zero progress 
since february 
guillermo loyola a union member for 33 years and a unit 
foreman said the disturbance that resulted in five arrests on 
tuesday is increasingly likely to recur as the stalemate continues 
while some 300 janitors marched through the financial district 
two protesters were arrested after they allegedly struck a police 
officer with picket signs and three were arrested for vandalism and 
disturbing the peace 
local 87 president wray jacobs angered police earlier by saying 
that although he does not condone violence vandalism is an 
emotional outlet and he might even break one or two windows 
myself at times 
the san francisco labor council which is coordinating the 
boycott criticized agnos this week for not taking stronger steps 
to end the dispute after meeting with 14 local labor leaders the 
council asked assembly speaker willie brown to mediate the strike 
brown did not immediately respond 
it would seem to me that to maintain harmony in the city he 
agnos could have called in people sooner said walter johnson 
secretarytreasurer of the council i think this needs direct 
action 
deputy mayor hadley roff said the mayor has been talking to 
people behind the scenes and urging the two sides to settle their 
differences at the bargaining table 
roff said agnos had no immediate plans to participate directly 
in the talks although he acknowledged having received a few 
complaints about the downtown disruptions

the education departments budget for research 
and development fell by 33 percent after inflation between 1980 and 
1987 the general accounting office said thursday 
at the same time the federal governments overall spending on 
research and development rose 24 percent the agency said in a 
report to a house education subcommittee 
but most of the growth was in the pentagon budget where rampd 
expenditures shot up 81 percent during the 1980s the gao said 
the education department spent 132 million on research and 
development in 1980 and 124 million in 1987 the latter figure 
taking inflation into account was the equivalent of 88 million in 
1980 dollars the gao said 
defense expenditures on rampd rose from 139 billion to 361 
billion the 1987 figure was the equivalent of 252 billion in 
1980 dollars 
the governments overall rampd spending rose from 317 billion in 
1980 to 561 billion in 1987 or in terms of 1980 dollars to 
394 billion the gao said 
such departments and agencies as health and human services the 
national science foundation the veterans administration and the 
agency for international development registered real increases but 
rampd spending fell at the departments of agriculture down 2 
percent commerce down 16 percent energy down 29 percent 
interior down 35 percent and transportation down 39 percent as 
well as the national aeronautics and space administration down 47 
percent 
the report said that educations center for education statistics 
has experienced a cut of 34 percent in constant dollars since 1980

teamsters attorney john climaco said thursday 
any scaleddown plan for government supervision of the union would 
be just as unacceptable as a straight takeover contemplated earlier 
federal law enforcement sources said rudolph giuliani the us 
attorney for the southern district of new york was considering 
modifying plans to seek a takeover following a failed attempt by 
federal prosecutors to convict teamsters officials of corruption 
giuliani initially wanted to force teamsters leaders out of 
office and put the union under court trusteeship 
instead he likely will file suit seeking a courtappointed 
monitor to oversee some organization activities according to the 
sources who spoke only on condition they not be named such a 
lawsuit still could seek removal of some members of the unions 
executive board the sources said 
the sources were confirming a story in the los angeles times 
giuliani plans to forward recommendations soon to acting 
associate attorney general francis a keating on how to proceed 
against the teamsters 
whether you call it a monitor or a trusteeship its still an 
undemocratic attempt by the government to become involved in the 
supervision of a free trade union climaco said it doesnt 
appear to me to be any change its still business as usual 
the reagan administration started with the air traffic 
controllers and it appears they want to end with the teamsters 
climaco added president reagan fired striking air traffic 
controllers in 1981 
on may 4 a us district court jury in new york aquitted anthony 
fat tony salerno and eight associates of charges they rigged 
the elections of roy l williams in 1981 and jackie presser in 
1983 as teamsters presidents 
although acquitted of the electionrigging charges salerno and 
six others were found guilty by the same jury of rigging 
multimilliondollar bids in the new york construction industry 
presser who recently underwent surgery for brain cancer is 
awaiting trial on criminal charges in cleveland that he allegedly 
misappropriated 700000 by keeping nonworking ghost employees 
on the union payroll

clare brower remembers finding a veteran 
with frostbitten feet living in a yakima garbage can last winter 
he was treated at a hospital and is now working 
then there was the drunken 54yearold korean war veteran in 
walla walla who hadnt held a steady job since 1953 when he 
sobered up doctors found he was a schizophrenic 
or the former navy typist with psychiatric problems whod been 
living on the streets since her discharge in 1982 
the three are among thousands of homeless mentally ill veterans 
located and helped under a twoyear 10 million pilot program 
launched in 43 communities around the nation by the veterans 
administration last year 
about 240 of those people have been located by the yakima 
office the only one in washington said brower a vietnam veteran 
who runs the office 
the reason theyre homeless is the same reason as anyone else 
for alcohol and substance abuse he said recently causes could 
be anything from preexisting mental illness to delayed stress 
syndrome brought on by war experiences he said 
the single male in general has fallen though the cracks in all 
health projects in the past brower said you send a single 
male to social agencies and unless theyre disabled they tell 
him to go to unemployment and find work 
what he needs is food in the belly and a place to stay he 
said 
so brower searches the alleys the rescue missions the drunk 
tanks under bridges old rail cars and other collecting grounds 
for the homeless and mentally ill 
those who are veterans are steered into a variety of va and 
community programs nonveterans are referred only to community 
programs brower said 
a lot of veterans are eligible for benefits that other 
homeless may not be said dan sullivan a spokesman for the walla 
walla va hospital among the programs are medical care housing and 
welfare assistance education programs and job training 
in the first seven months of the pilot program there were 
contacts with about 10000 veterans nationwide said terry clark 
of the va in washington dc of the 7800 veterans who received 
formal assessments of their cases 86 percent showed symptoms of 
mental illness he said 
a lot of studies indicated a significant portion of the 
homeless population are veterans and a significant number of them 
may be emotionally disturbed clark said 
i dont think weve gotten all of them he said 
the goal is to get them back on their feet 
if a veteran is willing to work i can get him a job now 
brower said no ifs ands or buts 
the homeless vet with the frostbitten feet who had been 
stationed in korea during the 1960s was found to have a drug 
problem was hospitalized and is now working brower said 
the 31year old former navy typist is hospitalized wih multiple 
psychiatric problems which may have been aggravated by her service 
stint brower said 
the vet suffering from schizophrenia qualified for some back 
pay and has moved to tacoma for treatment at a veterans hospital 
brower 44 who served in vietnam in 196869 said 90 percent of 
the homeless vets suffer alcohol or drug problems which can be a 
selfmedication for delayed stress syndrome 
to get rid of nightmares and flashbacks the greatest medicine 
is alcohol and its readily available brower said

kitty dukakis will undergo surgery friday morning 
to remove two herniated discs that are pressing on her spinal cord 
an operation described by one of her doctors thursday as not 
emergency but urgent 
dr james r lehrich said that if left untreated the condition 
could leave the wife of the massachusetts governor paralyzed 
however he said it appeared to have been spotted early and there 
was no sign of permanent damage 
in view of the fact that this condition has quite definitely 
worsened in the past 24 to 48 hours it was felt that waiting even 
until next week was taking a chance he said at a news conference 
lehrich a neurologist is a member of a team that confirmed her 
diagnosis at massachusetts general hospital where she is scheduled 
to have the operation 
he said the damaged discs were first spotted by doctors at 
cedars of lebanon hospital in los angeles where dukakis was 
campaigning for the california primary 
lehrich said he considered the surgery known as cervical 
laminectomy not emergency but urgent 
mrs dukakis problems were caused by two herniated discs in her 
neck these discs serve as soft cushions between the bony vertebrae 
that protect her spinal cord 
in her case these discs have squeezed out of place so that they 
press on the spinal cord 
lehrich said this could cause severe damage to the spinal cord 
resulting in permanent paralysis fortunately she has come to us 
early before any damage is evident 
at boston university medical center dr ronald mortara said 
most people with herniated discs are treated first with bed rest 
traction and pain killers and surgery is used only as a last 
resort 
however he added if someone has any evidence of spinal cord 
compression that becomes much more serious and urgent 
lehrich said that discs can be damaged by injury or it can 
happen spontaneously 
he said the doctors are unsure what caused mrs dukakis 
problems we have seen no trauma unless you consider that she 
has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot he said 
mrs dukakis 53 has been a student and teacher of modern dance 
for three decades 
he said mrs dukakis has suffered numbness and altered 
sensations in her hands and feet as a result of herniated discs 
although she noticed the problems several weeks ago the symptoms 
have worsened in recent days 
lehrich said the operation which he described as major surgery 
would take several hours the surgical team will include dr 
nicholas t zervas the hospitals chief of neurosurgery and a 
friend of the dukakis family as well as drs lawrence borges and 
frederick mansfield 
lehrich said serious complications of the surgery are very rare 
although they can include paralysis if the spinal cord is damaged 
during the operation doctors will remove bone from her hip and 
use it to replace the damaged discs her recovery in the hospital 
was expected to take one or two weeks 
doctors said that her problem while not rare is far less 
common than herniated discs in the lower back that do not press in 
the spinal cord 
mrs dukakis entered massachusetts general on wednesday night 
after flying to boston from arizona 
mrs dukakis disclosed last year that she had been addicted to 
amphetamines for 26 years until she entered a minnesota clinic in 
1982 she said she began taking the pills to curb her appetite and 
became addicted

relaxed day having tea with the queen watching parades and basking 
in tributes from his longtime friend and ideological soulmate mrs 
thatcher 
she told reagan i warmly congratulate you especially on 
his stance on human rights and his street encounters with russians 
a senior british official said 
she argued that the russian people would find it difficult now 
to see the united states as a threat in the future the official 
said briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
other british officials reported that at a small dinner for 19 
people at her no 10 downing st residence mrs thatcher called 
his work at the summit a tremendous success heralding a new 
era in eastwest relations

be vigorous and determined to carry out his reform program a 
british official said 
reagan also told mrs thatcher he was not prepared to be rushed 
into a strategic nuclear arms agreement said the official who 
added and we dont have any reservations about the position of 
the united states on this 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that mrs thatcher 
promptly accepted reagans invitation to visit washington in

before he steps down fitzwater said it was assumed she would also 
meet the presidentelect 
the visit promised to be a fond goodbye from mrs thatcher to 
reagan an ideological ally who shares her belief in capitalism and 
distrust of communism 
by stopping to brief mrs thatcher on his talks with gorbachev 
reagan was demonstrating his esteem for the woman whose nine years 
in office have paralleled his own tenure and made her the western 
alliances senior leader 
reagan rested at the us ambassadors residence before going to 
buckingham palace where he passed a crowd estimated by police at 
1500 there were waves and cheers and reagan waved back from his 
limousine 
the queen wearing a sapphireblue silk dress greeted the 
reagans in the marblecolumned entrance hall of her 285yearold 
palace 
nice to see you again she said how are you mr 
president 
to a reporter who asked whether he was glad to be here and not 
in moscow reagan grinned and replied let me put it very simply 
im very happy to be in london 
many of the onlookers were americans who had waited up to two 
hours to see reagan i live about 30 miles from his ranch and i 
dont bother to visit him said barbara black of camarillo 
calif and here i am half way around the world standing in line 
waiting to get a vague glimpse of him 
justine griffin a scot who waited outside the palace also was 
enthusiastic about the american president 
i think hes a good bloke she said 
reagan drove from buckingham palace to a ceremony outside the 
foreign office while mrs reagan returned to the ambassadors 
residence to receive a visit from prince charles 
the president stood on a dais in the quadrangle flanked by the 
prime minister who was in a black suit and widebrimmed black and 
white hat welsh guards in tall black bearskin caps and scarlet

us attorney general edwin meese 
iii said thursday he hopes a man accused in the 1985 twa hijacking 
gets life in prison 
meese was in munich to attend a meeting of european economic 
community interior and justice ministers 
in an interview with the associated press meese was asked about 
mohammed hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem who goes on trial july 5 
in frankfurt on charges of air piracy and murder in the twa 
hijacking 
we hope that he hamadi will be successfully prosecuted and 
appropriately sentenced meese said we believe that because of 
the severity of the crime that hamadi should receive the maximum 
life sentence 
a us navy diver was killed during the hijacking and 39 
americans were held hostage for 17 days 
the frankfurt juvenile court hearing hamadis case could give 
him a life sentence it also could rule that hamadi was under age 
21 at the time the hijacking began and try him as a juvenile in 
that case he could receive a maximum of 10 years in prison 
when he was apprehended hamadi gave his birthdate as june 13 
1964 but later maintained he was two years younger 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
customs agents found liquid explosives in his luggage and 
discovered his identification papers were forged 
earlier thursday meese met with european ministers representing 
the 12nation trevi group which meets to coordinate antiterrorism 
efforts trevi is an acronym for terrorism radicalism extremism 
violence international 
the united states is not an official member of the group but 
for years meese has met with ministers within the framework of 
trevi talks 
meese said he would present a number of us proposals to 
strengthen security cooperation during the meeting friday and 
saturday 
he declined to detail specific us suggestions but said there 
were several areas where cooperation could be expanded meese said 
us officials hope for increased exhanges of intelligence on 
terrorist groups and drug smuggling operations 
cooperation between the united states and europe has already 
been a material factor in decreasing terrorism meese said but 
it remains a serious problem 
he said the united states has also urged creation of a unified 
program of border security checks before the eec loosens travel 
restrictions in 1992

two groups announced thursday they are filing 
suit to force the fbi to disclose information about a program using 
librarians to monitor suspicious library users 
a spokesman for one of the groups the liberal people for the 
american way said the suit follows unsuccessful attempts to get 
information about the fbis library awareness program through the 
freedom of information act 
arthur j kropp president of people for the american way said 
the suit was being filed by his group and the national security 
archive in us district court in washington 
we believe that information is the currency of democracy 
said scott armstrong a former washington post reporter who now 
heads the national security archive therefore anything that 
constrains the flow of this valuable information damages the 
liquidity of the marketplace of ideas and thus damages democracy 
itself 
the fbi contends the program is an essential counterintelligence 
effort in a report released last month the fbi said soviet 
intelligence agents seeking sensitive technological information are 
among the most enthusiastic users of us libraries 
but kropp maintained that the fbi uses techniques of 
intimidation to enlist library officials kropp cited several 
instances of fbi agents instructing librarians to look for 
suspicious anomalous or funny behavior by people using 
libraries 
the american library association which represents 50000 
library workers has also been critical of fbi measures accusing 
the agency of undertaking a generalized effort to solicit 
librarians to do surveillance work 
people for the american way claims 250000 contributors 
nationwide it opposes censorship of school materials religion in 
politics and what it considers excessive government secrecy the 
national security archive is a security research group founded by 
armstrong to publish formerly classified government materials 
kropp said the fbi efforts have been reported in public 
libraries as well as university and technical libraries in new 
jersey wisconsin ohio new york california florida and maryland 
the fbi report said soviet agents have been using libraries for 
26 years to identify the nations emerging technology before it 
can be classified or restricted 
fbi director william sessions told a senate committee last month 
that the library awareness program was an important 
counterintelligence program and that librarians are free to refuse 
fbi requests for information about patrons

president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev parted company thursday expressing confidence they had 
advanced the cause of peace during five days of a moscow 
spring en route home reagan stopped overnight in london for a 
sentimental visit with a steady ally 
british prime minister margaret thatcher honored reagan with a 
dinner for 19 at no 10 downing street she told him the summit was 
a tremendous success heralding a new era in eastwest 
relations 
she told told her guests that reagan will take his place in 
history as one of the greatest us presidents 
at a kremlin farewell gorbachev said he and reagan could have 
accomplished more although they did manage to divert the train 
of ussoviet relations from a dangerous track to a safer one 
reagan replied that he and nancy for all our days will 
remember the people of russia the faces of hope hope for a new 
era in human history an era of peace between our nations and our 
peoples 
we think of you as friends he told the kremlin leader 
and thus ended the first presidential trip to the soviet union 
in 14 years 
asked later about gorbachevs criticism of the pace of 
negotiations reagan replied id like to speed them up he 
offered no elaboration 
the geneva negotiators are scheduled to resume talks but not 
until july 12 
just hours after reagan departed gorbachev told several hundred 
peace activists that reagans human rights campaign would not 
change soviet policy he said the russians dont need advice on 
how we run our affairs 
meantime the british turned on the pomp 
when the president came to her 285yearold palace for tea 
queen elizabeth ii greeted him with a simple handshake and a nice 
to see you again how are you mr president 
a band played the tunes of 100yearold american songwriter 
irving berlin when reagan met mrs thatcher who has been her 
steadiest supporter in the west he grasped her warmly by the elbow 
there was also a parade outside no 10 downing street an annual 
event in ceremonies leading up to the queens birthday the parade 
dating back to 1727 included 406 musicians and 61 horsemen 
reagan invited mrs thatcher to visit washington after the 
november election and she promptly accepted white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said it was assumed she would also meet 
the presidentelect 
a senior british government official briefing reporters on 
condition he not be identified said mrs thatcher was 
gratified that reagan had mingled among muscovites she told 
reagan the russian people would find it difficult now to see the 
united states as a threat he said 
reagan planned to meet friday with japanese prime minister 
noboru takeshita and deliver a speech on the state of eastwest 
relations before returning to washington 
secretary of state george p shultz who made a side trip to 
brussels gave the nato allies an upbeat summit assessment and said 
its certainly possible that the superpowers could agree on 
deep nuclear cuts before reagan leaves office in january 
we share his opinion that it was a successful and substantial 
summit said hansdietrich genscher west german foreign 
minister after meeting with shultz through this summit the 
americansoviet relationship got a new stability a new 
perspective 
reagan and gorbachev had hoped to find the formula for a 30 to 
50 percent slash in strategic weapons that goal evaded them but 
they agreed on two confidence building treaties and established 
a personal warmth 
reagan took pleasure in the outcome he said this summit in 
this moscow spring had fulfilled its promise 
a lessthaneuphoric tone was struck by edward l rowny 
reagans special adviser for arms control matters rowny returned 
to washington where his staff said he told japanese foreign 
minister sousuke uno that progress on strategic disarment was made 
but cautioned lets remember that the soviet negotiators always 
seek to cripple us in areas where they fear we might utilize our 
comparative technological advantages 
by stopping here to brief mrs thatcher reagan was 
demonstrating his esteem for the woman whose nine years in office 
have made her the western alliances senior leader 
the trip to london was likely to be reagans last as president 
although the pair will meet again in toronto later this month for 
the sevennation economic summit 
the reagans looked drawn and tired as they left moscow in a 
downpour he is tired i guess he looks tired were all tired 
acknowledged white house chief of staff howard baker 
baker talking to reporters aboard air force one en route to 
london said reagan and gorbachev were going at it pretty heavy 
until the end and disagreed over whether a communique should 
embrace the concept of peaceful coexistence a term coined by 
the soviets that became part of their cold war jargon 
gorbachev speaking a farewell to reagan seemed to agree that 
the talks were not always smooth 
our dialogue has not been easy the soviet leader said 
but we mustered enough realism and political will to overcome 
obstacles and divert the train of us soviet relations from a 
dangerous track to a safer one 
it is however so far been moving much more slowly than is 
required by the real situation both in our two countries and in 
the whole world he said 
he added over the past three years our two nations have come 
to know each other better they have now taken a really good look 
in each others eyes and have a keener sense of the need to learn 
to live together on this beautiful planet earth 
reagan noted that their parting was occuring in a kremlin hall 
named for the order of st george and said i would like to think 
that our efforts during these past few days have slayed a few 
dragons and advanced the struggle against the evils that threaten 
mankind and i would like to hope that like st george with 
gods help peace and freedom can prevail

the house gave overwhelming approval thursday 
to an 115 billion nasa authorization bill that includes nearly 1 
billion for the start on a space station but nothing for a 
freeflying unmanned factory in space 
the senate is not likely to go along with authorizing anything 
near that amount some senators have expressed an inclination to 
vote for no more than 102 billion for the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 an amount that could kill the space station project 
for the first time the house authorization bill puts a cap of 
242 billion on the total cost of the space station which is 
planned to be in orbit around earth and occupied by astronauts at 
the end of 1996 a year before that it would be available for 
periodic visits by astronauts 
also for the first time the bill authorizes spending for the 
national aeronautics and space administration for three years 
115 billion in 1989 144 billion in 1990 and 157 billion in 
1991 the amount for 1989 is what president reagan asked for and 
represents an increase of 29 percent over the 89 billion 
authorized for this year 
the vote was 360 to 26 
the bill authorizes no funds for the minispace station that 
would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle then leased by 
nasa from its developers for 700 million over five years it 
allows the space agency to request proposals for such a facility 
but specifically bans the awarding of any contracts except for 
studies by the national academy of sciences and the national 
academy of public administration 
under the house bill a 12member national mars commission 
would be established to prepare a detailed proposal for a joint 
manned mission to mars with the soviet union 
development of the advanced communications technology satellite 
which is opposed by the reagan administration is authorized by the 
bill and the house calls for a flight demonstration for a 
hypersonic space plane one capable of flying at least five times 
the speed of sound by 1995

a colombian cocaine dealer whose arrest prosecutors 
called second only to drug kingpin carlos lehder rivas in 
importance was sentenced to 60 years in prison thursday 
jose auli lopez chacon 38 ran a bogotabased drug trafficking 
ring that smuggled 325 million worth of cocaine to cities across 
the united states according to his indictment he was snared in a 
sting federal agents had dubbed operation pisces 
we dont usually catch people of your caliber us district 
judge lenore nesbitt said as she imposed the 60year sentence for 
one count of operating a continuing criminal enterprise 
lopez pleaded guilty to the charge in a plea bargain escaping 
the maximum life sentence possible under the law but lopezs 
attorney joel rosenthal said his client probably would spend the 
rest of his life behind bars 
the 60year sentence is a functional life term said 
rosenthal he has to serve at least 40 years without parole 
lopez was indicted in the drug enforcement administration 
moneylaundering sting operation pisces along with top medellin 
cartel figures pablo emilio escobar gaviria and jorge luis ochoa 
vasquez who have escaped custody 
lopez apparently kept his operation separate from the cartels 
but special justice department prosecutor carol wilkinson said he 
was second only to lehder in major drug figures arrested in the 
united states 
lehder a top cartel manager was convicted of cocaine smuggling 
in jacksonville last month 
lopez supervised his own farflung empire said ms wilkinson 
overseeing drug laboratories in the bogota area as well as us 
distribution of the drug 
his undoing was operation pisces a threeyear sting operation 
in which the dea set up undercover agents as money launderers while 
cracking down on the traffickers traditional conduits 
in all the dea agents handled 325 transactions averaging 1 
million to 15 million each agency officials said 
the sting supplied the dea with enough information for state and 
local authorities to arrest more than 350 people from 1984 to 1987 
as well as seize more than 19000 pounds of cocaine with a 
wholesale value of 270 million 
operation pisces ended in april 1987 with the indictment of 115 
people in miami new york and los angeles 
lopez was caught that same month when an undercover agent lured 
him to the united states by promising to introduce him to mafia 
money men who would launder his drug cash he was arrested as he 
stepped off the plane at miami international airport

some of the 57 men killed in the 
stolzenbach coal mine survived a devastating gas explosion but 
suffocated when their emergency masks ran out of oxygen officials 
said thursday 
among the dead was an 18yearold who was on his first shift as 
a miner when the explosion occurred wednesday afternoon in what an 
official described as one of the most modern and bestequipped 
lignite coal mines around 
the young man had graduated from school last friday and wanted 
to earn some money before continuing his education mayor bernd 
hessler told reporters hessler would not give the young mans 
name honoring the familys wishes 
rescue workers brought the first 11 bodies to the surface 
thursday afternoon and took them to a temporary mortuary in metal 
caskets gottfried milde hesse state interior minister said 36 
bodies had been found and the others were scattered over a wide 
area underground 
milde said earlier thursday that 12 bodies had been taken from 
the mine but changed the number after talking with rescue workers 
fourteen of the dead miners were turkish immigrants families 
and friends germans and turks together clung to each other at 
the mine 70 miles northeast of frankfurt eyes red and swollen from 
tears and lack of sleep 
around them men with with grim faces black with coal dust and 
soot moved to and from the mine intent on retrieving all the bodies 
my son dieter is down there hes been a miner for 20 years 
said werner henke who waited at his sons house god let him be 
alive he has two small children 
wulf boettcher a state mining official said the chances of 
finding any survivors have sunk to zero 
rescue workers broke through tons of debris and battled rising 
water in the effort to retrieve the bodies of all 57 victims of 
west germanys worst mining accident since 1962 
some of the dead were found with their miners breathing masks 
on said erwin braun head of the hesse state mining board 
that means they survived the blast and apparently ran out of 
air 
he said the emergency masks had about three hours of oxygen but 
boettcher put the time at about 45 minutes braun said the 
explosion was caused by a buildup of methane gas 
a report on the zdf television network said investigators were 
speculating that a shortcircuit from a power tool may have started 
a chain reaction of explosions inside the mine 
braun said that was possible because coal dust can become 
dangerous if it gets mixed with methane gas and there is suddenly a 
spark 
about stolzenbach he said this is one of the most modern and 
bestequipped lignite coal mines around and it has been inspected 
many times including recently 
stefan walscher the local prosecutor investigating the 
disaster told reporters it could be several days before all the 
bodies are located and brought out 
the water is rising in several places hampering the attempts 
to get the bodies out he said and workers were pumping fresh 
air into the mine to minimize the risk of another gas explosion 
braun said the danger of another methane buildup persisted and 
rescue work is being hindered by heavy damage teams can 
proceed only with oxygen masks 
braun said carbon monoxide levels inside the mine had receded 
but still were severe 
milde said officials planned roman catholic lutheran and moslem 
religious services at a local school where the bodies were to be 
taken and where relatives assembled earlier thursday 
turkish consulate representatives also were at the scene they 
said state officials had confirmed that the total number of turkish 
victims was 14 some of those killed will be taken back to turkey 
for burial they added 
wednesdays explosion blew the roofs off at least three 
buildings at the mine knocked down sheds and shattered windows and 
sent debris flying that seriously injured eight miners on the 
surface the mine is in a field with the nearest homes about 500 
yards away 
the explosion was the worst mining accident in west germany 
since february 1962 when 299 miners were killed at voelklingen in 
saarland state 
about 170 people have been employed in the stolzenbach mine 
which is owned by preussen elektra of hanover one of the largest 
west german utility companies

abc dropped the slap maxwell story after 
its star dabney coleman and producer and creator jay tarses 
refused to continue working together the president of abc 
entertainment said thursday 
we never really had an opportunity to renew the show or cancel 
it brandon stoddard said at an informal meeting with newsmen in 
his office 
the way it was presented to us was that if dabney continued 
with the show jay wouldnt do it and if jay stayed with the show 
dabney wouldnt do it it just went its way 
stoddard said he did not know what caused the conflict between 
coleman and tarses neither of whom was available for comment 
tarses was in new york and coleman was working on a movie for nbc 
called sooner or later 
the show with coleman as an acerbic sports writer did poorly 
in the ratings and had particular trouble reaching women viewers 
stoddard said he felt it was essentially a variation of buffalo 
bill which coleman and tarses did for nbc several years ago 
we felt the show had problems with women said stoddard 
they had trouble caring about that character but jay runs his 
show very clearly we talked to him and made suggestions but he 
does what he wants to do 
tarses was also the creator and producer of days and nights of 
molly dodd which was canceled by nbc 
stoddard met with newsmen to discuss the new schedule and abcs 
plans for the future although he avoided answering questions about 
contingency plans for fall programming should the writers strike 
continue 
although abc finished last season in second place in the 
ratings ahead of cbs he said he still considered abc the third 
network because it took second on the basis of the winter olympics 
world series and the super bowl 
we think the quality of our programming continues to move 
forward he said we have a long way to go in that direction 
but we are committed to quality programming we were lucky this 
spring that some of our tryout shows caught on with the public 
like the wonder years the ten of us and china beach 
abcs biggest problem show appears to be moonlighting which 
irked many viewers this past season with numerous reruns another 
problem was that cybill shepherd who costars with bruce willis 
was pregnant 
were making some headway against the problem of repeats 
stoddard said that is a serious problem but we look for more 
original shows the writers strike is causing creative problems at 
this time but in the future id like to see a greater balance in 
the stories 
we want moonlighting to return to being a detective show and 
to put less emphasis on the relationships we want it to get back 
to being a detective show we have great writers and a great cast 
and i dont think thatll be too difficult 
stoddard said he expected abcs 30hour miniseries war and 
remembrance a sequel to the winds of war to begin in 
february he said a final decision on how to schedule the series 
would be made soon the series based on the book by herman wouk 
could not be scheduled in the fall because of nbcs coverage of the 
olympics which has tied up all the advertising money 
ive seen 18 hours of this show he said and you aint 
never seen anything like this not ever i think this show is going 
to bring people back to television who havent watched in years 
and its not just one show its 30 hours long 
the final scenes for war and remembrance including a tank 
battle and miniatures for the battle of midway are now being 
filmed stoddard said a 26foot submarine miniature had its front 
end blown off during filming when two torpedoes were fired at the 
same time and exploded

the straits of malacca near indonesian waters by a salvage team

white men suffering from kidney failure are more 
likely to get a kidney transplant than are women or minorities a 
new study says but an transplant expert says that the statistical 
differences arent the result of bias on the part of doctors 
a study in the june issue of the american medical associations 
archives of internal medicine showed 31 percent of us men who had 
undergone longterm dialysis received a transplant compared with 
21 percent of the women 
among minority patients 20 percent received a transplant after 
longterm dialysis compared with 30 percent of white patients said 
the report based on national statistics dating to 1983 
dr carl m kjellstrand said the imbalance his report found does 
not prove actual bias 
however the most favored recipient of a transplant is similar 
to the physicians who make the final decision a young white 
man said kjellstrand a swedish doctor who spent several years 
doing research in the united states 
in certain age groups the difference in transplant rates 
between races or sexes was even greater than the 3to2 ratio found 
overall minority longterm dialysis patients age 21 to 45 were 
half as likely to undergo the surgery as white patients of the same 
age and sex 
and women of any race age 46 to 60 were less than half as likely 
to receiving a donor kidney as men of the same race and age 
according to the report 
dr lawrence g hunsicker former president of the american 
society of transplant physicians said that for various reasons 
white men are more likely to seek transplants 
a recent change in the method used to allocate donor kidneys to 
people on waiting lists ordered by the government ensures against 
bias based on age sex or race he said 
but women and nonwhites who have had kidney failures are much 
less likely to be on those lists than white men hunsicker said in 
a telephone interview thursday 
hunsicker said blacks might be less eager than whites for 
transplants because they typically do not do as well after 
receiving a donor kidney but they also do not do as well on 
dialysis because of specialized health problems he said 
to get a kidney transplant your doctors or you must get you 
on the list and black patients and doctors may not take the 
initiative said dr arthur j matas a kidneytransplant surgeon 
at the university of minnesota 
about 5 percent of the women who qualify for kidney transplants 
may have trouble being matched to a donor organ hunsicker said 
women who have been pregnant several times can develop antibodies 
that would reject the organ a problem that can be detected in 
pretransplant tests he said 
but that 5 percent does not nearly justify the disparity between 
the number of women and men on dialysis who receive transplants he 
said 
hunsicker also said women may hesitate to get transplants 
because by and large in our society men tend to be more 
aggressive and risktaking 
in november 1987 the united states instituted a new policy for 
allocating donor kidneys based on objective criteria hunsicker 
said the government enforces the system by denying hospitals 
medicare if they fail to report all patients on waiting lists all 
donor kidneys and all recipients 
even before the law was passed hunsicker said there is no 
reason to believe there was any bias anywhere with regards to race 
or sex age is a different matter 
he said some hospitals may have used age as a criterion before 
the new policy was instituted

cosmonaut alexei leonov suggested thursday that 
the superpowers spend money saved by disarmament to finance joint 
missions to mars and beyond 
in an interview with the soviet weekly nedelya translated by the 
tass news agency leonov said that would be an ideal use for money 
previously spent on intermediaterange missiles which united 
states and soviet union have agreed to scrap 
the funds released can be diverted to the implementation of 
largescale peaceful projects specifically to manned flights to 
mars and the exploration of the universe said leonov who flew 
on the joint soyuzapollo mission in the 1970s he estimated the 
cost of a mars mission at 30 billion 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
ratification instruments wednesday for a treaty eliminating the 
missiles the soviet union has said some transportation devices 
used for its missiles were being converted into construction cranes 
and civilian uses were being found for other missile hardware 
washington has been lukewarm to soviet proposals for a joint 
manned mission to mars because of the cost gorbachev first 
broached the idea in an interview last month with the washington 
post and newsweek magazine

representatives of big 
business failed to persuade black labor unions on thursday to 
abandon a threeday protest next week that is expected to take the 
form of a general strike 
the two largest black labor federations have called for a 
peaceful nationwide protest june 68 to express opposition to 
government crackdowns on antiapartheid groups and to a proposed 
labor bill that would curtail unions ability to hold legal strikes 
the federations cannot legally endorse a general strike but 
their previous calls for national protests have resulted in 
widespread work stoppages leading antiapartheid clergymen have 
endorsed the federations latest appeal 
leaders of the congress of south african trade unions the 
largest union federation met thursday with a committee 
representing major employer organizations and headed by bobby 
godsell of anglo american corp 
the federations general secretary jay naidoo told reporters 
the protest will go ahead as planned because the business officials 
failed to ease union concerns about the proposed labor legislation 
we maintain that the bill represents a major rollback of the 
rights of workers naidoo said 
godsell said the bill is not unionbashing legislation he 
also said the federation officials refused to promise him that next 
weeks protest would not include stayaways 
federation leaders arranged a meeting thursday with the south 
africa consultative committee on labor affairs which represents 
major employer organizations the talks included management 
representatives from the countrys leading industries such as 
mining metals and manufacturing 
officials of the congress of south african trade unions met 
wednesday with the national council of trade unions the second 
largest labor federation the two groups which have differed over 
political ideology agreed to cooperate in promoting the protest 
the congress says it has 691000 duespaying members the 
council claims more than 400000 members 
police officials said the union groups are being monitored to 
see if they violated stateofemergency prohibitions on promotion 
of political strikes and boycotts some employers have threatened 
to dock wages take disciplinary action and withdraw from wage 
negotiations if workers take part in a stayaway 
in february the government banned the congress of south african 
trade unions and 17 other antiapartheid organizations from taking 
part in politics 
a main federation target is the proposed labor relations 
amendment which would make it harder for unions to strike outlaw 
sympathy strikes and hold unions liable for losses suffered by 
employers during an illegal strike 
unions charge that major businesses have not used their 
influence to oppose the measure now before parliament 
at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg police 
fired rubber bullets into the air thursday to disperse hundreds of 
college students demonstrating against government detentions of 
antiapartheid activists 
there were no injuries or arrests vice chancellor mervyn shear 
said he said that the students had engaged in a perfectly 
peaceful protest 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained for varying 
lengths of time since the government declared a state of emergency 
in june 1986 following antiapartheid violence 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

presidential candidate jesse jackson met with 
gang members in a violenceravaged ghetto thursday and said he 
wants to end the cycle of desperationhopelessness that 
plagues their lives 
a combination of drugs and guns and money creates a kind of 
unholy alliance that has left the south central los angeles 
residents feeling they have no way out jackson said 
he said he hoped the meeting would be the first of many such 
talking sessions between officials and the young gang members 
beginning with one that afternoon with mayor tom bradley at city 
hall 
he talked to reporters as gang members and other residents of 
the nickerson gardens housing project milled around in the 
courtyard outside a twobedroom apartment where jackson had spent 
the night with a projects family 
jacksons closed session with more than 100 community 
representatives and gang members in the watts housing project had 
been billed as a meeting of both bloods and crips rival gangs in a 
city that saw 205 gangrelated deaths last year 
but the few dozen gang members on hand were all from the bounty 
hunters gang that dominates that area or their affiliate groups 
many sported the red colors hats or shirts that mark the the 
bloods 
gang members and police officers said they doubted anyone could 
get the gang rivals to sit down together peacefully 
id be surprised if they both got in there and didnt start 
anything said officer victor rocha who patrols the south 
central los angeles region where watts is located 
jackson emerged from the meeting to announce to reporters that a 
meeting had been arranged later in the day at city hall for 
himself gang members mayor tom bradley and other officials 
initially jacksons schedule included an afternoon debate with 
frontrunner michael dukakis but dukakis canceled it thursday 
morning because his wife was to undergo surgery on friday he flew 
back to boston to be with her 
jackson said the city hall meeting would include discussion of 
ways to more effectively target resources social programs and job 
efforts in the communities plauged by gang and drug problems 
he described gangs as groups of people who form a reaction of 
desperation to hopelessness 
it was unclear what else was acheieved at the morning meeting 
which was closed to reporters 
some local residents many of whom have lost friends and 
relatives to gang shootings expressed hope at the attention 
jackson brought to their concerns but also skepticism that any 
changes could be achieved 
i dont know i doubt it said james tapla 17 who 
described himself as aa bounty hunter marked by rival gangs 
you cant go nowhere without somebody wanting to beat you down 
or shoot you i lost three close friends to gang violence he 
said im tired of it its time for this to stop 
another youth john thomas 25 said he once shot someone in a 
gang feud and didnt stay around to see if the person died 
its no big deal life in south central la is tough he 
said but he said deep down inside many gang members dont want 
to be involved in violence 
he and others said virtually everyone in their community has a 
gun 
its better to be caught by the police with it than by some 
other fool without it said kevin johnson 25 
later thursday at city hall before jackson and bradley met 
with several county and city representatives and six gang members 
bradley praised jacksons thoroughly remarkable campaign 
i commend you for what you have done in showing what is 
possible for this country the mayor told the candidate 
however when questioned by reporters he declined to directly 
endorse jackson 
jesse jackson hasnt needed anybody to endorse him hes done 
it on his own bradley said he credited jackson with 
energizing millions of people across the country 
when the two emerged from a private meeting bradley turned 
aside questions as to why it took a jackson visit to spark the 
meeting between officials and gang members jackson in his most 
unique way has been able to make an appeal to gang members the 
mayor said

a teenage arab prostitute fatally shot an 
18yearold jewish seminary student thursday after telling him she 
was tired of life and wanted to commit suicide police and an 
israeli news agency reported 
spokesman rafi levy said jerusalem police were investigating 
whether the killing was linked to the palestinian rebellion that 
began dec 8 in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
also thursday a court convicted four leftwing israelis who met 
with plo officials of breaking a law against contacts with members 
of terrorist groups israel calls the palestine liberation 
organization a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it 
prime minister yitzak shamir on thursday reiterated his 
opposition to holding an international middle east peace 
conference shamir was reacting to soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs statement wednesday that he would be willing to renew 
relations with israel if such a conference took place 
shamir told army radio that gorbachevs remarks will not 
change my views i dont think we should pay a heavy price for 
renewing relations with the soviet union 
the soviets broke diplomatic ties with israel during the 1967 
middle east war when israel captured the west bank and gaza strip 
from jordan and egypt 
in the united arab emirates plo chairman yasser arafat said the 
arab uprising in the occupied territories will continue until 
palestinians have an independent homeland 
we need another year of continuous uprising arafat told a 
gathering of palestinians at the emirates presidential guest 
palace wednesday night 
the killing in jerusalem was the second recent attack on a 
seminarian in the holy city which has 340000 jewish and 130000 
palestinian residents the first occurred may 26 when an arab 
stabbed and wounded a jewish student in the arab quarter 
the latest victim eliezer schlesinger was a student at the 
shaarei chesed seminary in the rehavia quarter near where he was 
shot 
itim the israeli news agency said schlesinger and another 
student took a break from studies at 130 am and walked through 
sacher park

encountered a young woman who told them in fluent hebrew im 
tired of life i want to commit suicide itim reported

and the woman drew a pistol and opened fire hitting schlesinger 
five times in the back and head 
she fled but was caught by a security officer who heard the 
shots levy said the woman confessed and described the shooting 
but her name was not released because she is a minor 
an israeli soldier and a teenage jewish settler have been slain 
in the west bank during the palestinian uprising at least 199 
palestinians also have been killed according to un figures

week that put the palestinian death toll at 207 
col raanan gissin an military spokesman said the army was 
certain of only 152 deaths all at the hands of israeli soldiers 
all the rest are unclear and we are not going to relate to 
them he said 
the court convicted the four israelis after rejecting defense 
arguments that the plo was not a terrorist group and the 2yearold 
law against meetings with such organizations did not apply 
latif dory yael lotan reuven kaminer and eliezer failer held 
talks with a 15member plo delegation in romania in november 1986 
soon after the law was passed they said at the time they 
considered the meeting a test of the law

dialogue and declared we shall continue to fight it until it 
is revoked

entering a junior high school itim said the army closed the school 
for two weeks accusing students of throwing rocks at israelis who

supernova 1987a the closest star to explode 
in 400 years has provided a feast of many courses for an 
international army of scientists now the researchers are waiting 
for dessert a look at a neutron star in its infancy 
weve never before observed a supernova evolve through to the 
birth of a neutron star stan woosley a university of 
california santa cruz astrophysicist said at a national 
aeronautics and space administration news conference thursday 
now the egg is about to hatch 
supernova 1987a was first detected on feb 24 1987 the burst 
of light and radiation was located in the large magellanic cloud a 
galaxy near the milky way and some 160000 light years away 
it was the first exploding star in four centuries that was close 
enough to be seen with the unaided eye but only in the southern 
hemisphere and scientists all over the world immediately turned 
powerful instruments toward the object 
since then the progress of the explosion has been charted in 
minute detail as light and other radiation streamed away and were 
detected by instruments onboard airplanes and satellites or 
carried aloft by balloons and sounding rockets or housed in 
groundbased observatories 
it has been the most completely studied phenomenon outside the 
solar system in history woosley said it has been a grand 
event as it should be since something like doesnt happen but 
every 30 generations 
the scientists actually are studying an event that occurred 
160000 years ago but the star is so far away some 960000 
trillion miles that it has taken all of those centuries for the 
light to reach earth 
visible light from the explosion has declined slowly but data 
is still being collected in other parts of the radiation spectrum 
at thursdays nasa news conference scientists said the studies 
have confirmed some basic theories about the life cycle of stars 
and about the formation of fundamental elements in the universe 
but supernova 87 also has created mysteries that are yet to be 
explained 
among the findings reported thursday 
gamma ray studies show that as the star exploded a small 
amount of matter in its helium core evolved into radioactive 
nickel which decayed to cobalt and finally to the stable isotope 
iron56 this confirmed theories of the evolution of matter from 
stars 
we have seen for the first time the creation of new matter in 
the universe said david helfand a columbia university scientist 
data from emissions of the explosion which give indications of 
the stars composition show the star had a puzzling lifetime 
before its explosion woosley said it apparently spent about 9 
billion years as a blue sequence star changed its composition to a 
red super giant star for a million years through the loss of 
material equal to about four suns and then evolved back to a blue 
star he said there is no general explanation for this 
early in its life the star that exploded was about 20 times 
more massive than the sun its explosion came about through a 
gravitational collapse of shells of surrounding the core of helium 
light streaming from the star has been the result of 
radioactive decay the light has declined and will continue to do 
so until energy from an evolving neutron star causes the level of 
light to become steady 
it is this event woosley said that astronomers are awaiting 
detection of the neutron star could come in a year as some 
believe or it could take many years 
a neutron star is the final stage in the life of a star it is 
composed of neutrons and compressed to the density of about a 
thousand million million times that of water its density is only 
10 percent less than that of a black hole which is so dense that 
not even light can escape its gravitational field 
if a sugar cube was dropped on a neutron star it would hit 
with a megaton of force woosley said thats the energy in 
such a force of gravity

agencies coping with the aids epidemic in america praised a 
white house aids commissions call thursday for legislation 
protecting the infected and urged congress and the reagan 
administration to follow its recommendations 
a spokesman for one agency however challenged the report as a 
bandaid approach saying the proposed 3 billion increase in 
aids spending is too little too late 
the commissions report is courageous aggressive and 
compassionate said tim sweeney deputy executive director for 
policy of the new york citybased gay mens health crisis a 
clearinghouse on aids 
we applaude their honesty and directness in addressing 
antidiscrimination explicit education addiction treatment 
violence against people with aids expansion of voluntary testing 
and the federal governments lethargic approach to drug testing 
he said 
we challenge the president congress and presidential 
candidates to respond to this report by implementing its 
recommendations sweeney said 
the american public health association a private organization 
of health professionals lauded the report as an aggressive first 
step towards developing an integrated national strategy to deal 
with the aids epidemic 
the recommendations are a rational intelligent and 
compassionate response to the epidemic the association said 
it goes a long way in calling for a rational compassionate 
practical response to the aids epidemic which we are yet to have 
in this country said rene durazzo of the san francisco aids 
foundation 
he said the commissions report should have specifically called 
for the use of condoms and should have been strong in preventing 
aids transmission among intravenous drug users 
the recommendations cannot be ignored by the white house in 
light of similar recommendations by the national academy of 
sciences he said 
were having a very strong consensus coming together to form a 
good national practical response 
at the white house they have no reason to hedge the issues 
any more he said if they do theyre laying down and letting 
peope die 
bob kunst director of cure aids now a clearinghouse on aids 
and a service agency in miami feeding 120 aids patients condemned 
the report as a bandaid approach to this global menace and 
emergency 
kunst said the 3 billion spending hike proposed is again 
woefully deficient as a direct service agency in miami there is 
no money for food for housing for legitimate issues to keep 
people who are already infected alive 
the emphasis in this report is on antidiscrimination laws for 
people with aids he said florida was the first state to treat 
aids as a handicap none of that is saving anybodys life 
the last thing we need is the killing us with kindness 
attitude what we want is the money the accountability and we want 
legitimate people involved

there is no smoking gun in the harvard 
business school facultys vote for a former professor who claims 
she was denied tenure at the school because of her sex a federal 
judge said thursday 
whether barbara bund jackson should become the fifth tenured 
woman in the schools 80year history hinges on whether the 
evidence showed discrimination when she was denied tenure in 1981 
and 1983 us district judge douglas p woodlock said thursday 
jackson 44 now a private marketing consultant began teaching 
at harvard in 1973 she was promoted to associate professor in 1977 
and applied for tenure in 1981 she sued the university in 1984 
the judge who is expected to rule in the case next week heard 
closing arguments in the eightday trial came after attorney evan 
t lawson refused the judges recommendation to suspend the trial 
to question 56 professors involved a key 1981 faculty vote 
lawson said he did not have the resources to embark on an 
extremely complicated and lengthy procedure 
i think you will concede that there is no smoking gun here 
woodlock said what im interested in finding out is not whether 
or not her tenure review case was unfair but whether it was unfair 
because she is a woman 
in closing arguments lawson maintained he had compiled a 
multiplicity of little things that put together add up to an evil 
harvard attorney allan a ryan jr maintained not one shred of 
evidence linked jacksons tenure denial to sex bias 
during testimony harvard admitted that documents existed 
showing the schools faculty voted 477 to support jacksons tenure 
bid but two days later backed her by 2927 but ryan said there was 
no evidence that mcarthur used jacksons sex in lobbying professors 
to switch their votes in 1981 
tenure decisions at harvard are submitted to the faculty to 
gauge support for the professor the actual decision rests with the 
university president 
lawsons argument cited a number of factors which he contends 
prove that jackson was a victim of sex discrimination including 
business school dean john h mcarthur a codefendant with the 
university once said the only way to get more women on the 
schools faculty would be to impose quotas 
at least four men who had less favorable reviews and faculty 
support than jackson received tenure from 1977 to 1984 
a marketing expert from outside harvard who backed jackson was 
specifically asked whether his recommendation had anything to do 
with affirmative action 
lawson claimed the schools tenure standards were applied 
unfairly to jackson who after being denied tenure in 1981 was 
given a threeyear extension and asked to demonstrate excellence in 
marketing 
ryan contended that jacksons case was a long train of 
perceived slights but it is wholly bereft of any evidence that 
a man would have been treated any differently than her

dissident milovan djilas told an 
enthusiastic student audience on thursday in the increasingly 
liberal republic of slovenia yugoslavia can prosper only as a 
democratic confederation sources said 
they said djilas praised the west european pluralistic political 
system 
the sources said the noted author and former vice president of 
yugoslavia once heirapparent to the late president josip broz 
tito talked to students in the slovenian city of maribor in 
northern yugoslavia near the austrian border 
about 300 students loudly applauded him when he entered a hall 
in their dormitory and during and after his address according to 
the sources who spoke on condition their names not be used 
although the anticommunist themes djilas expressed were typical 
of him the fact that he was allowed to voice them was considered 
an event in itself 
djilas a former comradeinarms of tito the founder of 
communist yugoslavia spent about three years in royalist jails in 
yugoslavia before world war ii and nine years in communist jails 
after becoming one of the strongest critics of communism 
he was given back his passport in january 1987 for the first 
time since 1969 and began traveling widely giving lectures 
slovenia is yugoslavias most developed region and is strongly 
influenced by italy and austria on its western and northern 
borders 
in another development thursday the arrest of janez jansa an 
outspoken journalist and slovenian youth leader led to sharp 
public criticism in slovenia 
jansa one of four candidates for president of slovenias 
official socialist youth organization was arrested on tuesday in 
ljubljana a city 62 miles southeast of maribor on what police 
said was suspicion of revealing a military secret 
he had published articles in slovenian youth periodicals 
critical of yugoslav army policies and leaders he also reported on 
alleged plans for a military coup in solvenia 
we are embittered by jansas arrest and we are worried about 
the freedom of public speech said a statement released thursday 
signed by 88 leading slovenian intellectuals we feel this is an 
act of intimidation 
police said earlier that authorities found a secret military 
document in a ljubljana software company where jansa works 
the document allegedly represents the minutes of a toplevel 
closed communist party meeting at which a plan for a possible 
military intervention in slovenia was discussed jansas friends 
said 
they said the same document was published by the mladina youth 
magazine in may but authorities immediately banned the periodical 
saying it contained state secrets 
last month slovenian youth publications said the military was 
planning a coup in slovenia and intended to arrest intellectuals 
journalists and others to quell dissent in the republic 
a communique issued last week by the presidency of yugoslavia 
denied plans for a military takeover and called the articles a 
slanderous campaign 
bojan korsika a journalist friend of jansa told the associated 
press that jansas whereabouts were unknown since and that the 
military said he would be allowed only an official army attorney 
korsika said several youth organizations around slovenia have 
held meetings protesting jansas arrest and demanding his release

george bush declared himself a 
refurbished candidate on thursday after a week of rest and 
strategy talks but said he wont change his tactics just because 
hes trailing in the polls 
the vice president spoke with reporters at his seaside vacation 
home after a coast guard safety check of his powerboat 
ive never felt more relaxed never felt more convinced that 
were on the right track he said and im not going to be 
stampeded by polls that dont mean anything 
recent public opinion polls have shown bush trailing democrat 
michael dukakis by 10 or more points 
on another subject bush moved slightly away from president 
reagan stressing more forcefully than reagan did the ussoviet 
differences on human rights 
i think we have very different views on human rights than the 
soviet union he said i would suggest that soviet retaliation 
against us saying weve got human rights problems is mixing 
apples and oranges 
weve got some problems but theyre not problems of human 
rights i think the soviet union should adhere to these high 
standards the president is talking about said the vice president 
but bush sidestepped questions about reagans suggestion that 
soviet bureaucracy not kremlin policy was to blame for delays in 
issuing exit visas or refusing them outright 
he said he was pleased with the overall outcome of the summit 
saying i dont think anyone expected a significant 
breakthrough on a new treaty 
when i get back to washington ill get a much better inside 
assessemnt of what went on but i think generally speaking its 
been very positive he said 
on another subject bush said he has great respect for the 
conservative movement and believes he has its support despite a 
public disagreement with two of its more outspoken members 
one day earlier in a new york times interview he had taken aim 
at richard viguerie a new right fundraiser and howard phillips 
chairman of the conservative caucus he said in the interview 
theres only one or two that polarize and viguerie and howie 
phillips are two of them 
thats a longstanding feud with two individuals who dont have 
any following bush said thursday the fact that i have been 
constantly attacked by two individuals doesnt have anything to do 
with votes if it did i wouldnt be the likely nominee of the 
republican party 
bush clinched the gop nomination in april 
the vice president returns to washington on friday after an 
eightday sojourn at his vacation retreat during which he met with 
domestic policy and economic advisers and held strategy sessions 
with top aides 
asked by a reporter if a new bush would emerge he said 
youre going to see a refurbished candidate because i come here 
and i feel good i get a little bit rested but youre not going to 
see any drastic change in campaign plans 
some republican consultants have urged bush to put more distance 
between himself and the reagan administration and to step up his 
attacks on dukakis but while bush has moved a little bit in that 
direction in recent days he told reporters weve got a game 
plan were staying with it it will be effective 
he said he planned to hold most of his fire against dukakis 
until after the democrats formally nominate their candidate 
then he said you will see me doing much more to put 
differences in focus and that will be easy to do because we 
fundamentally differ on so many issues 
bush invited reporters to his house to watch his 28foot 
powerboat fidelity get a safety check from the coast guard 
auxiliary it passed 
he was presented an inspection sticker by john murray chief of 
staff for the regional coast guard auxiliary who noted that it was 
safe boating week 
next bush took a group of reporters for a boat ride as the 
coast guard officials looked on 
should i make a dramatic exit he asked he gunned the two 
185horsepower engines on his modified cigarette racing boat and 
turned the boat in a fast circle in the cove next to his dock 
sending up a wall of spray before rocketing out into the atlantic 
ocean 
was that a safeboating manuever murray the coast guard 
inspector was asked by reporters 
its his cove murray responded 
bush said that he learned a lot from economists who had 
briefed him on tuesday and wednesday 
he want on to attack democrats for pessimism and negativism 
about the economy

france said thursday it will continue 
nuclear tests in the south pacific and rebuffed a third world 
campaign for nuclear disarmament saying that fighting poverty and 
hunger are just as important 
france told the un special session on disarmament not to adopt 
utopian declarations on total nuclear disarmament it called for 
realistic measures to reduce conventional arms especially in 
europe and a ban on chemical weapons 
foreign minister roland dumas told the 159member general 
assembly it was paradoxical to lavish so much effort on 
disarmament talks while displaying only resignation and sometimes 
even indifference when tragic problems of poverty hunger and debt 
are broached 
chinas minister of foreign affairs qian quichen congratulated 
the united states and the soviet union for recognizing their 
special responsibility to reduce their enormous nuclear arsenals 
and on their treaty to scrap medium and shorterrange nuclear 
missiles 
he called on the superpowers to cut their arsenals further 
while cautioning against false complacency 
qian said that even if they do cut by half the number of their 
nuclear weapons their nuclear arsenals will still account for 
approximately 90 percent of the worlds total sufficient to 
destroy all life on earth many times over 
he said people should be on guard against an important change 
which is taking place in the superpower arms race even with a 
reduction in the number of nuclear weapons he asked will 
qualitative development of more and newer types of armaments make 
the world safer and peace more secure 
president george vassiliou of cyprus called again for 
demilitarization of his divided mediterranean island saying the 
money saved could promote economic development of turkish cypriots 
cyprus has been divided into greek cypriot and turkish cypriot 
areas since turkey invaded the island in 1974 saying it was to 
protect the turkish cypriot minority after a brief but unsuccessful 
coup there fostered by the greek military government then in power 
vassiliou said no lasting solution is attainable unless 
turkish occupation forces and settlers are withdrawn from the 
island 
the special session meets through june 25 the united states and 
its western allies hope for a concrete modest un document on 
disarmament that will not impose on national defense policies and 
bilateral disarmament efforts 
most of the 12 speakers at the opening session wednesday issued 
sweeping calls for total disarmament a comprehensive nuclear test 
ban and a supervisory verification and monitoring role for the 
united nations the united states is mainly opposed to the measures 
dumas said thursday that france will not stop nuclear testing in 
the mururoa atoll in the south pacific but announced that the 
government for the first time would make an annual statement on the 
number of tests in the preceding 12 months 
france refuses to ratify the rarotonga treaty instituting a 
nuclearfree zone in the region and dumas reaffirmed that decision

20year prison term here for assault and battery has persuaded 
mother teresa to visit three of the states prisons after 
corresponding with her for two years 
donald ouimet 47 will be greeting mother teresa when the 
77yearold nun visits three state prisons including walpole on

lowest of the low said ouimet at a prison news conference 
thursday afternoon but every now and then a ray of hope shines 
i hope this saturday a ray of hope will shine when a little nun 
from india comes 
walpole inmates will present mother teresa with a pen drawing of 
her against a background of a comment she once made we are like 
a pencil in gods hands even though the instrument is imperfect 
the writing is beautiful 
the unlikely acquaintance of ouimet and the nobel peace prize 
winner began in 1986 when ouimet encouraged by a prison chaplain 
and a nun in new york city decided to write to her 
since then he has written to her and has received four letters 
from her 
ouimet who grew up in the workingclass western massachusetts 
town of holyoke after graduating from sacred heart high school in 
holyoke he became a capuchine franciscan monk and joined the st 
pius x friary in middletown conn as a lay brother 
after four years in the monastery ouimet left he said hes 
still not sure why he decided to leave 
it was springtime and the birds were singing and i wanted to 
live the good life said ouimet addressing reporters with the 
aplomb of a celebrity accustomed to the spotlight little did i 
know the good life would lead to the good life behind bars 
in 1965 a few years after leaving the monastery ouimet was 
convicted of aggravated assault he served nine years at walpole 
before his release in 1974 then returned to western massachusetts 
and held odd jobs mostly as a cook 
around 1985 he said he was arrested for four separate 
incidents of aggravated assault ouimet said he assaulted both a 
man and a woman in the course of the incidents but he did not 
provide any details 
thats not the issue he said whats here and now is the 
issue i have nothing no life in the streets my life is in here 
walpole properly known as the massachusetts correctional 
institutioncedar junction is the states only maximumsecurity 
prison and is known as a tough institution but ouimet says he 
likes prison life and doesnt want to leave 
though he is eligible for parole in 10 years ouimet said he 
would prefer to stay inside describing himself as an oldtime 
con part of the furniture here he said he even likes the food 
i prefer it here theres security i dont have to pay rent 
dont have to pay for lights he said im comfortable here 
ouimet said he plans to continue his correspondence with mother 
teresa after her visit adding that it has broadened his 
outlook he hopes his fellow inmates will have the same experience 
when they meet her saturday 
we are poor in spirit poor in emotion and poor in material 
possessions but in the eyes of our father we have a great 
dignity he said

riot police in armored vehicles swept onto a 
lima university campus wednesday and arrested about 100 people 
protesting the death of a campus demonstrator officials said 
earlier police fired buckshot and tear gas to disperse 
students some wearing masks and shouting leftist guerrilla 
slogans who lobbed dynamite sticks at police and burned bonfires 
in nearby streets according to reporters on the scene 
demonstration leaders at san marcos about four miles west of 
downtown told reporters that six students were wounded by buckshot 
police said the maoinspired shining path guerrilla group 
fomented the san marcos violence but refused to confirm the 
reports of injury 
violent demonstrations also erupted at two universities 
downtown tear gas fired by police wafted through the city during 
evening rush hour forcing thousands of pedestrians to cover their 
faces or seek shelter 
the campus strife which began monday to protest the alleged 
killing of highland peasants by soldiers and against recent fee 
increases intensified wednesday a day after a student was slain 
protest supporters charge the student was killed by a tear gas 
cannister fired by police officials have not confirmed the cause 
of the death 
demonstrations held throughout the day culminated late 
wednesday afternoon as dozens of heavilyarmed police in five 
armored vehicles and in vans rolled into san marcos police said 
officials said 100 university protesters were arrested among 
them students in the campus cafeteria 
television news reports showed footage of police smashing a 
lifesized campus statue of ernesto che guevara the deceased 
hero of cubas marxist revolution 
it was the second time in 16 months that police entered the san 
marcos campus which the government charges serves as a planning 
site for small pockets of leftist guerrillas 
university campuses in peru as elsewhere in latin america are 
considered autonomous and traditionally off limits to government 
forces 
a san marcos police raid in february 1987 during which about 
800 students were briefly arrested sparked intense criticism by 
leftwing politicians against the government

the state medicaid program offered free condoms 
to its clients for the first time wednesday but an unscientific 
survey of pharmacies found there were few takers 
michigans department of social services is allowing medicaid 
recipients to receive up to 24 free condoms at a time from 
pharmacies in an effort to promote birth control and curb the 
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
by early afternoon the response at perrys drug store in battle 
creek was absolutely zero said arch kane the stores 
pharmacist 
at a perrys drug store in detroit five people requested free 
condoms by early afternoon give them a week word will spread 
quickly said the stores pharmacist who declined to give his 
name 
the program approved by the legislature in december 1987 is 
believed to be the first of its kind in the nation and officials 
are uncertain how strong demand will be said chuck peller dss 
spokesman 
the dss plans to put a limit on the giveaway when it compiles 
statistics on average use peller said recipients who ask for 
condoms must register their medicaid number to prevent from abusing 
the offer he added 
most of the cost of the program should be reimbursed by the 
federal government which pays for 90 percent of the costs of 
family planning services peller said 
the state will reimburse drug stores giving them a 47cent 
profit on each condom but that isnt as large as the margin on 
condom sales kane said 
condoms are the highest grossmargin product in the store

at snyders drug store in marquette there were no takers by

the first mormon missionaries to nigeria and ghana were greeted 
by whole congregations of converts awaiting baptism into a church 
that for more than a century had refused to ordain blacks to its 
priesthood 
they came to us said former missionary reed clegg we 
could have baptized thousands they were living the gospel paying 
tithing holding meetings before we arrived 
when the late mormon church president spencer w kimball ended 
the 130year exclusion of blacks from the churchs allmale 
priesthood on june 9 1978 he paved the way for one of the most 
extraordinary episodes in the faiths long history of missionary 
work 
blacks have also converted by the thousands in many 
predominantly black caribbean countries and in brazil where many 
of the churchs 250000 members claim black ancestors 
but the story of mormon growth in africa stands apart for 
decades thousands in nigeria and ghana who had read mormon books 
and tracts implored the church to send missionaries to baptize 
them but it wasnt until the doctrine forbidding black priests was 
abolished that african governments would grant visas to mormon 
missionaries 
in one year the first missionaries two elderly couples 
baptized nearly 2000 converts a decade later nigeria has 8500 
church members ghana 5000 with membership growing by about 4000 
a year in the two combined 
missionaries returning from african service tell of villagers 
walking more than 50 miles round trip to attend church meetings of 
baptismal services lasting for hours to accommodate all the 
converts and communities where religion in general was of urgent 
concern 
church leaders assert they could multiply by many times the rate 
of growth in africa if they wished but they are moving slowly to 
build a solid base of black leadership and they say the strategy 
is paying off 
in may visiting officials from salt lake city ordained the 
first black african stake president a lay leader who presides over 
several congregations in the nigerian city of aba 
in south africa controlled by the apartheid system of racial 
separation the number of black converts is also on the rise 
the church could not estimate their number because its 
membership records do not note race but blacks attend sunday 
meetings and worship in the johannesburg temple alongside whites 
said elder neal a maxwell who supervises church activities in 
africa 
black africans are aware of the churchs old policy of denying 
priesthood membership to blacks but it appears to have made little 
difference to them 
they are not as interested in it as we are for them thats 
that they are grateful for the change but their eyes are on the 
future and they dont seem quite as caught up in it its not a big 
thing for them said maxwell 
despite the success prosyletizing in africa has raised new 
challenges to a church long acquainted with missionary work in 
faraway places among the more difficult is the popular tradition 
of polygamy 
scores of potential converts have been denied baptism because of 
plural marriage a practice the mormons themselves once embraced 
but officially dropped in 1890 as a prerequisite to statehood for 
utah 
rendell mabey who led the first missionary contingent said the 
problem arose on a grand scale in a congregation organized years 
before the missionaries arrived when mabey went to the village to 
baptize the people he learned about half were polygamists 
the monogamists initially refused to be baptized unless the 
others could be as well but after meeting privately local leaders 
decided that those who were monogamous would be baptized and the 
polygamists would continue to attend as nonmembers 
a cultural barrier of a different type the practice of voodoo 
confronts missionaries in the west indies a folk religion with 
african origins voodoo involves the belief that the dead live in a 
spirit world from which they can be recalled to bless or curse the 
living those who practice it are refused baptism said david king 
a former utah congressman who now directs the churchs missionary 
effort in haiti 
but king said adherents usually are not attracted to mormonism 
i rarely hear it discussed although im aware it is very much 
a part of the haitian culture king said we can hear the 
voodoo drums going into the night

cleeretta smiley says shes free at last 
in the mormon churchs new washington dc second ward but her 
25yearold son a sunday school teacher wishes the church had 
more appeal for young blacks 
a decade after the church began admitting blacks to priesthood 
the sole urban mormon congregation in washington which is 70 
percent black is mostly white and struggling to convert and keep 
black members 
ward leaders could think of only two black families who attend 
church together most members are singles or couples and few stay 
in the ward long the 400member congregation is about 40 percent 
black but at a recent sunday service with 100 people only about 
onefourth were black 
yet officials of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
say some of the black members particularly morerecent immigrants 
are faithful members and they are having a subtle impact on 
traditional mormon services 
a former nigerian legislator rufus olumba teaches in his 
native agbada robes and headdress to a mostly white priesthood 
class the lessons are out of the church manual but olumba adds 
unique phraseology and experience to mormon doctrine 
mrs smiley the wards public communications director has 
heard the rev martin luther king jr quoted in church 
what this church has given me is such a high level of freedom 
im free im free at last in that ward she said consciously 
echoing kings words 
mrs smiley whose husband left her and won custody of two of 
their four children after she joined the church three years before 
the ban on black priests was lifted said she and other black 
mormons tried for years to get an innercity ward which was 
finally established in may 1987 
before that the city had been divided like a wagon wheel with 
its wards radiating out into the suburbs along the lines of the 
spokes that scattered the few black members among the suburban 
wards 
beverly campbell a washingtonbased church spokeswoman said 
the church earlier avoided having a city ward because it didnt 
want the appearance of segregating church members 
now although the gleaming mormon temple in kensington md is 
a suburban landmark the citys mormons have no chapel 
on sundays the church leases part of the national press club 
turning the modern downtown center into a notsotypical mormon 
wardhouse with bishops conferences in a 13thfloor lounge 
overlooking the city sunday school classes in rooms named for 
famous journalists and sacrament services in a hall where the 
nations newsmakers address the washington press 
campbell acknowledged the church faces a challenge in attracting 
black americans 
the gospel is ever true and ever the same it does not 
change she said and yet the people of other cultures must 
feel a spiritual and emotional binding with the spiritual message 
that is sometimes missing 
but in a church that now prides itself in attracting all races 
and nationalities there arent enough active black members to 
raise the issue of segregation 
mrs smileys son robert said the church has little appeal to 
innercity blacks who still view it as a white racist institution 
the church has the basic principles he said but it has 
to change with the times a graduate in industrial technology he 
said one of his major complaints about the church is the dullness 
of its music 
at a recent service the congregation sang several traditional 
slow mormon hymns a sharp contrast to the lively gospel music of 
washingtons predominantly black protestant churches 
a member of the bishopric mark sykes said he knew of no 
incidents of racial prejudice among mormons in the area but pointed 
to other problems 
church members assigned to make monthly visits to members homes 
have been mugged in tough innercity neighborhoods he said 
ward leaders try hard to make black members more active in the 
congregation and to make them leaders he said but many are from 
homes where they are the only mormons they face pressure to leave 
the church from their families and friends and from actively 
antimormon protestant ministers he said 
sykes a 26yearold financial analyst with the marriott corp 
said he believes full acceptance of the church by blacks may have 
to come with the generation who are now children 
the children should be able to reconcile their black 
heritage and their mormon heritage he said maybe only then 
can there be a happy marriage of mormonism and the black american

eighteen months ago when ibm suddenly 
shut down its greencastle operation and took away nearly 1000 
jobs it left behind a lot of ducks local merchant barbara 
lane likes to say very calm on the surface but paddling 
furiously underneath 
thats how she describes the approach this quiet college town 
has taken from the day of ibms bad news using careful planning 
good fortune and hard work to bring in six new employers and 1000 
replacement jobs in the short term as many as 2000 five years 
from now 
long before international business machines corp said it would 
close its parts distribution center after 33 years greencastle had 
laid the foundation to deal with the shock of losing 8 percent of 
the jobs in putnam county 
ibm made the announcement without warning nov 11 1986 and by 
the following march about half of the employees had transferred to 
other sites the rest had taken early retirement 
the fact that ibm closed could have been devastating it 
wasnt said banker bill marley the framework was there we 
were ready to go 
in 1983 an economic development review had identified the 
strengths and weaknesses of the town of 8400 the importance for 
example of revitalizing the courthouse square which had just been 
designated a national historic district a needed hotel the walden 
inn was planned for the edge of the depauw university campus 
two years later a planning group examined the towns economic 
future leading to the incorporation of the greencastle development 
center in september 1986 
we were fortunate this community had started planning for the 
future three years ahead of time said bob hutchings chairman of 
the mayors economic development commission 
despite an initial dark mood in town residents projected only 
optimism to reporters who came to record the changes greencastle 
was going through 
everytime any media came around the word would get around and 
the cheerleading would begin i think thats what won all the 
industry said ms lane who chairs the group that has led the 
rehabilitation of the victorian buildings along the courthouse 
square 
charles preston who helps the state recruit new industry 
through the indiana department of commerce said i think they 
benefited from a lot of exposure when ibm left and the legacy ibm 
left 
no one has a harsh word for ibm the company gave 17 million 
to local government to smooth the transition of its loss and 
continued its united way contribution of more than 120000 for 
three years it also turned over 700000 from the sale of big 
blue its 350000squarefoot complex 
just as importantly ibm bought the more than 300 homes being 
sold by transferred employees and hired merrill lynch to market 
them fewer than 10 remain unsold 
fortunate timing helped greencastle just days before the ibm 
announcement bonds were sold for a 13 million expansion of the 
high school and construction of the middle school a week later and 
the bonds might not have been sold theyve made the schools more 
attractive to companies scouting new locations 
a day before the announcement scouts for automotive industries 
which produces auto trim had been in the area discussing possible 
locations a few days afterward they were inspecting the ibm site 
that january just 72 days after ibms announcement automotive 
industries became the first new industry to come to greencastle in 
15 years it built a plant under the shenandoah industries name 
that might employ as many 700 workers in five years 
it was the boost we needed it was a confirmation to our 
optimism said joyce hanlon president of the greencastle 
merchants association 
banker dan doan recalled the time he and others were in his 
office after midnight negotiating with an officer from charming 
shoppes in pennsylvania on one phone and one from shigeru kk in 
japan on another 
charming will move into big blue and employ 300 by early 
next year in a warehouse for its womens fashion outlets more than 
600 eventually might work there 
shigeru which like shenandoah will supply auto trim to japanese 
auto plants being built in the midwest will employ 100 in a 
company called heartland automotive inc by the end of next year 
three other companies two automobile parts suppliers and 
sherwinwilliams which is setting up a distributing center for 
automotive paint also are developing facilities in an industrial 
park where once only ibm stood 
the new companies however wont replace ibms payroll which 
was 38 million or roughly 38000 per year per employee bill 
andis ibms former head of strategic planning who took early 
retirement to run the development center said new employers will 
create an initial payroll of about 20 million he and other 
retirees will bring in an additional 9 million in income 
al carney a local car dealer said ibm people represented sales 
of at least a car per day for him after ibm left his volume has 
dropped from more than 80 cars per month to about 20 he laid off 
19 of his 45 employees 
the rev alan barber pastor of the peace lutheran church said 
ibms departure meant losing a fifth of his congregation of 216 
plus 31 percent of the donations but now his congregation is back 
over 200 again 
the lord was very gracious with us barber said 
mayor mike harmless a 38yearold greencastle native elected 
last november points out the new industry will create entrylevel 
jobs for local highschool graduates but until all the companies 
get going he acknowledges these are going to be lean years for 
the community

professional surfer rell kapoliokaehukai sunn 
figured she and her dog shane had the wet pet division of a 
recent surfing contest all wrapped up then the pig with the 
sunscreen showed up 
brian keaulana another pro surfer and his 4monthold pig 
chop chop sent the 2000 spectators and five judges at makaha 
beach on leeward oahu hog wild beating a dozen other human 
competitors who rode their boards tandem with everything from a 
baby goose to saltwater fish in a bowl 
shane is the surfing dog of makaha the kids love him sunn 
said of her 2yearold mutt but brian really did some moves on 
the board with that pig chop chop shane just sort of sits there 
but sunn who is 37 and works as a lifeguard said winning was 
not important she was happy that the first wet pet contest 
part of the 11th annual rell sunn menehune surfing championships 
was a hit 
the kids out there were going crazy everybody just loved 
it she said 
not everybody 
the hawaiian humane society received numerous phone calls 
protesting the event and wants to prevent similar contests in the 
future according to bob spencer public relations and fund 
development director 
the society is not impressed by surfing animals 
we are against putting animals in unnatural or dangerous 
situations spencer said and there is nothing more unnatural 
than a pig on a surfboard 
further spencer said delicate pink pig skin is prone to 
sunburn and not all owners are as considerate at keaulana who 
covered chop chops ears and snout with multicolored zinc oxide 
people thought the pig was in distress because it was green 
spencer said they didnt know it was covered with colored suntan 
lotion 
sunns wet pet contest is the first one spencer has heard of 
in the islands but hes worried the idea might catch on 
it might look fun but whose entertainment is it he asked 
its certainly not entertaining or fun for the animals 
sunn disagreed but acknowledged spencer had a point 
shane loves being in the water he loves to surf and he loves 
the attention she said but some animals might not like it 
and their owners shouldnt push them just to show off 
sunn said she refused to let one inexperienced surfer enter the 
wet pet competition after she saw the woman practicing with her 
dog 
she wiped out and had attached the dogs leash to the board so 
it really got knocked around in the waves that dog could have 
drowned or broken its neck sunn said 
spencer said the humane society isnt declaring war on these 
people we just want to educate them noting that animals are 
prohibited on state beaches and that regulation could be more 
strictly enforced 
sunn said she plans to hold the competition again next year but 
will regulate who can enter 
were only going to have people who we know surf with their 
animals who weve seen out before she said meanwhile she says 
shell keep surfing with shane 
he loves it and i dont think anybody should tell me what to 
do with my dog she said i dont force him i just put the 
board on the beach he jumps on the nose and we paddle out 
together 
i only take him out in gentle surf he likes small waves 
nothing bigger than 5 feet 
rob burns agreed you know how certain dogs really like to 
hang their heads out of car windows well its like that some 
pets just really take to the waves 
burns owns local motion a honolulubased water sports equipment 
and clothing store with nationwide distribution which sponsored a 
surfing contest in the waves off waikiki on memorial day and wanted 
to include a wet pet division this year 
ive heard of pigs out in waianae that bodysurf all by 
themselves and one gal has a pet rabbit that follows her to the 
beach he said 
but after talking it over with the humane society burns 
scrapped his plan 
they let us know they were against it and that is was illegal 
to have animals on the beach burns said it looked like it was 
going to cause a big stink when it was supposed to be all in fun 
so we just decided to drop it 
burns was very sensible about it and understood our point of 
view said spencer some people arent so sensible those are 
the ones were worried about

garrison keillors a prairie home companion 
the second annual farewell performance comes to cable viewers 
saturday from that most cosmopolitan of places radio city music 
hall 
the setting is symbolic of keillors new life in new york after 
13 years of radio shows several television appearances and two 
bestsellers filled with wry tales from the quintessential small 
midwestern town keillor said in a recent interview that lake 
wobegon as well as reallife minnesota had become part of the 
past 
keillor ended the radio show last year with a farewell 
performance in st paul then left his lifelong home to move to 
denmark with his danish wife but he soon wearied of being a 
stranger in a strange land and returned to the united states this 
time to new york 
lake wobegon is really my childhood and it does not it isnt 
perhaps im supposed to walk away from it at some point and leave 
it keillor said somewhat sadly over italian food near his 
chelsea apartment i went back to minnesota ive been back twice 
since i left there last fall and realized both times that its 
not my home strange feeling not pleasant 
though his saturday evening public radio show was popular fame 
really descended upon keillor after publication of his 1985 
bestseller lake wobegon days in new york he said i think 
that our life is if anything more domestic than it was in st 
paul and much quieter and much more private some people might go 
to the midwest for peace and stability but life in st paul and in 
the midwest was crazy and life in new york is eminently sane 
saturdays broadcast after two nonbroadcast performances will 
be available on a number of cable systems offering a free sample of 
the disney channel the performance will also be carried live on 
american public radio keillors guests include chet atkins leo 
kottke butch thompson and the everly brothers 
leaving lake wobegon doesnt mean an end to the folksy stories 
and dry wit that have made keillor famous theyll just move to 
manhattan 
there are a lot of people like me in new york keillor said 
midwestern people churchgoing people not that i set 
churchgoing people aside as a separate class but white sort of 
unremarkably liberal ordinary people who enjoy all of the 
fascinations and foreignness of the city and the excitement without 
themselves being changed so much i think i could talk about 
those people in new york 
such adventures might turn up on radio in the nottoodistant 
future keillor said 
i think that i owe myself two years sabbatical and its half 
up but i really feel that since i did the show for 13 years at 
the biblical rate of one per seven im entitled to a year and 10 
months or something then i could decide on it but new york is our 
home for as far ahead as i can see 
more television is also likely there have been network people 
who want to have lunch sometime he said meanwhile keillor 
writes for the new yorker magazine and is working on a movie script 
at the urging of director sydney pollack his books lake wobegon 
days and leaving home a collection of lake wobegon stories 
both became bestsellers 
although in appearances on public television and previously on 
the disney channel keillor proved himself a natural for 
television he says he hasnt gotten used to seeing himself on the 
small screen 
if i had guests theyd sometimes turn it on and id stand 
and watch part of it but when i came on the screen i always felt 
unbearable and went and cooked something he said 
perhaps inspired by his recent appearance in the gala honoring 
irving berlin on his 100th birthday keillors radio city music 
hall performance will feature a productionnumber monologue 
involving the rotating stage 
while keillor is lifted lowered and turned around the radio 
audience is to be none the wiser 
ill be talking about something all this time that doesnt 
have anything to do with the house the stage television 
keillor said i was hoping to disappear as an illusion trick i 
didnt know quite how to do that on radio

avantgarde artists armed with video cameras 
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art 
designed to draw the viewer into the picture 
people are captivated by this art form said video artist 
mary lucier it screens out distractions it draws you into a 
completely new and different world in that sense its kind of 
like going to the movies 
a new exhibit american landscape video the electronic 
grove features work done in the past decade by seven leading 
video artists including lucier 
the show on display through july 10 at pittsburghs carnegie 
museum of art features bright moving images that appear on video 
monitors illuminating darkened rooms 
the videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds 
call a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging 
amid crackles and pops eerie music plays as the camera peers up 
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water 
the artists placed rocks trees and other objects around the 
video monitors which have screens up to 25 inches wide in one 
work viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own 
images in the still water of a reflecting pool in another a coil 
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts 
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream 
each space creates its own environment lucier says the 
impact i think is greater than sculpture there is the sound as 
well as moving images and three dimensional objects 
many people resist the concept of video art assuming viewing it 
would be like watching television but they usually like the works 
once they see them said bill judson film curator at the carnegie 
people come in and they see this and they say my god i love 
that he said theyre astonished in themselves 
video art began in the mid1960s when advances in technology 
made black and white film equipment more affordable in the early 
70s museums began showing elaborate video displays and some 
artists used color computergenerated images in their work 
in new york the metropolitan museum of art and the whitney 
museum of american art have displayed video works but many smaller 
museums cant afford the high cost of building the exhibits judson 
said 
theres a lot of great work being done but its just not 
getting exposure he said 
in luciers wilderness three videotapes are shown 
simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals she 
filmed the same sites depicted by 19th century american landscape 
artists such as thomas cole and frederic church showing gleaming 
icebergs against a backdrop of clear sky 
one work room for st john on the cross has a gyrating 
image of mountain tops projected on a large screen in the center 
of the room is a small cube with light streaming from a single 
window a voice reciting in spanish can be heard and a 
whitecapped mountain is shown on a small video monitor inside the 
cube 
artist bill viola said the work is based on a spanish mystic who 
wrote love poetry and dreamed of flying over mountains despite 
being confined and tortured for nine months in a cell 
doug halls the terrible uncertainty of the thing described 
features six monitors and a large screen that show a roaring fire 
tornadoes whirling and storms at sea within the gallery a steel 
fence encloses the coil that fires an electrical discharge at two 
oversized stainless steel highbacked chairs 
in the allure of the concentric by rita myers four monitors 
amid large volcanic rocks show closeup views of leaves and weeds 
dry cracked ground and the silhouette of stark tree trunks against 
sky 
frank gillette placed eight eyelevel monitors in a square 
showing reeds in a marsh birds flying and other wildlife in the 
wilderness north of corpus christi texas 
around the corner the viewer stands in the center of a ring of 
eight monitors showing natural and colorized images that steina 
vasulka created of new mexican mountains and the desert 
in dara birnbaums willothe wisp three monitors placed 
in a panel show a woman amidst trees as a womans voice speaks

hes hobnobbed with errol flynn rita 
hayworth jack benny and bette davis and touted the talents of a 
budding actor named ronald reagan 
but irving fein counts as his greatest coup resurrecting the 
career of an 80yearold outofwork comic named george burns 
ive been lucky fein said during a recent interview at 
caesars palace where burns his longtime friend and client was 
appearing ive been able to work with the best of them and ive 
been in a position to turn away the tough ones who spell trouble 
fein recites a long list of famous stars hes promoted since he 
entered the publicity field via a short story contest at the 
university of wisconsin more than half a century ago the names 
include flynn hayworth benny davis burns reagan edgar bergen 
and gracie allen 
he says working with those great names of another era is a 
different world from todays stars many of whom have egos to match 
stratosphere salaries 
these young kids making 5 million a year they think theyre 
giants and suddenly theyre monsters fein said some of these 
young stars are impossible with 18 hangerson managers agents 
etc 
ive been very lucky george is very easy to deal with hes a 
professional you get ready to go to the plane and hes half an 
hour early he gets to the dressing room an hour or hour and a half 
before the opening act 
jack benny was the same way he was always ready id pick 
him up to go to the airport and hed be waiting out in front of his 
house with his bags 
some of these new stars are terrible fein said you pull 
up and theyre still sleeping you make the plane just as the doors 
are closing 
what makes the difference 
jack and george were old pros he said they came up the 
hard way started small time in vaudeville had tough breaks tough 
jobs 
fein remembers another era as a publicity executive at warner 
bros when it was easier to work with stars 
at warners wed hire 20 young people a year sign them up at 
75 a week he recalled hayworth ann sheridan they all 
started that way they had sixmonth options their salaries would 
jump from 75 a week to 100 then 125 150 those young kids 
were so eager so cooperative theyd do anything to work with you 
they used to plead with us to do that publicity stuff 
fein was bennys manager in 1974 when the famous comic 
contracted cancer fein had landed benny the lead role in the 
sunshine boys with walter matthau 
benny died dec 26 1974 at the age of 80 fein had worked with 
benny 27 years winning an emmy for production work on his show in 
the last decade of bennys life it was fein who produced his tv 
specials and set up benefit concerts that took the two across the 
country and around the world fein was left with some poignant 
memories 
he was such a vibrant guy warm sweet honest decent 
fein said he came up with burns bennys best friend as the 
replacement for the sunshine role burns won an academy award 
for his performance and his second career at age 80 was off and 
rolling today burns is the author of several books performs 
regularly at caesars palace and caesars tahoe has starred in 
several movies and has been the host of several tv specials 
it was a different story in 1974 
georges career had gone way down since gracie allen died in 
1964 fein recalled he worked very little once in a while he 
would do spots for us jack bennys tv show george was very 
unhappy 
when fein learned benny was dying he told the films producers 
burns could fill the void 
every star was after that job fein recalled danny kaye 
milton berle danny thomas art carney jack albertson sid caesar 
a million people were after that job but i got it for george 
after sunshine boys was completed fein booked burns in 
london then carnegie hall in new york 
in the past 14 years with burns fein has produced several 
movies starring his friend you and me kid oh god you 
devil 18 again and is working on oh god iv 
he has written the book jack benny an intimate biography 
and worked with burns on books such as living it up will they 
still love me in altoona and the upcoming book gracie a 
love story which is due out in october 
fein planned to be a lawyer when he went to the university of 
wisconsin but he won a short story contest which landed him a job 
in the publicity department at warners he worked 18 hour days to 
continue his pr job and earn a law degree his first love remained 
the stars he promoted 
after getting dozens of stars tons of ink hes focusing today 
only on burns 
and he hasnt lost the knack of answering or avoiding a 
question 
how old is he 
early 70s fein says 
how early 
just early he grins

by some odd twists of place and history church 
leaders of the world converge next week in a land of official 
atheism to celebrate the original flowering there of christianity 
its a peculiar combination in the seemingly incompatible 
setting of the soviet union whose government disavows existence of 
god an enduring faith marks its 1000th birthday 
taking part there in june 516 celebrations are prominent church 
figures from many countries ranging from top vatican officers to 
evangelist billy graham to the archbishop of canterbury 
to a curious extent the occasion brings together chieftains of 
belief in a climate against it where the communist governments 
efforts to stamp it out have gone on for 70 years 
but signs of change circulated and the rev bruce rigdon a 
presbyterian scholar of chicago and specialist on soviet church 
life says all kinds of amazing things are happening to improve 
religious conditions 
we want to show our solidarity with churches there to express 
our hopes for them and let the government know that theyre not 
isolated and alone but part of a worldwide community that holds 
them in esteem and cares for them 
the rev john wilkes of the baptist world alliance in 
washington also among those attending says this worldwide 
gathering can be helpful in overcoming barriers to christianity and 
making it better understood 
the affair comes at a time of moderations in soviet domestic 
policies including opening of additional churches largescale 
printing and importing of bibles and promised easing of religious 
restrictions 
some even see latent religious potentialities in soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev reportedly raised in a russian orthodox family 
and who says laws are being revised to recognize religious concerns 
we are praying that he will become a christian and if 
possible a methodist the rev olay parnaments a methodist 
pastor in soviet estonia told the united methodist general 
conference in st louis in may 
gorbachev in april met with patriarch pimen in the kremlin and 
called for more tolerant attitudes toward religion the first such 
meeting between top church and government leaders in 40 years 
bishop clement us representative of russian orthodoxy says 
about 450 foreign church leaders are attending the celebrations 
there including about 60 from the united states 
roman cathoilicism is sending a highlevel 10member 
delegation headed by the vatican secretary of state cardinal 
agostino casaroli the popes top aide 
he and archbishop of canterbury robert runcie leader of the 
worldwide anglican communion including us episcopalians are 
among speakers for special jubilee ceremonies june 10 at 
resurrection church of the newly restored st daniel monastery in 
moscow 
other speakers at that time are to include graham and rabbi 
arthur schneier of new york president of the interfaith appeal of 
conscience foundation which works internationally to promote 
religious freedom 
pope john paul ii issued a pastoral letter on the rise and 
endurance of christianity in the soviet union expressing hopes for 
full communion in christ with these sister churches 
the lutheran world federation hailed the russian church for its 
creative influence in the countrys history 
among american church leaders attending 
the rev avery post president of the united church of christ 
the rev arie brouwer chief executive of the national council of 
churches metropolitan theodosius head of the orthodox church in 
america roman catholic cardinal john oconnor of new york the 
rev joe hale general secretary of the world methodist conference 
bishop herbert chilstrom head of the evangelical lutheran church 
in america episcopal bishop david reed of louisville ky 
presbyterian william p thompson of the world conference on 
religion and peace neal wilson president of seventhday 
adventists and the rev donald miller general secretary of the 
church of the brethren 
the 10day celebration starts with allnight vigils at moscow 
churches followed the next day june 5 by a liturgy at the 
patriarchal cathedral of the epiphany led by patriarch pimen 
russian orthodoxy holds a council june 69 at the nearby 
theological center at zagorsk with various intervening events at 
theaters and churches prior to the jubilee ceremonies june l0 
another allnight vigil was set june ll at moscow churches 
other special services commemorating saints and recognizing 
some new ones were set for june 12 in trinity cathedral with a 
reception afterward hosted by pimen and other orthodox prelates 
on following days and also interspersing previous events 
visits were to be made to churches in other cities including 
leningrad kiev and vladimir 
it was in ad 988 that prince vladimir newly converted to 
christianity got the pagan subjects of his principality then known 
as kievan rus to join in a mass baptism of thousands in the dnieper 
river at kiev 
the faith penetrated a people and a culture and despite 
hardships it has encountered the imprint remains

cole emerson has known for two years that 
when the big earthquake hits california it will be his job to get 
first interstate bank back into business 
when the citys worst highrise fire swept the banks 
headquarters last month emerson saw his disaster plans put to the 
test and by all accounts they passed 
the inferno broke out at 1030 pm may 4 gutting 4 floors of 
the 62story building killing one maintenance man and closing the 
states tallest building for an indefinite time 
but by the start of banking hours the next day the vital 
business of the first interstate bancorp the nations 
ninthbiggest bank holding company was proceeding and only one of 
the companys 320 california branches was closed the one on the 
buildings ground floor 
because of the planning process because of the group of 
people that was there the team and our instant communications 
with our customers we didnt miss a beat said emerson the 
banks vice president for information management 
emerson 42 is in charge of contingency planning and computer 
security he is assigned to the first interstate bank of 
california although in the headquarters fire his plan and staff 
also helped restart the parent company which owns banks in 13 
states and franchises in 10 others 
a former criminal investigator for the internal revenue service 
emerson moved into corporate security in 1977 he began his tenure 
at first interstate in 1986 after stints with various other firms 
including bank of boston corp and carter hawley hale stores inc 
his straightforward almost deadpan description of first 
interstates recovery from the fire is typical of his lawmans 
approach to the task of disaster planning 
he recalled that shortly after the fire broke out his 
fivemember business resumption group and a parallel group that 
deals with staff safety opened the banks new emergency center 
which is in a computer operations building seven blocks from the 
downtown headquarters 
as damage reports came in emersons group orchestrated moves 
for the vital groups that work in the headquarters 
they saw the securities trading department dispersed with 
traders flying to company offices in hong kong and new york as 
well as taking borrowed space in town they were prepared since 
the disaster plan calls for traders and a few other key employees 
to carry home diskettes bearing vital records from their personal 
computers 
they arranged the rental of hundreds of telephones switched 
numbers and lines and organized the flow of 125000 incoming and 
8000 outgoing pieces of mail each day 
as the week wore on they found office space for 1500 
displaced workers in first interstate buildings and branches 
throughout southern california and in offices rented or borrowed on 
short notice 
the main computers handling the banks daily rush of consumer 
and business transactions werent in the headquarters but if they 
had been knocked out they would have been backed up in northern 
california emerson noted 
those in banking that were aware of first interstates 
disaster plan said that it was among the best in the industry 
said nancy sheppard spokeswoman for the california bankers 
association 
cole is a very wellorganized person a very nonexcitable 
type person said ed pistey a coworker in charge of the banks 
physical security thats something thats very important in any 
crisis and if your planning has gone well thats something 
thats not all facade 
jj pinola chairman of the holding company credits planners 
with foreseeing the necessary moves but like emerson praises the 
employees who made the plans work and continue to work in sometimes 
cramped quarters 
i think the heroes are there pinola said but in this 
case every single member of the organization feels good about their 
part in getting us out of this mess 
the disaster plan actually was developed to deal with a great 
earthquake the state office of emergency services say odds are 
better than 50 percent that such a quake will hit the region in the 
next 25 years 
an earthquake is real and its catastrophic and its going 
to happen emerson said theres nobody in my position in any 
of the banks whos going to say if its always when its going 
to happen i feel even more confident right now that were well on 
the way to being prepared for that 
in emersons office a hardhat hangs from the coatrack and a 
portable telephone sits on a chair the view out the window is of a 
white circus tent pitched to shelter hundreds of cardboard cartons 
holding business documents and personal belongings salvaged from 
the building 
preliminary engineering reports indicate the building will be 
safe to reoccupy but pinola says estimates of when are guesses at 
best an electrical fault is believed to have caused the fire but 
the investigation isnt complete there still isnt a firm dollar 
estimate of the damage 
for emerson and his team the recovery is both a victory and a 
base on which to build 
its funny its almost addictive planning alternates 
emerson said even planning a trip you find yourself saying if 
i cant go this way and catch this plane at this schedule then i 
have this backup it just becomes a normal part of your 
thinking

from cajun food to cable television the 
journalists kremlinologists presidential aides and party 
functionaries involved in the moscow summit got a glimpse of 
capitalism in the core of communist power 
while the summit was short on substance it broke down some of 
the stereotypes the two leaders had on life in the other 
superpower stirring up a feelgood atmosphere that was visible 
on the streets and sidewalks of this infamously grim city 
media madness and commercial hype are unfamiliar experiences in 
moscow and for the most part soviet citizens were excluded from 
the fray that unfolded at the summit media center roadblocks set 
up a halfmile from the site at the international hotel steered 
away all without special passes 
but for the westerners in town for the meetings between soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan a few touches of 
home made their stay more comfortable and in conformance with 
similar events held abroad 
the island of consumerism established at the hotel known as the 
mezh among the foreign community here drew dozens of prominent 
soviet pundits and politicians 
instant coffee and caviar sandwiches were sold from linenspread 
tables in the congress hall alongside kiosks selling gorbachevs 
book perestroika and stacks of moscow postcards 
officials in the vanguard of the glasnost and perestroika 
campaigns milled around the cavernous press room where many of the 
5000 journalists covering the event set up telephones typewriters 
and portable computers they gave impromptu interviews surveyed 
the souvenirs and watched the live cable news network feed on huge 
television monitors set up throughout the center 
the white house press center issued texts of the presidents 
speeches and comments and the soviet foreign ministry responded 
with summit briefing packets and a desk that took applications for 
private interviews with soviet officials 
cnn beamed its 24hour service into central moscow for the 
summit but only foreignmade televisions like those at the mezh 
were able to tune in the american programming 
a mobile pizza van brought in to moscow two months ago parked 
along the moscow river embankment across from the hotel and did a 
whopping business with the busy journalists 
a louisiana chef john folse shipped his cajun cooking 
operation lock stock and catfish to moscow for the summit 
taking over the mercury restaurant at the mezh in a weeklong 
jointventure that hit some snags the restaurant gave out free 
hamburgers and fries to the working press as a means of eating up 
some of its profits that could not be taken out of the country 
rival tshirt and souvenir kiosks sprung up at the press center 
dispensing moscow summit88 memorabilia for hard currency even 
the official tass news agency got in on the act producing shirts 
buttons records and tapes with the help of an american marketing 
firm 
summit spinoffs that reached the general public were at times 
more hindrance than help roadblocks were set up at intersections 
leading to all summit sights the press center the american 
ambassadors residence where the reagans stayed and along motorcade 
routes the traffic diversions frustrated some soviets trying to 
get to home or work in areas around the presidents path 
but the sprucedup city and the excitement of a visit by the 
american president who once called the soviet union an evil 
empire made muscovites proud and brought them out in droves for 
walks about the summit showcase 
american and soviet flags stemmed from light poles along the 
motorcade routes and red square with its famous and garish 
landmarks was floodlit throughout the summit for the benefit of 
american television viewers who saw the historic setting as the 
backdrop on evening news programs 
the arbat pedestrian mall always thronged with street artists 
and strollers took on a more political focus with murals depicting 
abstract concepts of superpower relations and buttons commemorating 
the fiveday event 
but almost simultaneously with the takeoff of the presidential 
plane the barriers came down and the power plugs were pulled 
some summit preparations may have longer term effects like the 
frenetic painting and repaving done before the event but for most 
muscovites the signs of the superpower conference were a memory 
before reagans plane crossed out of soviet airspace

editors note in an affluent town on the connecticut river a

an 18th century tavern with trees sprouting 
through the floorboards seemed destined to be razed in a 
firefighting drill until it was rescued by a couple of connecticut 
developers who look to the past to find fancy homes for the future 
now it will be restored with modern conveniences added and 
become one of the dozen or so antique homes in an unusual 33acre 
subdivision in this affluent town on the connecticut river 
developers harry p broom jr and william oberg are scouring the 
countryside for other vintage homes for the subdivision they call 
sterling meadows the homes when finished will carry a modern 
price tag of 800000 to 12 million broom and oberg say they 
havent tried to sell any yet 
the former owner of the old tavern they said sold it to them 
rather than to the salem fire department which was going to burn 
it down for a firefighting drill 
the problem is most old houses are accidents of geography 
says oberg 32 of essex who left a career in finance more than 
two years ago to become a developer 
what used to be a convenient location on the main road is now 
a busy commercial district with a lot of traffic going by and they 
end up being torn down for a new office building a new apartment 
building or one thing or another 
oberg says the partnership has purchased five buildings for its 
subdivision and is still looking for others to fill the seven other 
lots four buildings are now being reconstructed at the site a 
concrete foundation is ready for a federalstyle home from 
massachusetts that dates to around 1800 
they expect to complete the development in about three years 
the first step is saving the buildings a painstaking task the 
partnership has paid 5000 to 20000 for the relics and spends 
five to six weeks dismantling them 
with a crew of carpenters supplied by brooms other business 
hb broom housewright inc a restoration company nearly 
everything is saved from frame and windows to mantels and 
floorboards 
broom and oberg remain true to each buildings original design 
which means for example rebuilding six fireplaces in the former 
salem tavern but the structures are outfitted with modern 
conveniences such as burglar alarm systems and central air 
conditioning 
when we rebuild these houses were using all the original 
features and restoring the house as best we can but were not 
building museums says broom 44 of lyme whose office is in a 
building built in 1770 to serve as a general store for steamships 
on the connecticut river and the ferry that to this day shuttles 
between chester and hadlyme 
were building houses that are practical to live in 
the interiors are slightly modified with ells to accommodate the 
modern trappings of kitchens and bathrooms otherwise the homes are 
original right down to the slightly offcenter front doors on some 
they plan to pave the winding road leading to the development 
and line it with sugar maples stone walls and picket fences 
antique lampposts will be recreated based on design borrowed from 
deerfield mass 
were trying to create the perfect new england environment 
oberg says we try not to change the details at all and take 
small liberties with the ells 
oberg is quick to dispel notions that the developers are trying 
to imitate sturbridge village in massachusetts or williamsburg in 
virginia he says they confine their efforts to homes built between 
1700 and 1815 and lean toward those in formal styles such as 
federal or georgian 
similar but smaller subdivisions of five relocated historic 
homes each are located in rural killingworth conn and in 
waitsfield vt 
oberg criticizes the socalled purist approach to 
restoration which is light on modern conveniences and heavy on 
dark interior colors 
the result when a socalled purist restores a house is that 
the houses tend to be dark and use dark colors and that is not 
quite what everybody would like he says 
the sterling meadows development has met the approval of town 
officials who are committed to 2 and 3acre zoning in order to 
preserve the towns atmosphere 
about 1910 people live in lymes 33 square miles homeowners 
include former new york city mayor john lindsay and brooklyn ny 
district attorney elizabeth holtzman 
if youre gonna have development of that nature you could do 
no better than skip broom says lyme first selectman john f 
yeomans referring to broom by his nickname theyre as good as 
any and better than most 
oberg and broom formed their partnership 2 years ago after 
oberg bought a tract of land alongside a 12acre parcel broom 
already owned oberg says he has had a lifelong interest in antique 
homes while broom quit a job as an analyst with shell oil co about 
15 years ago to start his restoration business 
i had a piece of land i bought as a investment and i always 
wanted to put antique houses on it says broom whose company has 
restored about 80 homes oddly enough he wanted to do the same 
thing

the 1989 ford probe can be hazardous to drive 
the problem is not with the car but with other folks who want to 
get a good look at it 
during the time i had a probe gl test car i was chased at 80 
mph down a freeway by two guys in a spanking newlooking pontiac 
grand prix who wanted to check out the probe their grand prix just 
made its debut this model year 
i also encountered an older fellow who nearly stopped in the 
middle of intersection so he could get a gander at my probe 
traffic in my neighborhood picked up one sunday as people came back 
around the block to get second and third looks at the probe 
and the probe was immediately surrounded by curious sales people 
at a honda dealership i visited 
it sure seems that ford has an attentiongetter with this 
aerodynamic funtodrive small specialty car that was unveiled in 
chicago in february and went on sale in may ford already has 
70000 orders which amounts to this years full production at the 
flat rock mich plant where the car is built eventual plant 
capacity could reach 150000 annually 
the frontdrive probe is unique in a couple ways though sold in 
ford showrooms the car was designed with the help of mazda motor 
corp of japan and is being produced at the mazda plant in flat 
rock by united auto workers members 
the plant the first us assembly plant operated by a japanese 
automaker to be organized by the uaw also builds the mazda version 
of the probe called the mazda mx6 which shares many components 
with the probe 
ford by the way owns 25 percent of mazda 
but the probe differs from the mx6 in appearance inside and 
out conveying a more modern sleek image and for all the 
attention it gets it doesnt cost a mint base price for the gl 
the lowestpriced version of the probe was 10459 the test car 
with optional premium sound system cast aluminum wheels air 
conditioning and automatic transmission totaled 13186 
ford also offers an upscale lx model which starts at around 
11400 and a topoftheline performance gt which sports a 
spoiler fog lamps and turbocharged engine and starts at around 
13600 
those prices put the probe squarely in contention with its 
japanese competitors the honda prelude which starts around 
14000 and the toyota celica which starts around 12000 
the test car the lowend probe gl had commendable suspension 
and good handling however the standard engine a 22liter 
electronic fuelinjected fourcylinder didnt quite seem to 
deliver the power one would want in such a sleek sassylooking car 
cloth front bucket seats were comfortable enough but leg room 
in the back was a problem 
fit and finish inside and out was admirable and the tilt 
steering was different causing the whole steering module 
including instrument cluster to move up and down it was a nice 
touch considering the feature meant never having to worry about a 
steering wheel adjustment obscuring the view of one of the gauges 
it took some getting used to the blinker it wasnt a stalk on 
the side of the steering column rather it was a small lever 
attached to the dash 
likewise the headlights were not activated by the traditional 
pushpull knob on the dash nor the turn of a switch at the end of a 
blinker stalk instead the retractable headlights came out and on 
when a large dial on the side of the instrument cluster was turned 
the rear cargo area was deep and roomy but items had to be 
lifted up and over the rear of the car the probe is aimed at 
young careeroriented buyers a ford statement said 
specifically targeted buyers have a median age of 30 55 
percent are single half are male and they have a median annual 
income of 33000 said ford analyst ray windecker the major 
occupations expected to be represented among probe drivers include 
professionaltechnical workers and managers he added 
there have been several reports that the probe is designed to 
replace the ford mustang which has been around since the 1960s 
ford says the two cars will be sold sidebyside in showrooms 
and the mustang will remain as long as there is consumer demand 
because the probe is just arriving on the market there are no 
reliability reports

the moscow summit offered the soviets a forum to 
show off mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and a chance to boost the 
kremlin leader on the eve of a communist party conference crucial 
to the success of his policies 
while the us media devoted much space and time to the meeting 
between president reagan and gorbachev the soviet media devoted at 
least as much space if not more to discussion of the party 
conference and a reform document published on the eve of the summit 
that outlines more potentially radical reforms 
soviet television coverage of the summit meanwhile portrayed 
gorbachev as a dynamic worldwise leader 
reagan helped promote that image during his stay by repeatedly 
acknowledging the blossoming of the staterun arts and media 
restructuring of the economy and freeing of some political 
prisoners under gorbachev 
in fact reagan appeared so impressed with gorbachevs policies 
that he withdrew his earlier characterization of the soviet union 
as an evil empire and when it came time for reagan to leave 
he bid a warm farewell to a leader he said had become a personal 
friend 
but the air of good will did not hide the fact that gorbachev is 
waging a battle to win the support of the 5000 communist party 
delegates to the national conference which begins june 28 the 
conference is the first of its kind since 1941 
gorbachev has said he wants partisans of perestroika his 
effort to restructure soviet society elected as delegates to the 
conference at the same time the soviet leader has indicated that 
he does not want any party conflicts out in the open and he 
studiously avoided mention of the party conference during the 
summit 
but that did not stop soviet reformers from speaking out about 
the fierce fight being waged by orthodox communists and outspoken 
gorbachev supporters over delegate elections to the conference 
boris yeltsin the ousted moscow communist party boss dropped 
from the ruling politburo last february took the most dramatic 
step giving two interviews to western television stations in which 
he called for the resignation of the kremlins no 2 official 
yegor k ligachev 
yeltsin is said to have criticized the slow pace of reform in an 
unpublished speech last oct 21 that led to his ouster this week 
he took the unprecedented step of using western interviews to 
assail ligachev for allegedly blocking reform 
gorbachev insisted at his news conference last week that there 
is no movement to force ligachev to step down 
at the same time however the proreform weekly ogonyok and the 
weekly moscow news available in english spanish french german 
and arabic as well as russian published candid articles about 
maneuvers used to ease reformers off the conference slate 
organizers of the soviet unions fledgling independent political 
party the democratic union founded on may 4 held a meeting of 
1500 people in leningrad last weekend demanding a multiparty 
system and fairer delegate selection 
smaller protests on this and other issues such as jewish 
emigration took place daily in moscow during the summit with 
police watching in silence 
vitaly korotich editor of ogonyok said moscow students went to 
the citys pushkin square last week to collect signatures on a 
petition demanding he be a conference delegate 
sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya writer fyodor burlatsky 
historian yuri afanasyev and korotich told western reporters in 
news conferences or interviews that they failed to gain election as 
delegates in an initial round of voting 
burlatsky said the problems were due to the fact that we are 
learning democracy 
korotich too blamed the maneuvering on the lack of a political 
culture 
we have to learn not to be afraid he said in an interview 
we have to get rid of the stalinist remnants under stalin it 
was easy he had a theory of enemies that made everybody afraid of 
one another 
banging on a desk for emphasis he added if you thought this 
desk was bad you could just say it was made by enemies simple as 
that 
perestroika he added is just a big return to the norm 
we have to become normal again 
foreign ministry press center officials were swift to accede to 
western reporters requests for interviews with the most outspoken 
proponents of reform who also took the dais at news conferences 
for hundreds of journalists 
known conservatives were not seen at such forums and were not 
strongly in evidence at a meeting reagan had with writers and 
intellectuals last tuesday 
this could be the result of what gorbachev himself has described 
as passive panicky resistance to his reforms this maneuvering has 
not so far emerged into a publicly identifiable political movement 
korotich also noted that the conservatives have not yet 
presented a program and have not suggested any new leader to 
replace gorbachev as communist party general secretary 
he said he expected gorbachev to emerge strengthened from the 
conference 
the public relations campaign for gorbachevs reforms that was 
waged during the summit certainly convinced a moscow taxi driver 
who said he was from the soviet leaders home region in southern 
russia 
gorbachev is like jesus christ he volunteered to a western 
reporter during a conversation highly critical of soviet life 
our children have all forgotten how to work and he will get them 
going again

west german businesses lured in 
part by promises of economic reform in the soviet union are 
rushing to boost their trade with the kremlin 
they range from the mighty deutsche bank which recently 
arranged a 2 billion line of credit for the kremlin to the 
sporting goods company adidas which already is making products in 
the soviet union but is looking to expand 
while a string of new collaborations were announced in may the 
growing trend has sparked some criticism from washington 
sen jim sasser dtenn without referring by name to deutsche 
bank said the soviets are using these loans to finance military 
mischief i fear around the world 
but soviet economists say that is unlikely 
soviet consumers want better products said helmut giesecke 
an economist with the bonn industry and trade conference office 
once they have them theyre not going back to the old ways 
still defense secretary frank carlucci who appeared with 
sasser at a recent senate committee hearing said us defense 
officials had discussed the situation in general terms because 
they put an added defense burden on the nato allies 
the allies however could also complain about us trade with 
the soviets carlucci noted 
west germany which serves as natos front line of defense 
against the sovietled warsaw pact has seen its trade with the 
soviets decline for the past three years 
west german imports from the soviets have nearly halved to 427 
billion since 1984 and exports to the soviets are down to 46 
billion from 63 billion three years ago 
seventy percent of soviet exports to west germany are natural 
gas and oil products which are purchased with us dollars but a 
low dollar and cheap oil prices have taken their toll cutting into 
the foreign currency supplies the soviets need import goods 
increased ties to west germany fit soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs program to improve conditions at home soviet 
economists say to encourage foreign investment the soviet union 
has begun allowing western concerns to own a share of soviet 
industries 
deutsche bank economist hans dettmar said that it is too early 
to tell how the line of credit will be used by the soviets but 
it is intended for light industry consumer products such as 
shoes and foodstuffs and joint venture projects to expand that 
market with the soviet union 
any business deals will be announced by the companies taking 
part not the bank we and the other banks involved only make the 
money available he said 
among the german companies that announced deals last month were 
salamander west germanys largest shoe producer which already 
produces shoes in leningrad said it would up its production with a 
new plant in vitebsk 
lurgi gmbh said it was heading a consortium of companies 
awarded a 294 million contract to build two new oil and gas plants 
to expand production in the tengiuz oil fields near the caspian sea 
adidas will begin making sports textiles in tbilis by the end 
of this year the company has been making shoes in moscow since 
1978 and in kiev since 1984 
man producer of heavy vehicles announced a joint venture with 
the soviets to produce longhaul trucks 
to help finance the deals the soviets are looking west for hard 
currency frankfurt bank sources said the soviets are planning to 
sell 294 million in eurobonds in west germany 
that sale would follow a 70 million bond the soviets floated 
five months ago in switzerland

south koreas exports in may rose 16 
percent to 467 billion but appear to be slowing from the brisk 
pace set in the first four months of the year the trade and 
foreign ministry said thursday 
exports totaled 467 billion last month compared with 402 
billion a year ago 
but they increase fell short of the 325 percent average boost 
during the first four months of the year 
the setback was attributed to recent labor disputes over wage 
hikes in auto and some other exportsensitive industries as well as 
the appreciation of the korean won against the us dollar the won 
has risen about 8 percent in value since january 
imports in may totaled 423 billion up 166 percent from 363 
billion a year ago 
the trade surplus in may amouted to 435 million compared with 
437 million in april and 395 million in may 1987 the may surplus 
was the smallest since february 
for the past five months exports totaled 221 billion up 286 
percent from a year ago while imports rose 307 percent to 1983 
billion according to the ministrys preliminary figures

the government has relaxed curbs on the production 
of alcohol and lifted some restrictions on the sale of booze in a 
slackening of mikhail s gorbachevs antidrunkenness drive a 
weekly newspaper reports 
moscow news which is at the forefront of the soviet leaders 
campaign for glasnost or openness did not say what 
restrictions on sales were removed 
but the labor newspaper trud reported last month that moscow 
city authorities had recently allowed an expansion of the number of 
stores selling alcoholic beverages to 772 it did not give the 
previous figure 
moscow news in its wednesday editions and trud gave two 
reasons for the easing of gorbachevs antialcoholism campaign to 
try to discourage moonshining and stop a run on sugar the 
moonshiners who trud said are outproducing the legal alcohol 
industry use sugar to make alcohol 
sugar is being rationed in several soviet cities but moscow 
news said it is not in short supply adding that sugar supplies 
were greater in 1988 than last year 
increased sales of alcohol and the stabilization of alcohol 
production should reduce the use of sugar by moonshiners moscow 
news said 
gorbachevs antialcohol campaign his first major initiative 
after taking power in march 1985 included raising the drinking 
age shortening the hours of liquor stores and cutting liquor 
production 
soviet officials have credited the campaign with increasing the 
life expectancy and cutting drunkenness on the job 
but nikolai shmelev a prominent economist told reporters last 
week gorbachev has been going about trying to reduce alcoholism the 
wrong way 
he said the campaign has encouraged moonshiners and taken 
revenue from liquor sales away from the government 
instead said shmelev the government should improve consumer 
supplies so a man could use his ruble to buy a bottle of vodka or 
a good shirt 
the communist party daily pravda reported late last year that 
more than 45 million of the soviet unions 284 million people are 
registered alcoholics 1 million of whom require compulsory 
care

making graduation cards containing humorous references to drinking 
after they got a cool reception from a mothers against drunk 
driving chapter 
hallmark decided tuesday to discontinue manufacturing and 
shipping alcoholrelated graduation cards diane wall a 
spokeswoman for the kansas citybased company said wednesday 
however janet cater director of the orange county calif 
chapter of madd said hallmark had not done enough because the 
cards were still available in some stores 
ms wall said the graduation season is nearly over and that the 
cards would soon been removed from store shelves the company said 
the decision to withdraw cards was up to retailers 
two stores in anaheim calif pulled the cards at the request 
of casa an orange califbased group that works against drinking 
drug use and pregnancy among teenagers said organization 
chairwoman jane wyner 
every day these cards are on the market they are going to be 
selling she said this has to be nipped right away 
the controversy arose last week when parents of students at 
edison high school in huntington beach calif showed madd 
officials two cards 
one card depicting a refrigerator filled with beer and a single 
egg advises dont go to graduation without a good breakfast 
first 
another suggests that graduates wear loosefitting gowns so they 
can hide at least two bottles of champagne underneath 
how can a company which advertises when you care enough to 
send the very best send hallmark produce cards which encourage 
alcohol and drunken driving asked ms cater 
hallmark offers about 600 graduation card designs and less 
than 1 percent deal with alcoholrelated subject matter said ms 
wall it is a very small percentage 
the costa mesa califbased grad night foundation which 
promotes sober graduations is urging orange county members to ask 
shops to pull the cards said foundation director lori warmington 
this is such a national issue now ms warmington said 
incidents like this really fan the flames its inconceivable 
hallmark can be so lacking in sensitivity 
we are certainly concerned and we feel our actions are an 
appropriate response replied ms wall

scheringplough corp says it has 
terminated its revised agreement to buy cooper companies incs 
worldwide contact lens and lens solution businesses for 195 
million 
schering said wednesday it ended the deal because it did not 
believe a speedy review would be forthcoming from the federal trade 
commission 
schering and cooper reached a definitive agreement in march but 
terminated it in may after the ftc threatened a suit the ftc said 
at the time the deal might reduce competition in the manufacture 
and sale of soft contact lenses 
a few weeks later the companies entered a revised agreement and 
submitted it for ftc review 
the transaction would have doubled the size of scherings

texas billionaire h ross perot for help in improving the nations 
postal service 
perot a pioneer in computer services is expected to be asked 
to study the massive postal service and recommend ways to improve 
efficiency 
frank who became postmaster general march 1 reportedly first 
met perot at about that time and began discussing the possibility 
of having the texan help improve postal efficiency 
details of the plan including the cost of perots work were 
not immediately available but is was expected that perot and 
associates from his computer firm would undertake an analysis of 
postal operations including automation and labor relations 
the postal service lost 635 million in the quarter from 
december to march but higher rates put into effect april 3 are 
expected to pull the agency back into the black 
when it was made an independent agency in the early 1970s the 
postal subsidy was eliminated and the service was directed to break 
even which it has done on average over the last decade 
perot founded electronic data systems co a pioneer computer

after three months of lawsuits talk of a 
recapitalization plan and a flurry of political support koppers 
co succumbed to a 17 billion takeover bid from british 
industrialist brian c beazer 
the construction materials and chemicals company one of the 
largest us road repair concerns agreed wednesday to be acquired 
for 61 a share by bns inc a company formed by beazer shearson 
lehman hutton inc and national westminster bank plc 
we set out to keep the company independent but business as it 
is currently conducted didnt give us that opportunity koppers 
chairman charles pullin said after the board unanimously approved 
the merger 
beazers struggle to acquire koppers aroused intense hostility 
in pennsylvania where koppers is a major employer it led to legal 
wrangling in federal court and compelled local members of congress 
to introduce antitakeover measures 
the battle also ignited sharp criticism over shearsons role in 
participating in a hostile takeover while helping to finance it 
koppers congressional allies were quick to note that beazers 
victory does not quiet those concerns 
the question for the congress remains about the role of the 
investment bankers where they were essentially both soliciting the 
deal and providing the wherewithall said rep doug walgren dpa 
that to me is something that we ought to remain concerned 
about said walgren one of 15 congressmen who petitioned the 
energy and commerce committee for an investigation 
its not approprite for securities firms and foreign 
corporations with banking interests to be involved in hostile 
takeovers said rep tom ridge rpa who vowed to support new 
regulations 
ridge and walgren cosponsored a bill barring foreign banks and 
domestic financial services firms from hostile takeovers but their 
efforts like a bill introduced by sen john heinz rpa fell 
short of helping koppers 
a key feature of the merger agreement is job guarantees for 
koppers employees about 7000 salaried workers will be guaranteed 
jobs for at least one year or get a years pay and hourly 
employees are covered by contracts that remain in force koppers 
said 
in addition payments from a 32yearold deferred compensation 
plan will be accelerated to some of koppers 460 active and retired 
managers but nobody is going to get more under this merger than 
they had when koppers was totally independent pullin said 
beazer said he would delay for 45 days plans to sell the 
chemicals business giving managers a chance to make an offer he 
agreed that koppers will remain headquartered in pittsburgh for at 
least three years 
pullin said koppers greatest hope of surviving on its own was a 
recapitalization plan it claimed would compete with beazers offer 
but managements deal collapsed last week when an unidentified 
prospective buyer backed out of purchasing part of the construction 
materials business he said 
koppers opposition to beazer traces back to march 3 when bns 
launched a 45ashare tender offer bns boosted the offer to 60 a 
share on march 25 and sweetened it by 1 during weekend 
negotiations 
koppers won antitakeover injunctions in us district courts in 
los angeles and pittsburgh the california ruling concerning 
antitrust issues fell last week on appeal and the judge in 
pittsburgh offered bns options for overcoming apparent violations 
of securities laws 
on wall street koppers stock closed wednesday at 6050 a 
share up 150 
analysts were satisfied with the 61ashare payout thats a 
good value for koppers shareholders said analyst christopher h 
willis of brown brothers harriman in new york 
in the end pullin insisted that the merger agreement was 
reached with my complete cooperation and that the takeover 
fulfills managements commitment to enhance shareholder value 
now that the drama has ended we are looking forward to 
getting on with the job putting together a world class aggregates 
company and beating the competition beazer said 
the tender offer was extended until june 15

financially troubled coleco 
industries inc says it plans to offer to make its debtholders 
majority owners of the company if they agree to a restructuring of 
the companys debt 
the ailing west hartford toy maker made the announcement 
wednesday as it extended a debtexchange proposal a fourth time 
this time until june 30 
coleco has pinned its hopes for recovery on a plan to exchange 
335 million of debt for 119 million of new debt and 6 million 
shares of common stock 
but that offer launched march 23 was rejected by debtholders 
because it reduced the value of their investment in the company by 
about 65 percent 
debtholders also complained that the plan did not require 
similar sacrifices from coleco stockholders who would have seen 
only a 34 percent reduction in the value of their investment if 6 
million more shares of stock were issued 
in a short statement coleco said it is preparing a revised 
offer that would respond to the concerns of debt holders without 
giving specifics coleco said the new plan would offer more bonds 
nearly as much as the 335 million of original securities that 
would be replacing 
in addition coleco said the new offer would include enough new 
shares of common stock to give bondholders more than a majority 
equity interest in the restructured company with 178 million 
shares of stock outstanding currently that indicates that 18 
million new shares of stock would have to be issued under the new 
plan 
coleco officials have said the company might have to seek 
protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy laws unless 
it can restructure the debt and raise working capital 
colecos other products include alf dolls big wheels plastic 
tricycles and board games such as scrabble and trivial pursuit 
industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the 
nations toy market

merger with riser foods inc that will give riser 63 grocery stores 
and one of the largest wholesale grocery operations in the midwest

into effect june 13 the new company will be the largest retail 
employer in greater cleveland with about 6500 employees and 
estimated revenues of about 1 billion fisher said 
under the merger each share of fisher common stock will be 
exchanged for one share of riser class a common stock and each 
share of preferred will also be evenly exchanged 
even though the special meeting was not delayed corrigan will 
still consider the suit filed by william steiner and charles miller

are scheming to acquire a disproportionately high amount of 
fishers stock at the expense of fisher shareholders

stock prices pulled back today after rising sharply over the 
past two sessions and the nations largest general retailers 
reported may sales that analysts described as lackluster 
at noon on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
which had climbed 10757 points tuesday and wednesday was off 676 
at 205725 
analysts said some traders sold stocks to cash in on the gains 
of the past two sessions they noted that interest rates which had 
fallen earlier this week turned higher today 
in the latest round of retail sales reports major storeowners 
reported their sales were marginally higher or actually fell last 
month 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said its 
overall sales last month rose 51 percent from may 1987 levels 
while sales from stores open at least a year also known as 
samestore sales rose only 02 percent 
k mart corp said its overall sales rose 6 percent last month 
while samestore sales rose only 23 percent jc penney co inc 
said its overall sales fell 12 percent last month and samestore 
sales fell 14 percent 
on wednesday the government reported april gains in its chief 
economic forecasting gauge as well as in factory orders and 
construction spending 
the commerce department reported its index of leading indicators 
rose 02 percent in april following rises of 02 percent rise in 
march and 15 percent in february 
the march increase in the leading index originally was reported 
as a much stronger 08 percent rise however weakness in consumer 
and business borrowing pulled the index down sharply 
the government also reported that orders to us factories for 
manufactured goods climbed 12 percent in april to a seasonally 
adjusted 2187 billion following an even bigger 16 percent march 
increase 
most economists had been forecasting only modest growth in new 
orders of 05 percent in april the biggerthanexpected number 
likely will do little to alleviate concern among some analysts that 
strong demand particularly for exports will trigger greater 
inflation 
the strength in new orders in april came in electrical 
machinery lumber and wood products and in petroleum chemicals and 
paper 
in a third report the commerce department said construction 
spending rose 01 percent in april to an annual rate of 4018 
billion following a 13 percent jump in march and a 04 percent 
february increase 
analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and focused 
on a big 88 percent rise in spending on industrial plants which 
put activity in this sector up 398 percent from where it was a 
year earlier 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers said the gain reflected the boom in export sales 
which has meant plants in many industries are operating near full 
capacity 
government construction fell by 31 percent in april to an 
annual rate of 793 billion residential construction posted a 04 
percent advance in april to an annual rate of 1919 billion while 
nonresidential construction climbed 21 percent in april to an 
annual rate of 944 billion 
in another economic report wednesday the agriculture department 
said us farm exports climbed to a 3year high of 148 million 
tons valued at 33 billion in march a year earlier farm exports 
were 114 million tons valued at 24 billion

he said the new crude can be priced a dollar more a barrel than 
the isthmus brand which previously was the nations superior oil 
mexico also exports a heavy crude called maya 
olmeca is much finer than isthmus and it is superior to 
arab light juarez mendez told local reporters at an oil 
conference on latin american drilling according to the article 
which was published thursday 
mexico he said has the capacity to eventually export 125000 
barrels to 150000 barrels a day of the new crude which is being 
extracted from fields in the southeastern state of tabasco along 
the coast of the gulf of mexico

the englishlanguage daily mexico city news quoted an 
unidentified pemex official as saying the government is not yet 
sure how much light oil it has pemex is still exploring

pemex meanwhile reported that prices to japanese clients for 
isthmus and maya crudes were held steady in may 
the price for isthmus was 1530 a barrel in may to japan the 
same as in april and for maya 1260 a barrel 
this reflects the stability that prevails in the general level 
of prices in the international oil market pemex said in a 
statement 
mexico has a contract with japanese customers to supply 180000 
barrels of oil a day the statement said 
mexicos prices vary according to geographical area the oil

about 200 capitalists converged here thursday for 
a weekend of caviar on the great wall boat rides on an imperial 
pleasure lake and a display of opulence not seen in this spartan 
socialist capital since 1949 
the participants from 21 countries are spending 4300 each to 
enjoy such western luxuries as a masked ball and champagne 
breakfast at sites of past chinese imperial glory 
for 5200 more 100 of them will spend 10 days touring chinas 
most famous scenic spots 
the weekend event dubbed the return of marco polo after the 
13th century venetian adventurer was organized by a french group 
calling itself the committee to save venice and the great wall 
headed by public relations agent daniel vial 
the proceeds were intended to help restore the great wall 
reduced in many sections by weather and war to a heap of stones 
and to preserve the art and architecture of venice italy 
but vial said chinese officials are charging such high fees for 
transportation food site rentals and services that most of the 
ticket receipts will be needed to cover expenses 
he cited a 54000 charge by beijing municipal authorities to 
rent a section of the great wall for four hours saturday so the 
guests can lunch there on caviar and champagne 
im not sure they chinese officials got exactly the concept 
of a charity vial told a news conference this week they 
charge us the maximum 
the number of highpaying guests also is less than half what was 
expected vial acknowledged he said chinese delays in confirming 
arrangements made it impossible to advertise far enough in advance 
the organizers now say any funds to help the great wall or 
venice will have to come from the final event of the weekend a 
sothebys auction sunday of donated modern western and chinese art 
and rare objects 
sothebys has estimated the 67 items including a 1777 bottle of 
cognac a pottery jug painted by picasso and a painting by deng 
lin the daughter of senior leader deng xiaoping should fetch 
695400 to 869000 
however auctioneer julian thompson chairman of sothebys 
international said no one is really sure what to expect it will 
be the first auction of western art in china since the communist 
takeover in 1949 
the cheapest item in the sale is expected to be a sevres 
porcelain cup valued from 215 to 320 about how much an average 
chinese factory worker earns annually 
despite uncertainty about how much will be reaped for charity 
plenty of cash will flash during the weekend 
the guests will be ferried about in black red flag limousines 
entertained by chinese acrobats and singers fed on caviar french 
cuisine and brandy and allowed to party at some of chinas most 
sacred national monuments 
they will boat at the luxurious 19th century summer palace and 
hold a venetian masked ball and watch fireworks at the diaoyutai 
state guesthouse 
they will breakfast at the temple of heaven where the emperor 
offered sacrifices for a good harvest dine in the forbidden city 
the imperial palace in beijing and watch chinese and western 
performers saturday night at the great hall of the people 
the guests gathered at the weekends first event a cocktail 
party in the garden of the glassplated sheraton hotel serenaded 
by chinese musicians playing ancient instruments 
an american businessman asked why he was willing to pay so 
much said with a shrug to have fun 
we are not in beijing now said a frenchman who like the 
american spoke on condition of anonymity its as if we are in 
san francisco 
organizers said several european and arab nobility signed up for 
the weekend but most of those at the party seemed to be involved 
in business with china 
hundreds of police will shield the guests from contact with 
ordinary beijing residents among who the main topic of 
conversation lately has been 30 to 60 percent increases in the 
prices of pork eggs and sugar 
former foreign minister huang hua when asked at the cocktail 
party if such displays of wealth were appropriate in impoverished 
china call income differences an objective reality 
we are trying to make our country prosperous he said we 
need all kinds of help

alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in seoul 
and other cities 
their leader told police hyundai engineering executives offered 
him 27000 to kidnap suh and persuade him to drop his labor

175 the service charge on most of those calls is now 155 and 
lower for shortdistance calls 
the service charge on operatordialed calls charged to an atampt

fmc corp moved thursday toward increased weapons 
sales in the middle east by signing a 1 billion pact to jointly 
produce armored vehicles for turkey and announcing a 400 million 
sale to saudi arabia 
the saudi order approved by congress last month represents 
chicagobased fmcs first foreign sales of its bradley fighting 
vehicle and could open the door for similar sales to other friendly 
countries in the region a spokeswoman said 
sure its a possibility said fmc spokeswoman patricia 
brozowski its hard to judge right now what the overall 
potential is but well certainly see what happens 
the previously announced 1 billion deal calling for fmc and 
nurol defense industry to produce 1700 smaller armored vehicles 
for the turkish government is a crucial element of tukeys 
defensemodernization plan said fmc chairman robert h malott 
through participation in this contract fmcnurol will 
contribute to turkeys economic dynamism malott said in remarks 
prepared for an afternoon signing ceremony with turkish prime 
minister turgut ozal in new york 
meanwhile the us economy will benefit from the sale of some 
usproduced components to turkey malott said 
fmc a leader in armoredvehicle manufacturing and technology 
produced the turkish armys exisiting fleet of m113 personnel 
carriers the new contract is for armored infantry fighting 
vehicles which are popular because they can operate in water 
without addon flotation devices and are small enough to be 
transported in c130 class aircraft 
the vehicles have 25mm cannons and the capacity to carry 10 
people at a maximum speed of 45 mph 
the agreement calls for fmcnurol to deliver 1700 vehicles over 
an eightyear period from the joint ventures manufacturing plant 
in turkey the percentage of the vehicles content produced in 
turkey will steadily rise to 73 percent in the last contract year 
malott said 
fmc will own 51 percent of fmcnurol and hold a majority of the 
positions on the joint ventures board he said 
the agreement represents one of the largest joint ventures 
undertaken by fmc which has previously coproduced armored troop 
carriers in belgium italy and the netherlands malott said 
the sale of 200 bradley vehicles to saudi arabia with 
deliveries expected to begin in 1990 expands fmcs customer base 
for bradleys beyond the pentagon for the first time 
the pentagon has purchased about 3400 of the vehicles since the 
early 1980s ms brozowski said 
the bradley touted by malott as the mercedes benz of its 
type but reviled by some military critics is equipped with 
surfacetosurface rocket launchers and 25mmm cannons 
the saudi order also specifies that the bradleys be 
airconditioned

the yugoslav government faced with 
a deepening economic crisis is considering a plan to allow 
citizens of this communist country to buy stocks and securities 
the staterun press reported thursday 
a draft of the reform proposed by a governmentappointed 
comission of about 140 prominent economists and scientists has 
been presented to the federal parliament for debate newspapers 
said 
stocks and bonds would be issued by staterun companies and 
could be purchased by their workers or other citizens said the 
vecernje novosti newspaper 
in this case a shareholder takes over part of the risk of 
managing the company said the report 
except for small cooperative and private ventures the majority 
of yugoslav enterprises are owned by the state 
yugoslavias economy a mixture of freemarket elements and 
sovietstyle central planning has been growing at a sluggish rate 
averaging less than 1 percent annually over the past six years 
the reform also calls for the sale or a temporary lease of a 
staterun company to its workers or other citizens in case the 
state is not interested in ownership 
the draft of the reform also indicates that yugoslavia plans to 
gear its economy more to the market to overcome difficulties that 
include a 15 percent unemployment rate a 21 billion foreign debt 
and an inflation rate of around 170 percent the highest in europe 
the government last saturday launched a major austerity program 
that included substantial price hikes wage cuts of up to 30 
percent and a 239 percent devaluation of the dinar the national 
currency 
the program also lifted price controls for about 60 percent of 
goods and services under a price freeze since last november 
as a result yugoslavs have been hit by a new wave of price 
hikes for hundreds of goods and services of up to 127 percent 
food drinks cars rents and air transport were affected by the 
increases 
meat went up by an average 50 percent rents in belgrade by 90 
percent and domestic air travel by 127 percent 
the price hikes are bound to contribute to a further decline in 
living standards which have already fallen by onethird since 
1980 labor unrest is also expected to grow

eastern airlines and continental airlines are 
being operated safely but labor turmoil at eastern raises the risk 
of safety problems there an investigation by the transportation 
department concluded today 
the report said that a close inspection of texas air corp the 
parent company of the two airlines showed no serious management or 
financial problems but that labor strife at eastern may have a 
future impact on public safety 
as a result of the continuing labor problems the federal 
aviation administration planned to continue close scrutiny of 
easterns operations and former labor secretary william brock will 
attempt to work with eastern management and labor to ease tensions 
faa administrator allan mcartor told a news conference that an 
unsafe condition does not currently exist at either eastern or 
continental 
but mcartor and transportation secretary jim burnley voiced 
concerns that safety may be jeopardized at eastern in the future by 
the extreme labormanagement tensions at the airline 
burnley said that the departments investigation of texas air 
and its two major airline subsidiaries showed no safety problems at 
continental it did however find a serious lack of communication 
between labor and management at eastern 
the department also said it found no evidence that texas air 
corps extensive financial losses last year posed any serious 
financial problems saying the company had adequate resources and 
its management was found to be fit willing and able to run an 
airline 
burnley said that brocks role will be to work for ways to 
deescalate the labormanagement tensions at eastern 
brock said he had been in contact with most of the parties 
involved in the eastern turmoil but that he had not yet developed a 
game plan on how to ease those tensions 
mcartor said that an indepth planebyplane inspection at both 
eastern and continental had not shown anything that would warrant 
extreme safety concerns 
frank lorenzo texas airs chairman repeatedly has blamed labor 
unons at eastern airlines for his two airlines problems accusing 
the unions of waging a campaign against the airline to discredit 
its safety record 
the transportation department announced its twopronged 
investigation of texas air on april 13 including a planebyplane 
examination of easterns aircraft by faa inspectors five days 
later the faa safety inspection was broaded to include continental 
as well 
in conjunction with the announcement of the investigation the 
faa disclosed that it was proposing a 823000 fine against eastern 
because of safety violations found in special reviews of the 
miamibased airline last year 
during the 30day inspections of eastern and continental faa 
officials repeatedly examined each aircraft at airport gates to 
determine if they were following federal air safety requirements 
the separate probe of the parent company focused on possible 
management and financial concerns dot investigators wanted to 
determine if the executives of the houstonbased holding company 
are fit willing and able to operate an airline according to 
federal aviation laws 
there had been pressure from congress for the department to open 
an investigation of texas air in light of the companys huge 
losses including 466 million last year and its continuing labor 
turmoil at eastern 
a resolution calling for a such an investigation gained the 
support of 150 congressmen 
in announcing the special probe officials cited a pattern of 
safety violations at eastern reflected by the latest 823000 fine 
which came 
on top of a 95 million civil penalty from earlier eastern 
safety violations 
the department also had raised concern about recent financial 
transactions involving texas air and eastern including attempts by 
the airline to spin off easterns lucrative northeast shuttle the 
shuttle spinoff has been blocked by the courts 
these transactions raised quetions about whether the managers of 
texas air corp have complied with federal safety and economic 
practices that are required of commercial air carriers under 
federal aviation law dot officials said in april 
eastern airlines and continental airlines are the key airlines 
under texas air corp it also owns rockey mountain airways britt 
airways bar harbor airlines and provincetownboston airlines none 
of the smaller carriers specifically was subject to the dot or faa 
investigations

chicago board of trade and grain futures posted moderate gains on 
forecasts for continued warm dry weather in the midwest 
the soybean market already more sensitive than the grains to

chicago i think the bean rally was due to the rally in meal more 
than anything else 
soybean meal futures posted nearlimit gains with the contract 
for delivery in july closing 730 higher at 253 a ton

west pointpepperell inc announced steps 
to strengthen its poison pill takeover defense thursday a 
little more than a week after it revealed plans by farley inc to 
purchase up to 25 percent of its common stock 
the georgiabased textile company announced that its board had 
amended its share purchase rights plan which allows existing 
stockholders to purchase additional shares at reduced prices in the 
event of a takeover bid the plan is designed to make a hostile 
takeover more expensive 
previously the plan was effective when a person or group 
acquired 20 percent or more of pepperells common stock or 
announced a tender offer under the amendment the threshold is 10 
percent 
pepperell announced may 25 it had been notified of farleys 
filing with the federal trade commission for permission to purchase 
up to 25 percent of pepperells approximately 32 million 
outstanding shares 
farley a conglomerate privately owned by william f farley 
includes in its holdings fruit of the loom inc the underwear 
manufacturer 
pepperell recently became the nations largest publicly owned 
textile company when it acquired jp stevens amp co in a joint 
buyout with odyssey partners inc 
pepperell officials declined to confirm thursdays action was in 
response to the farley disclosure 
but patricia ryan a textile industry analyst with raymond james 
in st petersburg fla said the directors probably took the 
action to protect stockholders if farley does buy a significant 
portion of pepperell stock 
apparently its to dilute the ownership of the outside group 
thats trying to buy stock added kay norwood a textile analyst 
with interstate securities in charlotte nc 
in a statement issued by the company pepperell chairman joseph 
l lanier jr said the amendment will expire in two years if the 10

silver futures prices skyrocketed to sevenmonth highs in their 
largest singleday gain since last september as news of a peruvian 
mine strike and continuing inflation fears unleashed a storm of 
speculative buying 
on other markets other precious metals also advanced sharply 
copper prices leaped grain and soybeans futures posted strong 
gains livestock and meat futures were mixed energy futures were 
mixed and stockindex futures retreated 
the commodity research bureaus index of 21 commodities surged 
325 points to 25308 its highest level since dec 4 1984 
fifteen components gained four posted losses and two were mixed 
the crippling strike at the uchucchacua mine owned by 
buenaventura perus largest silver producer will probably not 
have much impact on world silver supplies analysts said 
but the silver market has lagged behind platinum and gold in 
recent months and news of the strike gave speculators an excuse to 
buy heavily into silver said george anagnos metals analysts for 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
to some extent there was some pentup buying mechanism built 
into the market structure anagnos said 
in addition the broad rise in commodity prices over the past 
several months has fanned inflationary fears prompting many us 
investors to turn to precious metals for the first time since the 
financial markets collapsed in october analysts said precious 
metals tend to hold their value during times of rising prices 
were starting to see more speculative demand here in the 
united states based on the sharp increase in the crb index and the 
strength in the grains and that obviously translates into fear of 
inflation said jacques luben executive director of investments 
for the new yorkbased platinum guild international 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 910 to 10 
higher with the contract for delivery in august at 47150 a troy 
ounce silver was 44 cents to 476 cents higher with july at 7305 
a troy ounce 
also on the comex reports of a strike at southern peru copper 
cos toquepala mine contributed to fears of tight copper supplies 
and helped drive futures prices sharply higher anagnos said 
copper settled 180 cents to 970 cents higher with june at 
10825 a pound 
soybean futures prices surged on the chicago board of trade and 
grain futures posted moderate gains on forecasts for continued 
warm dry weather in the midwest 
the soybean market already more sensitive than grains to 
weather factors because of tightsupply concerns got an additional 
boost from indications the soviet union recently purchased more 
than 1 million metric tons of soybean meal from south american 
processors and was looking for more analysts said 
i think the bean rally was due to the rally in meal more than 
anything else said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
the soybean meal contract for delivery in july settled 7 higher 
at 25270 a ton 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents higher with july at 350 a

july at 819 a bushel 
cattle futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
ideas that cash prices for dressed beef were ready to rebound after 
a recent decline analysts said 
pork futures retreated in anticipation of an increase in hog 
marketings next week as cooler weather moves into the major 
hogproducing states said tom morgan president of sterling 
research corp of arlington heights ill 
hogs sometimes die if they are transported in hot weather he 
said

currency dealers in europe said the dollars rise stemmed from 
the improved us trade performance and firmer us interest rates

german mark swiss franc and french franc and higher against the 
british pound japanese yen and canadian dollar

down against the pound and yen in recent days 
in addition there were unconfirmed reports that several central 
banks including the federal reserve sold dollars early in the

inflationary expectations have been increasing said john

a lungcancer victims intelligent decision 
to smoke despite the known risks of smoking should not be 
secondguessed a tobacco company lawyer said thursday during final 
arguments in a cigarette liability trial 
rose cipollone made an informed choice a choice people in 
this country have a right to make to use a product with 
associated risks said lorillard inc attorney robert northrip in 
the second day of summations 
in a us district court civil suit against liggett lorillard 
inc and philip morris co antonio cipollone contends the tobacco 
companies misled the public about the danger of cigarettes he has 
not specified damages 
mrs cipollone died four years ago at the age of 58 and if the 
jury awards damages it would be the first time a tobacco company 
has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by smokers and 
their families 
another tobacco company lawyer peter bleakley argued that 
people have been talking about the risks of smoking for hundreds of 
years 
people have been claiming that smoking is bad for you that 
its bad for your health that it kills you as long as these 
products have been on the market he told the jury thursday 
people do things all the time they know to be risky 
bleakley who represents philip morris also defended the 
council for tobacco research formed and funded by the tobacco 
companies to study the health effects of smoking he said no 
evidence in the case shows that the scientists on the councils 
advisory were anything but reputable and disinterested 
the companies presented evidence throughout the fourmonth trial 
to support their contention that mrs cipollone was intelligent 
knew of smokings risks through newspaper articles and warnings 
from relatives and made a strongwilled choice to smoke 
its our position that smoking was her decision to make and 
we shouldnt secondguess her not me not mr edell not mr 
cipollone northrip said referring to cipollone attorney marc z 
edell who was expected to make his closing statement friday 
northrip on thursday and liggett attorney donald j cohn on 
wednesday cited testimony by relatives who said cipollone 
constantly told his wife to stop smoking her mother blamed 
cigarettes for her fathers death and two sisters called cigarettes 
coffin nails as youths 
they also cited newspaper articles relating charges about the 
dangers of cigarettes 
earlier thursday northrip focused on medical testimony by 
physicians who treated mrs cipollone pathologists who studied her 
cancer and cancer experts 
he noted that physicians for the defense and the plaintiffs 
disagreed over what kind of lung cancer killed mrs cipollone 
some are statistically associated with cigarette smoking 
small cell carcinoma some are not carcinoid or atypical 
carcinoid said northrip 
edell must convince the jury that cigarette smoking caused mrs 
cipollones lung cancer not that smoking causes cancer in general 
northrip told an 11member panel that will be randomly reduced to 
six for deliberations 
the case was expected to go to the jury monday

researchers say a genetically altered carp that 
grows up to 20 percent faster than normal could mean billions of 
dollars for the fish industry but a critic says the carp would 
wreak havoc if released into lakes and streams 
scientists from johns hopkins university here and auburn 
university in alabama inserted a gene from rainbow trout into carp 
eggs creating a fish that grows more quickly 
the potential of doing this in other fish could mean billions 
of dollars worldwide dennis powers chairman of the biology 
department at johns hopkins university said thursday if you can 
get organisms to grow faster and improve efficiency it will bring 
down the price to the consumer 
the technique could eventually be applied to catfish a 300 
millionayear industry in the south powers said 
however a leading critic of genetic engineering 
washingtonbased lobbyist jeremy rifkin said if the carp are put 
into the natural environment that could dramatically change and 
disrupt marine life 
if the altered genes are transmitted to other generations they 
could overtake the environment said rikfin president of the 
foundation on economic trends 
but powers said the fact that the fish need substantially more 
food means they would likely starve if released into the 
environment rather than being raised at a fish farm 
powers cautioned that the experiment is just a preliminary 
study and said he and his colleagues have not yet determined 
whether the altered gene can be passed on to future generations of 
carp 
the scientists injected a gene from the pituitary gland of 
rainbow trout into carp eggs the gene produces additional growth 
hormone which regulates the growth of the fish 
the technique for putting the gene into the carp eggs is still 
imprecise with only 20 successes in 10000 attempts the 
scientists hope to produce more altered carp before publishing a 
study 
rex dunham a fisheries geneticist at auburn university said 
there was no particular reason for choosing a donor gene from 
trout except that it was more interesting to try a gene from a 
different species he said he thought the same result could have 
been achieved by inserting an extra carp growth hormone gene 
powers and the two other scientists involved in the experiment 
dunham and thomas chen a molecular biologist at the center of 
marine biotechnology at john hopkins have asked the us 
department of agriculture to allow them to release the carp into 
experimental ponds to see how the fish fare outdoors 
powers said the fish would be isolated and would not allowed to 
escape from the holding ponds to lakes and streams but rifkin said 
there is not enough assurance of that and wants the petition denied 
chinese scientists last year proved that genes from other 
animals can change the physical and chemical processes in fish 
scientists have also successfully mixed genes from different 
species in warmblooded animals such as rodents and livestock and 
microbes and plants

the securities and exchange commission sought a 
court order thursday to force highliving investment adviser 
roberto c polo to produce business records 
the sec action accused polo 37 and his private asset 
management group inc a registered investment advising firm of 
failing to keep books and records as required by federal securities 
law 
the agency launched an investigation following published reports 
last week that some of polos clients are suing him in state court 
alleging that he diverted 110 million from their accounts to 
support a lavish lifestyle 
the day after a may 26 wall street journal article on the 
lawsuits against polo federal officials went to check the books of 
private asset management at the fifth avenue address listed on 
public documents as the firms offices 
instead they found miguel cruz international a fashion design 
firm owned by polo and were told the investment adviser business 
had moved to geneva switzerland sometime in 1986 
the manager of miguel cruz also told federal officials 
according to court papers that all of the investment records had 
been moved to switzerland and that she and other cruz employees had 
not been paid in several months 
in its civil complaint filed at federal court in manhattan the 
sec claimed the withholding of books and records thwarted the 
commissions efforts to check whether the law had been broken 
in other court papers charles padgett associate regional 
administrator for the sec in new york said the agency had been 
unable to locate polo or learn who his current attorney is 
the frontpage article in the wall street journal described the 
cuban born polo as a voracious art collector with an expensively 
furnished apartment in paris 
according to the article 13 of polos investors filed civil 
suit in new york state court claiming he diverted 110 million 
from their accounts a state court has barred him from disposing of 
his assets french authorities have seized the paris apartment and 
swiss and french police are searching for polo on financial fraud 
charges in switzerland

eli lilly amp co has not ruled out a sale of 
its herbicide spike to the state department for aerial spraying 
of coca crops in peru a house subcommittee chairman said thursday 
rep glenn english whose house government operations panel is 
reviewing the us battle against illegal drugs said the use of 
the chemical is still possible even though lilly has expressed 
environmental and safety concerns 
english who spoke wednesday to lilly officials did not repeat 
his wednesday statement that the indianapolisbased corporation was 
a deserter in the war on drugs 
the oklahoma democrat used that critical description after ann 
b wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters complained to the subcommittee that the company 
refused to cooperate in the coca spraying program 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley also had said lilly 
apparently was worried about possible retaliatory measures by 
traffickers or terrorists 
speaking at a hearing thursday english said lilly officials 
have objected to use of the chemical tebuthiuron sold under the 
name spike because they have not done the proper testing of 
application by air over a wide section of countryside they have no 
data they have not seen data from the state department and 
cannot assume responsibility or liability 
but he added we will continue discussions we need to acquire 
a herbicide against coca bushes as quickly as possible at this 
point my own perception is the door is open discussions will 
continue and hopefully a solution can be found to this particular 
problem 
later in an interview english expanded his remarks to say 
there had not been proper aerial testing in the coca producing 
region of peru where the chemical would be sprayed he said the 
area has considerable groundwater and therefore is much different 
from the dry brush areas where the herbicide is used in the united 
states 
english added that the company also was concerned that the coca 
area in peru may not be in friendly hands and you may not have a 
pilot totally concentrating on the accuracy of spraying 
ted mckinney a lilly spokesman had no immediate comment on 
englishs statement on thursday 
but he did say the chemical is applied both by air and on the 
ground in the united states 
he described spike as a broadspectrum soilapplied 
herbicide for brush and weed control on noncropland pasture and 
rangeland the herbicide is approved for use in grazing lands 
wildlife openings along ditchbanks and utility rights of way it 
is safe for humans livestock wildlife and the environment when 
used according to label directions

the suzuki samurai a popular sport utility 
vehicle tends to roll over in sudden turns and should be banned 
the publishers of consumer reports magazine said thursday 
that car literally trips over its own feet and i wouldnt 
want to be in it said r david pittle technical director of the 
nonprofit consumers union which publishes the monthly magazine 
in an article scheduled to appear in its july issue consumer 
reports labels the japanesemade samurai not acceptable the 
first time it has given such a rating to a car in 10 years 
american suzuki motor corp based in brea calif defended its 
vehicle 
the samurai was thoroughly tested for safety including 
stability and handling prior to its introduction into the united 
states said doug mazza vice president and general manager of 
american suzuki motor corp 
we have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and 
stable vehicle he said thursday 
consumers union filed a petition with the national highway 
traffic safety administration asking that the agency change its 
regulations to ban the samurai which the petition called wholly 
unsuitable for consumer use 
a similar petition alleging the samurais rollover problem was 
filed in february by the center for auto safety a nonprofit 
washingtonbased consumer group the government has yet to act on 
that petition 
both petitions demand that a stability standard for vehicles 
that would let the government ban any car that has an undue 
propensity to roll over 
consumers union said the samurai is the first car out of 349 
tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine 
accidentavoidance test in which cars are made to swerve to avoid 
an obstacle in the road 
at a news conference consumers union officials showed a 
videotape in which the samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to 
roll over when it suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph 
the car did not roll onto its side because it had been equipped 
with armlike extensions to avoid a rollover pittle said the 
extensions actually improved the cars stability by lowering its 
center of gravity 
the samurais major competitors the jeep wrangler the jeep 
cherokee and the isuzu trooper were shown making the same maneuver 
without losing stability at speeds over 40 mph 
we are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the 
samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over mazza said but 
the real results of the samurai safety is proven on american roads 
everyday 
between november 1985 when the samurai was introduced and the 
end of april 1988 there have been 154675 samurais sold in the 
united states the cars have a suggested retail price of about 
8500 
according to the national highway traffic safety administration 
there have been 44 reported samurai rollovers involving 53 injuries 
and 16 deaths 
nhtsa spokesman ron defore said he could not comment on whether 
the suzuki has a higher rollover rate than its competitors but 
said utility vehicles generally have a fatality rate three times 
that of lightduty vehicles such as small pickups and that 
rollovers account for twothirds of the fatalities in utility 
vehicles 
defore said drivers of utility vehicles such as the samurai tend 
to be younger and more adventurous than the average driver of a 
passenger car and therefore are more prone to accidents 
in its statement suzuki said that in all of the accidental 
deaths involving the car police found that serious driver errors 
led to the accidents 
the company also said it believes the attacks on the samurai may 
have been triggered in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster 
public opinion against suzuki and perhaps the entire sport vehicle 
industry 
suzuki also said it believes it has been targeted because the 
samurai is the leading imported sport utility vehicle from japan 
and has gained tremendous media attention because of its uniqueness 
and affordability 
the company said it would continue trying to determine the 
original source of allegations against the vehicle and why the 
company is being singled out it will then consider legal action 
it said 
the most famous vehicle rollovers involved the jeep cj5 and cj7 
which the wrangler superseded in 1986 chrysler corp which bought 
american motors corp in august inherited liability for lawsuits 
seeking nearly 11 billion in damages caused by jeep rollovers

farmers insurance group inc which is 
fighting a hostile 45 billion takeover offer by batus inc 
postponed thursdays scheduled announcement of the results of a 
shareholder vote on the issue 
counting of the proxy vote taken at farmers annual meeting may 
20 was incomplete said charles l schultz senior vice president 
for finance 
the annual meeting was reconvened thursday in the expectation of 
announcing the count then adjourned until june 10 when results are 
expected to be available schultz said 
the tally conducted by corporation trust co of america was 
difficult because both sides in the protracted fight sent out 
numerous statements seeking shareholders permission to cast their 
votes in proxy he said the counting firm based in delaware has 
yet to offer a preliminary count 
its not a surprise it is simply a question of the mechanics 
of making a count when the two sides are sending out repeated

a 21yearold hollywood feud between 
scriptwriters and directors over who gets top credit for a movie is 
flaring anew over a tactic writers are using in their bitter strike 
against movie and tv producers 
negotiations between the writers union and the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers representing management 
were scheduled to resume friday following an unsuccessful 
ninehour session wednesday 
in making a separate labor peace with 80 small producers this 
week the writers guild of america used a contract that requires a 
film be credited to the writer rather than the director 
the directors guild of america on thursday threatened legal 
action against producers who sign the unions model contract which 
also allows writers to encroach on directors prerogatives in 
several other areas 
the warning by the directors guild made in an advertisement 
published in hollywood trade journals is the latest complication 
in the writers 13week strike which has already forced delays in 
the start of fall television season 
the writers independent contract with small producers who have 
broken ranks with the management group gives writers possessory 
credit the right to have their name associated with the film 
title 
other objectionable provisions said directors spokesman chuck 
warn require meaningful consultation with the writer on choice 
of director actors and location and give the writer a voice on 
script changes made during filming 
warn declined to discuss possible legal action other than to 
say directors lawyers were studying the matter the unions fought 
in court over possessory credit in 1967 and the directors won 
writers guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden refused to comment on 
the directors threat or the possessory credit issue 
it shows their demands are not realistic herb steinberg a 
spokesman for the producers said of the writers theyre just as 
unrealistic when it comes to the residuals for onehour shows and 
foreign production he continued referring to the two main 
issues in the strike 
the independent producers who have signed independent contracts 
with the union employ only about 100 of the unions 3000 active 
writers steinberg said 
the writers guild called the strike march 7 largely because the 
producers sought to reduce their compensation for reruns of 
onehour television shows with the demand for reruns of onehour 
shows slipping the producers sought to tie the writers payments 
called residuals to a shows success in reruns

court to delay the 17 billion sale of koppers co to an

materials and chemicals company when koppers agreed earlier this 
week to be acquired for 61 a share by bnc inc a company he 
formed with shearson lehman hutton inc and national westminster

in court papers filed thursday the city argued it should be 
allowed time to review the latest findings in the case before an 
injuction blocking the sale is lifted 
mayor sophie masloff sharply criticized koppers saying i 
think they sold us down the river i thought we had an agreement 
with them that there wouldnt be a sellout yet but apparently they 
didnt pay any attention to that

employees the company has in the pittsburgh area all but 40 of 
koppers local workforce is attached to chemicals operations beazer 
plans to sell
