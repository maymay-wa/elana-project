it looked like win no 2 for the expansion 
minnesota timberwolves and a third straight loss for the roadweary 
seattle supersonics 
minnesota used a 162 spurt to take an 8380 lead and had the 
ball with nine minutes to go but sam mitchell who keyed the 
timberwolves run was called for traveling 
dale ellis followed with a 3point jumper that practically 
deflated the metrodome roof the 21702 fans let out a collective 
groan seattles derrick mckey took over under the basket and the 
sonics used a 194 surge to win 10897 
we needed a basket desperately said ellis who has made more 
3pointers 486 than any other player in nba history we had 
been down the court a few times and had come up emptyhanded i 
like to take shots in times like that i feel 3pointers are 
highpercentage shots 
threepointers are like dunks they can deflate an opponent 
theyll give up for a short spell and thats all it takes 
its all it took for mckey to take over he scored 10 of his 32 
points during the decisive rally 
he broke our backs wolves coach bill musselman said we 
tried everybody on him it was tough to match up with him 
said minnesotas tony campbell we went ahead then this guy 
started making everything he shot from his ankles and it went in 
seattle led 7867 with 233 left in the third quarter but 
mitchell scored eight of his careerhigh 31 points and campbell 
added six of his 30 during the run that gave the timberwolves their 
threepoint lead 
ellis 3pointer was the first scoring of the fourth quarter for 
the sonics who had committed turnovers their first five times down 
the court 
mckey followed with a 10footer michael cage dunked and xavier 
mcdaniel made a short jumper before mckey scored eight straight 
points to complete the spurt for a 9987 lead 
seattle coach bernie bickerstaff said it was just a matter of 
getting his starters back in the game he felt it was necessary to 
give them some rest after thursdays fiveovertime loss at 
milwaukee and saturdays 109102 defeat at chicago 
that was the only difference i could see he said when 
players are fatigued they revert to sloppy playground basketball 
the team could have made excuses but they responded they executed 
excellently down the stretch ellis hit his 3pointer and we 
exploited derrick inside 
mcdaniel added 26 points for the sonics whose three victories 
this season include two over minnesota 
before the loss at chicago dropped its record to 23 seattle 
hadnt been under 500 since nov 30 1988 
for minnesota the defeat came two days after it beat 
philadelphia for its firstever victory 
cage had 12 of his 18 points and 10 of his 16 rebounds in the 
first half as the sonics took a 5849 halftime lead

dont bulldoze the berlin wall just yet says 
a california businessman who wants to buy it and sell chunks for 
souvenirs 
barry stuppler a precious metals and coins dealer said 
saturday he tried to offer the east german government 50 million 
for the wall after watching tv reports of berliners ripping out 
chunks as keepsakes of the day the communist government ended 
travel restrictions 
to be candid with you i think i could merchandise it said 
stuppler president of gold and silver financial group 
stuppler said he hopes to put together an investment partnership 
of about 50 people to quickly raise funds to buy salvage rights 
they the east germans need hard currency and i have an 
interest in spending the money and doing it he said what else 
are they going to do with it the wall anyway 
stuppler said he had called the east german embassy in 
washington dc and was told someone would get back to him next 
week 
an embassy employee who refused to give his name said he hadnt 
heard of stupplers bid but added that the people who would handle 
such a proposal were out of the office for the weekend 
stuppler acknowledged hes unlikely to get title to the wall 
which is already being picked at by souvenir hunters after looming 
for 28 years as a grim symbol of the division of east and west 
berlin 
if he were to succeed he would cut the wall into small chunks 
for sale with each keepsake piece certified as authentic by the 
east german government 
i think direct sale of it would probably be very easy he 
said i think this is a piece of history well worth saving for 
posterity

the attacks but according to civilian sources the attack on 
alvarengas residence left at least one guerrilla dead and at two

the mayors of east and west berlin shook hands 
sunday at a new berlin wall crossing point in a historic meeting 
symbolizing the crumbling of the cold war relic that divided the 
city since 1961 
their meeting came after more than 1 million east germans poured 
into west germany on saturday taking advantage of their 
governments opening of western borders the vast majority intended 
to make a brief visit and then return to the east 
on sunday west berlin mayor walter momper and his east berlin 
counterpart erhard krack met at the potsdamer platz a bleak 
virtual nomans land bisected by the berlin wall 
hours before their morning session east german workers drilled 
a hole through the wall with jackhammers at potsdamer platz 
creating the third new border crossing point since east germanys 
communist leaders announced the end of travel restrictions late 
last week 
momper and krack later left the area for breakfast and talks in 
a west berlin hotel 
the new freedom to travel and other reforms in east germany have 
touched off a wave of enthusiam about the possibility of reuniting 
the two german states divided at the end of world war ii 
however east german communist leader egon krenz on saturday 
dismissed such talk 
the new wave of visitors to west berlin and west germany on 
sunday was expected to exceed saturdays estimated 13 million 
visitors almost 8 percent of east germans 166 million population 
most of saturdays exuberant visitors returned home overnight 
west german border police said 
a core of east german and west berlin revelers kept a joyful 
vigil in front of the brandenburg gate on the western side of the 
berlin wall 
however west berlin riot police vans lined up in front of the 
wall at the brandenburg gate early sunday to try to fend off 
revelers who lit torches and candles in memory of east germans 
killed trying to escape over the wall 
at the friederichstrasse crossing point known as checkpoint 
charlie renowned cellist mstislav rostropovich gave an impromptu 
concert saturday in front of a section of the wall covered with 
graffiti 
police said a 24yearold visitor from potsdam east germany 
went into labor on bustling wuerttembergische strasse and gave 
birth to a girl on the sidewalk to the delight of a surrounding 
crowd 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said he would meet with 
krenz whose three weeks in office have brought a whirlwind of 
change to discuss ways of cooperating in the new age 
however krenz told kohl to forget any ideas of making the two 
nations that rose from the rubble of world war ii into a single 
germany again 
east germanys communist authorities built the 14foothigh 
berlin wall beginning aug 13 1961 to stem a flow of workers to 
the west ironically it was another flight this year of more than 
200000 east germans that forced them to open it 
east german leaders lifted travel regulations and pledged 
greater democratic freedoms after both the exodus and weeks of 
street protests

colleges run by indian tribes have inadequate 
salaries and libraries and often operate out of trailers because of 
eroding federal support according to new study released sunday 
us support for the 24 colleges serving some 4400 indian 
students has been woefully insufficient concluded tribal 
colleges shaping the future of native americans by the carnegie 
foundation for the advancement of teaching 
their accomplishments have occurred despite the federal 
governments benign neglect and a lack of national awareness of 
their merits said the 103page report 
the first and largest navajo community college in tsaile 
ariz was founded in 1968 and has more than 1000 students 
twentythree others have opened in montana arizona north 
dakota south dakota california oregon nebraska minnesota 
wisconsin and illinois most are twoyear colleges 
approximately 90000 indians attend us colleges according to 
federal statistics and nearly all attend nonindian institutions 
many such schools have become more hospitable to indians and at 
least 85 have established indian studies programs according to the 
carnegie study 
nonetheless mainstream colleges have a poor record with such 
students almost 90 percent drop out the report said 
unlike past programs that frequently encouraged indians to deny 
their heritage a central mission of tribal colleges has been to 
help tribes reclaim their cultural heritage wrote foundation 
president ernest l boyer in a foreword to the study 
eleven years ago congress authorized the government to provide 
4000 for each fulltime student at tribal colleges and a lesser 
amount for parttime students the authorized grant per student was 
later increased to 5825 but actual appropriations never 
approached those figures the report by the princeton njbased 
foundation said 
in 1980 when there were only about 1700 students in tribal 
colleges the federal government distributed 5 million under the 
tribally controlled community college act about 3000 per 
student the report said 
by 1989 with enrollments up nearly threefold the 
appropriation climbed to 85 million but the amount generated for 
each student declined to 1900 in effect tribal colleges are 
being penalized for their own success said the report 
federal funding up to authorized levels headed the list of 10 
recommendations in the report which also called for increased 
support from states and private foundations 
many tribal colleges are forced to carry on their work in 
trailers and abandoned government buildings that other colleges 
would have hauled away or bulldozed over 20 years ago it said 
such poor facilities not only restrict learning but also make 
a powerful statement of neglect said the study 
the report the first to examine the work of tribal colleges 
was written by paul boyer a journalism instructor at california 
state university at sacramento and comes at a time of heightened 
attention to the plight of indian education 
two foundations the macarthur foundation and us west were 
scheduled to announce multimilliondollar grants to aid tribal 
colleges and other indian institutions at a news conference in 
washington on monday 
last month us education secretary lauro f cavazos announced 
plans for an indepth study of indian education the joint study by 
the education and interior departments will review the 
effectiveness of government programs affecting indian education he 
said 
tribally controlled colleges were spawned in the midst of the 
1960s civil rights era when indians and other minority groups were 
actively rejecting assimilationist arguments and demanding a voice 
in running institutions affecting them 
since their beginnings many tribal colleges have offered 
tutoring in basic skills and extensive counseling at some faculty 
and administrators visit the homes of students who start missing 
classes 
tribal colleges offer social and economic services to entire 
indian communities many offer adult education or work with local 
businesses to enhance the local economy 
typical students are older than the average college student 
female and living on reservations at fort berthold college in 
north dakota for example the average student is 33 many come to 
tribal colleges failing at traditional colleges 
college presidents are nearly all indians and all colleges are 
chartered and controlled by tribal advisory and governing boards 
but most faculty are nonindian and low pay and isolation have 
led to a high turnover rate the report found 
twelve are fully accredited and eight are candidates for 
accreditation according to the report 
clearly tribal colleges are not marginal institutions that 
have been given a break it said

west german marks about 55 in welcome money for other 
things like buying watches and electronic goods at shops in the 
same area 
but its a real shame they can get only 100 marks said a 
clerk at an electronics store

a district magistrate on sunday blocked 
construction of a hindu temple that has ignited violent protests by 
moslems who claim the project infringes on their holy land a news 
agency said 
press trust of india said the fundamentalist hindu group trying 
to build the temple at ayodhya 325 miles southeast of new delhi 
had agred to delay construction pending discussions at a religious 
convocation in january 
at least 300 people have been killed in hindumoslem riots in 
india since midaugust when the world conference of hindus vowed 
to build the temple on a site occupied by a 16th century mosque 
the foundation of the new temple was placed friday about 120 
feet in front of the babri masjid mosque whose name honors babar 
one of the mogul conquerors who introduced islam to india 
the ceremony touched off attacks on hindu temples and shops 
saturday in two neighboring moslem nations bangladesh and 
pakistan which were part of india before 1947 when the former 
britishruled subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines 
into independent nations 
more protests erupted sunday in lahore pakistan hundreds of 
pakistanis lined a major street chanting slogans and rattling 
placards in opposition to the temple 
moslems and hindus both claim the temple site is sacred to their 
religion hindus say the mosque was built atop an ancient hindu 
temple marking the birthplace of lord ram one of the most popular 
gods in the hindu pantheon 
the areas district magistrate rs srivastava was quoted 
sunday by press trust of india as saying he could not give the 
hindus permission to continue digging at the site as long as the 
matter was pending in court 
press trust said the hindu group building the temple vishwa 
hindu parishad had agreed to halt work temporarily 
it quoted the groups general secretary ashok singhal as 
saying a decision on the next course of action would be made during 
a hindu conference in allahabad on jan 27 
singhal said last week his group would not try to demolish the 
mosque but wanted to remove it intact and honorably from the 
site 
moslems say this would set a bad precedent since they say there 
are at least 316 other mosques in india that hindus claim are built 
on hindu holy places 
pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto on saturday denounced 
the planned temple as a willful desecration of an islamic holy 
place an indian foreign ministry spokesman promptly accused her 
of malicious meddling in indias internal affairs 
saudi arabia and iran also have criticized the indian government 
the dispute has become a chief issue in prime minister rajiv 
gandhis reelection campaign on saturday indias most 
influential islamic clergyman syed abdullah bukhari urged moslems 
to vote gandhi and his congress party out of office 
india has more moslems than any other country in the world 
except indonesia even though indian moslems form only 11 percent 
of the population of 880 million they traditionally have voted for 
the congress party so their alienation could prove crucial in the 
elections on nov 22 24 and 26 
india has had a secular government but it has always been headed 
by hindus who make up 82 percent of the population

hereford cathedral has accepted a 48 
million offer partly financed by oil heir john paul getty jr to 
keep a unique 13th century map of the world off the auction block 
the cathedral announced 
dean peter haynes said saturday the cathedral in hereford 
western england had agreed to a package of 16 million from getty 
and 32 million from the statefunded national heritage memorial 
fund 
he said the money will be used to build a new museum on 
cathedral grounds and set up a trust to safeguard the map and 
ensure it is never sold 
the plan is to be announced formally monday 
the mappa mundi which shows jerusalem at the center of a flat 
world is considered a national treasure its name means map of 
the world in latin 
the dean and the cathedrals governing authority announced a 
year ago that the map would be auctioned off possibly to foreign 
buyers for about 11 million to pay for repairs to the 
900yearold cathedral 
the map was later withdrawn from auction after a national outcry 
an alternate plan to collect money by selling public shares of 
the map raised only 384000 the project was scrapped 
under the latest plan the map will be displayed with the 
cathedrals other main treasure a library of medieval books 
the gain to the cathedral will be that there will be a 
properly constructed building sympathetic to the rest of the 
cathedral haynes told reporters 
the mappa mundi in the past has been simply in the north choir 
aisle and its place in a new building will allow it to be properly 
safeguarded he said 
getty who lives in england has given millions of dollars to 
british institutions his largest gift was 63 million in 1985 to 
buy paintings for the national gallery in londons trafalgar square 
his father j paul getty died in 1976 after creating a us 
oil empire he left behind a fortune of 4 billion

there was one voice of discontent in the chorus 
of praise for east germanys decision to open its borders one 
country that could not share the happiness of germans dancing on 
the ruins of berlin wall 
it was the jewish state 
israel which became home to about 100000 survivors of the nazi 
holocaust had other ruins to remember 
east germanys decision to open the borders to the west came on 
the anniversary of kristallnacht during which the nazis destroyed 
jewish homes stores and synagogues killing 91 jews and sending 
30000 to concentration camps 
the night of nov 910 1938 was named crystal night by the 
nazis for the shattered glass that covered the streets in the dark 
years that followed the nazis killed 6 million jews 
when the jews saw modernday germans toasting champagne in the 
streets they could neither forget nor forgive 
when i watched them on the screen i was happy because of the 
peoples happiness i could feel how happy they were and i told 
myself but these are germans sociologist yehudit richter said 
in an interview saturday 
mrs richters father was among the twins who suffered barbarous 
genetic experiments at the hands of nazi doctor josef mengele her 
mother is a concentration camp survivor 
i have never visited germany and i shall never go there i can 
forgive on a personal level but on the level of society i shall 
never forgive mrs richter said 
leading israeli newspapers and analysts sounded a bitter note as 
they described the events in berlin home to 175000 jews and one 
of the worlds largest jewish communities before world war ii 
about 150 jews live in east berlin today 
maybe germanys reunfication its climb to european 
leadership are unavoidable the masscirculation daily yediot 
ahronot said in an editorial but for gods sake not in our 
generation 
the staterun israel television interrupted saturdays flow of 
pictures from germany to interview gershom schocken the elderly 
editor of israels haaretz newspaper 
its very important that germany stays divided he declared 
in the 20th century germany twice brought incomparable disasters 
upon the world 
the german people of today seek peace they are cultural and 
friendlybut we cannot ignore the german potential that 
implemented itself so terribly upon the jews and other people one 
must hope such things would not be repeated in history but we 
cannot forget them 
shlomo aronson a germaneducated political scientist from the 
hebrew university agreed 
my only doubt about reunification is the historic tendency of 
germans young and old to lose control once they are 
powerful he said this is the thing that jews and especially 
the israelis have to be conscious of in this sense we do have a 
right to be sceptical 
that skepticism was reflected in a cautious statement by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir who praised the changes in eastern europe 
but said they could be dangerous 
what is happening today in eastern europe is an earthquake 
they have not reached stability yet and that period of 
instability carries many dangers said shamir whose parents 
perished in the holocaust 
israel has never had formal contacts with east germany because 
of its denial of responsibility for nazi germanys crimes ties 
with west germany israels secondlargest trading partner after 
the united states experienced many upheavals 
a reparations accord came in 1952 followed by the establishment 
of diplomatic relations in 1965 israels ambivalence toward west 
germany reached its peak in 1981 when thenpremier menachem begin 
told parliament 
for what happened to the jewish people in the 1930s and 1940s 
in europe the entire german people is responsible 
no israeli leader repeated such a claim since but many israelis 
share the feeling 
we see the wave of history flooding eastern europe 
columnist yosef lapid wrote in the daily maariv and find 
ourselves divided between our human identity and our jewish 
destiny

the spectre of a reunified germany awakened by the 
opening of the berlin wall last week haunts frenchmen who remember 
german troops marching across the eastern frontier at the beginning 
of two world wars 
it seems to me that whenever the germans are united they are 
united against us comedian guy bedos told a french radio 
interviewer after the wall was opened thursday 
this anxiety has been the motor driving french efforts to 
integrate west germany into a fully federal europe unified 
economically politically and perhaps militarily after 1992 
france italy and others believe that bringing west germany 
firmly into a tightly organized european community will keep it 
from pursuing its own interests as it did in 1870 1914 and 1939 
france the current head of the 12member european community is 
bound to place events in germany at the center of talks among heads 
of state at the european summit in strasbourg next month 
the summit was expected to be a showdown between the conflicting 
visions of european unity held by french president francois 
mitterrand and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
but last weeks events are likely to fuel a common desire to 
find compromise on issues such as monetary union and a european 
social charter and to move quickly toward completing the plan for 
unification 
french leaders friday urged that the european community members 
open their borders with the same speed as shown by east german 
officials in opening the wall splitting berlin 
democratization should be pursued first of all within east 
germany itself said former conservative president valery giscard 
destaing now a member of the european parliament and during 
this period i hope we will not lose time in pursuing our own 
union 
french angst is fed by the knowledge that west germany big and 
powerful with a population numerous and industrious already is a 
formidable force 
in the first half of this year the countrys gross national 
product blasted ahead at a 46 percent annual rate the quickest 
rise in 13 years exports for the first seven months of 1989 were 
18 percent higher than last years record pace 
west german business interests reach into all corners of europe 
and in many markets it is japans main competitor 
if joined with east germany the nation would have more than 80 
million people out of a total western european population of about 
320 million and a gross domestic product almost as big as britains 
and frances combined 
it would have the biggest army in europe outside the soviet 
union a fact that has not gone unnoticed in paris 
relations with germany have been since the beginning of the 
century a major problem wrote political observer alain 
peyrefitte in an editorial in the conservative daily le figaro 
the two germanys divided between nato and the european community 
on the one side and the warsaw pact on the other furnished a 
solution to the problem 
all of this is now in question and the balance of power 
is about to be upset he wrote 
west germany is already the chief western trading partner of the 
soviet union and its east bloc allies and it is well positioned by 
a number of factors including language to benefit from the new 
freemarket economies emerging in poland and hungary 
france like other european community members worries that west 
german attraction to the east will dampen its enthusiasm for 
european integration 
jacques delors president of the european commission has said 
he fears west germany might be tempted by a destiny other than 
the construction of europe 
delors met behind closed doors in brussels on friday night with 
the 17 european community commissions to discuss german 
reunification the first debate ever held on the possibility 
discussions focused on ways to incorporat east germany and 
possibly other east bloc countries into the common market 
framework

the election victory of moslem 
fundamentalists who call for an alcohol ban greater segregation of 
the sexes and more islamic teaching in schools has alarmed many of 
the countrys christians 
the moslem brotherhood captured two seats in this halfchristian 
hilltop city of 95000 people where church spires and mosque 
minarets dot the skyline 
to the consternation of many christians the third seat was won 
by dr saad haddadin a christian who campaigned under the slogan 
islam is the solution he denies receiving brotherhood support 
moslem activists captured at least 34 of the 80 parliament seats 
in wednesdays election 
christians make up only about 6 percent of jordans 3 million 
people but their rights of worship and their customs traditionally 
have been protected 
christian women in western dress orthodox priests in black 
robes liquor stores and ancient churches are common sights in the 
steep narrow streets of madaba 25 miles southwest of the capital 
amman 
on a nearby ridge to the west is mount nebo where the bible 
says moses first saw the promised land and where he was buried 
under jordans election system madaba has one of the nine 
parliament seats reserved for christians and 12 candidates 
contested it 
as a result the christian vote was split a dozen ways haddadin 
captured the seat by winning moslem votes with the tacit support of 
the brotherhood 
he was the weakest candidate but he won because of his 
alliance with the brotherhood said engineer aouni twal a 
christian our jesus he said a little bit of wine is not bad 
but this dr saad he refuses to say he wont ban alcohol 
election banners stretched above madaba streets proclaimed 
islam is the solution vote for dr saad haddadin copying the 
brotherhoods nationwide slogan but the winner denied they backed 
him 
since i am a christian i cannot be with the brotherhood and 
they would never accept me haddadin 41 said as he received 
congratulations from wellwishers in the nearby village of main 
although asked several times he refused to say specifically 
whether he supported islamists demands for banning alcohol for 
more sexual segregation and the introduction of strict moslem 
sharia law 
everything that is good for my country i am the first one to 
support it he said 
asked if he thought the christian community in madaba would 
accept the introduction of moslem sharia law he said i dont 
know i cannot say 
middleclass christians in amman worry that the brotherhood 
could increase its influence in the education ministry to impose 
more islamic teaching and islamic dress codes including some form 
of veiling for women 
in what was seen as a move to reassure christians king hussein 
vowed in a postelection news conference that the rights of all 
jordanians are sacred and they are rights that will not be 
affected 
although many christians were visibly nervous following the 
fundamentalists strong showing in the first nationwide ballot in 
22 years some cautioned against assuming there would be radical 
change 
as a christian from the middle east i have no fears whatsover 
of genuine islam said rami khoury a political observer and 
former editor of the englishlanguage jordan times 
what we should be careful of are distorted or exaggerated 
sentiments that impose restrictions reflecting social traditions 
rather than religious dictates

a rocket slammed into a house while 
three generations of a family were having tea sunday killing 13 
people witnesses said it was one of 11 rocket attacks reported by 
the government 
an additional three people were injured in the other attacks 
elsewhere usbacked rebel forces reportedly closed the 
highway again connecting the capital to the soviet union sparking 
new fears of shortages the government denied the salang highway 
was closed but soldiers said buses bound for a provincial capital 
mazaresharif had been turned back and that fighting near the 
salang tunnel was fierce 
the fatal rocket attack occurred at 230 pm in the northwest 
corner of kabul across the street from the continental hotel where 
many foreign reporters stay witnesses said the rocket went through 
the roof of a twostory house and exploded in the living room 
three generations of a family had just sat down to tea they 
said the shrapnel from the rocket killed everybody in the room 
they said 
the united states supplies rockets to the moslem guerrillas who 
have been fighting the sovietbacked government more than a decade 
it could not be immediately determined what kind of missile hit the 
house but people in the neighborhood blamed the united states 
tell the americans that we are sick of this war said a 
woman who lives next door to the stricken house these could have 
been my children and my parents dead here this is not a war for 
freedom it is a war against the people 
the attacks sunday marked the first time in four days that 
rockets have hit kabul on saturday the government claimed it was 
clearing the guerrillas from the hills surrounding the capital 
since june rocket attacks on kabul have killed about 400 
people half the victims have been children according to the 
international committee of the red cross the government says the 
rebels are responsible for the attacks but the rebels deny it 
the frequent attacks are souring the populations once strong 
support for the rebels or mujahedeen who are credited with 
chasing the soviet red army from afghanistan the soviets withdrew 
the last of their troops from afghanistan in february 
before the rockets began the people had hope for a good 
change in afghanistan said trina nawabi a doctor now they 
feel the mujahedeen have let them down 
soldiers with knowledge of the salang highway said rebel and 
government forces were fighting north of the town of carikar on the 
highway they said rebel forces succeeded in shutting down the 
highway near the town of salang 
soldiers said government troops would probably open the road in 
one or two days 
it is always like this said a captain in the government 
army they have it for a few days we have it for a week 
the guerrillas closed the highway for 10 days late last month 
causing prices of flour and gasoline to jump 50 percent because 
supplies could not be driven in from the soviet border 
since it opened again in early november more than 2000 trucks 
have rolled into the capital kabul 
soldiers said thousands of trucks carrying food are waiting to 
head south from hayratan the main depot for goods from the soviet 
union afghan news reports say moscow has sent more than 200000 
metric tons of goods via hayratan since the last soviet soldiers 
withdrew from afghanistan

haagendazs ran out of ice cream bars sunday a 
rare occurrence in november burger king was out of beer by early 
afternoon even cash machines were empty as more than a million 
visitors swarmed through west berlin 
east germans crossing the nowporous berlin wall and west 
berliners drawn to the impromptu international street festival 
bought all the fruit and coffee available and flooded businesses 
from pretzel stands to peep shows 
hordes of east germans grabbed everything from lettuce to 
radios cleaning out stores in west german cities and towns near 
the border from luebeck in the north to hof in bavaria 
city officials restaurateurs and shopkeepers found their 
supplies of goods falling short but their good will appeared to be 
holding out against the onslaught 
bakers rose earlier than usual sunday to make extra batches of 
pretzels and pots of coffee for the chilled but hearty revelers who 
had walked west berlins streets through the night 
crowds of gawking east germans filled the leysieffer 
confectionary store and cafe in the morning discouraging the usual 
wellheeled cappuccino sippers 
klaus meyer a barkeeper at the joe am kudamm disco said 
patrons broke or stole 1000 glasses friday 
the haagendazs shop on kurfuerstendamm street sold all of its 
ice cream bars 
normally we sell two to three a day at this time of year 
yesterday we sold 300 said george shampromario from behind the 
counter 
burger king which had 45minute lines ran out of beer by early 
afternoon and was running out of food as well 
westerners who wanted to join the party risked running short of 
cash 
the automatic tellers that dispense cash along berlins main 
streets were empty of marks although banks were kept open to 
dispense the 100mark 55 gifts to the visiting east germans 
such services to westerners were shut as usual sunday 
the berlin red cross brought disposable diapers and baby food to 
lines of young families snaked along berlins major streets as the

was full before the weekend when well over a million visitors 
arrived each day and that families appealing for a warm place to 
stay overnight had to be put into movie theaters 
the number of subway cars in service was boosted 50 percent but 
it was jammed around the clock 
seventy special tour buses were dispatched to shuttle the 
visitors along west berlins major thoroughfares but they quickly 
stalled in bumpertobumper traffic 
kurfuerstendamm west berlins stylish shopping boulevard was 
finally closed to vehicles late saturday because of the crush of 
pedestrians filling the streets traffic resumed sunday morning 
after the overnight sea of strollers and windowshoppers dwindled 
even berlins seamier attractions proved insufficient to meet 
demand andreas schulz a bouncer at a peep show across from the 
west berlin train station said his employers decision to accept 
the nonconvertible east german mark as payment brought 50000 
customers to the neonlighted establishment between thursday night 
and sunday morning 
long lines also formed at sex shops

insisted that one reason it built the wall was to shield east

the conversion of former secretary of state 
george p shultz has experts predicting others from across the 
political spectrum will join ranks with those who see 
decriminalization as a workable solution to the drug problem 
national drug control policy director william j bennett 
acknowledges that shultz may draw others with him but argues that 
legalization is a dopey idea and a moral disaster that 
wont wash with anyone who has been within five miles of a crack 
house 
nevertheless legalization proponents are trumpeting an october 
speech by shultz that appeared in adapted form in the wall street 
journal as a major step toward moving the onceradical viewpoint 
into the mainstream 
the political mix of legalization advocates is already broad on 
the conservative side are shultz who headed president reagans 
state department and president nixons treasury department 
economist milton friedman and political commentator william f 
buckley the liberal side includes democratic mayor kurt schmoke of 
baltimore a former prosecutor hodding carter iii journalist and 
chief state department spokesman in the carter administration and 
former attorney general ramsey clark 
the liberalconservative definitions keep crumbling 
princeton universitys ethan nadelmann said in an interview each 
is split into libertarian and social control groups 
some legalization advocates say the issue simply needs to be 
addressed while others call for controlled legalization with 
alcohollike regulations for drugs such as marijuana and more 
restrictive rules for more dangerous drugs 
most say president bushs antidrug strategy developed by 
bennett is more of the same law enforcement programs that have not 
worked in the past 
in an open letter to bennett published in the wall street 
journal on sept 7 two days after bush presented the strategy in 
a primetime television address friedman wrote the path you 
propose of more police more jails use of the military in foreign 
countries harsh penalties for drug users and a whole panoply of 
repressive measures can only make a bad situation worse the drug 
war cannot be won by those tactics without undermining the human 
liberty and individual freedom that you and i cherish 
the column by shultz like friedman a denizen of the hoover 
institution at stanford university was less vitriolic but made 
similar arguments 
it seems to me were not really going to get anywhere until we 
can take the criminality out of the drug business and the 
incentives for criminality out of it shultz wrote frankly 
the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to make it 
possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a 
price that approximates their cost we need at least to 
consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs 
shultz declined to be interviewed for this article 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on hearing about 
shultzs column quipped whoa hes been out on the west coast 
too long hasnt he the guy slips into retirement and right away 
he starts saying things that are strange 
fitzwater then reiterated bushs opposition to legalization 
that it is not a moral position for the united states to take 
and that it makes no sense whatsoever 
bennett said in an interview that he understands the legalizers 
arguments and has concluded its a dopey idea 
he acknowledged however that the legal movement is going 
somewhere its going around intellectual salons and the academy 
libertarians and its getting currency with people who want more 
than anything else to be au courant but it doesnt hold up it 
doesnt make any sense its a moral disaster 
given shultzs background and his straightarrow image he 
will carry some people along but he wont carry people along who 
have been within five miles of a crack house anybody who has seen 
the devastation of a crack house and been to a hospital and seen 
the devastation of crack babies bennett said 
said rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control for eight years as 
secretary of state george shultz never said a word about drugs 
no wonder drug control was not a foreign policy priority of the 
reagan administration shultz did not and does not believe in it 
now we learn he wants to give up altogether 
shultzs tenure at the state department coincided with increased 
us interdiction efforts and congressional requirements that 
foreign governments prove their cooperation in the drug war to get 
their full allocation of foreign aid 
despite the criticisms nadelmann said there is a political 
movement growing 
i predict with some confidence that within the next nine to 12 
months youre going to see a lot more george shultztype people 
coming out nadelmann said at a recent conference on legalization 
arranged by the drug policy foundation 
what you are going to have one or two years from now is a 
critical mass of people across the political spectrum across the 
career spectrum across the color spectrum in favor of 
legalization and its going to make it a legitimate argument he 
said

until sunday one of the most poignant sights in 
this city scarred by enmity was that of the rusting tram lines 
running under the berlin wall in west berlin at potsdamer platz 
from a wooden platform nearby visitors peering over the grim 
concrete barricade could see what had become of the square that 
once was the vibrant city center the times square or picadilly 
circus of central europe 
a vast death strip dotted with concrete watchtowers had replaced 
the cafes where playwright bertolt brecht caroused in the 1920s 
where bustling berliners once traded and changed trams there 
was only an eerie emptiness and silence 
on sunday the silence and some of the ghostly atmosphere lifted 
as east german soldiers removed enough slabs from either side of 
the nomansland to allow the mayors of east and west berlin and 
then thousands of their citizens to meet 
for the first time since the wall blocked them 28 years ago the 
tram lines could be seen in full running through into east berlin 
on a cobbled street that survived both adolf hitlers war and the 
ensuing cold war 
perhaps mused an east berlin woman wistfully as she waited 
in the gray mist to cross to the west perhaps therell be a tram 
line running here again soon 
only a week ago that was inconceivable 
we want to look through the brandenburg gate from the other 
side said east berliner wolfgang rosenloecher standing with his 
wife monika 
just last week we were walking there saying to ourselves 
perhaps well get there before we are pensioners but we never 
thought it would happen so quickly 
rosenloecher 62 came here many times between 1951 and 1961 
when the wall was built this was where the drivers of the trams 
changed between the western and eastern zones over there he 
pointed into the nomansland on either side of the wall that 
was the market where the easterners could buy stuff in their 
currency 
and of course he sighed potsdamer platz was one of the 
places where the most happened on june 17 
on that day in 1953 soviet tanks rumbled over the cobblestones 
to crush a workers revolt against east germanys communist 
government 
on sunday such cruel memories were in the past 
east berlins mayor erhard krack walked past the dismembered 
slabs of the wall into west berlin and shook hands with his west 
berlin counterpart wolfgang momper 
in contrast to the quiet orderly crowd of about 1000 on the 
eastern side the 10000 or so in west berlin were in noisy high 
spirits 
let us in we want to go and have breakfast on the alex 
they cried referring to the alexanderplatz square in downtown east 
berlin 
hundreds climbed the wall and swarmed into the former death 
strip watched by bemused east german border guards a longhaired 
rocker dressed in black leather careened around shouting i 
cant believe it the wall has gone 
hundreds of impatient easterners left to seek another less 
crowded crossing 
rosenloecher and his wife didnt budge we used to use every 
opportunity we could to look across to the west climbing the high 
apartment houses or to the top of the cathedral said mrs 
rosenloecher we can wait now

congressional leaders deadlocked with white 
house officials in their search for 14 billion in budget savings 
now seem ready to let the guillotine of the grammrudman law do 
some of the work for them 
the willingness to permanently retain a portion of the 161 
billion in cuts to most federal programs imposed last month by the 
balancedbudget law comes from democrats and republicans alike and 
reverses congressional sentiment that prevailed until recently 
if that becomes the litmus test or quid pro quo for the 
administration agreeing to a deficitreduction bill then 
its not off the table senate budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn said last thursday 
the ranking republican on the senate budget panel pete domenici 
of new mexico said bipartisan talks aimed at finding a way to 
reduce this years projected 116 billion shortfall are moving in 
the direction of a compromise that will have some acrosstheboard 
cuts in federal spending 
the only real question at this point appears to be the degree to 
which the cuts will be left in place as a rule of thumb roughly 
1 billion is saved for each month the cuts are retained 
turning to partial grammrudman slashes for some savings is the 
latest twist to ongoing democraticrepublican efforts to do one of 
two things each side wants to either agree to a deficitreduction 
bill coupled with some savings from grammrudman cuts or to find a 
way to blame the other party if their efforts fail and the full 
grammrudman reductions remain in effect all year 
the balancedbudget law triggered the 161 billion in cuts on 
oct 16 when congress and president bush failed to agree to a plan 
to shrink the deficit to 110 billion at the time the working 
assumption on capitol hill was that the cuts would be rolled back 
when a plan to reduce the shortfall was sculpted 
but after weeks of fruitless searching for a deficitreduction 
deal the grammrudman cuts remain in place bush says hed prefer 
retaining the acrosstheboard slashes to enactment of the 
budgetcutting bills passed by the senate and house which he 
complains contain billions of dollars in phony savings such as 
shifting payments out of the fiscal year 
although the grammrudman reductions have barely been felt so 
far their pain will become more apparent if left intact much 
longer as agencies are forced to save money the law has imposed 
43 percent reductions in defense spending and 53 percent cuts in 
most domestic programs excluding social security and initiatives 
for the poor 
to avoid that scenario democrats want to move a 
deficitreduction measure through congress by thanksgiving that 
restores most of the grammrudman reductions a plan they believe 
puts pressure on bush 
if the president wants to sign it which i think would be the 
responsible thing to do id applaud him said sasser if he 
chooses to veto it thats regrettable and hell have to take the 
consequences of that 
some lawmakers do not see things that way sen bob packwood 
rore ranking republican on the finance committee has been a 
staunch defender of bushs threat to veto an inadequate 
deficitreduction measure and leave the grammrudman cuts intact 
packwood wrote to bush last week that retaining the grammrudman 
cuts is not the worst outcome is the alternative is a 
deficitcutting bill that relies upon budget gimmicks and 
accounting devices contains almost no longterm deficit reduction 
and sets the stage for a true budget crisis next year 
indeed lawmakers are drawing differing conclusions about just 
how damaging retention of the grammrudman cuts will be 
ranking house budget committee republican bill frenzel of 
minnesota circulated an analysis last week concluding that the cuts 
are a mixed bag the defense department could have to pare its 
activeduty personnel by 170000 troops but the federal aviation 
administration would be able to juggle its budget and protect air 
traffic controllers frenzel wrote 
yet rep silvio conte of massachusetts ranking republican on 
the house appropriations committee said the cuts will have 
severe negative impacts on hundreds of programs he wrote of 2 
million farmers facing support payment reductions aids service 
cuts and 250000 fewer pell grants to college students 
one key impediment to congress budget work appears ready to be 
laid aside for the rest of the year next week 
the senate plans votes tuesday and wednesday on a proposal to 
cut the tax on capital gains a plan bush has fought for all year 
if gop supporters of the plan lose as expected they have 
promised to not raise the issue again until next year 
republican insistence on trying to attach the plan to crucial 
budget bills has slowed work on those measures in recent weeks

luella wilsons tiny frame and stooped 
walk are misleading this 91yearold woman who stands to lose her 
home and life savings because of an unusual court case is tough 
in her younger years wilson stood her ground on hunting 
expeditions for coyotes and moose trophies hang in her home to 
prove her success she also ran her familys dude ranch for years 
caring for up to 52 horses until last year 
shuffling around her cluttered home and pointing out prized 
possessions wilson boasts that she once owned a nightclub and 
handled eight bartenders not to mention rowdy patrons 
but wilson fears shes finally met her match in the legal system 
shes uncharacteristically confused tangled in a legal 
nightmare she says is not of her own making but which threatens to 
cost her everything she has collected over her nineplus decades 
wilsons troubles began in 1984 when she gave her greatnephew 
willard stuart 6300 for his 18th birthday to buy a car although 
stuart did not have a drivers license wilson knew that when she 
gave him the money he drove the car 
three weeks later after a night of heavy drinking and smoking 
marijuana stuart drove the car off a bridge a backseat passenger 
mark vince was paralyzed and later had a leg amputated 
the passenger sued wilson saying she knew that stuart did not 
have a license and that he used drugs and therefore was negligent 
in giving him money to buy a car 
a superior court jury agreed ordering wilson to pay the 
passenger 950000 in damages her home has been inventoried for 
sale and her savings locked up by the courts 
the vermont supreme court however says others may share the 
blame with wilson including the dealership that sold stuart the 
vehicle a superior court jury will decide that question in 
december 
he used to be my favorite nephew wilson said last week 
his mother used to get him up in the morning dress him and he 
would come running through my meadow and stay here with me all 
day 
although he still lives nearby wilson hasnt talked to stuart 
since the verdict and has seen him only in passing as he drives by 
her home 
i dont know if he feels so bad about it that he doesnt want 
to talk to me she said when you get into an awful mess you 
dont know how people are going to feel about it 
publicity over wilsons plight has sparked a wave of support 
and her kitchen table is littered with about 50 letters from people 
offering money or assistance 
others around the nation are watching this case because of its 
precedentsetting potential 
they say there would be enormous ramifications if the court 
finds either the dealership or salesman negligent for selling the 
car to someone who did not have a license and was later in an 
accident 
such a ruling could affect banks other car dealerships or 
anyone who lends or gives money to another individual 
the passengers attorney rolf sternberg told the new york 
times recently that the ruling is in keeping with legal doctrine 
that a person who gives a dangerous tool to another is liable for 
any resulting damage and said wilsons claims of poverty are 
exaggerated 
she is not destitute sternberg said the court order said 
her assets are to be frozen except for what she needs to live 
adequately somebody is trying to make it difficult to pick a fair 
and impartial jury 
wilson says the law is wrong that there is no one to blame but 
those directly involved in the accident she believes she is guilty 
only of giving her nephew a certified check and the sole reason she 
was sued is that she is the only one with any money 
wilson who was hospitalized last month after collapsing in her 
kitchen vows to attend court in december saying her failure to 
attend the original proceeding and tell her side of the story may 
have cost her the case 
when you have to walk so far you cant go into a place like 
that wilson said of the courthouse 
for now her world is her home she smiles at the good old days 
even as she awaits the courts decision 
the lesson to be learned if you have any relatives just 
dont give them nothing dont give them any money wilson said

top administration officials insisted sunday 
that the kremlin continues to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons 
although a published report said some deployments had been cut in 
anticipation of an arms control deal 
the fact of the matter is the soviets have continued to 
modernize their strategic forces defense secretary dick cheney 
said on the nbctv program meet the press 
cheney did not flatly deny a report published sunday in the 
washington post that quoted unidentified government sources as 
saying the soviets had stopped producing four new weapons the 
ss18 and ss24 missile the blackjack bomber and the typhoon 
submarine and had suspended work on an aircraft carrier 
the post said the reports apparently based on satellite 
photography conflicted with recent statements by cheney and vice 
president dan quayle that the soviets continued to deploy new 
weapons 
responding to that assertion cheney said the soviets might have 
slowed deployments of some new systems in order not to exceed a 
ceiling proposed for the strategic arms reduction treaty which 
would slash longrange superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 
50 percent 
that treaty is not expected to be the centerpiece of a summit 
planned for dec 23 in the mediterranean sea senior us 
officials have said the start deal might be ready for another 
meeting between president bush and mikhail s gorbachev slated for 
next spring or summer 
cheney said the kremlin was replacing many of its older nuclear 
weapons with more modern bombers ballistic missiles and 
submarines the three legs of the socalled strategic triad 
in effect what i think would be fair to say is that by the 
late 90s even if you have a start agreement the soviets will 
have changed out completely replaced modernized every single leg 
of the triad cheney said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said that despite the 
moderate new tone of kremlin rhetoric the soviet union still 
remains a very heavily armed superpower 
commenting on reports that the soviets had stopped deploying 
ss18s ss24s blackjacks and typhoon submarines baker said 
as far as i know that has not been established 
we do believe that the soviets are in keeping with what they 
have told us reducing their production of conventional weapons 
said baker appearing on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley 
but as yet we do not have firm evidence in my opinion that 
they have begun reducing their expenditures for strategic weapons 
they may have we may be able to establish that later he said 
addressing the broader issue of how the united states should 
respond to changes in the soviet union baker said politically 
the soviet union is saying and acting in a way that does indeed 
make it harder to argue the threat the threat itself in terms of 
military power is still there 
so we really should not disarm until the time comes to do 
so in light of actual soviet actions he said 
cheney did not directly discuss continuing ss24 blackjack and 
typhoon production but said the soviets are deploying a new 
version of the ss18 a heavy strategic missile 
theyve deployed two new ballistic missiles that are mobile 
the ss24 and the ss25 and this year theyve deployed two new 
ballistic missile submarines the sixth typhoon and the sixth delta 
iv so the pace continues he said 
i dont think theres any realistic expectation that the 
soviets will have anything other than a very modern strategic force 
for the foreseeable future he said 
he said that the change in the soviet strategic arsenal was 
not a net increase so much as its a more capable force that is 
to say youre taking out older systems and putting in new ones

the line that carved germany 
into two nations could not have come closer to the farmhouse where 
waleska von hagen was born 
my fathers land was divided down the middle she said 
on sunday mrs von hagen was among hundreds of people from the 
little west german town of wanfried who suddenly decided to push 
across the border to look at the little east german village of 
katharinenberg 
much to the dizzying confusion of border guards hundreds of 
equally curious katharinenberg residents traveled the four miles to 
look at wanfried 
authorities announced early sunday that the road between the two 
border towns would be one of the new crossings opened for the first 
time in three decades 
hundreds of east germans began crossing into west germany to 
visit wanfried and gawk at its relative opulence 
at katharinenberg guards stamped passports or identity cards of 
east germans at a makeshift control point but were overwhelmed by 
the numbers and gave up within an hour 
although the open border was meant more for east germans who had 
been denied travel privileges for 28 years wanfried residents were 
eager to look at their east german sister city 
hundreds of townspeople from wanfried which has 3000 
residents walked up a wooded lane to the wiremesh fence to cheer 
the east germans as they crossed into the west german town 
several east germans on foot waved handprinted signs reading 
freiheit the german word for freedom 
suddenly a crowd of west germans surged forward past the 
guards who watched with stunned looks and began heading east 
now were going to see how you live on the other side said 
one west german to a man walking in the other direction 
you wont find anybody in katharinenberg the east german 
responded they have all gone across the border 
one of the first west germans to reach this village was mrs von 
hagen who said she was born in a farmhouse just over the border on 
the west german side 
she said gen george s patton and a soviet officer met in her 
fathers living room and signed the agreement that drew the border 
for this region 
ive never been able to come here before we were never 
allowed she said looking at the simple village homes 
asked what she thought of the east german village she said 
its like going back 40 years in time 
border guards abandoned any attempt to stop the tide of laughing 
and waving west germans heading to katharinenberg 
you have to have your passport the regulations are still the 
same an east german guard told west germans who bothered to ask 
but at the moment we cant do anything

president daniel ortegas biggest 
problem in his partys campaign to retain power may not be the 
usbacked political opposition but the large number of undecided 
voters 
the results of three opinion polls put the undecided figure at 
35 percent to 46 percent heading into the feb 25 balloting 
this could lend credence to charges by washington and opposition 
groups that ortega this month ended a ceasefire with the contras 
in order to create a crisis and have an excuse to call off 
elections the sandinistas fear they might lose 
the thinking is that if the leftist sandinista government has 
not won support from a clear majority after 10 years in power it 
will be hardpressed to do so in the brief time remaining before 
the general elections 
in all three polls those who said they will vote in the 
elections ranged from 784 percent to 95 percent 
ortega had been leading in most polls except the latest one in 
which publisher violeta barrios de chamorro was favored by 428 
percent of those surveyed to ortegas 213 percent 
still even in that poll 35 percent of the respondents were 
either unsure of who they would for vote or did not answer the 
question the remaining 9 percent favored five other presidential 
candidates from tiny parties 
that poll released last week was conducted oct 2330 by the 
costa rican firm of borge and associates for la prensa the 
nicaraguan opposition daily owned by mrs chamorros family and el 
nuevo herald the spanishlanguage edition of the miami herald 
it surveyed 1284 nicaraguans nationwide and had a margin of 
error of 4 percent 
delegations from the sandinistas and the usbacked rebels are 
to resume negotiations monday at the organization of american 
states in washington 
ortega is intent on having the estimated 12000 contras 
demobilize from their honduran jungle camps before the elections 
the contras have said they will stay put until the elections take 
place 
as an incentive ortega has offered to resume at the end of this 
month the ceasefire he suspended nov 1 after it had been in 
effect since march 1988 
renewed fighting between sandinistas and contras would make 
campaigning impossible but critics say the sandinistas want the 
contras eliminated as a pressure force in order to have a freer 
hand should election results not be in their favor 
two other polls have given ortega the upper hand over mrs 
chamorro 
one poll was conducted oct 27 by the nicaraguan firm eco for 
the central american university in managua in it 784 percent of 
the 4114 people answering said they would vote in the elections 
of those surveyed 365 percent said they would vote for the 
sandinistas 181 percent for the opposition and 418 percent were 
undecided or did not answer the question 
in another poll by the nicaraguan institute of public opinion 
83 percent of the 1157 people surveyed said they would vote 
twentysix percent said they would vote for ortega 21 percent for 
mrs chamorro and 46 percent were undecided or did not answer the 
question 
that poll was conducted sept 27oct 2 
by the same token the percentage of undecideds sends a strong 
message to mrs chamorros 14party bloc the national opposition 
union that nicaraguans do not consider it a good alternative to 
the sandinistas 
that showing of people who pretend they dont know who theyre 
going to vote for is a latin american phenomenon said a latin 
american diplomat of long experience what these people are 
saying is were going to vote for the least bad candidate and 
its the decisive vote in any election 
that also shows clearly the wasting away of sandinista fervor 
over these 10 years this is due to several reasons but the main 
one is their not having been able to solve the socio economic 
problem 
everything will be better the sandinista campaign slogan 
is an acknowledgement that the economy must be improved but the 
promise rings hollow when living conditions are on an unrelenting 
downslide with no apparent end in sight 
ortegas government has been battling hyperinflation with a 
tough austerity program that has slashed government spending and 
laid off more than 30000 public employees this year

negotiations with the soviet union to cut 
nuclear arsenals reduce troops and tanks in europe and banish 
chemical weapons are skipping along without rancor and with no more 
than healthy suspicions 
but the issues are so tough that even goodwill and determination 
have not cleared away all the roadblocks to quick completion of the 
accords 
president bushs confident prediction last spring that the nato 
and warsaw pact alliances could conclude a treaty in vienna to 
reduce armies and armories in europe within six months to a year 
appears to have been an overstatement 
key us government officials attending an arms control seminar 
this week on the eastern shore of maryland rated chances of 
fulfilling bushs prediction as slim 
speaking on condition their names not be used they were equally 
dubious about quickly wrapping up ussoviet treaties to sharply 
reduce longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines and to 
outlaw further production of chemical weapons 
bush has excluded arms control as a major topic at his 
mediterranean nearsummit next month with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev a session being billed as a getacquainted meeting 
one without a set agenda 
but the fulldress summit being planned for washington next 
summer could look like a neareven as well if there are no major 
arms control accords to sign 
and yet a halfdozen well informed officials rated as slim the 
prospects for an agreement by summer it seemed that only 
politeness and loyalty kept them from simply saying no way 
both a conventional forces in europe agreement and a strategic 
arms limitation treaty were described as no more than longshot 
possibilities by next summer by one key official he rated the 
chances of a chemical weapons pact as even slimmer 
and yet by christmas the united states and the soviet union plan 
to be exchanging information about their chemical arsenals and 
production facilities inspections probably will start in may 
the idea is to see that the agreement being negotiated in 
geneva switzerland is not undercut by cheating that means being 
able to detect chemical weapons that can be produced virtually in a 
broom closet and which can be carried in a small satchel 
verification procedures also are being explored for the 
prospective pacts on strategic weapons reductions and on troops 
tanks and artillery in europe 
but no one has found a way yet to keep perfect track of cruise 
missiles carried aboard submarines and surface vessels 
the soviets have agreed to deal with that problem separately 
but that is turning out to be only a procedural shift the pentagon 
will resist severe restrictions on the seabased weapons and the 
soviets who are far behind in the field want to curb them 
when it comes to reducing nonnuclear weapons in europe some of 
the nato allies are turning out to be more difficult in some ways 
than moscow they are not warm to the idea of soviet inspectors in 
their tank plants for instance 
the soviets are described as eager to complete the treaty if 
only to turn their technicians and factories to the production of 
consumer goods 
but they are also trying to retain some 1000 airplanes that 
nato insists are not entirely for the defense of soviet territory 
and therefore subject to limitations 
and bush administration officials are already worried that 
whatever anticheating devices are attached to the three accords 
the senate might decide they are not airtight and block 
ratification

defense minister dmitri t yazov confronted by a 
growing movement against the draft lashed out at antiarmy 
manifestations and ruled out change in conscription rules the 
official tas news agency said sunday 
the report came a day after the latvian supreme soviet in a 
move that carried more symbolic than legal force voted to allow 
alternative service to conscientious objectors in the baltic 
republic 
tass said yazov condemned antiarmy manifestations which 
recently spread in some regions of the country calls to refuse 
service in the army attempts to evade callup into the armed 
forces blockade of callup stations etc 
the tass report indicated yazov was not receptive to proposals 
from groups in various soviet republics to allow soldiers to serve 
only in their home regions he said the draft would continue to 
develop according to the principles of extraterritoriality 
nearly all soviet men between 18 and 25 years old are required 
to serve at least two years in the armed forces students were 
granted deferments and partial exemptions from service this year 
but yazov and marshal sergei akhromeyev president mikhail s 
gorbachevs top military adviser have made clear there will be no 
shift to a volunteer army in the near future 
the soviet unions standing army of about 4 million is about 
halfway through a unilateral reduction of 500000 troops announced 
by gorbachev in december 
yazov cited the baltic region the caucasus republics and parts 
of moldavia where he said antidraft actions were strongest all 
have strong grassroots movements pushing for more independence from 
moscow 
in the caucasus republic of georgia more than 200 youths 
protesting the draft have been staging sitins near government 
buildings in recent days activists said 
the popular fronts of latvia estonia and lithuania are pushing 
for their youths to serve only in the baltics and a small group of 
protesters backing such regional service demonstrated in front of 
the estonian parliament in tallinn over the weekend 
azerbaijani activists charge that too many of the republics 
youths die in the service and latvians and other groups have 
similar complaints 
an empty coffin to symbolize deaths among latvian soldiers was 
brought to the republics supreme soviet parliament during the 
weekend debate on the alternative service law for conscientious 
objectors and mothers demonstrated outside the building said aris 
jansons a latvian newspaper editor 
jansons political editor of the youth paper padomju jaunatne 
said a parliamentarian told him an amendment on alternative service 
is being prepared in moscow but he said it focuses more on service 
in construction battalions and other noncombat units 
speaking in a telephone interview from riga jansons said the 
latvian measure was essentially a gesture to make its wishes 
known because the legislative body does not have the authority to 
change soviet military law 
the presidium of the national supreme soviet last week put 
latvia and three other republics that have passed sovereignty laws 
on notice that they are expected to bring their laws in line with 
national policy and the constitution

rajiv gandhi the prime minister lands 
outside a big town the clatter and windstream of his helicopters 
rotor blades churning up reminders of the power and money he has 
pumped into his electoral district 
raj mohan gandhi a 54yearold writer and political novice 
bumps down dirt lanes in a venerable white sedan telling villagers 
barely touched by the 20th century why they should vote for him 
instead of the prime minister 
its an uphill battle for the challenger even though he is the 
grandson of beloved independence leader mahatma gandhi 
he is unrelated to the prime minister whose name also evokes 
rich pages of indian history rajiv gandhi is the grandson of prime 
minister jawaharlal nehru and the son of prime minister indira 
gandhi 
most people in the amethi parliamentary district are poor many 
are illiterate but they know the power of the office of prime 
minister they know that even if raj mohan gandhi defeats rajiv 
gandhi in this months election raj mohan will be just another 
member of parliament not prime minister 
still there are rumblings of discontent with the government 
despite an impressive construction boom in towns like amethi and 
gauriganj since the last elections in 1984 there are villages a 
few miles away where people wonder why they do not also have 
electricity 
across the road from a modern steel plant farmers wonder why 
laborers were imported from other states for jobs they wanted for 
their sons 
in the larger towns unemployed young men with high school 
educations and engineering degrees talk about corruption and an 
arms scandal that has dogged the government 
however in jais and gauriganj cities of several thousand 
people on a narrow but wellmaintained blacktop road its hard to 
believe anyone except the prime minister is running for the seat he 
has held since 1981 
posters with his portrait are plastered on shops and hang from 
lightposts the orange white and green colors of his congress 
party also the colors of the indian national flag are festooned 
across the streets 
in a 10hour drive through the amethi constituency barely two 
weeks before the election that starts nov 22 and ends nov 26 not 
a single portrait of raj mohan gandhi was spotted the solid green 
banners of the janata dal party he represents were seldom seen 
outside amethi town 
raj mohan gandhi has an answer for this 
in misrauli outside amethi he tells villagers each rajiv 
gandhi poster costs 10 rupees 62 cents for that you could feed 
your families today 
his listeners nod in agreement and say theyll vote for him he 
drives through khushyal village a few miles away on a bonejarring 
dirt road and doesnt stop in his wake though the inhabitants of 
the mud and thatch houses say they too will vote for this tall 
slim scholarly looking man 
susahi tiwari a whitebearded man who says he is about 55 but 
looks 70 explains the main point is electricity we have none 
we have given an application but there is no response 
nearby women from this village of 50 families inveigh against 
the congress party unusual in a region where politics 
traditionally are left to men 
sugar now costs 14 rupees a kilo 38 cents a pound a woman 
in a green sari says waving her forefinger 
but back in amethi town which has a population of about 20000 
rajiv gandhi warns constituents the opposition will hamper the 
progress of amethi 
the district has indeed made progress in 1980 only 330 of the 
1299 bigger villages had electricity today 1254 have 
electricity 
in 1980 the district had 262 miles of paved roads today it 
has 714 miles 
not everyone has a job though 
in sarwanpur on the outskirts of amethi mohammad aftab akhtar 
says hell vote for raj mohan gandhi and the opposition i am an 
engineer but i cant get a job 
his neighbors nod in agreement and when asked why they oppose 
rajiv gandhi they burst into a chorus bofors bofors bofors 
a scandal involving the swedish arms manufacturer has hounded 
gandhi during the campaign the janata dals top national leader 
vishwanath pratap singh and leading indian newspapers have 
challenged the prime ministers assertions that no indians received 
kickbacks in the 1986 contract to buy artillery guns from bofors 
of unemployment satish sharma rajiv gandhis local point man 
says every new industry every project that is set up they try 
to give the highest job priority to the land losers but there 
are some categories of people who have no skills 
raj mohan gandhi in an interview as he motored down the road to 
yet another remote village said even if he doesnt defeat the 
prime minister hes sure hell prevent him from winning by the 84 
percent landslide he got five years ago 
rajiv gandhi continues in power despite corruption that 
would have overthrown a government in the democratic world he 
said 
as for running against a member of indias most powerful and 
longest lasting political dynasty raj mohan gandhi says the 
fact is somebodys got to do it and why not me

one year after its groundbreaking the 
ronald reagan library has far exceeded its 45 million fundraising 
goal and is still looking for donations including 1 million from 
japans sony corp 
the latest palatial presidential library under construction 
atop a suburban hillside 45 miles northwest of the city will also 
be the last of such grand proportions thanks to a bill reagan 
signed while president 
at 153000 square feet the spanishstyle ronald reagan 
presidential library will dwarf even the largest of the 
presidential museums the 100000squarefoot lyndon johnson 
shrine in texas 
presidential libraries are built with private funds and 
presented as gifts to the united states which operates the museums 
at taxpayer expense the national archives and records 
administration will run the reagan library with an annual budget of 
about 15 million 
the presidential library system inaugurated by franklin d 
roosevelt costs taxpayers about 16 million a year 
todays system makes each former president try to outdo his 
predecessor and you end up with huge marble pyramids more fitting 
as monuments to the pharaohs sen lawton chiles dfla 
complained when he sponsored a 1986 bill limiting the size of such 
libraries 
it was reagan who signed the chiles bill limiting presidential 
libraries to a single building of not more than 70000 feet his 
own was exempted 
the reagan foundation refuses to identify donors many of whom 
gave in response to a 25 million directmail and telemarketing 
campaign common in presidential library fund raising 
foundation records show it with assets of 58 million as of dec 
31 1988 the latest figures available said sam williams 
spokesman for the registry of charitable trusts an arm of the 
state department of justice 
however reagan spokesman mark weinberg confirmed last week that 
the foundation recently asked japanbased sony corp for a 1 
million donation 
representatives of the foundation have had contact with a 
number of american and foreign businesses about donating to the 
library and sony is one of them he said 
the foundation wants 1 million worth of video equipment to 
enhance the librarys value as a research center but sony 
spokesman tsutomu sugiyama said a decision hadnt been made 
the reagans want this to be the best of the presidential 
libraries state of the art said weinberg he said organizers 
are seeking funds in excess of the initial 45 million goal so 
there will be endowment money to invest and bring income to the 
library 
the former president and his wife nancy were the hosts in 
japan last month of the fujisankei communications group a japanese 
media company reagan was reportedly paid 2 million for that trip 
which included two speeches and attendance at a concert to benefit 
the reagan library 
the reagan library located on a 100acre site above the ventura 
county bedroom community of simi valley will be the repository for 
an expected 62 million papers exceeding richard nixons record 44 
million 
set to open in the spring of 1991 the library will include 
underground storage a museum and research materials depicting the 
reagan administration and events during his washington years 
reagan helped break ground nov 21 1988 for the library that 
will house his white house papers saying at the time he hoped 
historians and scholars examining his eightyear presidency would 
judge our efforts well 
meanwhile about 70 miles to the east the richard nixon 
presidential library is about halfcompleted on a site in the 
orange county community of yorba linda dedication is set for june 
21 1990

he is unmarried and has no children he grew 
up in a family in which the mother stayed at home and he is 
tantalizingly close to a legislative victory on national child care 
legislation 
sen christopher dodd dconn perhaps an unlikely candidate to 
champion the child care cause is now closer to his goal than he 
has been in the three years since he convened hearings on how 
working parents can raise their children 
a housesenate conference committee worked into the night just 
before the long weekend and agreed on a 12 billion bill to 
subsidize child care for lowincome families proponents hope to 
send it to president bush before the thanksgiving recess 
dodd has had to clear some formidable obstacles to get to this 
point senate republican leaders said the bill was just another 
layer of government interference bush said he preferred tax breaks 
for poor families rather than subsidies and conservative 
thinktanks even accused dodd of being against the traditional 
family the kind he grew up in west hartford 
dodd responds with an admission ill state it over and over 
again the best child care is parental care 
he also has a problem if you could tell me theres some 
terrific bill you could introduce to somehow cause mothers and dads 
to stay together on one income to take care of everybody i mean 
im all for that my problem is thats not the real world today 
now the issue is what happens to that kid if he doesnt have 
the alternative i had and no matter how much i would like him to 
have that that doesnt cut it 
the legislation would increase direct federal child care 
subsidies to low and moderateincome families by 12 billion in 
1990 and by up to 85 billion over the next five years under the 
compromise agreement more of the money would go to rural areas at 
governors discretion and states could issue vouchers that parents 
could use to pay for day care services provided by churches 
the federal government now allots between 400 million and 1 
billion per year in block grants to states for child care 
subsidies the legislation would add 750 million to that pool and 
require that states regulate care providers 
an additional 150 million would go to the head start preschool 
program that now reaches about 500000 3 and 4yearolds per year 
with the aim of turning those facilities into allday yearround 
child care centers 
all im trying to do with this bill is to increase 
availability make it affordable for families that are in the lower 
income levels so they can continue to work and be productive 
citizens and require that when they leave their infant child with a 
virtual stranger through no fault of their own that that stranger 
ought to meet some minimum health and safety standards dodd said 
the conservative heritage foundation argues that dodd is turning 
the government into an advocate for one particular not altogether 
preferable method of raising a family 
dodd believes that the traditional family where the child is 
cared for by parents in their own home is dead is obsolete 
rector said he is accelerating a trend which he admits is not in 
the best interest of children 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan called the child care 
legislation a classic insidethebeltway bill it sounds great 
who can be against it 
but making any real dent in the problem probably would cost 20 
billion to 30 billion says dole 
dodd responds that dole had neglected to consider what the 
legislation might save by providing welfare mothers a way to work 
without abandoning their children 
we dish out 16 billion of your tax money every year to keep 
these welfare mothers at home dodd said so the wealthy mother 
should go to work but the lower income mother shouldnt

some had their limbs severed by the wheels of 
a train headed north from the laredo railyards others were mangled 
in car crashes as they tried to flee the border patrol all were 
among the illegal aliens who end up in buddy flores hospital on 
the southwest border 
pregnant women from mexico who have heard that mercy regional 
medical center in laredo will not turn them away show up ready to 
deliver a child who will automatically be a us citizen 
many have had no prenatal care others arrive midway through a 
difficult or troubled labor their midwife decided she could not 
complete 
in a city with a large population of legal residents without 
insurance or money to pay for medical care illegal aliens are 
draining resources at flores catholic hospital and occupying 
intensive care beds that are short as it is he says 
the hospital writes off 20 million a year in bad debts and 
charity care but flores doesnt know how much is spent on 
undocumented aliens under texas law no patient can be refused 
emergency services 
three years ago i would have told you this was an occasional 
problem delivering babies from women here illegally flores 
said its a consistent problem now if theyre in active labor 
they know we cant refuse them 
laredos problems are not unique hospitals and trauma units 
from san diego to miami have been experiencing financial 
difficulties treating undocumented aliens according to border 
state lawmakers 
it is not unusual for a borderarea hospital to treat a large 
number of patients who may be illegally within the us almost 
always the hospital must write off the cost of this medical care 
because the patient cannot pay and invariably has no medical 
insurance says rep kika de la garza a texas democrat whose 
district borders mexico 
de la garza is cosponsoring the trauma care center alien 
compensation act that would provide 20 million a year in grants to 
hospitals that incur at least 15 percent of their uncompensated 
costs from treating illegal aliens in their trauma units 
the legislation would recognize immigrationrelated problems 
as a federal responsibility not to be shouldered alone by hospital 
trauma centers de la garza said from los angeles to miami 
trauma centers face reimbursement problems that threaten trauma 
care for all patients 
cosponsored by rep bill lowery a san diego republican the 
bill would apply only to trauma patients and would not cover the 
problem of illegal aliens delivering their babies in the united 
states 
lowery acknowledges the severity of the obstetrics problem but 
says something must be done immediately to prevent more trauma 
centers from closing their doors because of the impact on the 
community 
ten trauma centers in florida and 10 in los angeles have already 
been forced to close and others are foundering lowery said

as the euphoria of being elected mayor of new 
york city subsides david dinkins may feel a fouryear hangover 
kicking in 
a series of headaches awaits dinkins the first black mayor of 
the nations most populous city and though they are common to most 
cities crack crime aids the homeless theyve become nasty 
migraines in new york 
i congratulate him and i wish him well but i dont envy 
him former mayor john lindsay said the day after dinkins 
defeated republican rudolph giuliani new york faces towering 
problems and weve got nowhere to turn for help 
lindsay was referring to the underlying problem money the 
economic boom of the 80s has passed revenues are slipping and 
albany and washington have problems of their own 
dinkins will be staring at a potential billiondollar deficit in 
his first budget 
he faces enormous problems said outgoing mayor edward i 
koch the question will be how will he handle the dollars that 
are available 
giuliani in conceding defeat said our city is troubled in 
deep and serious ways 
the citys physical facilities are in disarray financier 
felix rohatyn who helped rescue the city from its 1970s fiscal 
crisis said earlier this year many of our bridges are crumbling 
or unsafe many of our school buildings are a disgrace and many of 
our streets would embarrass a third world country 
welcome to the 1990s mayor dinkins 
crack and crime theyre inseparable said thomas 
reppetto director of the citizens crime commission and they lead 
to clogged courtrooms and overcrowded jails 
in 1988 new york set records for murders 1896 and violent 
crime 162916 murders rapes robberies and assaults forty 
percent of the murders were drug related reppetto said 
in 1981 there were 26000 arrests on drug charges in 1988 
about 90000 this year it will be about 110000 he said 
aids more than 22000 new yorkers contracted aids more than 
12000 of them have died about 200000 are infected with the aids 
virus according to some estimates though some say the number 
could be as high as 360000 
its going to be bad said carisa cunningham of the gay 
mens health crisis theres a perception that its slowed down 
but thats not the case 
by the end of 1991 there will be 40000 aids cases by 1993 
60000 the city health department estimates 
health care were extremely strained in terms of capacity 
and in terms of financial difficulties said bruce vladeck 
president of the united hospital fund of new york a research group 
thats all hospitals he said though city hospitals are 
taking the particular brunt of the epidemics of aids and crack and 
related illnesses 
new york city hospitals public and private average more than 
90 percent occupancy he said the national average is 60 percent 
even if a 10year 21 billion capital plan for city hospitals 
went ahead full steam which it wont he said that will 
achieve less than twothirds of the modernization that it is 
agreed by everyone is needed 
the homeless there are about 74000 homeless in new york the 
partnership for the homeless estimates the number is growing by 
about 7 percent annually but could skyrocket in hard economic 
times 
we did a reasonably decent job of addressing the families in 
welfare hotels but in meantime ignored the mushrooming number of 
single adults the ones you see on the subways and on the 
streets said peter smith partnership president 
between 8000 and 11000 of the homeless are infected with the 
aids virus and that could reach 30000 by 1993 unless something 
dramatic is done smith said wheres he going to get the money 
to do it 
race relations racially motivated killings of blacks have 
sent tremors through the city and marches by thousands of blacks 
kept the issue in the forefront 
there are signals that people are trying to find their way 
through this wilderness said the rev herbert daughtry a civil 
rights leader david dinkins election is one of those signs 
im going to hang up my marching shoes daughtry said i 
may not put them in bronze but ill put them up for a while 
money contracts for nearly all union municipal employees must 
be negotiated in the coming year each percentage point increase in 
pay equals 130 million for the total payroll said raymond horton 
president of the citizens budget committee 
theres a problem but not a crisis horton said he can 
raise taxes he can cut expenditures or he can manage the 
resources the city already has more efficiently 
i would tell him to focus as much as possible on 
productivity 
but rohatyn says it is quite likely that in retrospect the 
years of the fiscal crisis of 75 to 1980 will appear benign 
compared to what new york city is likely to face in the years 1990 
to 1995

struggle among dissidents of libyanbacked terrorist mastermind abu 
nidal

victims included 20 senior officials of the fatahrevolutionary 
council which abu founded in 1973 after he broke away from yasser 
arafats palestine liberation organization 
the sources spoke in the ein elhilweh refugee camp the main 
lebanon power base of guerrillas loyal to arafat they said the 20 
officials were shot by abu nidal whose real name is sabri 
elbanna or his bodyguards at his home in tripoli libya and 
buried in the backyard 
most of the others were killed in various refugee camps in 
lebanon they said 
the sources were commenting on reports about the bloody split 
published sunday in the new york times the newspaper cited 
dissident fatahrevolutionary council leaders plo officials and 
arab diplomats for its reports 
the paper said most of the 20 leaders killed were lured into 
abu nidals house near tripoli on the pretext of discussing policy 
matters taken by surprise and killed in the house 
then they were buried right there abu nidal and his hirelings 
poured the cement over their bodies themselves the times quoted 
a dissident it identified as abdulrahman issa as saying 
abu nidal tops the most wanted lists in the united states and 
europe for several terrorist attacks including the 1986 bombing of 
a synagogue in istanbul in which 21 people were killed and the 
1985 attacks at rome and vienna airports in which 20 people were 
killed and 120 wounded 
abu nidal also was behind the assassination of dozens of 
moderate plo officials who advocated peace with israel

members of the groups 10man politburo including the spokesman 
atef abu bakr quit after abu nidal murdered mustafa murad in 
tripoli on oct 17 1988 
murad better known as abu nizar had been abu nidals closest 
aide since the split from the plo 
plo sources had reported a schism in the ranks of abu nidals 
group since mid1987 mainly because of his totalitarian policies 
and insistence on maintaining absolute control over finances 
the groups money came mainly from libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi and from a string of ransom kidnappings staged by abu 
nidals men against activists of humanitarian organizations in 
south lebanon in the last three years according to abu bakr and 
issa 
the two men have issued separate statements from algiers 
algeria in the past few months in which they stressed the groups 
financial corruption

woman hostage the group said the six were seized nov 8 1987 
aboard a french yacht off the israelioccupied gaza strip it 
accused them of spying for israel 
two swiss officials of the international committee of the red 
cross were kidnapped in sidon on oct 6 they are believed held at 
an abu nidal base in majdalyoun on sidons eastern outskirts 
abu nidals activists also are believed to have kidnapped some 
of the other 16 westerners held in lebanon and to have sold them to 
proiranian moslem factions 
issa and abu bakr have said murad was shot in the presence of 
majed atta the husband of abu nidals niece 
his widow subhia murad has accused abu nidal of shooting her 
husband and burying him in a fatahrevolutionary council camp 
outside tripoli an account the new york times said was 
corroborated by unnamed arab associates 
at the camp abu nidal built a new room for his house on top of 
the spot where two other senior commanders were buried in concrete 
after being killed by him late last year the times said 
haj abu mousa the groups top military trainer was lured to 
abu nidals house earlier in 1988 and killed in the same manner 
the reports said the tripoli killings touched off a campaign of 
assassinations among the rival wings of the groups in which some 
130 people have been killed in south lebanon and in the northern 
camps of baddawi and nahr elbared in the last three months 
they said abu nidal has suspended the groups politburo and 
transferred its powers to the 50man central committee after 
appointing atta as its second secretary abu nidal is the first 
secretary they added

the opening of the berlin wall has brought joy 
to the public but poses problems for us defense planners trying 
to maintain the military balance in europe experts say 
theres so much euphoria people will tend to think its all 
over said raymond l garthoff of the brookings institution 
we need some sort of policy to preserve the military 
balance in europe said robert lieber a government professor at 
georgetown university he urged a force cut on both sides along 
the lines of the conventional force reduction talks underway in 
vienna 
rapid change in east germany underscores the need for stability 
in central europe the flashpoint for two world wars in this 
century said garthoff and lieber echoing a view widely held among 
defense officials 
from 1871 to 1945 the politics of europe were highly 
unstable and the main problem was a very powerful germany said 
lieber 
us officials face the followng questions the experts said 
how to react to a possible reunification of east and west 
germany for the first time since the defeat of nazi germany in 1945 
whether west germany will be able to accommodate east german 
refugees an estimated 200000 already have arrived in the west 
this year 
how to encourage other east european countries to move toward 
democracy and freemarket economies 
the pace of change appeared to be speeding up rather than 
slowing down with the resignation on friday of bulgarian communist 
leader todor zhivkov after 35 years in power indicating a shift 
toward reform there 
that would leave czechoslovakia and romania as the only two 
members of the warsaw pact yet to start reforms 
i suspect there will be some move fairly soon in 
czechoslovakia too leaving romania even more isolated said 
garthoff who was us ambassador to bulgaria from 1977 to 1979 he 
said he didnt expect changes in romania as long president nicolae 
ceausescu retains a strong hand 
the european balance could be tipped by a unilateral western 
reduction in forces that leaves the soviet union dominant in the 
region or a decision by east germany to unite with west germany 
and withdraw from the warsaw pact 
despite a unilateral soviet troop reduction in eastern europe 
announced last year western government officials say the soviets 
have superior conventional forces in europe 
soviet experts however claim there is a rough equivalence when 
sophisticated western aircraft and other weapons are included 
president bush and his top advisers have insisted that caution 
is the wisest policy in the face of rapid change in eastern europe 
the best way to keep america and the west free is to keep 
ourselves strong bush said in a speech last friday 
bush also promised to seize every chance to encourage 
democracy in eastern europe but he and his top aides say that 
despite soviet bloc claims that reform is permanent hardliners 
could return 
i dont think its going to be reversible but it may be 
secretary of state james a baker iii said pbstvs 
macneillehrer news hour thats why we must continue to 
maintain our strength our will 
the prospect of german reunification arouses great concern among 
us and western european defense officials 
the major pitfall is whether or not we do find that events 
lead us the to reunification of germany said retired general 
bernard rogers the former nato commander 
east german ambassador gerhard herder told a news conference he 
could dream of german reunification but not in the foreseeable 
future 
the main obstacle he said is that east and west germany are 
integrated into military alliances guaranteeing a stable balance 
of power in europe

six years after escaping vietnam 
aboard a 30foot wooden fishing boat sonbinh nguyen made a 
research discovery as a summer intern at dupont that could improve 
the way nylon is made 
dupont rewarded nguyen last month with its achievement award 
the first college undergraduate ever to receive the honor from the 
delawarebased chemical giants research and development department 
nguyen a 20yearold penn state university senior majoring in 
chemistry and physics plays down his research efforts 
its luck as far as im concerned he said recently 
the 20yearolds findings could potentially improve the way 
chemicals used in manufacturing nylon are prepared and save the 
company millions of dollars said ronald mckinney nguyens 
supervisor at dupont 
sonbinh identified a problem that the company may not have 
fully appreciated before and he also came up with a possible 
solution mckinney said 
whether that solution ends up being something used in the 
plant is not clear yet but it certainly is under serious 
consideration i think it looks very promising he said 
after several unsuccessful attempts to escape nguyen made it 
out of vietnam with about 20 others in march 1983 aboard his 
uncles boat bound for malaysia his parents were left behind 
when i escaped i dont even know if i live or not said 
nguyen a small boat in a big ocean pirates the government 
coast guard it very likely i might die 
they were rescued three days later the group spent 13 months in 
refugee camps in malaysia and the philippines before being allowed 
into the united states 
nguyen and his brother transon now 18 went to an aunt and 
uncle already living in williamsport 
although he didnt speak english very well nguyen was placed in 
the regular curriculum at williamsport high school 
he got two jobs after school working from 230 pm until 
midnight 
hes an exceptionally talented dedicated student said mary 
bennardi who taught nguyen english at williamsport high school 
at penn state nguyen spends 20 to 25 hours a week in the 
chemistry laboratory and takes eight or nine courses a semester 
the work is exciting he said 
nguyen is one of the hardest working students ive ever met 
said gregory geoffroy a chemistry professor who is dean of the 
college of science 
nguyen wants to do advanced studies in chemistry when he 
graduates in may 
he also expects to become a us citizen next spring and is 
trying to get his parents another brother and two adoptive sisters 
from vietnam the us government has approved but the vietnamese 
government has not 
nguyens mother and father were doctors when north vietnams 
communist government completed its takeover of south vietnam in 
1975 
they now grow coconuts in chogao a farm village 70 miles south 
of ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
we dont have any future there nguyen said we never 
really get along with the communists and the way the communists 
treat the people 
nguyen said he is grateful for the help he has received in the 
united states 
because of all of the people who have given me scholarships 
help and support for the last five years he said i should not

the world war ii allies still have an official 
grip on berlin but there was little evidence of that during a 
tumultuous weekend of wild celebrations 
no one asked permission from the united states the soviet 
union england or france to punch holes through border barriers 
although security and sovereignty are strictly the affair of the 
occupying forces 
likewise the exclusive allied matter of access to the city was 
ignored during the emotional exchange that brought hundreds of 
thousands of east germans to west berlin 
reflecting the upset of order inflicted by the crumbling 
borders us army sgt terry ramsey said his unit had suspended 
patrolling of the berlin wall where the watchposts were empty 
theres no reason to go because we gather information about 
the guards and the towers said ramsey who has been stationed in 
berlin for three years theres no one there so theres no 
purpose in the wall patrol 
but the fourpower control does have effects for example 
forcing a wide detour in what would have been a short flight for 
west german chancellor helmut kohl from warsaw to berlin last week 
and the allies would legally have final say over the 
reunification of berlin 
under the potsdam agreement of 1945 the four victorious powers 
of world war ii parceled out defeated nazi germany and the capital 
berlin for occupation 
sovereignty was granted to the new west german state created out 
of the french british and american occupation zones in 1949 and 
the soviets followed by setting up the communist state of east 
germany in the remaining zone 
berlin has remained under allied jurisdiction 
daytoday administration of the western sectors was deeded to a 
west berlin government and the soviets gradually relinquished east 
berlin to the installed communist leadership 
us mission spokesman anthony sariti explained that the powers 
officially remaining with the allies are over security access and 
provision of services and facilities for the occupying forces 
the controls define air corridors into the city that limit 
commercial aviation access to carriers from france britain and the 
united states and highway access is also officially monitored by 
the foreign forces 
that cumbersome air corridor stipulation forced kohl to detour 
through hamburg on friday when he flew from the polish capital of 
warsaw to berlin it also prevents the west german national 
carrier lufthansa from flying into one of the nations most 
important cities

dolores ibarruri nicknamed la pasionaria spurred besieged 
antifascist fighters in the spanish civil war with oratory that 
led to her exile and earned the hatred of triumphant gen francisco 
franco 
the communist leaders fiery exhortation to republican forces in 
the 193639 civil war no pasaran or they shall not pass 
became a battle cry and inspired worldwide forces against fascism 
many literary scholars believe she was the model for pilar the 
energetic heroine of ernest hemingways novel of the war for 
whom the bell tolls 
ms ibarruri died sunday in the ramon y cajal hospital in madrid 
of pneumonia she was 93 
though her forces were defeated by franco she outlived the 
spanish dictator and ended a 38year exile in the soviet union by 
returning in triumph in 1977 
in the first democratic elections since franco set off the 
bloody threeyear civil war the 82yearold honorary communist 
party president won back the parliament seat she had held four 
decades earlier she later gave it up because of her age 
on dec 9 1985 figures from the international communist 
movement and from spains socialist government feted la 
pasionaria on her 90th birthday 
the name of la pasionaria sums up an entire era in the 
struggle of workers and the spanish people for freedom democracy 
and progress cuban president fidel castro wrote in an article 
published for the celebration 
born dec 9 1895 into a roman catholic mining family in 
gallarta in the basque province of vizcaya dolores ibarruri was 
the eighth of 11 children 
in her autobiography the way mrs ibarruri wrote she had 
an unhappy childhood and an adolescence without hope and said 
the harsh conditions in which her family lived turned her into a 
revolutionary 
i knew the terrible pain of days without bread and winters 
without fire 
her family was too poor to pay for schooling so she abandoned 
her ambition of becoming a teacher she married julian ruiz a 
socialist activist five years her senior ruiz who claimed he 
guided la pasionaria politically once recalled her as being as 
independent as a mountain goat 
separated from his wife since the 1930s ruiz died a few weeks 
after her return to spain from moscow 
mrs ibarruri wrote that she found married life odious and 
unbearable four of her six children died in infancy including 
triplets born in 1923 
ruiz was often jailed for labor agitation and unable to feed 
their two remaining children a son ruben who died in the battle 
of stalingrad and a daughter amaya the sole surviving child 
dolores ibarruri turned to politics after ruiz introduced her to 
socialism and marxism she read about the russian revolution two 
names she wrote later struck me in my heart and in my head 
russia and lenin i no longer felt sad i no longer felt alone 
she began a career as a labor organizer and strike leader and 
wrote articles she signed as la pasionaria a name she chose in 
1916 because her first article appeared during holy week known in 
spanish as the week of the passion 
in 1934 she led a rebellion by 40000 miners in the northern 
province of asturias 
soviet communism became la pasionarias religion she visited 
moscow in 1933 and 1935 when she was elected deputy to the 
parliament from the town of oviedo 
when the civil war broke out in july 1936 she sent her surviving 
children to the soviet union remaining in madrid to lead rallies 
visit republican forces and make her ringing radio broadcasts 
her ability to recruit fighters was so strong that her enemies 
often claimed she was being guided directly by moscow 
with francos victory imminent la pasionaria fled to the soviet 
union in 1939 where she was named secretarygeneral of the spanish 
communist party in exile in 1942 she became president in 1954 
although she was always present at communist party meetings 
mrs ibarruri remained in the background and rarely spoke in public 
she saw the once powerful spanish communist party which she 
helped found in 1920 split into factions and become a minor 
political force under the constitutional monarchy of king juan 
carlos 
she witnessed the transformation of the partys move away from 
moscow without saying a word but she always remained an 
unshakeable supporter of the soviets who gave her the order of 
lenin one of the soviet unions most prestigious honors 
in later years her vibrant voice and energy were gone but she 
kept her habit of dressing in black 
why have i always dressed in black mrs ibarruri said in a 
rare interview a woman of humble background like me cant wear 
bright clothes with a black dress although it may be inexpensive 
one can go anywhere and one goes more decently

pope john paul ii canonized princess agnes 
of bohemia a medieval czechoslovak nun on sunday in the first 
papal ceremony broadcast on state television in the communist 
nation 
the pontiff also formally conferred sainthood on a polish friar 
adam chmielowski 
more than 9000 czechoslovaks including a government 
delegation packed st peters basilica to watch the canonization 
of the princess who turned nun and laid a framework for social work 
in 13th century bohemia a region that became modern 
czechoslovakia 
the pilgrims paid 300 each for the fourday trip to rome 
the live hourlong broadcast and the unprecedented move of 
granting travel visas to czechoslovak pilgrims reflected a marked 
improvement in relations between prague and the holy see in recent 
months 
the decision to broadcast the ceremony appeared to be in line 
with an official effort to prevent catholic dissent at a time when 
czechoslovakias orthodox communist leaders are becoming 
increasingly isolated from shifts toward democracy in other eastern 
european countries 
during the ceremony the polishborn pontiff praised agnes for 
her christian faith and heroic charity 
agnes rejected efforts by her parents king premysl otakar i 
and queen constance to arrange her a royal wedding instead she 
became a nun in 1234 and established religious hospitals and the 
convent of the poor sisters where she died in 1282 
john paul told the crowd they should learn from agnes example 
of helping others without complaint 
human history is in continuous movement times change with the 
different generations and with scientific discoveries new 
techniques but also new worries arise on the horizon of human 
beings who are always traveling but the truth of christ who 
illuminates and saves survives the changing events said the 
goldrobed pontiff 
he did not refer specifically to the rapid push toward democracy 
in eastern europe over recent months or to czechoslovakias failure 
to embrace the shift 
but there has been a thaw in the vaticans relations with the 
soviet bloc and after years of bitterness and contention prague 
agreed to the appointment of four new bishops this year 
however seven out of thirteen diocese in czechoslovakia are 
still vacant 
also canonized sunday was chmielowski known as brother 
albert he was a 19th century painter of religious themes who 
founded hostels for the poor and homeless he became a franciscan 
friar and established a congregation of friars 
he helped found 21 religious houses before dying in 1916

president hosni mubarak called for measures 
to combat a trade gap unemployment and sluggish productivity among 
governmentowned industries but he rejected calls to sell off 
companies to the private sector 
in a nationally broadcast policy speech saturday marking the 
inauguration of a new session of the peoples assembly mubarak 
devoted most of his 90minute speech to the economy and how to 
enact reform 
for months egyptian officials have been discussing the need to 
dismantle part of the public sector whose factories range from 
producing iron and steel to clothes mubarak called for freer 
management of governmentowned industries but he refused to 
consider privatization 
the freeing of the public sector is a pure egyptian necessity 
for the interest of the national economy he said the issue is 
not selling the public sector or changing its ownership but the 
issue is supporting it and increasing its capability so that it 
will produce more 
the president said the nation needed to narrow its 45 billion 
gap between foreign exchange and spending on imports by increasing 
production and modernizing the industrial and agricultural sectors 
continuation of this gap would have dire consequences 
touching the country and all citizens mubarak told the 458seat 
house where his national democratic party holds an overwhelming 
majority 
mubarak ruled out using foreign loans to bridge the gap the 
countrys foreign debt totals about 44 billion 
mubarak indicated private business must help in tackling 
unemployment official figures show about 2 million university 
graduates and laborers are without jobs 
we put the unemployment problem at the top of our priorities 
because we understand the importance of opening new productive job 
opportunities but the government cannot face this problem 
alone mubarak said 
mubarak who took office eight years ago inherited most of the 
countrys economic woes from late president anwar sadats opendoor 
policy and late president gamal abdel nassers socialist regime 
roughly onefourth of egypts foreign debt is owed to the united 
states under pressure from the usdominated international 
monetary fund cairo began economic changes in 1987 that included 
increasing exports reducing imports and fusing several foreign 
exchange rates into a single more realistic one 
the reforms enabled egypt with imf help to reschedule debts of 
about 8 billion talks are under way with the fund on further 
changes to permit rescheduling 5 billion in other loans

west germanys president on sunday urged western 
nations to help east germany recover from the exodus of its 
citizens and the mayors of east and west berlin shook hands in no 
mans land to usher in a new era of relations 
east germanys communist party leader called for an emergency 
party congress and indicated a new slate of leaders will be 
installed to replace the old guard and institute reforms in his 
changing nation 
another hole was cut through the berlin wall to the roaring 
cheers of spectators east berliners continued to flood the western 
half of the city buying all they could afford with their 55 of 
government welcome money 
by sunday afternoon burger king was out of beer and haagendaz 
had sold all its ice cream bars 
unlike thousands who abandoned their communist homeland for the 
west in recent weeks most people crossing on the weekend were just 
visiting taking advantage of the freedom created by the opening 
thursday of east germanys borders by sunday night the border 
gridlock had eased and west berlins streets were returning to 
normal 
reflecting the new openborder policy east german defense 
minister heinz kessler said sunday that border guards who once 
shot at their fleeing countrymen have been told not to use 
firearms any more in cases of border violations 
but amid the euphoria there were reminders of the political 
changes and uncertainty still sweeping through east germany which 
began carving passages through the 29milelong berlin wall on 
friday 
communist party chief egon krenz called for an emergency party 
congress next month the official adn news agency said he 
indicated a new central committee will be elected to carry out 
various reforms aimed at stopping east germans from going west 
we need a central committee that can carry the full 
responsibility and enjoys full trust krenz was quoted as telling 
reporters 
krenz said the current central committee would meet monday to 
approve holding the congress also monday east germanys 
parliament is to meet to name a cabinet to replace the one that 
resigned tuesday the reformminded party chief of dresden hans 
modrow was expected to be named premier 
since krenz replaced hardliner erich honecker as party chief 
oct 18 10 full members of the ruling 21member politburo have 
lost their positions there also has been pressure for the 
163member policysetting central committee chosen under honecker 
to resign 
on west berlins fashionable kurfuerstendamm avenue about 1000 
leftists marched through the streets shouting slogans against 
german reunification 
an appeal signed by the official free german youth movement and 
representatives of the democratic opposition voiced fears about 
the very existence of our country in the wake of the massive 
westward stream of visitors 
more than 3 million east germans headed west over the weekend 
while several hundred thousand people made their way to berlin from 
other countries to join a 4dayold celebration 
the wall will never be what it used to be it remains a 
memorial to inhumanity west german president richard von 
weizsaecker said in a speech in west berlins 
kaiserwilhelmgedaechtnis church the church a landmark to world 
war ii destruction combines the bombedout ruins of the old 
kaiserwilhelm church with a modern structure 
winter is at the door the ailing have to be taken care of 
von weizsaecker said alluding to the near decimation of parts of 
the east german economy and the severe shortage of medical 
personnel as a result of the recent exodus of east germans to the 
west 
more than 200000 east germans have left east germany since 
september there have been reports that medical students have been 
drafted to work in hospitals to make up for the loss of doctors and 
nurses 
turning his attention to other nations von weizsaecker the 
former west berlin mayor said the west should be ready to help 
east germany with open hearts and open doors 
he cautioned that the west should not interfere in east germany 
internally but urged the east berlin leadership to stick to its 
promise of free elections 
weizsaecker later went through the new berlin wall crossing at 
potsdamer platz took several steps into east berlin and exchanged 
a few words with some border guards as he was mobbed by hundreds of 
people 
west berlin mayor walter momper and his east berlin counterpart 
erhard krack met at the potsdamer platz once a vibrant city 
center but now a bleak no mans land bisected by the berlin wall 
and flanked by concrete watchtowers 
their highly symbolic handshake represented a start of a new era 
of optimism on closeness for the german people although krenz and 
other officials have flatly ruled out reunification of the 
countries 
earlier thousands of people cheered as east german border 
guards used jackhammers to bore a hole in the wall at potsdamer 
platz it was the fourth opening created in the wall since friday 
the others are at bernauer strasse puschkinallee mahlow and the 
glienecker bridge footcrossing 
its a great day in our history and the history of the 
world said torsten fischer a 20yearold east german border 
guard who has been doing wall duty for six months at potsdamer 
platz 
cheering spectators on both sides of the concrete barrier 
watched the reunion of mayors 
outside berlin east germany opened at least 10 more border 
crossings 
british rock star joe cocker joined the party in berlin with a 
performance that drew thousands to the deutschlandhalle concert 
hall in the western sector about two miles from the wall he was 
among more than 20 musicians peforming at the concert which police 
said was staged parly to drew crowds from the wall

proisraeli collaborator from a lamppost in a gaza strip refugee 
camp and fatally stabbed another in the west bank residents said 
also sunday the government approved the establishment of a 
jewish settlement in the occupied gaza strip israel radio said 
the united states and european nations oppose new settlements in 
the occupied lands saying they are an obstacle to peace the 
approval came three days before prime minister yitzhak shamir 
visits washington more than 70000 israelis live in about 130 
settlements in gaza and the occupied west bank 
in the jabaliya refugee camp in gaza the body of ahmed mohammed 
jamil shehadeh 28 was found hanging from a lamppost early sunday

suspected of collaborating with israel 
in the west bank village of idna masked palestinians stabbed

he escaped unharmed when a threevehicle army convoy came to his 
rescue an israeli army sergeant and all three arab enforcers were 
killed in an ensuing gun battle

wednesday with president bush 
israel is seeking assurances from washington that proposed talks 
between israeli and palestinian delegations will exclude the 
palestine liberation organization 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said the united states must find a 
formula that satisfies us 
i believe if the americans want to advance peace and they do 
then they will find a solution to this problem he told israel 
army radio 
speaking on israel television sunday night shamir said of the 
usisraeli talks there are certain differences of opinion that 
can cause differences during discussions but i see no reason for 
confrontation 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of the leftleaning labor party 
which opposes shamirs hardline approach said in a speach that 
israel should be prepared to take risks for peace 
israel has taken chances in war and in making peace with 
egypt and israel therefore should take a calculated risk when it 
comes to attempts to reach a peace agreement he said

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
sunday that any us economic aid for east germany must await clear 
evidence that the east bloc country is willing to reform its 
economy not just open its borders 
the dramatic change unfolding in berlin is a historic 
political event but it doesnt mean a whole lot in economic 
terms baker said 
baker interviewed on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley defended the bush administrations cautious response to 
the events saying it would be wrong to start funneling economic 
assistance to any country in eastern europe before there is 
clear evidence that they want to reform their economic system 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennadi gerasimov praised 
president bushs response to the tumult in east germany saying 
i think hes handling it as a real statesman 
bush is still preparing a response to an informal cable he 
received friday from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
underscoring the importance of the changes taking place in east 
germany and expressing hope the situation remains calm and peaceful 
gerasimov on cbstvs face the nation predicted that at 
next months shipboard summit off malta bush and gorbachev may 
come to a common ground that both countries and actually 
everybody is interested in stability in not too much upheaval in 
europe 
baker said he believes moscow would draw the line at any attempt 
by its east bloc allies to withdraw from the warsaw pact the 
communist alliances counterpart to the wests north atlantic 
treaty organization 
but baker said they have made it very clear to us that 
they will not use force in eastern europe 
to do so they said would mean that perestroika has failed 
he said using the russian word for the soviet reforms 
baker said the administration wants to work with the soviets 
to assist them where we can with technical economic advice in 
their efforts to move to a free market economy 
the soviets wont ask us for american cash baker said 
they havent yet theyve said theyre not going to and i dont 
believe well see that in malta 
but if the soviets want to move from competition to cooperation 
he added we need to see cooperation in central america 
the secretary of state said the united states wants to avoid 
overreacting to the situation in eastern europe or doing 
anything to promote instability he said it was premature to even 
consider a meeting between bush and new east german communist 
leader egon krenz 
he said the united states would welcome the eventual 
reunification of the two germanies as long as that reunification 
comes about on the basis of western values but he stressed it is 
too soon to make the great leap from right of free travel on 
the part of east germans to the question of reunification 
baker ruled out any unilateral us troop withdrawals from 
europe 
the reason the walls coming down is because we have 
maintained our will and our resolve and our strength for 40 years 
and lets dont jump here before its time to jump baker said 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine and other 
democrats have accused bush of responding timidly to the east bloc 
shift toward democratic and economic reforms 
the house last month passed an 837 million package to aid the 
reform governments in poland and hungary nearly double what bush 
requested for those two east bloc states struggling to rebuild 
their ailing economies and shift toward democratic freedoms 
defense secretary dick cheney who openly voiced skepticism 
earlier in the year about gorbachevs ability to survive said 
sunday mr gorbachev is indeed for real but cheney added 
i think mr gorbachevs going to be in for a very rough winter 
the soviet economy is a basket case at this point in terrible 
condition with labor strife ethnic unrest said cheney 
i think theres great uncertainty about what ultimately will 
happen in the soviet union and i think we have to judge our 
policies accordingly the defense chief said 
he said the soviets still have thousands of nuclear weapons 
aimed at the united states were patrons of the guerillas who 
attacked the government of el salvador earlier sunday and were 
supporting the governments of nicaragua and cuba i dont think 
the united states ought to be in a position of providing material 
assistance to the soviets cheney said on nbctvs meet the 
press

about 7 million serbians in 
yugoslavias largest republic voted sunday in a referendum on their 
next president nationalist slobodan milosevic was expected to win 
the most support 
belgrades official socialist youth organization dismissed the 
referendum as antidemocratic noting all four candidates are 
members of the ruling communist leadership 
the voting is similar to a public opinion poll the serbian 
parliament will select the president of the republic from the two 
candidates who get the most votes from the electorate the state 
tanjug news agency said 
milosevic 48 was named president of serbia the largest of 
yugoslavias six republics in may he organized the tightening of 
the republics control over kosovo province after members of 
kosovos mainly christian serbian minority claimed harassment by 
the moslem ethnic albanian majority 
the moves were popular with serbians but brought ethnic albanian 
protests and armed clashes in which at least 28 people have been 
killed 
milosevic and other serbian leaders have been criticized for not 
permitting alternative political parties which are allowed in the 
more liberal northern republic of slovenia 
it is not a merry event to proclaim as a great democratic act 
the voting for a single political concept the belgrade newspaper 
borba said 
leaders of belgrades socialist youth last week spoke of 
possible abuse of the elections which are expected to lead to 
milosevic retaining his post for a fouryear term 
it called for realistic political and organizational 
conditions which will make possible direct and free candidates and 
elections

the time is 1928 the place berlin the 
depression is only a year away and hitler waits to seize power in 
germany but at the grand hotel people are more concerned with 
other more important things like life death love money 
they are the subjects of grand hotel the intoxicating 
evocative new musical that swept into broadways martin beck 
theater on sunday night under the extraordinary guidance of tommy 
tune 
with jerome robbins preoccupation with ballet and the deaths of 
michael bennett bob fosse and gower champion tune stands alone as 
the foremost director and choreographer of broadway musicals 
although their approaches differed greatly these men are linked by 
their ability to make musicals move to create productions that 
soar through song dance and story 
and grand hotel based on the vicki baum novel and the 
famous mgm film starring greta garbo and john barrymore moves with 
a fluidity that approaches the cinematic 
through the hotels everrevolving front door swirl a half dozen 
characters whose stories will be played out before the evenings 
two hours are over all of them are introduced in a dazzling 
opening number the grand parade 
grushinskaya the aging ballerina is on yet another farewell 
tour tended by her devoted companion raffaela a young baron 
trying to find a way to pay his debts contemplates stealing the 
ballerinas jewels preysing an industrialist attempts to close a 
big business deal before his career is ruined flaemmchen a 
secretary stuck in a drab deadend job longs to go to hollywood 
and become a movie star kringelein a timid terminally ill 
accountant discovers how to enjoy life in his dying moments 
the book written by luther davis with apparently an uncredited 
assist from peter stone telescopes their stories with grace and 
wit without sacrificing characterization 
much of the score by robert wright and george forrest was 
augmented or revised by maury yeston the composer and lyricist of 
nine who wrote what is documented laboriously in the program 
regardless of authorship the music and lyrics fit together well 
particularly the period pastiches that suggest the sounds of the 
late 1920s 
the cast sings and dances with authority as the ballerina 
liliane montevecchi is surprisingly funny although she is not much 
of an actress the woman has a show biz snappiness that works well 
especially when she tears through the shows most heavily parisian 
number bonjour amour david carroll blessed with the 
strongest voice in the cast earns applause with the barons 
highpowered love song love cant happen 
flaemmchen is a germanic betty boop and as played by jane 
krakowski becomes an utterly captivating creature particularly 
when she is dancing a charleston with kringelein michael jeter 
jeter is astonishing in a second charleston well take a 
glass together in which the looselimbered little man dances his 
way over the hotel bar and timothy jerome the greedy 
industrialist sings what could be shows best song the crooked 
path with great glee karen akers as the ballerinas morose 
confidante is saddled with the musicals gloomiest numbers but she 
still manages to create a character 
tune interwines their tales brilliantly the glamorous 
introduction is interspersed with a hard proletarian lament 
some have some have not from the hotels scullery workers 
the musical and dance numbers blend with a flawless precision 
rarely stopping for star turns by the performers there is a 
dramatic tango near the end of the musical but it serves to 
underscore an important plot development rather than interrupt the 
show 
that seems to be the hallmark of tunes sophisticated approach 
the show has enormous style that never slips to mere showiness it 
recalls such landmark musicals as cabaret follies and even 
evita in which everything served the story 
tony waltons stationary twotiered setting composed of what 
look like glass pillars puts the orchestra above the action on the 
second level its a restrained but expensivelooking environment 
that allows the playing area to be set aside for dancing much of 
the hotels activity is mimed from the telephone operators 
answering calls to the partying in the hotel bar even down to the 
workings of the washroom attendants 
people come people go but nothing seems to change says a 
worldweary doctor the hotels one permanent resident played with 
a bitter ferocity by john wylie in grand hotel tune and 
company have put an entire world on stage and in the process 
created a daring provocative piece of musical theater

gov william a oneill fired the state 
police commander sunday after revelations that the police secretly 
taperecorded telephone calls between suspects and their attorneys 
the governor said he believed commander lester j forsts 
assertion that he wasnt aware of the scope of the taping system 
but he said forst had to go because the people have to be assured 
that their police department is on their side 
oneill named former hartford police chief bernard r sullivan 
to replace forst as state police commander and public safety 
commissioner 
in a foursentence letter to the governor forst said he was 
resigning with profound regret oneill said he had asked for 
forsts resignation 
i have not violated any laws nor have i condoned any 
wrongdoing however it has been my training for over 27 years to 
serve the best interests of the state of connecticut and the 
department of public safety he wrote 
forst could not be reached immediately for comment his home 
phone number is not listed 
the firing had been anticipated since the hartford courant 
disclosed the tapings on tuesday forst had been on a hunting 
vacation in alaska and bad weather delayed his return until the 
weekend 
calls between suspects and their attorneys were taped as part of 
a system that recorded all incoming and outgoing calls at the state 
polices 12 regional barracks 
the state police have said the tapes generally were not listened 
to unless police needed to verify details of an incoming call for 
example or check on any complaints from the public about the 
handling of a call 
the governors legal counsel the attorney general and the chief 
states attorney are examining state police taping policies as 
well as those at local police departments in addition the us 
attorney for connecticut and the fbi are investigating whether the 
tapings violated federal wiretap laws 
oneill also ordered an immediate halt to recordings of 
attorneyclient calls 
a group of criminal defense lawyers have filed a classaction 
suit against the state seeking unspecified damages for clients who 
may have had their private phone conversations recorded the 
lawyers have said they expect prisoners to seek new trials 
forsts ouster culminated a stormy eightyear career as 
commissioner that saw him at the center of controversies over 
budget overruns and the use of informants 
the taping activity should not have been done was wrong and 
cannot be tolerated oneill said at a news conference with 
sullivan 
do i believe it was done with intent and malice aforethought 
the answer to that is probably not oneill said 
the governor said he chose sullivan rather than promoting 
someone from within the department to make sure the controversy 
would not overshadow the state police 
oneill said sullivan 46 had assured him that attorneyclient 
calls were never recorded by the hartford police

between the two nations during a mass sunday in a village on former 
german territory 
about 5000 worshipers applauded the gesture by kohl and prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki in krzyzowa during world war ii 
members of the antinazi resistance met in krzyzowa known in 
german as kreisau 
dense fog shrouded warsaw forcing kohl to travel six hours by 
bus rather than plane to reach krzyzowa after he resumed his visit 
to poland interrupted by a brief trip home to discuss 
developments in east germany 
kohl returned to warsaw sunday evening for talks with communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski mazowiecki a former solidarity 
activist and polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski 
hans klein kohls spokesman told reporters afterward that the 
talks had focused on east germanys opening of the berlin wall and 
other borders to the west he characterized the talks as 
unusually intense and open 
poland has welcomed the new east german freedoms but the 
prospect of reuniting the two germanys is met with suspicion in a 
nation overrun by germany in world war ii and still insecure about 
its western border 
on sunday the west german leader the first to visit poland 
since 1977 sought to erase the bitter nazi german legacy 
bishop alfons nossol celebrated the 90minute roman catholic 
service in polish and in german saying it could serve as 
reconciliation between the germans and poles 
we have heard in the sermon kohl said that we should 
never forget history but we also have to learn from history i 
think it was just this moment of learning of history we have 
greeted one another in the sign of reconciliaton 
west german diplomats in warsaw said kohl attached great 
symbolic importance to the visit to krzyzowa kohl appeared moved 
when he embraced mazowiecki after the congregation was asked to 
give the sign of peace to one another 
onethird of all current polish territory was german before 
world war ii an estimated 80000 ethnic germans remain mostly in 
the former german territories of silesia and east prussia 
polishgerman relations in the region have been strained since 
the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 millions of germans were 
expelled after the regions were awarded to poland after the war 
those displaced germans remain a strong political force in west 
germany 
reporters at the mass and polish radio said about 5000 people 
attended the service which was broadcast on television some held 
banners in german saying we demand german schools and church 
services and helmut you are our chancellor too 
mazowiecki the first noncommunist leader in the soviet bloc 
appealed for greater brotherhood between germans and poles 
although a 1970 treaty pledges west germanys respect of the 
oder and neisse rivers as polands western border west german 
conservatives have recently suggested seeking reunification within 
prewar borders which include large areas of presentday poland 
after the mass kohl was to travel to czestochowa the holiest 
shrine in poland before returning to the capital for a meeting 
with president wojciech jaruzelski 
during kohls trip the two sides signed eight agreements they 
include one for 15 billion in economic assistance from west 
germany

federal prosecutors filed suit sunday against the 
owners of a greek freighter for damaging the environment when the 
vessel ran aground on a fragile coral reef off the florida keys 
us marshals seized the 470foot mv elpis on saturday after it 
was floated off the reef by high tide the vessel laden with sugar 
and bound for mexico from the netherlands ran aground about 5 
miles off key largo late friday 
it was the third ship to run aground off the keys in less than 
three weeks all hit at night but in fair weather in areas marked 
by navigational lights 
federal agents boarded the ship late saturday and moved it to 
anchorage off miami beach diane cossin a spokeswoman for the us 
department of justice in miami said sunday marshals then went 
aboard and served a warrant to keep the ship there she said 
we are filing charges against the ship and the ships owners 
alleging damage to the reef and the consequent future damage to the 
ecosystem within the key largo national marine sanctuary she 
said 
the government will seek to recover damages and costs of 
recovery but cossin wouldnt cite specific figures until federal 
marine scientists make a report 
the justice department has filed a 9 million lawsuit against 
the yugoslav freighter mavro vetranic which ran aground off the 
keys late last month alleging the ship was unseaworthy and the 
crew incompetent 
a coast guard board of inquiry is to convene monday to 
investigate the elpis grounding and question crew members said 
captain herbert robinson commanding officer of the coast guard 
marine safety office in miami 
the crew was not tested for drug or alcohol use the coast guard 
said 
gov bob martinez has amended an executive order to expand a 
criminal investigation of the first two groundings to include the 
elpis accident 
the elpis accident took place about four miles south of where 
the 155foot freighter alec owen maitland ran aground oct 25 
cutting a 200foot swath in the reef 
five days later the 475foot mavro vetranic ran aground off the 
dry tortugas in the far wester keys destroying about 500 feet of 
coral 
the reef is the worlds third largest living reef extending 
about 200 miles from miami to the dry tortugas it is wellmarked 
by lighthouses and other navigational aids and shouldnt be 
difficult to navigate especially in fair weather coast guard 
spokesman jim wentworth said 
you can see the change in color between the deep and shallow 
water and its well marked by buoys he said i dont know why 
these groundings are happening but they shouldnt be 
reef experts say it could take nature hundreds of years to 
repair the damage to the reef

a former savings and loan regulator who told 
congress he was pressured by five senators to go easy on one of 
their major campaign contributors has been questioned by fbi agents 
apparently looking into whether laws were violated according to 
published reports 
meanwhile another newspaper said one of the five senators 
democrat alan cranston of california continued to intercede with 
federal regulators on behalf of financier charles h keating jr 
for two years after auditors urged the takeover of keatings 
lincoln savings and loan association 
edwin gray former head of the home loan bank board told the 
house banking committee last week that he was asked at an april 2 
meeting with four of the five senators to ease regulatory pressure 
on lincoln by dropping a rule barring the thrifts risky 
investments 
the four at the meeting were dennis deconcini dariz john 
mccain rariz cranston and john glenn dohio sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich has acknowledged making subsequent entreaties 
on keatings behalf although he did not attend the meeting 
together the five received 13 million in campaign 
contributions from keating who has told reporters he certainly 
hoped his contributions had bought influence with the senators 
in a related matter the arizona republic reported on sunday 
that federal election commission records show deconcini also may 
have received 600 in illegal campaign contributions from a 
phoenixbased home building company 
the company emerald homes was identified in a 11 billion 
federal racketeering lawsuit as participating with keating and 
others in fraudulent realestate transactions involving lincoln 
the questionable contribution was made by emerald executive 
william p junge who sent deconcini a note two months ago 
indicating emerald actually made this contribution the 
republic said 
although it is not clear when the fbi questioning reported by 
the boston globe on saturday and the washington post on sunday 
began the chief of the justice departments public integrity 
section wrote to common cause on oct 24 that the department would 
thoroughly review the political watchdogs call for an 
investigation into whether keatings actions violated federal 
election laws or other laws 
while declining to comment on whether the fbi is conducting an 
investigation a justice department official pointed out sunday 
that such interviews by agents would be normal practice in a 
preliminary review of allegations that laws had been violated 
the globes report saturday quoted two wellplaced sources 
as saying gray was interviewed by agents last week and that gray 
declined to confirm whether he was questioned the report did not 
say whether the interviews took place before or after grays 
congressional testimony 
the post account said other regulators also were questioned but 
did not say whether they were among those who also gave testimony 
that backed up grays assertions to the house panel last week 
all five of the senators have acknowledged taking campaign money 
from keating and interceding on his behalf all five likewise 
have denied any wrongdoing 
the san jose calif mercury news reported sunday that cranston 
continued to intercede with grays successor m danny wall 
the paper quoted cranstons top aide roy f greenaway as 
acknowledging that the senator was pushing early this year for a 
quick sale of lincoln and said he did it because the sale would 
have averted a taxpayer bailout of the thrift and would have taken 
keating out of the savings and loan business even though 
keating would have remained an investor

entertainers headlined the demonstration and energized the crowd 
that stretched from the steps of the lincoln memorial along the 
reflecting pool to the washington monument

dcalif urged the crowd that waved signs and chanted prochoice 
slogans for about five hours on a sunny mild autumn day while 
the other side is out bombing abortion clinics well be electing

women this will be the issue of 1990 
the washington rally organized by now was the largest of a 
string of demonstrations and other events that began sunday morning 
with a sunrise service in kennebunk maine near president bushs 
vacation retreat in kennebunkport 
more than 300000 prochoice activists rallied at the capitol in 
april in anticipation of a supreme court ruling in a missouri 
abortion case 
the court left intact its landmark 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion but the justices gave the states broad authority to 
restrict womens rights to terminate their pregnancies 
the supreme court did us a great favor said mary ann baker 
of youngstown ohio it got us off our complacent behinds 
the court will hear three cases later this month and in december 
seeking to further restrict a womans right to abortion 
galvanized by election victories for prochoice candidates 
earlier this month in virginia and new jersey demonstrators said 
they were encouraged that politicians would not be able to ignore

being antiabortion is a bad position to be in said elizabeth 
chipley of vienna va a washington suburb who was accompanied by 
her husband and two daughters

concerned that president bushs stand against abortion will hurt 
the republican party and mar an administration they worked to put 
in office

jennifer salandi of darnestown md i dont want to see it damage 
the whole party she said but added that many women are going 
to vote democratic because of this issue

yarrow and mary travers helped to entertain the crowd 
about 30 antiabortion demonstrators gathered near the lincoln 
memorial in an area that was roped off from the prochoice 
demonstrators a few carried signs and one demonstrator used a 
megaphone to address abortionrights activists who drowned him out 
with their own chants of prochoice prochoice 
one man was arrested for demonstrating without a permit when he 
ventured beyond his designated area he was fined 50 and released 
a woman arrested for disorderly conduct was fined 25 and released 
meanwhile two women running for governor said the recent 
prochoice election victories will buoy their chances and those of 
other abortionrights candidates 
diane feinstein a former democratic mayor of san francisco and 
candidate for governor in california said more women must be 
elected to top political jobs because we can best plead our 
case and the message she said is keep your hands off our 
right to choose 
lt gov joann zimmerman of iowa a democrat running for 
governor urged that politicians feet be kept to the fire to 
assure that someone who says they are prochoice will not later 
vote otherwise 
we must elect people who will not trade us off she said

two senior bush administration officials on 
sunday called this weekends guerrilla offensive in el salvador a 
desperate move by the insurgents and said they expect the 
usbacked government to be able to handle it without assistance 
leftist rebels attacked the residence of rightwing president 
alfredo cristiani and other official buildings saturday night and 
occupied several sectors of the northern part of san salvador 
where fighting continued sunday 
defense secretary dick cheney appearing on nbcs meet the 
press program said he did not believe us military personnel 
would get involved 
weve got of course advisers in el salvador but i think the 
government of el salvador can handle it he said 
the pentagon chief added that i think theres a bit of a view 
that the attack on the city basically is a move of desperation by 
the guerrillas that the fmln farabundo marti national liberation 
front is under a lot pressure from the salvadoran government 
and that this is an effort to try to dramatize their posture 
hours later cristiani announced a dusk to dawn curfew and 
declared a state of siege in an address on salvadoran radio and 
television the state of siege approved by the cabinet restricts 
transit the freedom of expression rights of assembly and privacy 
of correspondence the legislative assembly would vote on the 
measure monday 
the white house would not comment on the new developments said 
spokeswoman alixe glen 
secretary of state james a baker iii interviewed on abcs 
this week with david brinkley said that as far as we know 
this morning the american community is accounted for that is 
the americans resident in el salvador and the diplomats and 
military people that we have there 
i can tell you that i believe there has been one american 
casualty a schoolteacher killed there are no other american 
casualties as far as i know he said he did not identify the 
teacher 
baker said that this appears to be an action that te 
insurgency in el salvador the fmln has undertaken a rather 
desperate action in my view to disrupt the negotiations that 
they were having with the government towards seeking a political 
accommodation 
the secretary of state said he does not believe the offensive 
threatens to destabilize the salvadoran government because i 
think the government of el salvador can handle this militarily and 
defensively 
the attacks came three days after the fmln promised to intensify 
its decadeold insurgency against the usbacked government more 
than 70000 people have been killed in the guerrilla war

republican governors gathered 
sunday to take political stock after the partys 1989 setbacks and 
their leaders said that with better candidates and better handling 
the gop can avoid trouble on the abortion issue in 1990 
three of the governors agreed at an opening night news 
conference that republican candidates should spell out clear 
positions on the issue and avoid being typecast as antiabortion 
gov carroll a campbell jr of south carolina the conference 
host said republicans running in 1989 allowed themselves to be 
cornered on the issue by the news media and by their democratic 
opponents 
the problem with republicans is that they have not gone out in 
advance and told the public what they believe in campbell said 
he said the democrats defined the issue in their own terms this 
year 
youll beat nothing with something every time you put it on 
the table he said 
gov mike hayden of kansas chairman of the republican governors 
association said this years elections point to the need for 
aggressive efforts to recruit strong gop candidates in 1990 asked 
whether he was suggesting that the republicans who lost last 
tuesday werent strong candidates hayden said well they didnt 
win 
gov john ashcroft of missouri the vice chairman also sought 
to play down the issue saying the political trouble is at the 
extremes and that the antiabortion plank of the 1988 republican 
platform wont define the positions gop candidates for governor 
take in 1990 
vice president dan quayle and lee atwater the party chairman 
were the featured political performers at the governorss twoday 
resort conference 
it opened sunday with several of the governors and quayle 
playing golf in advance of formal sessions planned monday and 
tuesday 
fifteen of the 22 republican governors were due to attend the 
annual conference that overall number will go down by one when new 
jersey switches hands with the inauguration of a democrat next year 
republicans were defeated there and in virginia where the 
incumbent is a democrat in last tuesdays offyear balloting the 
virginia election was the closest in state history and a recount 
is likely 
democrats claimed major headway in elections across the nation 
and the republicans could only say as president bush did wait 
until next year 
quayles keynote address at the conference on monday is likely 
to look toward the next campaign when 36 states will elect 
governors 34 will choose senators and all 435 house seats will be 
at stake 
atwater will concentrate on the politics of reapportionment in 
his report to the governors the state governments shaped in the 
1990 elections will be in charge of reapportioning house seats on 
the basis of next years census and republicans fear that the 
democrats who have controlled the house for 35 years may draw 
district lines that will strengthen that advantage 
the governors also are to hear reports on the twin problems of 
crime and drugs from attorney general dick thornburgh and william 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
their final conference session on tuesday is to deal with 
education

kinder and it is not gentler to force a woman to remain pregnant 
against her will 
the protesters carried plastic imitation candles as in san 
francisco 
here at dawn we kindle a thousand points of light our own 
thousand points of light to say that we will never again accept 
the darkness of back alley despair never return to the dark ages 
of pain and abuse said kate michelman executive director of the 
national abortion rights action league 
a handful of abortion opponents marched in front of the 
kennebunk church some waving signs reading abortion is murder 
the church service was followed by a march to bushs home in 
neighboring kennebunkport bush was not at the familys estate 
the renewed debate on abortion stems from the supreme courts 
ruling july 3 upholding missouri laws restricting abortion by 
banning the use of public funds employees and facilities to 
perform abortions and by requiring doctors to test fetuses for 
viability in some cases 
in pennsylvania the state senate will consider a bill tuesday 
that requires husbands be notified of abortions a 24hour waiting 
period and prohibits abortions based on the sex of the fetus 
backed by gov robert p casey the bill has passed the house 
and is expected to clear the senate making pennsylvania the first 
state to enact abortion restrictions since the supreme court ruling

an environmental mystery is springing up 
along interstate highway medians from boston to philadelphia how 
did those fluffy yellow wildflowers usually found along beaches 
find their way inland 
this is kind of intriguing said leslie j mehrhoff a 
botanist with the connecticut department of environmental 
protection there are not many cases where you can watch a native 
plant undergo this kind of apparently rapid explosion into new 
habitats 
the plants called seaside goldenrod grow as high as 8 feet 
produce 6inchlong deepyellow clumps of flowers that linger into 
november they have been spotted in patches along interstate 91 in 
connecticut i84 in connecticut new york and pennsylvania and 
along the massachusetts pennsylvania and new jersey turnpikes 
part of the mystery is that the flower isnt found along some 
other interstates for instance it hasnt been seen along route 
128 near boston nor along i495 and it doesnt seem to grow on 
the massachusetts turnpike west of sturbridge 
why it drops out there is a mystery said bruce a sorrie 
staff botanist for the massachusetts natural heritage and 
endangered species program 
botanists say they dont know exactly when the plant began its 
move mehrhoff said she remembers seeing a few seaside goldenrod 
along i84 in the early 1980s since then it has spread quickly as 
time is measured in botanical terms its growth has been lightning 
quick 
we dont have any good data on movement of plant species at 
that kind of rate sorrie said 
botanists agree that road salt spread in the winter by highway 
crews may have helped the plant take hold since it ordinarily grows 
along salty beaches or marshes 
how they got inland is another question sorrie and mehrhoff 
said they couldnt remember any projects in which the flowers were 
planted sorrie said one theory is that goldenrod seeds were 
carried inland by cars and trucks 
but if so he asked why dont you see them along i495

thousands of peruvians defied rebel threats 
and voted sunday in mayoral elections maoist guerrillas trying to 
disrupt the balloting killed a candidate and blew up a church a 
school and power lines 
four people were killed sunday night including a mother and her 
baby when one of the victims stepped on a mine on a road a few 
miles north of the andean city of huancayo police reported they 
said two people in nearby concepcion were electrocuted sunday by 
power lines after guerrillas of the maoist shining path movement 
blew up a utility pole 
authorities extended voting in lima for two hours to accommodate 
lines of people waiting to cast ballots but voting was slower in 
the andean highlands where a rebeldecreed strike paralyzed public 
transportation 
an exit poll commissioned by television channel 5 showed ricardo 
belmont an independent the clear winner in limas mayoral race 
with 496 percent of the vote 
juan inchaustegui runnerup in the field of nine candidates 
with 26 percent conceded defeat and congratulated belmont 
inchaustegui was the candidate of a centerright coalition backing 
novelist mario vargas llosa in next aprils presidential election 
the main parties with candidates in most of the municipal races 
are the united left a marxistled alliance and the democratic 
front 
vargas llosa who is favored to win the presidential race 
called sundays vote very important to the future of our country 
to demonstrate that peruvians do not fear the extremist 
minorities that want to destroy our democracy 
although voting was heavy in lima and other large coastal 
cities the terror campaign by the shining path rebels frightened 
some voters 
officials said that in ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima and 
considered a shining path stronghold 687 percent of the votes 
cast were blank or null voting is required by law 
with peru suffering 3000 percent annual inflation and economic 
chaos the governing centerleft aprista party was given little 
chance of winning many mayoral races 
death threats by the rebels who have killed scores of officials 
and candidates this year frightened anyone from running for office 
in more than 80 municipalities 
we must put aside the threats and go forward said francisco 
vega 56 one of about 5000 voters who waited quietly outside a 
school in lurigancho a shantytown set amid sand dunes on the 
outskirts of lima 
i am voting because i believe in democracy not because 
someone is forcing me to said the 56yearold vega who like 
many in lurigancho migrated from the andes highlands in search of a 
better life 
soldiers armed with assault rifles patrolled the streets armed 
police and soldiers also provided heavy security at voting places 
authorities said shining path guerrillas shot and killed the 
aprista mayoral candidate early sunday in azangaro near the 
bolivian border 470 miles southeast of lima 
in huancayo capital of junin department 140 miles east of lima 
the rebels dynamited a church and a school early sunday 
the attacks followed more than 20 explosions around the city 
saturday night intended to disrupt the voting as the first stage in 
their campaign to block the presidential election next april 
rebels this year alone have killed more than 130 mayors local 
judges clerks council members and municipal candidates and 
hundreds more have resigned in fear for their lives 
some 10 million peruvians were registered to vote peru has 
1947 municipalities but election authorities said there were no 
candidates in at least 86 towns due to rebel death threats 
voting is required in the past voters have had to dip their 
middle fingers in purple ink that does not wear off easily in the 
days before the last presidential election in 1985 shining path 
rebels cut off the fingers of children in several highland villages 
in a warning to adults against voting 
rumors circulated around limas shantytowns that anyone who 
voted sunday would suffer the same fate the national election 
board left the decision of whether to use the ink up to local 
boards 
in lima election officials used the ink which is intended to 
prevent repeat balloting

a former savings and loan regulator who told 
congress he was pressured by five senators to go easy on one of 
their major campaign contributors has been questioned by fbi agents 
apparently looking into whether laws were violated according to 
published reports 
meanwhile another newspaper said one of the five senators 
democrat alan cranston of california continued to intercede with 
federal regulators on behalf of financier charles h keating jr 
for two years after auditors urged the takeover of keatings 
lincoln savings and loan association 
edwin gray former head of the home loan bank board told the 
house banking committee last week that he was asked at an april 2 
meeting with four of the five senators to ease regulatory pressure 
on lincoln by dropping a rule barring the thrifts risky 
investments 
the four at the meeting were dennis deconcini dariz john 
mccain rariz cranston and john glenn dohio sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich has acknowledged making subsequent entreaties 
on keatings behalf although he did not attend the meeting 
together the five received 13 million in campaign 
contributions from keating who has told reporters he certainly 
hoped his contributions had bought influence with the senators 
although it is not clear when the fbi questioning reported by 
the boston globe on saturday and the washington post on sunday 
began the chief of the justice departments public integrity 
section wrote to common cause on oct 24 that the department would 
thoroughly review the political watchdogs call for an 
investigation into whether keatings actions violated federal 
election laws or other laws 
while declining to comment on whether the fbi is conducting an 
investigation a justice department official pointed out sunday 
that such interviews by agents would be normal practice in a 
preliminary review of allegations that laws had been violated 
the globes report saturday quoted two wellplaced sources 
as saying gray was interviewed by agents last week and that gray 
declined to confirm whether he was questioned the report did not 
say whether the interviews took place before or after grays 
congressional testimony 
the post account said other regulators also were questioned but 
did not say whether they were among those who also gave testimony 
that backed up grays assertions to the house panel last week 
all five of the senators have acknowledged taking campaign money 
from keating and interceding on his behalf all five likewise 
have denied any wrongdoing 
the san jose calif mercury news reported sunday that cranston 
continued to intercede with grays successor m danny wall 
the paper quoted cranstons top aide roy f greenaway as 
acknowledging that the senator was pushing early this year for a 
quick sale of lincoln and said he did it because the sale would 
have averted a taxpayer bailout of the thrift and would have taken 
keating out of the savings and loan business even though 
keating would have remained an investor

just who will be leading the nations big three 
automakers in the 1990s is clearing up but only temporarily 
ford motor co said last week that vice chairman harold poling 
will become head of the nations no 2 automaker on march 1 when 
chairman donald petersen retires 
but theres a catch of sorts poling 64 will have the job for 
just three years 
thats kind of weird analyst kathleen heaney of nikko 
securities co international inc in new york said friday after the 
succession was announced so much for the old predictable ford 
most of the speculation centers on allan gilmour who on friday 
was named the next president of ford automotive group the 
companys vehiclemaking operation 
i think this three years is a period of time which the 
company is going to use to groom mr gilmour said analyst scott 
merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
succession speculation at ford is likely to continue for the 
next three years its a little clearer at least for the long 
term at general motors corp and chrysler corp 
in a reorganization announced earlier this year gerald 
greenwald was named a vice chairman at the no 3 us automaker 
making him the oddson replacement for lee iacocca whose contract 
with chrysler expires in early 1991 
at gm a board of directors task force has been looking this 
year for a successor to chairman roger smith who leaves office in 
late 1990 gm president robert stempel has been mentioned as the 
favorite but some bets are being put on executive vice president 
f alan smith no relation to the current chairman 
in most discussions of succession in automakers corner offices 
theres usually talk about whether the candidate is a car guy 
or a bean counter that is an executive who came up through 
the companys product or finance operations 
at gm the debate is clearest 
stempel 56 joined the automakers oldsmobile division as a 
detailer in the chassis design department he stayed in design or 
engineering operations en route to heading up the 
buickoldsmobilecadillac group in january 1984 and moving on to 
become the companys president and chief operating officer in 
september 1987 
stempel refuses to talk about who the next chairman will be gm 
spokesmen set a ground rule for reporters wishing to interview 
stempel that no questions be asked about who will succeed the 
chairman 
alan smith 58 was hired in june 1956 in the gm treasurers 
office in new york as a trainee and rose through the financial 
sector as did roger smith alan smith became executive vice 
president for finance in january 1981 
some of the blame for gms falling market share has been laid on 
roger smith for being too much of a bean counter and not enough 
of a car guy 
merlis said the nod should go to stempel partly because gms 
board has taken so much abuse about finance guys being in there 
most of iacoccas early experience was in product development at 
ford before he joined chrysler as president in 1978 when the 
company faced bleak financial times 
he led chryslers efforts to secure loans and federal guarantees 
that eventually bailed out the company greenwald came to chrysler 
as the companys controller shortly after iacocca did 
theres a common element in each of the potential chairmen each 
was in a leadership position when the auto industry took a serious 
dive in the early 1980s and each has had a hand in bringing the 
big three back to profitability 
all of the leadership in the auto industry merlis said 
reached the top of the organizations when we had experienced the 
worst automotive recession in postwar history 
theres no better training than to drive through hell in an 
automotive depression he said

ashland has spent or commited itself to spend on spillrelated 
damage and expense claims by individuals businesses and government 
agencies on civil penalties for a criminal fine for settlement 
of a classaction suit and for the cleanup 
the figure consists of about 14 million for damages expenses 
and civil penalties including the 4 million pennsylvania 
agreement 11 million for cleanup 225 million for a criminal 
fine and up to 16 million under the terms of a classaction 
settlement filed in us district court in pittsburgh last week

earnings according to ashland spokesman robert schrum ashland had 
to pay a 25 million deductible but insurance comvered the 
balance of the damage and cleanup costs he said
