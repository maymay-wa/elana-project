vice president dan quayle will visit panama 
honduras and jamaica this month aides said wednesday but one 
official said privately that other countries feeling resentment 
about the us invasion of panama were discouraging quayle visits 
at this time 
quayle himself said that diplomatic sensitivities have held 
up scheduling his trip to central and south america but he denied 
any lingering deep resentment among latin leaders after 
president bushs dec 20 invasion of panama 
no country has said we dont want the vice president 
period he told a luncheon gathering of the hoover institution 
however quayle later told a reporter there are diplomatic 
sensitivities theres a matter of timing on when you go theres a 
matter of coordination and these things have all got to be worked 
out 
it is anticipated that quayle instead of actually visiting as 
many of the countries as he originally might have will meet with 
many of their leaders when he attends presidential inaugurations in 
honduras on jan 27 and in brazil and chile in midmarch 
his office on wednesday announced he would go to panama and 
jamaica in conjunction with the honduras trip and would make 
other stops to be determined on his march 1016 south american 
trip for the inaugurations 
many latin officials have said opposition in their countries to 
the us military action is so strong that this would not be a good 
time for quayle to visit especially while the us combat troops 
remain in panama 
one administration official commenting only on condition of 
anonymity confirmed that some of the countries have passed along 
to quayle their reluctance to have him visit now 
the official said that the nations have not indicated they would 
reject quayle indefinitely just that this is a bad time 
by the end of this thing in a couple months we will have 
talked to everyone the official said 
venezuelan officials in washington have told reporters they 
would prefer that quayle not visit and the head of the countrys 
main opposition party eduardo fernandez said in caracas on 
wednesday a visit would not be convenient 
quayle aides wednesday night declined to confirm or deny a 
report in thursday editions of the new york times that quayle had 
dropped plans to stop in venezuela and mexico because of objections 
from those countries 
bush said in assigning quayle to visit the region that he 
understood the sensitivities of the latins to the us military 
action in their region and was sending quayle to explain the action 
was not taken lightly or without rationale 
asked if bush had underestimated the depth of reaction to the 
invasion the official replied bush spotted the problem a lot 
earlier than most 
quayle asked about the impact of the panama action on his trip 
said of the latin american leaders ive talked to a number of 
these people on the phone and i will be very surprised if i 
find deep resentment 
i do not believe that the heads of state are unhappy or 
resentful of our actions in panama i think they understand it 
thats one of the reasons im going down to find out what their 
true feelings are 
earlier quayle told the lunch group my mission is not one to 
apologize it is not an effort to mend fences but rather he 
said to consult with the latin leaders on how we make panama a 
successful democracy 
one venezuelan official said that in addition to perceiving the 
timing as a problem many people in countries quayle might visit 
object to him as the messenger because of his conservatism and his 
role as a principal cheerleader for the invasion 
the organization of american states voted to deplore the 
military action and some latin leaders have publicly viewed it as 
trampling on panamas sovereignty 
perus president alan garcia is protesting by saying he wont 
attend the upcoming drug summit in colombia if us invasion troops 
remain in panama he is sending a lower ranking representative of 
his government 
bush said wednesday he wants to withdraw the invasion force from 
panama as soon as possible but he feels under no pressure to 
get them out before the feb 15 drug summit 
bush in a photo session with gen maxwell thurman the 
commander of us forces in panama congratulated thurman and his 
troops for the outstanding job they did for our country 
he denied in response to a shouted question any difficulties 
finding countries willing to host quayle in the region

chinese authorities have intensified their 
suppression of the roman catholic church carrying out a wave of 
arrests of clergy loyal to the pope a church missionary bulletin 
reports 
asia news published by the institute for foreign missions said 
the chinese government has adopted a policy of hard repression of 
all dissent especially that of catholics 
it identified some among those it said were recently arrested as 
pietro liu guandong bishop of yixian giuseppe li side bishop of 
tianjian jiang liren bishop of hohot mattia lu zhensheng bishop 
of tianshui filippo yang lipo bishop of lanzhou paolo li 
zhenrung bishop of xianxian and bartolomeo yu chengdi bishop of 
hanzhong 
about 20 priests deacons and lay people have also been 
arrested asia news said in tuesdays report 
china broke diplomatic relations with the vatican in 1957 and 
allows worship only under the guise of the statesponsored chinese 
patriotic catholic church which consecrates its own bishops 
the church claims more than 3 million members but an unknown 
number of other catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope 
it is feared the wave of arrests could now extend to 
beijing said asia news adding that the statecontrolled church 
is investigating to identify the places where the proroman 
catholics celebrate their masses in secret 
the patriotic catholic church seems to actively participate in 
the repressive action collaborating with the police it said 
the missionary organization said its hong kong office compiled 
the information from sources in china and that all those arrested 
had practiced their religion clandestinely

one year after shots from a 
semiautomatic weapon shattered playtime and childhood innocence at 
an elementary school campus life appears to have returned to 
normal but fragile immigrant families are still healing 
the shootings helped lead to the nations first and only 
statewide ban on the sale of assault weapons 
the buildings at cleveland elementary have been painted and the 
blacktop repaved covering the bullet holes and blood stains where 
five children died and 29 other children and one teacher were 
injured 
behind the school two boys dribble a basketball up the steps of 
a classroom building near where on jan 17 1989 24yearold 
drifter patrick purdy fired 105 rounds from his ak47 assault 
rifle then used a handgun to kill himself 
but while the campus is free of noticeable scars the students 
and teachers are not some still carry bullet fragments inside 
their bodies and the wounded teacher limps from a bulletshattered 
knee about 100 children still attend weekly group therapy 
sessions many teachers also receive counseling 
the kinds of things the kids are expressing are still some 
fears of strangers fears of loud noises difficulty sleeping and 
nightmares said roger speed program chief for san joaquin 
county mental health services 
those symptoms are some of the same as for posttraumatic stress 
disorder a chronic ailment suffered by some vietnam war veterans 
war survivors and victims of rape and torture 
it remains to be seen whether these children are going to have 
a chronic problem or not speed said we dont know only time 
will tell 
school and county mental health authorities initiated counseling 
for students and staff immediately after the shooting with hopes 
of aiding the healing process and preventing problems later on 
but mental health therapy is not a miracle speed said 
its not something that solves everyones problems we cant 
guarantee that all of these kids are going to be problemfree 
for many of the children the shooting was the latest in a 
series of tragedies to befall their families about 60 percent of 
cleveland elementarys 1000 pupils are from southeast asian 
refugee families many of them already traumatized by war 
the five children who died by purdys bullets were of southeast 
asian descent four cambodian and one vietnamese an official 
report described purdy as emotionally disturbed and full of racial 
hatred 
the father of slain ram chun 8 frequently cries out for his 
dead daughter sometimes talking of suicide and occasionally 
requiring hospitalization the girls 16yearold brother ran away 
from home last april after being hospitalized for an emotional 
breakdown the father of slain sokhim an 6 has difficulty 
sleeping and worries about the safety of his four other children 
speed said the countys transcultural mental health clinic has 
seen its clientele double from 450 last year to nearly 900 
i cant say each one of those is directly related to the 
cleveland school incident he said but these are all southeast 
asian folks i know theyre all aware of the shooting i think it 
affects their anxiety about being separate from the community 
a twoweek teachers strike over pay issues that threatened to 
continue through the anniversary of the shooting created confusion 
for many families officials said the walkout ended monday night 
therapists also worried that widespread media attention to the 
anniversary could reopen psychological wounds the attention 
however also has affected society 
last may in the wake of the stockton shooting and escalating 
street gang violence the california legislature passed the 
nations first and only statewide ban on the sale of assault 
weapons 
the wounded teacher janet geng has returned to teaching and 
become an outspoken advocate of nationwide gun control 
boon khoonsrivong director of lao kmu association refugee 
resource center said community support after the shooting helped 
overcome some cultural barriers between southeast asian immigrants 
and other ethnic groups 
i think at first they thought that the thing was going to 
happen again that it might be discrimination but after that they 
could see that a lot of people are concerned the community is 
concerned about them and is doing something good about them he 
said

the overthrow of nicolae ceausescu may 
herald the return of freedom in romania but many of this 
transylvanian villages 2200 laborers say their store shelves 
remain bare and leaders are still corrupt 
nothing has changed says vasile grota who works on an 
assembly line in a leather factory we still have little to eat 
and the family is often cold 
mayor virgil cernusca and other newly installed community 
figures depicted villagers as generally content with their lot in 
the wake of the revolution and with the local officials now leading 
them 
but complaints by grota and others in poplaca about three miles 
outside of the regional capital of sibiu and 100 miles northwest of 
bucharest indicated that ordinary folk feel the revolution has 
left them in the lurch 
they believe that ceausescus energy and food rationing should 
be just a bad memory banished with the toppling and execution of 
the stalinist dictator and his wife and the plans to create a 
westernstyle democracy 
a month after the popular uprising however fuel for the tile 
stoves in poplacas modest houses is just as scarce as in the old 
days even though rationing officially has ended yards are bare 
except for a scrawny chicken or two scratching the frozen earth 
and the little food on display in the community grocery store 
strains small budgets to the limit 
as in other villages overt ceausescu loyalists have been 
replaced by new community leaders 
but angry villagers complain that appointments had been made 
from above by the regions provisional government in sibiu and 
they had no say in the selection just like under ceausescu so 
they remain distrustful of the new officials 
these are not our people said maria luca shaking her head 
wrapped in a black shawl we didnt put them in office they 
chose themselves 
many said the workplace also has changed little from the days 
when communist party appointees milked state farms and factories 
for personal gain 
they made themselves millionaires but didnt give anything to 
the workers said grota 59 
his voice rising indignantly grota said the director of his 
enterprise had not been replaced even though he had taken 10000 
in a production bonus last year and we got nothing grota said 
the haggard man wearing torn shirt and trousers his face 
blackened by soot from a futile attempt to light his wood stove 
wept as he aired old frustrations and new disappointments at a 
table crowding one of two dingy rooms he shares with his wife and 
infant daughter 
i had a yard full of animals grota sobbed relating the 
evils of ceausescus 24year tenure they took them all away from 
me and now i have trouble finding the 14 lei 150 to buy milk 
for my girl 
and the new leaders are no different he charged 
what have i gotten in return since the revolution two kilos 
44 pounds of wheat and i dont have wood for the winter because 
i dont have enough money 
grota waved in resignation when asked about village leaders 
these are still ceausescus people he said 
theyve got to change all of them even the teachers he 
said saying they had twisted childrens minds with the dictators 
vision of a socalist romania 
luca grotas neighbor added her voice to complaints about 
factory officials 
i also want to change all the leaders of our collective 
because they were part of the old order the bad ones she said 
suggesting that some held on to good jobs despite being in the pay 
of securitate ceausescus feared special police less than a 
month ago 
as the two spoke about 30 villagers gathered in front of 
grotas hovel and around the allterrain vehicle formerly owned by 
the ceausescus and now used by the local provisional government to 
transport foreign guests around the region 
many had marched the night before to express their general 
discontent with the course of the revolution 
give us new leaders some of them shouted as the western 
visitors emerged we dont have enough food

the publication of claude monets cookery notebooks 
reveals the father of impressionism as a tyrannical gourmet who 
could fly into a rage over a sauce 
monets cookery notebooks by claire joyes and published 
recently by editions du chene is a delightful look at the private 
life of the man who immortalized haystacks in the haze and water 
lilies floating under a quaint japanese footbridge 
the book is to be published in the united states in the spring 
by prentice hall 
a must for art buffs and food lovers alike monets cookbook 
with recipes tested and adapted by awardwinning chef joel robuchon 
is an authentic record taken from family notes 
like a social and cultural chronicle of the half century monet 
spent at his normandy country home in giverny from 1883 to 1926 
the notebooks detail monets likes and dislikes what he served to 
his friends and what his second wife alice had prepared for their 
eight children two were his six were hers on ordinary days and 
holidays it even tells how tables were set for picnics 
joyes an art historian found the handwritten notebooks tucked 
among letters photographs and other monet archives inherited by 
her husband jeanmarie toulgouat a greatgrandson of alice 
hoschede monet 
claire was the storyteller jeanmarie had the memory said 
benedicte servignat joyes editor at chene he never knew monet 
but he spent all his childhood vacations at the giverny farmhouse 
and remembered the cook marguerite and of course monets 
stepdaughter blanche who carried on all the culinary traditions 
after monets death 
toulgouat an artist and joyes live in the village of giverny 
near vernon but have nothing to do with monets renovated 
farmhouse now open to the public as a museum 
monet was a solid middleclass bon vivant but his daily 
routine was strictly regimented and it revolved totally around 
painting 
he rose before dawn to capture the variations of early morning 
light took a cold shower and breakfasted englishstyle on eggs 
and bacon grilled tripe sausages and cheese toast and orange 
marmelade 
he would spend the morning working on his studioboat with 
blanche also an artist back by 11 am they were ravenous and 
impatient to sit down to lunch 
joyes decribed monet as a demon for punctuality a first then 
a second stroke of the gong would assemble the scattered family in 
the dining room for lunch which was served at 1130 precisely 
monet would cough irritably on the very half second causing panic 
in the kitchen she wrote 
lunch invariably was a fivecourse extravaganza which included 
a fish course meat dish salad cheese a different homebaked 
dessert every day and cakes at 4 pm all prepared by the family 
cook marguerite 
monet never lingered over his food service had to be quick so 
he could get back to work he even ordered servants never to pass 
dishes around twice when his american stepsoninlaw theodore 
butler was lunching with them since butlers slow eating habits 
drove monet mad 
lunch was a social affair often with guests tea was served 
under the lime trees always at 400 friends were never invited 
for dinner because monet was always in bed by 930 the uninvited 
even close friends were politely turned away 
though alice ran the house she consulted monet in planning 
menus which revolved around the fruit and vegetables in season and 
which catered to the special tastes of a roster of illustrious 
guests like renoir cezanne and premier georges clemenceau who 
loved the waterlilies 
monet and his family arrived in giverny in may in 1883 despite 
their precarious financial situation they immediately set about 
renovating the kitchen and landscaping the wild gardens which 
sloped gently down to wide meadows and a small pond 
monet was obssessed with order in his flower gardens but he was 
fanatical about the picking schedule of his fruit and vegetables 
grown and nurtured in a 2acre walled kitchen garden on the other 
side of the town 
constantly looking to expand and improve an impressive array of 
herbs and vegetables he would spend evenings leafing through 
scholarly publications to find new seeds to test in the rich and 
often wet norman soil 
joyes described monet as equally fanatical about the poultry he 
was served spending an inordinate amount of time choosing ducks 
and hens to be used for breeding stock he just didnt trust 
local farmers

with chinas bestknown dissidents jailed exiled 
or in hiding a popular folk singer is trying to fill the void with 
protest songs and calls for democracy 
you could say im the worlds stupidest most amateur 
dissident said hou dejian laughing and shaking his head in mock 
selfridicule 
im not a politician i had friends who were dissidents but 
im a professional musician he said with elaborate emphasis 
but right now im trying to figure out how to become a passable 
dissident 
hou 33 is no ordinary mainland musician he is the 
taiwaneseborn son of a nationalist soldier who fought against the 
communists seeking his roots hou visited the communist mainland 
as an established star in 1983 and decided to stay 
the darling of the government he was allowed to keep living 
like a star with two homes and two cars one a maroon mercedes 
benz 
the skinny chainsmoking hou usually clad in black leather 
jacket and boots is famous among chinese on the mainland taiwan 
and hong kong for his bob dylaninfluenced songs about social 
concerns such as the endangered pandas and about the worries of 
youth 
but he became known to westerners when in the final days of 
chinas student democracy movement last spring he and three 
friends began a hunger strike in tiananmen square to protest 
martial law many students were already leaving the square out of 
fear and the hunger strike infused the movement with new spirit 
less than 48 hours later on june 4 with tanks poised on the 
squares edge hou negotiated with the army to allow the remaining 
students to retreat peacefully possibly saving hundreds of lives 
now he is again trying to keep the spirit of democracy alive 
taking advantage of his relative freedom as a defector 
i can say more than ordinary chinese hou said so he has 
begun making a little noise giving interviews to foreign 
journalists and singing for them the halfdozen songs he has 
written about the democracy movement songs he knows no mainland 
company can record now 
friends who love freedom spread our wings one ballad goes 
listen carefully no one can lie again open your eyes no one 
can twist the truth again 
hou has not worked out any philosophy of government or theories 
about the relative merits of communism and capitalism im not a 
political scientist i say ask all the chinese people and then 
decide 
all he wants is provide an alternative to the communist party 
voice that has filled the airwaves and newspapers since june with 
relentless condemnation of the democracy movement 
because you cant hear other voices that doesnt mean theres 
stability he said choosing words carefully while he picked out 
chords on his electric guitar 
we have an ancient tyrant culture a real change would mean 
changing the slaves not changing the tyrant although its been 
slow there is change most people in beijing took part in the 
movement and they are not as afraid as before 
hou said the movement wiped away his feeling of being an 
outsider on the mainland 
that is why during the summer when he hid from police for more 
than two months in the australian embassy he did not apply for 
asylum he came out aug 15 as soon as the foreign ministry 
promised he would not be arrested or deported 
some chinese suspected a deal when he told government television 
two days later that he did not see anyone killed in tiananmen 
square during the june 34 army attack authorities insist no one 
died in the square while acknowledging about 300 deaths elsewhere 
in the city 
but hou said he made no deal i can only say i didnt see 
anyone die that doesnt prove no one died 
two of the three friends who went on the hunger strike with hou 
remain jailed one was freed in december 
hou was tailed by police for a while and has not been allowed so 
far to travel inside china or to australia where his wife pop 
singer cheng lin fled in june 
but his main punishment has been loss of his career stores have 
been told not to sell his records and he cannot sing his new songs 
in public hou said he has no interest in singing the old ones 
he has begun selling his music equipment for money i had a 
lot of money but i spent a lot he said with a grin i dont 
save nonetheless he has turned his threeroom beijing apartment 
into a hostel for friends fired because they protested and gives 
money to other former protesters who seek help 
i dont like being a dissident i cant stand it hou said 
selfmocking again he remembered fang lizhi chinas most famous 
dissident who has been hiding in the us embassy in beijing since 
june 
maybe when fang lizhi comes out he can continue his dissidence 
and i can go back to being a musician

several us airlines said tuesday they were raising air fares 
again to offset jet fuel costs the second such hike in two weeks 
by major carriers and one of the airlines announced a fuel 
surcharge 
united airlines usair and northwest airlines said they planned 
to increase by 10 percent selected oneway discount fares often 
used by business travelers 
american which on monday confirmed plans for a 10 percent hike 
on similar fares also plans to add a 6 oneway fuel surcharge 
effective feb 9 on all tickets 
in addition united american and northwest are adding a 
threeday advance purchase requirement and usair a sevenday 
advance purchase rule for oneway discount fares that now dont 
require advance purchase 
the changes are effective jan 24 for northwest and feb 1 for 
american and usair 
under americans changes an unrestricted oneway fare between 
chicago and dallas which was 314 on jan 1 increased to 327 on 
jan 11 and would go to 360 on feb 1 when it must be purchased 
three days in advance another 6 would be added on feb 9 
spokesmen for continental airlines delta air lines and eastern 
airlines said those carriers are studying the 10 percent fare hike 
earlier this month industry leader american and other big us 
airlines raised fares by 4 percent to help pay fuel costs while 
northwest and others imposed a special fuel surcharge the first 
such charge since the 1970s oil crisis the 4 percent hike took

roundtrip tickets starting feb 1 said mary oneill a 
spokeswoman for american in fort worth texas

12 round trip on all tickets effective feb 9 
northwest previously planned a 612 surcharge also to take 
effect feb 9 usair spokeswoman susan young said a surcharge was

fuel costs that we are seeing said al becker a spokesman for 
american 
he said the price american pays for jet fuel has jumped from an 
average 58 cents a gallon at the beginning of 1989 to around 96 
cents as oil prices have surged jet fuel generally represents 
around 35 percent of an airlines operating budget 
the fuel surcharges do not require government approval for 
domestic flights most of the airlines imposing them earlier this 
month said they have sought permission from foreign governments to 
apply them to international flights 
last week american and united also raised most of their cargo 
rates to help offset fuel costs

a senate bill to establish federal 
drugtesting standards for private companies is coming under fire 
from the chairman of a house panel as a horrible invasion of 
americans rights 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights said tuesday the 
measure would encourage drug testing that is terribly expensive 
and doesnt do any good 
the bill might have support when congress returns next week 
edwards said with the drug hysteria that is being fanned by 
president bush and his hardline macho approach almost daily 
meanwhile mandatory random testing for drugs and alcohol went 
into effect tuesday for the 90000 men and women who operate the 
nations railroads 
the bill by sens orrin hatch rutah and david boren dokla 
would not require businesses to test employees but give them the 
clear right to do so a provision supporters said would prevent 
unwarranted court challenges to drugtesting policies 
former surgeon general c everett koop endorsing the bill said 
court challenges discourage companies from implementing 
drugtesting programs he said such testing deters workers from 
using alcohol and drugs on the job 
hatch said the measure would protect privacy rights by 
establishing guidelines for circumstances under which businesses 
can test their workers 
under the measure drug and alcohol tests would have to be 
analyzed at a federally certified lab tests could be conducted 
before workers are hired during annual physical exams and any time 
for workers who had gone through a drug rehabilitation program 
random testing could be conducted only for sensitive 
employees or workers who the employer says deal with matters 
connected to national security health or safety the environment 
or require a high degree of trust and confidence 
the american civil liberties union considers the guidelines 
vague and too broad said the groups legislative representative 
gene guerrero 
the aclu also opposes the measure because it would preempt state 
laws that do more to protect workers guerrero said sixteen states 
now have drugtesting laws and several of those laws are more 
protective of workers privacy rights than the hatchboren measure 
he said 
the railroad drug and alcohol testing began one year after drug 
abuse was singled out as a factor in a 1987 amtrakconrail crash 
near baltimore that killed 16 people and injured 175 
the testing program delayed because a lengthy series of court 
battles between the government and railroad unions requires that 
at least 25 percent of railroad engineers brakemen dispatchers 
signalmen conductors and all other railroad employees directly 
involved in the movement of trains be subjected to random testing 
this year 
half of the operations personnel of the nations largest 
railroads must be tested by the end of 1991 for the presence of 
alcohol and such drugs as marijuana cocaine opiates 
amphetamines and phencyclidine also known as pcp

dozens of state legislatures are in the position of a 
supermarket shopper with a full cart and an empty wallet 
declining tax revenues have made budget problems the top issue 
facing at least 20 states this year and among the major issues in 
most other states even as they are pressed by such weighty 
matters as abortion drug abuse education and the environment 
all but a few smaller states will hold 1990 legislative 
sessions most beginning this month or next 
some states particularly in the northwest have managed to 
avoid fiscal pitfalls but most have fallen victim to an unexpected 
plunge in tax revenues 
the most desperate states are in the northeast where lawmakers 
are trying to bail out of potential deficits that include 15 
billion in new york 500 million in massachusetts 400 million in 
connecticut 80 million in new hampshire 67 million in maine and 
30 million in maryland 
notheastern governors have proposed raising taxes in 
massachusetts canceling a tax cut in new york raising sin 
taxes in new hampshire and imposing a junk food snack tax in 
maryland 
the northeast is far and away in the worst shape of any 
region said marcia howard research director for the national 
association of state budget officers i cant think of another 
state that is in as bad shape as any of the states in new england 
ms howard puts the blame on sluggish corporate profits that 
produced lowerthanexpected corporate income tax revenues i 
think the states that have the biggest problems are the states that 
rely most heavily on that tax she said 
midwestern states generally have coped with the downturn she 
said because their expectations are so low that its not 
difficult to meet them still some states are having problems 
missouris senate appropriations committee chairman roger wilson 
has warned agencies to decide who gets into the lifeboat first 
most southern states have taken in as much income as they 
expected ms howard said but that doesnt mean theyre wealthy 
louisiana is still slipping on lost oil revenues and hurricane 
hugo blew away any hope of budget surpluses in the carolinas 
i think if no frills has ever been identified with a budget 
it will be this year said south carolina state rep james w 
johnson jr i think we are going to do well to tread water and 
stay where we are 
californias budget was shaken up by the bay area earthquake 
but several other western states are in decent shape legislators 
in washington and utah face the pleasant task of deciding what to 
do with extra money 
perhaps the least pleasant task awaiting legislators this year 
is deciding whether to adopt more stringent abortion regulations 
nearly every legislature will have to confront what alabama state 
sen chip bailey calls the most controversial issue any 
legislature will deal with in the next decade 
drug abuse is another highprofile dilemma that is expected to 
be a major issue in more than a dozen states 
in georgia democratic house leaders have prepared a package of 
more than 40 bills for what they call a death on drugs 
campaign ranging from increased penalties for drug traffickers 
to improved antidrug educational programs republicans and 
democratic gov joe frank harris are proposing their own antidrug 
packages 
several states including alabama new york and rhode island 
are considering proposals to suspend the drivers licenses of 
convicted drug users people seem to cherish their drivers 
license and i think that would be an effective penalty rhode 
island gov edward diprete said 
finances abortion and drugs are issues that transcend local and 
regional boundaries but many of the issues facing legislatures are 
more parochial 
the big issue in delaware is providing paramedic service to two 
counties that arent already served in arizona lawmakers are 
squabbling over the martin luther king holiday in illinois its a 
proposal to legalize mississippi riverboat gambling to pay 
education bills what state rep ej zeke giorgi calls a 
conspicuous good use of bad money 
and in new jersey and neighboring pennsylvania no issue is 
getting more attention than high auto insurance rates that 
prompted stephen macnett chief counsel to pennsylvanias senate 
republicans to ask is there any other issue

top us and mexican officials maintain 
antidrug cooperation between the nations has never been better 
but many mexicans are still angry over their countrys bad image in 
a tv miniseries on the slaying of an american drug agent 
the consejo nacional de la publicidad the national advertising 
council took out fullpage ads in three major us newspapers on 
tuesday to outline mexicos antidrug efforts and to ask what 
have you done in the usa 
the miniseries on the kidnapping torture and murder of drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena in 1985 and the 
subsequent coverup by mexican officials called drug wars the 
camarena story aired jan 7 8 and 9 on nbctv it generated a 
great deal of controversy in mexico 
i think its obvious that the mexicans were deeply chagrined 
by the nbc series one bush administration official said on 
condition of anonymity 
the newspaper ads read in mexico we say no a las drogas 
which means no to drugs they recount drug seizures 
destruction of poppy and marijuana fields arrests and sentences of 
drugrelated criminals and the killing of 41 public servants in the 
line of duty 
they conclude and meanwhile what have you done in the 
usa 
we ran this advertisement in the washington post the new york 
times and the los angeles times in reaction to a certain television 
miniseries because we wanted to rectify the damage that could have 
been done to mexicos image said dionisio ascobereta director 
general of the consejo nacional de la publicidad the national 
advertising council 
the council a nonprofit organization made up of about 60 
advertising agencies is separate from the government ascobereta 
said in a telephone interview from mexico city 
the council has participated in public service campaigns in 
mexico to prevent drug abuse and drunken driving and keep the 
streets clean 
according to rates quoted by representatives of the three 
papers the ads cost a total of about 124340 to run 
theres been a strong reaction by the mexican government to 
the miniseries dea spokesman frank shults said tuesday adding 
it hasnt had any negative impact on our ability to conduct our 
international program with mexico at least not to my knowledge 
acting deputy dea administrator terrence burke was in mexico 
last week and had very productive meetings with people in the 
mexican attorney generals office shults said 
fernando arias chief spokesman for mexican attorney general 
enrique alvarez del castillo said last friday now more than 
ever the relationship between our nations is friendly 
particularly among those dedicated to fighting drug trafficking 
the events in the miniseries occurred during the previous 
administration in mexico president carlos salinas de gortari who 
took office in december 1988 has cracked down on drug trafficking 
and corruption 
but mexican embassy officials strongly criticized the show and 
nbc news segments that accompanied the broadcasts contending they 
were inaccurate and unfairly depicted widespread corruption among 
mexican authorities 
lloyd siegel executive producer for special broadcasts at nbc 
news said mexican embassy officials refused invitations to appear 
on the discussion panels 
we do not accept the charge that there were any inaccuracies 
or inconsistencies in the reporting siegel said last week 
last friday the government newspaper el nacional published a 
frontpage story accusing camarena of being corrupt allegations 
heatedly denied by us officials 
there is not a scintilla of evidence whatsoever that enrique 
camarena was involved with the traffickers in any way other than an 
adversarial role shults said when that story appeared 
camarena 37 was kidnapped feb 7 1985 in guadalajara 
mexico his mexican pilot alfredo zavala avalar was kidnapped a 
few days later their bulletriddled bodies showing signs of 
torture were found march 5 1985 wrapped in plastic bags and 
buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of 
guadalajara 
drug traffickers rafael caro quintero 37 ernesto rafael 
fonseca carillo 56 and 10 other men have been prosecuted and 
sentenced in mexico for the killings but us officials believe 
some higherlevel mexican authorities were involved in protecting 
the drug traffickers and helping cover up the crime

abcs world news tonight regained its 
winning ways in weekly ratings but dan rathers oncedominant 
cbs evening news was third in ratings last week ac nielsen 
co audience estimates show 
abcs newscast anchored by peter jennings easily won the week 
ending jan 14 with a ratings average of 119 it was the 12th time 
this season the program has triumphed over cbss newscast 
according to an abc spokesman the previous week cbs was on top 
tom brokaws nbc nightly news which has been in third 
place was second in ratings last week with a 109 average 
rathers newscast was third by a narrow margin of onetenth of a 
point 
each point represents 921000 homes 
last week one major cbs affiliate kpixtv in san francisco 
shifted rathers program to an earlier 530 pm pst start time 
but it isnt known yet if that was a factor in the weeks 
nielsen returns for the program said michael eisenberg cbs vice 
president for audience measurement 
we couldnt point to that as the only reason right now he 
said tuesday were studying the matter and trying to find out 
what the reasons are 
at a news conference in los angeles during the weekend rather 
and cbs news president david burke said they were unable to explain 
the ratings slide 
but each discounted speculation that some of it was due to 
rathers muchpublicized onair confrontation with then gop 
presidential candidate george bush during a cbs evening news 
interview in early 1988 
burke blamed part of the ratings problems on what he called 
statistical errors in the nielsen ratings system and on the 
programs of other broadcast outlets such as the 24hour cable news 
network 
there is increasing competition from cnn which means you 
dont have to make an appointment to watch the news anymore you 
have it on all the time and i think they do a fine job he said

idaho attorney general jim jones says the 
supreme court now has a chance to correct a travesty of justice 
that silences some of our tiniest sex abuse victims while 
benefitting their molesters 
jones strong reaction came after the court said tuesday it will 
use cases from maryland and idaho to decide whether children may be 
forced to have facetoface meetings with the adults charged with 
abusing them 
courts in both states threw out childabuse convictions because 
defendants were not given a chance for such confrontations 
jones said those decisions pose an unacceptable roadblock to 
prosecution of child molesters adding many sex abuse 
prosecutions cant be pursued without the use of incriminating 
statements made by young sex abuse victims 
many states in recent years have taken steps to protect young 
crime victims such as allowing a child to testify by 
closedcircuit television rather than in the presence of the 
defendant 
the courts decisions expected by july could spell out what 
steps are necessary to meet the constitutional requirement that 
in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right 
to be confronted with the witnesses against him 
maryland attorney general joseph curran said this is a 
crucial case for the protection of the most vulnerable of victims 
our children 
we want the supreme court to recognize that children who have 
been traumatized by child abuse should not be forced to submit to 
additional traumatization by having to come facetoface with their 
alleged assailants in open court curran said 
the courts review of the two childabuse cases marks its second 
venture into that area of the law within the past two years 
the justices in 1988 struck down an iowa mans sexualassault 
conviction because two 13yearold girls were allowed to testify 
while protected by a large screen placed in the courtroom between 
them and him 
but that ruling the result of splintered voting among the 
justices appeared to leave unanswered whether there may be 
exceptions to the facetoface requirement 
in one of the new cases marylands highest court threw out 
sandra a craigs conviction saying her 7yearold accuser and 
three other young witnesses wrongly were allowed to testify against 
her over closedcircuit television 
mrs craig had been convicted of sexually molesting a girl who 
attended her clarksville md daycare center for two years before 
it was closed in 1986 she had been sentenced to 10 years in prison 
for her 1987 conviction on those charges 
she also faces trial on charges stemming from allegations of 
molestation of 12 other children who attended her center 
in the idaho case the issue is whether a defendants right to 
confrontation was violated by the testimony of a pediatrician who 
had examined a 2yearold girl allegedly abused by her father 
laura lee wright and robert giles were convicted in idaho of 
lewd conduct committed on mrs wrights two daughters who were 
then 5 and 2 
mrs wright was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the state 
supreme court threw out her conviction last june 13 and ordered a 
new trial 
the state court ruled the trial judge wrongly allowed a 
pediatrician who had examined the 2yearold to testify about what 
she told him the girl did not testify at the trial and therefore 
could not be crossexamined by mrs wrights lawyer 
in other matters tuesday the court 
agreed to decide in an alabama case what authority police have 
to stop and question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip 
refused to let a 10month strike by machinists against eastern 
airlines spread through sympathy work stoppages to commuter 
railroads in new york city philadelphia and their suburbs

public fear of pesticides is growing and 
politicians are poised to tighten regulations but a researcher 
says incomplete information on the extent of agricultural chemical 
use could lead to bad law 
as a nation we are in the middle of a major assessment of the 
role of pesticides in agriculture said leonard gianessi of the 
resources for the future a nonprofit environmental research group 
which held a seminar on pesticides tuesday 
if lawmakers are set on making changes they should first gather 
more information on the use of pesticides he said 
otherwise we stand a good chance of dropping many pesticides 
and thereby causing negative consequences that cannot be fully 
anticipated gianessi said 
gianessi said most reports on pesticides focus only on major 
field crops and many are out of date 
for example the last reports for kansas and missouri were 
done in 1978 he said some state have never released any 
pesticide use information at all 
he said the federal government did its last multistate 
pesticide use surveys for fruit and vegetable crops in 1978 and 
its last survey for citrus crops in 1977 
detailed information is needed to develop effective food residue 
monitoring programs said the researcher he added that because 
monitoring is expensive it should be targeted to areas where 
pesticide use is high 
furthermore lawmakers should have a realistic view of 
pesticides if they are to fashion regulations on their use 
pesticides have made it possible to grow highvalue crops in 
regions of the country where such crops could not normally be 
produced said gianessi 
lawmakers also would benefit from better information from 
consumers on their specific concerns about pesticides said carol 
kramer another researcher who spoke at the seminar 
there are a couple of studies of consumer reaction to 
extraordinary contamination of incidents where sales dropped 
precipitously she said however there are no good studies of 
demonstrated routine consumer willingness to pay more for 
pesticidefree food products 
she also said a number of grocery stores are experimenting with 
organically grown produce 
but at this time we cannot answer the fundamental question of 
how much perceived risk from pesticides consumers are willing to 
accept and how much they are willing to pay to get what they 
want she said 
legislation has been introduced in both the house and senate 
that would revise pesticide regulation president bush also has 
presented ideas he would like incorporated into any new law 
the 1990 farm bill is also expected to contain provisions that 
in some way will encourage a change in the way chemicals are used 
in agriculture

arisen since last months revolution

otherthrow and execution of dictator nicolae ceausescu in a bloody 
popular uprising

senate minority leader bob dole claiming the 
white houses blessing wants to provide new aid to emerging 
democracies in eastern europe and panama by trimming aid across the 
board to traditional allies 
within hours of the proposal voiced at a news conference 
tuesday and in an opinion column in the new york times 
denunciations came from israel and assorted lobbyists for other 
countries that would lose out under the plan 
but state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called it 
well worth looking at dole said president bush himself had 
told him he appreciated it which he took as an endorsement 
at a news conference dole proposed a 5 percent cut in us aid 
to all countries now protected by congressional earmarks the 
largest of wich are israel egypt pakistan turkey the 
philippines el salvador greece and honduras that would free 
about 400 million to help encourage fledgling democracies he said 
some of these countries have to realize there are fewer 
tensions in the world and maybe some of their demands can be 
reduced because we have new players in the foreign aid field 
dole said 
dole said he already had received a call from the 
americanisrael public affairs committee expressing alarm about the 
proposal the group issued a statement calling for new aid to 
emerging democracies but adding we believe it should not be at 
the expense of other vital us foreign policy objectives we must 
try not to hurt some allies in the process of helping other 
allies 
nobody will like it dole said but it seems to me fair 
and across the board of israel he added we have limits 
israel has gotten a lot of preferential treatment 
the israeli embassy in washington issued a statement agreeing 
that historic change was occurring in eastern europe but noting 
the winds of change have failed to reach the middle east and the 
dangers israel faces have even increased 
cutting military assistance to israel at this delicate stage 
of the peace process will send a negative message the statement 
said cutting economic assistance at a time israel gears itself 
towards the absorption of hundreds of thousands of jewish 
immigrants would make it almost impossible to meet this challenge 
tutwiler said further talks with congressional leaders on the 
proposal would be scheduled soon but she carefully couched the 
administrations position as one of support for increased 
flexibility in doling out us foreign aid dollars and not an 
intent to cut any specific countrys current quota 
one early reaction came from sen howard metzenbaum dohio who 
suggested the money instead come from cuts in the defense budget 
foreshadowing a major battle that will occupy congress when it 
convenes its 1990 session next week 
and rep charles schumer dny contended the united states 
has gotten more out of the assistance it has directed to israel 
than any other foreign aid program it conducts israel has long 
been americas most dependable ally 
of this years 146 billion foreign aid program 92 percent has 
been earmarked by congress for specific recipients leaving just 
12 billion for the administration to spread thinly among dozens 
of friendly needy nations as many as a dozen friendly countries 
will get nothing this year because of lack of money 
israel at 3 billion is the top recipient of us aid for 
several reasons strategic importance as an ally in the middle 
east participation in the camp david peace process with egypt and 
the political clout of american jews 
the secondlargest recipient is egypt which will get 21 
billion this year also largely because of the camp david accord 
turkey a nato ally is to get 610 million pakistan which has 
played a key role in supplying arms to the usbacked mujaheddin 
rebels in afghanistan will receive 490 million and the 
philippines where the united states has important military bases 
and wants to support a struggling democracy will get 360 million

the army officers and soldiers 
accused of murdering six jesuit priests made their first appearance 
in court and president alfredo cristiani said he believed almost 
everyone involved in the crime was in custody 
neither judge ricardo zamora nor col guillermo benavides the 
highest ranking military officer to be accused of a human rights 
crime in a decade of civil war had any comment after the closed 
proceedings tuesday 
the appearance in the 4th penal court was a preliminary 
procedure that gave the defendants a chance to tell the judge their 
side of the story 
cristiani who named the suspects publicly saturday said he 
hoped the proceedings would clear up the crime 
we have come down to the bottom of this and we hope that 
through the interrogation process in the judicial aspect that 
even more information might come out and that everybody involved 
will be held responsible and punished by the law he told 
nbctvs today show 
he said he believes almost all of those involved in the 
crime are in custody 
zamora has until friday to decide whether the evidence is 
sufficient to charge the eight suspects and order them held for 
trial in the nov 16 slaying of the six priests their housekeeper 
and her 15yearold daughter 
benavides who wore a dress uniform to court and the three 
lieutenants two sergeants corporal and soldier who faced the 
court were returned after dark to the military and police garrisons 
near the capital where they are being held 
a ninth soldier who allegedly took part in the slayings deserted 
last month and is a fugitive 
cristiani told abctvs good morning america that benavides 
denies ordering the slayings but the junior officers involved 
expressly have testified that they received a direct order from 
him 
benavides is director of the military college and the others are 
members of the elite atlacatl infantry battalion which was 
attached to the college at the time of the massacre 
even though the killings of thousands of suspected leftists by 
death squads in the early 1980s have been either linked to or 
tolerated by the military no officer has ever been convicted of a 
human rights crime 
the jesuit massacre which took place on the fifth day of the 
biggest rebel offensive of the war and wiped out the leadership of 
the highly regarded central american university is a test for 
cristianis rightist government 
the murders prompted an international outcry and calls in 
congress for a reappraisal of the more than 1 million a day in aid 
sent to el salvador 
they also focused attention on the salvadoran justice system 
which us ambassador william walker has publicly said doesnt 
work 
cristiani whose government greatly depends on the us aid has 
presented himself as the face of a new more moderate right in el 
salvador 
but extreme elements of his party and others in the far right 
have long regarded the central american university jesuits as 
subversives because of their belief that the civil war was the 
result of gross social injustice rather than international 
communist expansion and their insistence on dialogue rather than 
military force as the path to peace

barbara bush says the secret to her popularity 
is that shes just a nice fat grandmother who doesnt threaten 
anyone 
asked why the american people give her favorability ratings that 
surpass even her husbands high poll numbers mrs bush said 
tuesday i dont know maybe they think i like them 
does she darn near everybody she said 
i dont like racists i dont like greedy people i dont like 
hate i like people to be positive i like people to help each 
other she told three reporters 
people like her mrs bush said because i dont have to do 
anything except just be there i dont threaten anyone im just a 
nice fat grandmother 
in an interview reflecting on her first year in the white house 
mrs bush said she is still plagued by the double vision and 
irritated eyes resulting from graves disease an immune system 
disorder 
she said she is cautiously optimistic that the recent 
radiation treatments she underwent will improve the double vision 
it is particularly severe in the morning she said 
she can read but sees double when looking up her eyes on 
tuesday looked slightly teary but not as puffy as in some recent 
days 
but mrs bush said her health problems ranked about 20th on the 
list of things on her mind over the past year including her 
family her dogs six puppies and the fun she had with christmas 
at the white house 
if you think of others and you keep busy you really are better 
off in life she said 
mrs bush said she has been surprised at how much she likes 
being first lady 
although security concerns prevent her from walking her dog out 
on the street when she feels like it or going for a drive she 
called those restrictions minor compared to the luxuries 
ask me how many times i have to wait at the doctor or ask me 
how many times i have to hassle at the airport or try to find a 
cab or wait for the plumber ask me how many times i have to 
stand in the grocery line everything wonderful happens to me 
i dont have any hassles 
on other matters the first lady disclosed 
a new mattress for the bed in the lincoln bedroom was purchased 
by bushs brothers and sister because the old one was too soft 
they said if were going to have to sleep here we want a better 
mattress so they bought a better mattress 
she doesnt have a favorite former first lady but is 
grateful to every one of them the fords for their pool the 
trumans for their balcony pat nixon for the beauty parlor 
nancy reagan she said really saved me a lot of repair by 
making sure the plumbing works and overhauling some of the older 
rooms 
she would prefer that the upcoming drug summit bush will attend 
in violenceridden colombia be held elsewhere although she is 
confident security precautions will keep him safe i wish it 
would be right here but i cant change his mind or make those 
decisions i have no input on that 
mrs bush who typically declines to comment on policy issues 
was asked if women should be allowed in combat as they were in 
panama recently 
if i thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was 
wounded and carry them to safety if i thought they could throw a 
hand grenade as far as a man then i would say fine because i 
think certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to 
compete with a man she said 
they can shoot as well they can fly as well

government officials say they dont know how 
many health care workers become infected with the aids virus on the 
job but they are sure its higher than the 19 reported us cases 
an official at the federal centers for disease control said 
tuesday his agency is working to expand reporting and come up with 
more accurate data but critics say putting out figures that are 
admittedly too low trivializes the risk and lulls workers into 
complacency 
if the risk is downplayed then the itcanthappentome 
attitude will tend to prevail said hacib aoun a baltimore 
physician who contracted aids after he cut his finger on a tube 
filled with infected blood in 1983 
david bell chief of aids activity in the hospital infections 
program at cdc in atlanta said the agency isnt minimizing the 
risk of occupational exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus 
or hiv which can occur if a worker is pricked with a contaminated 
needle or is splashed with blood from an infected patient 
bell said all surveillance systems including the one tracking 
health care workers who become infected with hiv are prone to 
underreporting 
the number of health care workers with hiv infection 
including occupationally acquired hiv exceeds that which has been 
reported to us we all know that bell said 
however he said public health officials dont know how many 
health care workers have been infected in the course of their work 
the cdc reports 27 cases of occupationally acquired hiv 
infection by health care workers worldwide 19 of them in the 
united states the agency is also investigating 34 other cases he 
said 
larry gostin executive director of the bostonbased american 
society of law and medicine said the actual number of cases in 
which health care workers are infected on the job could be up to 
five times the cdcs official count 
a study has determined the risk that a health care worker will 
become infected with hiv after being pricked with a contaminated 
needle is 1 in 250 bell said 
gostin said i dont want health care workers to be unduly 
alarmed by the risks i think the risks are small but they have a 
right and society has a right to have the numbers be as truthful as 
possible 
that way a clearer calculation can be made about the risk 
and theres more incentive to see that the risk is real and that 
its necessary to use precautions he said 
aoun who said his case has not yet been included in cdcs 
official count said he believes underreporting is a form of 
panic control that ultimately will subject workers to greater 
risks through complacency 
the information they provide is used to formulate policy to 
improve protections for workers and to improve benefits for workers 
infected on the job he said if the number is trivialized these 
changes that are needed will be slow in coming 
aoun who settled with johns hopkins hospital in 1987 said 
workers need better protections against hiv infection and better 
benefits if they do become infected on the job 
several other lawsuits filed by health care workers claiming to 
have been infected on the job have been settled and several are 
pending 
the current suit by new york physician veronica prego is the 
first to go to trial 
sometimes workers dont report a needlestick or other possible 
accidental exposure and in three quarters of the cases that are 
reported and hiv infection is positive subsequent investigations 
turn up other risk factors including sexual behavior and 
intravenous drug use bell said 
bell said that in the cdcs expanded reporting system reports 
will be categorized according to how clear they are that infection 
occurred in the workplace 
the center published voluntary guidelines in 1982 for hospitals 
and other medical institutions to follow to protect workers against 
hiv infection the labor departments occupational safety and 
health administration has proposed regulations that would require 
hospitals to institute specific safeguards

officials at mci communications corp say it 
couldnt happen to them us sprint says it could happen to anybody 
a day after longdistance service crashed for millions of atampt 
customers atampts two biggest longdistance competitors disagreed 
on tuesday about whether they could suffer a similar massive 
computer glitch 
mci the nations secondlargest telecommunications company and 
no 3 us sprint use the same signaling system 7 technology that 
apparently caused problems for the american telephone and telegraph 
co 
in washington mci executive vice president richard liebhaber 
said after a toptobottom check of the companys equipment we 
dont see any potential points of failure 
but a spokeswoman for kansas city mobased us sprint terri 
dunn said essentially it could happen to anybody 
atampt carries about 70 percent of the nations longdistance 
calls mci handles about 12 percent us sprint has about 8 percent 
neither of the smaller companies experienced long distance 
outages monday 
i hate like hell to see it i really feel sorry for these 
guys said mcis liebhaber noting the longdistance disturbance 
has an impact on american industry and an impact on everybodys 
customers 
signaling system 7 is a socalled common channel signal system 
that makes your network smarter and improves the calling 
process said dunn the system allows equipment to see if a 
circuit or a phone number is busy before putting a call through and 
tying up a circuit 
atampt said tuesday it traced the trouble to a bug or logic 
problem in the atamptdesigned software that runs its signalling 
system it said the bug was written into the software originally 
and was an accident waiting to happen 
ms dunn said us sprint has had the system since november 1987 
and we have not experienced an outage such as this but she 
said us sprint is constantly checking our software and centrally 
monitoring of the network 
liebhaber said that although their technology is similar to 
atampts the equipment is different 
they have manufactured their own system he said of atampt 
i dont use stuff supplied by atampt our equipment is manufactured 
by digital switch and combined with our own software 
both mci and us sprint said atampt customers could use their 
longdistance services by dialing the access codes of either 10333 
for sprint or 10222 for mci callers will be billed through their 
local phone company bill

the actress who portrayed housekeeper 
aunt bee on the andy griffith show lived her last years in 
seclusion in a dark dingy house and kept a 1966 green studebaker 
with four flat tires in the garage 
the home of frances bavier reflects little of the coziness of 
the fictional house that aunt bee managed for mayberrys sheriff 
and his young son on the popular television series of the 1960s 
the 86yearold miss bavier died dec 6 in the spacious 
twostory siler city home to which she retired in 1972 she rarely 
left the house town residents say 
she strikes me as living a sparse life in her latter years a 
very quiet life said diana hatch communications director for 
university of north carolina center for public television 
of an estimated 700000 estate miss bavier left the house to a 
hospital foundation and its antiquated contents to the public 
television network 
an appraisal put the value of miss baviers belongings at 
31683 excluding the studebaker last driven in 1983 on a trip to 
a grocery store 
the stench from the actress 14 cats coupled with peeling 
plaster frayed carpets and worn upholstery indicate miss bavier 
either was unable or unwilling to spend much time keeping up the 
home 
her cats evidently used a basement room and a shower stall as a 
litter box 
evidently the reclusive actress spent most of her time in a 
large back room plainly furnished with a bed a desk a television 
and an end table where she kept her reading and opera glasses 
black licorice and a bell 
i think she was a person who obviously valued her privacy she 
could have had nonstop fans if she had opened her doors 
said ms hatch 
two trunks held her fan mail letters in one and studio 
portraits of her to be signed in another 
miss baviers few costly possessions consisted primarily of some 
rare leatherbound books a lace collection and a considerable 
quantity of table linens said ms hatch 
the few mementos of the actress television days were the dress 
and hats she wore in the show and a few publicity pictures there 
also was a blue satin gown she may have worn when she won her emmy 
award said ms hatch 
just as the neat matronly aunt bee would have done miss bavier 
saved sewing fabric in labeled boxes in a bedroom closet but what 
she made with the material was not evident in the house which had 
no curtains at windows the walls were mostly bare except for a few 
ordinary electric wall clocks 
and while aunt bee was known around the ficticious mayberry 
nc courthouse for her tasty box lunches there was only one 
cookbook in miss baviers yellow and green 1950s kitchen 
the belongings will be auctioned this spring said bob royster 
production director for the public television center

three lockheed aircraft corp workers in chad 
have been detained in what the company tuesday called a 
misunderstanding with that countrys government but a relative 
of one of the men described them as hostages 
the three work for the lockheed aeronautical systemgeorgia 
subsidiary and are in the african country as part of a sale of 
c130 hercules airplanes built in marietta ga to the government 
there said company spokesman dick martin 
lockheed agreed to set up an office in chad for one year after 
the sale so the technicians could help maintain the planes and 
explain their use martin said 
the year ended in december and as the men packed up they 
destroyed some documents including manuals on the planes martin 
said chads government felt the documents belonged to them while 
lockheed maintains they were company property 
martin said officials of chad revoked the workers passports 
but said they were allowed free movement in the marriott hotel in 
the capital of ndjamena and the surrounding area 
barbara porter whose brother irving thrash is one of the

the air force is lifting restrictions that 
kept women from being crew members on cargo airdrop missions 
capt george sillia said tuesday that women now may serve as 
pilots copilots loadmasters flight engineers or crew chiefs on 
c130 or c141 transport planes the spokesman said the decision 
will affect about 100 women among its 4800 pilots and a like 
number of women among enlisted crew members 
previously women crew members were allowed to fly on c141 
aircraft to a specific location unload the cargo and return 
however women had not been allowed to be crew members on the 
c130 except the wc130 a weather reconnaissance plane 
the decision was made dec 14 six days before the us invasion 
of panama during which army women were reported to have taken part 
in combat sillia said the intervention delayed the formal 
announcement 
the command determined that airdrop missions dont fall under 
the defense departments february 1988 risk rule which says a 
noncombat mission or unit can be closed to women if officials deem 
that the risks are equal to or greater than those of the combat 
mission they support

the bush administration supports soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs use of troops to try to restore order in the 
southern caucasus and is criticizing feuding azerbaijanis and 
armenians for revisiting old ethnic hatreds 
without offering a judgment on the territorial dispute between 
the two groups state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
said tuesday its time for the violence to stop and any 
grievances to be settled peacefully 
at least 56 people have been killed and 156 injured in the 
strife in the soviet republic of azerbaijan since thursday 
gorbachev on monday signed a sweeping emergency decree after 
intense antiarmenian riots in baku the regional capital 
at the heart of the fighting are conflicting claims to 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian area within ajerbaijan 
in response to questions ms tutwiler said the bush 
administration supports the selfdetermination of people but 
she gave no hint of backing either sides claims 
as gorbachev and the presidum of the soviet parliament struggled 
with the violence in the caucasus the state department and the 
white house stressed moscows authority to restore order 
the distinction here is not people pressing for peaceful 
political change participation expression ms tutwiler said 
they are instead revisiting old ethnic hatreds 
describing the situation as a very difficult one marlin 
fitzwater the white house spokesman said we have seen ethnic 
tensions there for many many years and we certainly regret the 
violence that is taking place now we understand the need to 
establish order in a situation where order has broken down 
also fitzwater said we recognize the right of any state to 
ensure the safety of its citizens and it looks like thats the 
primary concern at the moment 
in moscow spokesman vladimir a yanchenkov of the soviet 
interior ministry confirmed media accounts that kgb security forces 
and army had been deployed in the region he referred to some of 
the violence as pogroms or massacres 
at the state department spokeswoman tutwiler said the united 
states regretted the violence and urged armenians and azerbaijanis 
to refrain 
these are ageold ethnic tensions she said 
unfortunately the level of violence has escalated dramatically 
over the last several days its time for the violence to stop and 
any grievances settled peacefully 
the statement concluded we dont encourage the use of force 
anywhere and we would hope it is unnecessary but we recognize the 
need to establish order where people are killing each other 
on another subject the state department said gorbachev may 
have opened the door a bit to the possibility of a multiparty 
system in the soviet union 
but he is by no means calling for its establishment ms 
tutwiler said in a statement 
this referred to remarks by the soviet leader during a visit 
last week to vilnius the capital of lithuania there he urged 
rebellious lithuanians to remain in the soviet union and said his 
fate and that of his economic reconstruction program depended on 
the outcome 
we should not be afraid of a multiparty system if it serves 
the people gorbachev said 
the state department also registered its approval of a decision 
by the east german government to drop its plan for reviving a state 
security organization it reflected the clearly expressed wishes 
of the east german population a statement read by ms tutwiler 
said 
on another front the state department supported czechoslovakia 
in calling for the removal of soviet troops from the country 
but the statement read by ms tutwiler stressed the only way to 
verify a pullout is through a treaty now in negotiation in vienna 
between nato and the warsaw pact 
it would reduce us and soviet troops in europe and impose 
strict limits on how many foreign forces could be stationed in any 
country

with the recent collapse of east european 
communist governments the late chinese nationalists sun yatsen 
chiang kaishek and chiang chingkuo stand out as giants of 
history says walter h judd in a rare appearance for the aging 
former missionary and congressman 
the three leaders of the nationalist republic of china are 
giants today while communist leaders from marx to lenin to 
brezhnev to deng xiaoping to gorbachev are increasingly 
discredited the aging minnesota republican said tuesday 
judd 91 was famous as a leader of the old china lobby a 
group of influential americans credited with delaying us 
recognition of the chinese communist government for nearly a 
quarter of a century after its 1949 takeover in beijing 
judd a medical missionary in china for a decade who later 
served 20 years in the house made a rare public appearance at the 
launching of chiang chingkuo remembered the man and his 
political legacy a book about the nationalist president who died 
in 1988 
it was written by ray cline central intelligence agency station 
chief in taiwan from 1958 to 1963 and later a cia spokesman in 
washington now retired from government cline heads the us 
global strategy council a conservative research organization 
chiang chingkuo was the son of chiang kaishek the 
generalissimo who led the nationalist retreat to offshore taiwan 
in 1949 sun yatsen headed the revolutionaries who overthrew the 
manchu dynasty and formed the first chinese republic in 1912 
cline who knew chiang chingkuo for 30 years and other 
speakers credited the late president with laying the groundwork 
for current democratic reforms in taiwan and for the islands 
spectacular economic growth 
when the united states switched diplomatic relations from taiwan 
to beijing in 1979 president chiang chingkuo overruled advice to 
turn his back on america and democracy swallowing blood on his 
teeth said veteran us career diplomat david dean using a 
chinese expression for turning the other cheek 
dean finished a tour last month as head of the taipei office of 
the american institute in taiwan the organization maintaining 
nonofficial us relations after derecognition 
taiwan is prepared to trade with and provide some economic aid 
to poland and other newlydemocratic countries of eastern europe 
but they have to make the first move said stephen sf chen 
deputy chief of taiwans mission in washington known as the 
coordination council for north american affairs 
taiwan law prohibits dealing with hostile countries but such 
countries are no longer hostile chen noted a problem is that 
the consortium of donor nations for eastern europe aid is made up 
of governments that like the united states do not recognize 
taiwan and do not allow it to participate he said 
cline said his book will be translated into chinese by taiwans 
united daily news group for publication in book form with excerpts 
in the lian ho pao newspaper

a 15mile antenna strung out like a giant 
cross in the chequamegon national forest quietly sends radio 
messages to missileequipped submarines patrolling deep waters 
around the world 
the navy began using the 400 million elf system last fall 
replacing smaller transmitters that had been sending messages to 
missileequipped submarines since the late 1960s 
the earlier project went through despite years of protests based 
on fears that the lowfrequency radio waves would fry fish in 
nearby streams and produce twoheaded squirrels 
in the last two years we have had only two protests of any 
significance those folks were strictly antimilitary said lt 
john smythe project commander i think the biological 
ecological and safety issues have all been addressed 
at one point demonstrations occurred almost weekly at the 
fencedin transmitter site in northwestern wisconsin 
nuclearweapons opponents argued the system would make the forest a 
target for soviet missiles and environmentalists called for more 
studies 
elf or extremely low frequency is the only system of its kind 
that sends radio waves that penetrate water the system permits 
submarines to prowl undetected by radar while receiving messages 
several hundred feet under water 
the antenna two strands of cable strung on wooden poles and 
a transmitter are tucked into the forest atop 20000 feet of buried 
rock near clam lake a quiet tourist wayside 
bears frequently climb on the poles and snowmobiles glide 
through a corridor carved in the trees 
jerry holter and his wife tish both 60 live about a mile from 
the antenna and have watched the project unfold since 1969 
they brought in peace activists by the busloads holter 
recalled you wont find anybody in the area that ever thought 
the project would do all the things opponents claimed including 
make you sterile if you walked under the lines 
mrs holter served as a human guinea pig for researchers 
monitoring the medical effects of the system on nearby residents 
we are both so darn healthy its funny she said 
but mark peterson executive director of the sigurd olson 
environmental institute of northland college in ashland said the 
project still has its skeptics they point to studies that indicate 
milk production of cows that graze near high voltage electrical 
lines drops off he said 
the system and a companion one near ki sawyer air force base 
south of marquette mich use a total of 60000 worth of 
electricity each month and employ about 75 people mostly 
civilians smythe said 
elf is scaled down considerably from the original plan which 
included a grid of 6200 miles of buried cable and 100 transmitters 
built to survive a nuclear war 
independent researchers spent years studying possible 
environmental and ecological problems the giant antenna and its 
radio waves might cause smythe said 
scientists checked to see if sparrows laid the same number of 
eggs each spring offspring of birds and bees were measured and 
weighed 
there have been no squirrels with two heads and six legs we 
have not been able to detect any negative effects in the 
biologicalecological system smythe said 
but monitoring of homes and other testing in the area will 
continue through 1991 smythe said 
former sen gaylord nelson dwis raised the first 
environmental questions about the project in the late 1960s 
i would say that they had resolved 90plus percent of the 
concerns i had at the time perhaps 98 or 99 percent said 
nelson now an adviser with the wilderness society in washington 
an environmental group that specializes in public lands issues 
holter a wood carver said elf which looks like a small radio 
station is preferable to other alternatives 
i think i feel more secure with that sitting in my backyard 
than tons of battleships

the un security councils permanent members the 
united states the soviet union china britain and france have 
agreed to move quickly to seek a ceasefire and free elections in 
cambodia under un administration 
officials of the five countries concluded two days of meetings 
tuesday night by setting out a 16point summary of principles 
focused on an enhanced un role in bringing peace to cambodia 
representatives of the countries will meet again in new york in 
about two weeks then again in late february in paris to push the 
peace program ahead as quickly as possible 
were at least going to make a strong try at it said a 
senior us official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
were not talking about a process that would take several years 
but its clear it will take several months 
much could depend on china which arms and supplies the powerful 
khmer rouge resistance faction and is being counted on to 
influence its clients to accept unsupervised elections rather 
than seek military victory 
the five countries said a special representative of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar would be in charge of 
united nations activities in cambodia during an unspecified 
transition period leading to elections 
they called in a statement for an effective un presence to 
assure internal security apparently a reference to a peacekeeping 
force 
elections must be conducted under direct un administration 
that would assure a neutral political environment in which no 
party would be advantaged the statement said 
an enduring peace can only be achieved through a comprehensive 
political settlement including the verified withdrawal of foreign 
forces a ceasefire and the cessation of outside military 
assistance it said the goal should be selfdetermination for 
the cambodian people through free fair and democratic elections 
points set out in the statement do not deal with some of the 
most difficult issues such as whether to dissolve premier hun 
sens vietnamesebacked government or what to do about cambodias 
united nations seat now held by the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition led by prince norodom sihanouk 
the statement does not even refer directly to hun sen sihanouk 
or the khmer rouge cambodias brutal masters for three years until 
the late 1978 vietnamese invasion that ousted them the khmer rouge 
are now allied with sihanouk and another noncommunist resistance 
group 
it appeared to draw heavily from ideas floated by australia and 
by us rep stephen solarz dny for expanding the united 
nations role in cambodia 
hun sens government and the three guerrilla factions have shown 
varying degrees of enthusiasm for the idea but none has rejected 
it out of hand 
pressure to find a solution has grown with reports of steppedup 
khmer rouge attacks in western cambodia without large numbers of 
vietnamese troops to help it is not clear how well hun sens 
forces will stand up to the guerrillas 
a peace conference last summer in paris foundered on 
disagreement over proposals for a temporary administration of all 
four cambodian factions to run the country until elections chose 
new leaders hun sen refused to consider letting the khmer rouge 
in sihanouk rejected any idea of keeping them out 
the khmer rouge were responsible for killing hundreds of 
thousands of people while they were in power 
the american official who spoke to reporters said chinese 
participants in the meeting said they did not want to eliminate 
completely the proposal for a quadripartite administration but were 
willing to pursue the prospects for a greater un role in running 
the country until elections are held 
the statement issued by the permanent members tuesday suggests a 
supreme national council might be the repository of cambodian 
sovereignty during the transition process but does not say who 
might serve on such a council 
another point says questions involving cambodian sovereignty 
should be resolved with the agreement of the cambodian parties 
which seems to fall short of the effective veto power each of the 
four factions held at previous steps of the slowmoving peace talks 
in recent years 
the united nations also is asked to verify complete withdrawal 
of foreign forces from cambodia vietnam announced in september 
that the last of its troops had left but sihanouk accused vietnam 
of leaving disguised soldiers behind and intending to colonize the 
country

armed troops guarded the capital today 
after the main opposition leader was disqualified as a candidate in 
may 27 elections burmas first multiparty vote in three decades 
western diplomats said 
the decision to disqualify aung san suu kyi was made late 
tuesday by the military governments election commission sources 
on the commission said they said without elaborating that her 
candidacy for a seat in parliament did not conform to the election 
law 
both the commission sources and the diplomats spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the diplomats reached by telephone from bangkok said large 
numbers of troops who had entered rangoon in trucks on tuesday were 
guarding city hall where election commission has offices they did 
not say exactly how many troops there were 
a candidate in the rangoon constituency of bahan ms suu kyi 
44 has been under house arrest since july 20 the government has 
accused her of subversion but no formal charges have been filed 
ms suu kyi is the daughter of the late aung san the widely 
revered leader of burmese independence 
she is the general secretary of the national league for 
democracy which is the largest and most popular opposition party 
the coleader of her party tin oo was sentenced last month to 
three years in prison on charges of subversion 
ms suu kyi has strongly criticized alleged abuses by the 
military authorities 
the military seized power after crushing a national 
prodemocracy uprising in september 1988 killing several thousand 
mostly unarmed protesters 
the government has promised to relinquish power after a free and 
fair election but western diplomats say the arrests of thousands 
of opposition activists in recent months and harassment of 
politicians like ms suu kyi shed doubt on the elections potential 
fairness 
sources in ms suu kyis party said it plans to appeal its 
candidates disqualification to the election commissions central 
fiveman body 
the challenge to ms suu kyis candidacy was raised by labang 
grong a candidate for the the national unity party running in the 
same rangoon constituency 
the national unity party is the successor to the burma socialist 
program party which ruled for 26 years and has close ties to the 
military government 
grong contended that ms suu kyi was not eligible because she 
was entitled to the rights of a foreign citizen and had links with 
a rebel student group she is married to a briton but holds a 
burmese passport 
the decision has not been officially announced 
in the last multiparty election in 1960 u nu was elected prime 
minister he was ousted in 1962 the beginning of oneparty 
military rule 
u nu was put under house arrest last month and banned from 
running in the may elections after he refused to dissolve a 
parallel government formed at the height of the 1988 uprising

china plans to amend its unpopular practice of 
forcing some married couples to live and work in separate cities 
an official newspaper said today 
the china daily said the state council chinas cabinet has 
worked out a policy to help the 300000 stateemployed couples now 
living apart get back together 
most chinese are assigned jobs by the state after finishing 
school and job placement officials in the past have routinely sent 
young married couples to different cities 
changing jobs and obtaining a residency permit in the more 
comfortable larger cities is extremely difficult and many couples 
have been forced to spend much of their married life living apart 
senior intellectuals will be given priority in receiving 
permission to rejoin spouses the china daily said people with 
doctorates or those involved in high technology jobs will 
automatically qualify for relocation 
the personnel ministry said that in the future all university 
graduates who are engaged to be married should be assigned to the 
same city 
the ministry said it is asking married couples to join in 
smaller cities rather than wait for permission to unite in 
overcrowded larger cities 
it said 1 million couples were separated when the government 
first confronted the problem a decade ago and the practice of 
sending couples to different cities has been a large financial 
burden to the state 
separated couples are allowed three to four weeks off a year to 
visit their spouses with all travel expenses paid the state loses 
10 million paid work days and must budget 468 million for the 
visits

tens of thousands of american women are being 
misdiagnosed as suffering from psychiatric disorders when they are 
in fact suffering from an unusual form of heart disease a 
researcher says 
the women who have chest pain but no signs of heart disease by 
conventional tests are suffering from a treatable disorder of the 
small arteries said dr richard cannon of the national heart lung 
and blood institute in bethesda md 
many have been mislabeled as neurotic or hysterical women 
cannon said tuesday they truly have a pain syndrome 
cannon said the disorder afflicts up to 100000 americans each 
year most of them women 
among their symptoms is a condition cannon calls sensitive 
heart in which they experience sharp pain when test probes are 
threaded into arteries near their hearts 
such probes usually are painless said cannon who described his 
research at the american heart associations annual science 
writers forum 
cannons studies have shown that many of the patients are 
suffering from a disorder he calls microvascular angina in which 
blood flow may be blocked in very tiny arteries that nourish the 
heart 
the arteries are too small to show up on angiograms in which 
dye is injected into the larger coronary arteries to look for 
blockages he said the condition has sometimes been called 
syndrome x because its cause was unknown 
it may be common in men but occurs in middle age and later when 
many men have already developed coronary artery blockages those 
blockages hide underlying microvascular angina cannon said 
a variety of treatments exist to relieve the pain and many are 
standard heart drugs cannon said 
the patients are identified in part because they have reduced 
flow of blood to the heart cannon said 
studies have shown that the patients appear to have a disorder 
of the socalled smooth muscle in arteries the smooth muscle 
causes arteries to tighten and relax as they help regulate blood 
pressure and blood flow 
the patients are unusually sensitive to drugs that constrict the 
blood vessels and somewhat insensitive to drugs that relax blood 
vessels cannon said 
they also commonly have disorders of the esophagus and an 
asthmalike condition in the bronchial tubes the esophagus and the 
bronchial tubes contain smooth muscle 
the disorder could be caused by some defect in the smooth muscle 
itself or it could be a problem in the portions of the brain and 
nervous system that regulate the contraction and relaxation of 
smooth muscle cannon said 
although microvascular angina is not a psychiatric condition 
some psychiatric drugs appear to relieve the chest pain perhaps 
because they alleviate a disorder in the nervous systems 
regulation of the smooth muscle cannon said 
his current hypothesis is that the condition may be the result 
of improper signals sent from the body to the brain or a problem 
in the brains analysis of those signals 
panic attacks anxiety and depression can be seen in some 
patients with microvascular angina but the vast majority of 
people i see are put together pretty well psychologically cannon 
said

the government stung by american tv 
depictions of corrupt mexican officials who aid drug traffickers 
says it is looking into claims that a murdered us drug agent 
actually was in league with traffickers president carlos salinas 
de gortari meanwhile put on a hastily arranged memorial service 
for 44 mexican narcotics agents killed in the line of duty in the 
last 13 months 
the first condition for attacking narcotics trafficking is to 
dismantle and destroy the networks of corruption that protect it 
salinas said at the memorial tuesday at mexico citys airport 
mexico has been embarassed and angered by the nbc miniseries 
drug wars which was broadcast early this month 
the miniseries based on the 1985 killing of us drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena showed corrupt 
mexican officials aiding narcotics traffickers and thwarting the 
investigation of camarenas murder 
comments on nbc news programs that followed the miniseries 
suggested the corruption that allowed camarena to be killed has not 
gone away 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said mexican 
officials had no independent corroboration of press reports that 
camarena was working with drug traffickers although those reports 
first appeared in a government news service dispatch 
we are checking the basis of those reports said alvarez 
who refused to give further details in a brief encounter with 
reporters 
the reports which involved marijuana busts in northwestern 
mexico have been angrily denied by us officials 
salinas has made an effort to remove drug trafficking as an 
irritant in usmexican relations winning praise from us 
officials for vigorously pursuing drug traffickers 
he did not mention the controversy over the nbc miniseries in 
his speech but before an audience of about 400 agents and family 
members of the dead he emphasized that eliminating corruption was a 
key to defeating drug traffickers 
we do not deny our problems nor do we look for excuses for 
our errors salinas said 
although the great majority of our agents have demonstrated 
great valor in fighting drug trafficking i repeat we will 
energetically punish those who involve themselves in drug 
trafficking he said 
elaine shannon author of the book desperados on which the 
nbc miniseries was based said mexican authorities began attacking 
camarenas integrity in 1985 in order to divert attention from 
themselves and even tried to set up a fake bank account to prove 
camarena took dirty money 
law enforcement sources said camarena may have been involved in 
activities common to us agents that are technically illegal in 
mexico such as allowing informants to operate freely for the sake 
of gaining information and bagging bigger game 
opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas added some political heat 
to the drug wars controversy by saying the mexican government 
allows us agents to operate too freely in mexico although he 
said he did not know the details of their activities 
even gabriel garcia marquez a winner of the nobel prize for 
literature got into the act 
mexicos response to the defamation of the country was weak 
and inadequate because it attacks not only this country but all of 
latin america said marquez according to the excelsior news 
service marquez is a colombian national but lives here 
on monday a local radio station broadcast called for a 
demonstration at the local nbc office but none materialized 
the salinas administration crackdown has resulted in the seizure 
of 36 tons of cocaine in the 13 months salinas has been in office 
more than was seized the previous 10 years and the shutdown of 
several major cocaine smuggling operations 
the memorial service staged at a hangar used by the attorney 
generals office was broadcast live on mexican television and 
given wide play on news broadcasts 
placards listed the accomplishments of the salinas 
administration and several airplanes and helicopters used for 
surveillance and herbicide spraying were on display 
drug kingpins rafael caro quintero and ernesto fonseca carrillo 
were sentenced in december to 40 years in prison without parole for 
the camarena murder but an investigation continues in the united 
states and further indictments are expected 
mexican and us officials say the controversy has not affected 
working relations between the two governments especially in 
narcotics

a drug kingpin whose arrest in honduras 
sparked antiamerican riots was sentenced to life in prison without 
possibility of parole closing one of the west coasts largest 
cocaine trafficking cases 
juan ramon matta ballesteros 45 was sentenced tuesday by us 
district judge pamela ann rymer ending an odyssey that began in 
1988 when honduran police raided his tegucigalpa home at dawn and 
swiftly extradited him to the united states 
matta is considered one of the godfathers who established the 
colombian cocaine connection said john zienter special agent in 
charge of the drug enforcement administration in los angeles 
his sentencing sends a message to the primary individuals 
involved that no matter how high up they are and believe me 
matta was among the highest they are not safe from dedicated law 
enforcement officers 
matta was in the custody of us marshals who were expected to 
transport him to a maximumsecurity prison said assistant us 
attorney manuel medrano 
prosecutors said matta headed a powerful cocaine cartel based in 
cali colombia which funneled tons of cocaine through mexico to 
the united states 
matta moved almost 600 pounds of cocaine with a street value of 
more than 73 million through arizona and southern california 
prosecutors said 
in a presentencing memorandum filed last month medrano 
described matta as perhaps the most significant trafficker in 
custody in the world to date 
mattas lawyer martin stolar portrayed his client as a 
legitimate businessman and one of honduras largest private 
employers 
stolar has 10 days to notify the court if he intends to appeal 
the sentence 
mattas extradition from honduras triggered deadly riots in his 
homeland some 2000 hondurans burned the us embassy annex and 
five people were killed in the weeklong disturbances 
attorneys for matta said he was kidnaped from honduras which 
has no extradition treaty with the united states 
but federal courts have upheld extraditions medrano said 
matta was convicted in september on seven criminal counts that 
included conspiracy possession and distribution of narcotics and 
running a criminal enterprise 
the case centered on a september 1981 dea raid at a suburban van 
nuys apartment that netted 19 million in cash and 114 pounds of 
cocaine at that time the largest seizure of the drug in state 
history 
coded ledgers that were seized in the raid were traced back to a 
shadowy figure called el negro who was identified as matta by 
hector barona becerra an admitted drug 
traffickerturnedgovernment witness

another rumor about the soviet leader set back the 
tokyo stock exchanges key index today just as it was recovering 
from a major twoday plunge and the dollar inched down against the 
japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 2922 
points or 008 percent closing at 3682114 
after losing more than 650 points on each of the last two 
trading days the index gained 36066 points in this mornings 
trading responding favorably to a 2325point overnight gain in 
the dow jones industrial average in new york 
but then it turned down as the market looked for a continued 
decline in japanese government bond prices and received another 
setback from a recurring rumor that mikhail s gorbachev was 
resigning said kazuhiro nomura a dealer with new japan securities 
co 
nomura said the rumor generated in the bond market was 
transmitted to the stock market and the nikkei fell 
bond prices however rose 021 points today their first 
increase this year after an eightsession slide that had pushed the 
yield up about one percentage point from last year 
dealers have pointed to the slumping bond price as a major 
factor in the nikkeis decline of more than 2000 points or 54 
percent since ending last year at 3891587 a record high but 
amid general pessimism rumors and speculation have been moving the 
market they say 
commenting recently on the rumors yamaichi securities analyst 
kenji maeshiro said gorbachev will probably have to die a 
thousand times in such rumors this year besides supposedly 
resigning 
analysts say investors push such rumors in an attempt to 
manipulate prices for profittaking 
the market this morning finally began to think that the nikkei 
had already hit the bottom and would start recovering but it is 
still vulnerable and is supersensitive to pessimistic rumors 
nomura said 
after substantial buying in the morning session many investors 
sold back issues for profittaking followed by massive selling by 
solomon brothers a major foreign securities firm shortly before 
the afternoon session ended nomura said 
trading was thin with an estimated 550 million shares changing 
hands on the first section 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14552 yen down 023 
yen from tuesdays 14575yen finish it opened at 14540 yen and 
ranged between 14537 yen and 14555 yen 
although trading was calm as many market players awaited the 
release of us trade figures for november due to be announced 
later today the dollar was basically getting stronger said 
yoshitsugu hanada a trader with mitsui bank 
he added that the yens weakness will continue to affect 
government bond prices 
there is no immediate need to buy the yen now because of 
uncertainties ahead of the major election he said referring to 
nationwide balloting for parliaments upper house next month 
some 367 billion changed hands in spot trading today

gov michael s dukakis said he knows many 
massachusetts residents feel angered and betrayed by his 
presidential loss and the damage it did to the state 
its clear to me now that i underestimated the amount of time 
and energy it takes to seek the modern presidency trying to do two 
jobs at the same time was more difficult and more grueling than i 
expected dukakis said in his final state of the state speech 
tuesday 
and i underestimated the toll it would take on my family 
too 
dukakis wife kitty entered an alcoholism treatment program 
shortly after his loss 
mrs dukakis received a standing ovation and perhaps the warmest 
applause of the evening when she stepped onto a balcony to watch 
her husbands address 
dukakis said he won the democratic presidential nomination 
swept up by the excitement and euphoria of what he called the 
massachusetts miracle 
but a funny thing happened on the road to the white house i 
ran a great campaign for the primary and a lousy one for the 
final dukakis said i lost and in the process massachusetts 
took an unfair beating and i feel terrible about it 
i know that many of you are angry with me feel betrayed feel 
that i put myself before you and the commonwealth dukakis said 
tuesday 
but there comes a time and i believe it has arrived that 
nobodys interest and certainly not the publics is served by 
laying on more blame dukakis said 
the 56yearold governor is serving the last year of his third 
fouryear term he announced early last year that he would not seek 
reelection 
dukakis repeated his call for new taxes to solve the states 
nagging fiscal problems but said he was optimistic about the 
future of massachusetts and of new england both of which are 
suffering economic declines 
the state legislature still has not balanced the states 12 
billion budget which is about 500 million in the red 
many legislators including republicans praised the speech 
i admire him for making the admissions that he did i wish he 
had done it a year ago said senate minority leader david locke 
after the speech the governor and his wife greeted lobbyists 
state workers and other wellwishers mrs dukakis looked thin and 
was less ebullient than she has been in past appearances but the 
old warmth returned when she hugged friends and cooed over an 
infant 
im feeling much better thank you glad to be here she 
said when asked about her health 
mrs dukakis said she is not sad to see the governors term come 
to an end 
i think 12 years 12 times is enough she said referring 
to the number of times the governor has given a state of the state 
address im just grateful for all the wonderful experiences

a pilot accused of flying drug money from fort 
lauderdale to panama was part of an illegal aliensmuggling ring 
led by manuel antonio noriega prosecutors say 
the accusations came tuesday during a bond hearing for a noriega 
codefendant and raised the possibility the deposed panamanian 
dictator could face new charges 
myles malman a deputy assistant us attorney told a 
magistrate the government has evidence that the panamanian pilot 
eduardo pardo was involved in noriegaled ring that smuggled 
illegal aliens into the united states 
asked whether there would be any new charges against noriega 
us attorneys spokeswoman diane cossin refused to comment saying 
any discussion of the new aliensmuggling accusations would be 
premature 
pardo 44 was denied bond by us magistrate william turnoff 
who agreed with prosecutors that he was a risk to flee the united 
states 
a separate bond hearing for another noriega codefendant lt 
col luis del cid who was identified by authorities as a former 
head of noriegas secret police and one of his righthand men was 
to resume today 
del cid 46 has pleaded innocent to charges of collecting bribe 
money and acting as a liaison between noriega and drug traffickers 
who allegedly used panama as a conduit for drug shipments to the 
united states 
if convicted on all counts del cid could be sentenced to 70 
years in prison and fined 550000 
his wife 34yearold tilsa jimenez del cid appealed to judge 
william hoeveler to release her husband until his trial saying 
their children rely on him for their education and religious 
training 
i dont recall him ever going to bed without saying a 
prayer she testified 
mrs del cid denied that her husband led panamas g2 secret 
police and said he had nothing to do with drug trafficking 
del cids lawyer samuel burstyn complained in a motion filed 
tuesday that prosecutors havent complied with hoevelers dec 26 
order to allow him access to evidence against del cid 
the case against lieutenant colonel del cid is a very thin one 
and apparently rests entirely upon the uncorroborated hearsay 
statements of floyd carlton caceres burstyn wrote in the motion 
testimony by carlton a former confidant of noriega provided 
the basis for much of the indictment and the convicted drug pilot 
is expected to be the prime witness against noriega at his 
drugsmuggling trial 
outside the courtroom a noriega attorney steven kollin said 
he would need at least a year and possibly two to prepare for trial

a tiny inflatable balloon that can open 
arteries plugged with cholesterol could replace up to 30 percent of 
the 110000 operations done each year to help save legs from 
amputation a researcher says 
the blockage of arteries in the legs is the result of hardening 
of the arteries or atherosclerosis when atherosclerosis occurs in 
the arteries that nourish the heart it leads to a heart attack 
when it occurs in the leg arteries it can lead to gangrene and 
amputation 
blockages in leg arteries are treated with bypass surgery 
analogous to heart bypass operations the leg operations are 
performed on about 110000 americans a year another 100000 
americans undergo amputations of legs feet or toes each year said 
dr eric martin of columbia university who presented his findings 
tuesday at the american heart associations annual science writers 
forum 
wider use in the leg arteries of the balloon technique could 
save 300 million to 400 million a year martin said similar 
balloons are being used in lieu of heart bypass surgery in the 
coronary arteries that nourish the heart 
the balloon procedure called angioplasty is as effective as 
surgery in leg arteries martin said depending upon which leg 
artery develops the blockage unblocked arteries have a 65 percent 
to 90 percent chance of remaining unblocked for at least five years 
after angioplasty he said 
limb problems often occur in diabetics whose arteries are more 
likely to become clogged in most cases atherosclerosis in the 
legs does not occur until after blockages already have produced 
heart and kidney disease martin said 
limb problems therefore are limited mostly to elderly patients 
three new techniques may one day improve upon surgery and 
angioplasty martin said but as yet they are unproven 
the use of tiny rotors to cut away blockages inside arteries is 
still in its infancy but the technique may cut in half the rate of 
recurrence of blockages compared to angioplasty martin said 
lasers that are designed to burn away the blockages have been 
disappointing so far he said they are also extremely expensive 
the machine costs 100000 
as with angioplasty and the tiny rotors the laser machine uses 
a catheter or small tube which is threaded through the arteries 
until it reaches the site of the blockage the laser catheters cost 
600 apiece and must be discarded after a single use martin said 
a third new technique is the opening of blockages with stents 
tiny wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the blockage expanded 
to open a clear channel and left in place a new blood vessel 
lining grows over the stent after a few weeks 
initial results are good martin said but the stents can 
produce clots

more than 11000 newly arrived troops struggled 
today to end battles between bands of azerbaijanis and armenians 
who reportedly were armed with everything from submachine guns and 
grenades to commandeered artillery 
the official death toll from the clashes in the southern 
republic of azerbaijan stood at 56 mostly armenians and new 
clashes were reported 
azerbaijanis staged protests in their republics capital baku 
and elsewhere to demand they be armed and allowed to defend their 
claim to the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh an 
predominantly armenian enclave in azerbaijan newspapers and 
officials said today 
in bordering armenia to the west people were still breaking 
into police stations and other arms repositories in search of 
weapons said dmitri seleznyov an interior ministry spokesman in 
moscow 
seleznyov said that in the past 24 hours there had been 64 
attacks on armenian homes in baku where the bloodletting exploded 
saturday night with mob attacks on armenians its a terrible 
thing he said 
the armenian news agency armenpress said some 1500 refugees 
were arriving daily in the armenian capital of yerevan 
on tuesday the official tass news agency said 2000 people 
armed with antiaircraft guns and other artillery were massing on 
hills around nagornokarabakh the flashpoint for the neighboring 
groups ethnic hatreds 
president mikhail s gorbachev declared a state of emergency in 
the strifetorn mountain area monday night empowering the 
government to deploy units of the soviet army navy and kgb to 
protect lives and guard vital installations such as railroads 
more than 6000 additional internal security troops were sent 
tuesday to reinforce existing interior ministry detachments tass 
said to assist them more than 5000 red army soldiers who 
traditionally carry heavier weaponry also were dispatched tass 
said 
soviet media did not say how many troops already were in the 
region 
tass said that in armenia demands are being made to arm 
citizens and send them to nagornokarabakh the government 
newspaper izvestia reported 16 attacks on weapons depots in 24 
hours by armenians seeking guns 
the troops have been instructed to get tougher with the 
fighters seleznyov said and soldiers opened fire tuesday when an 
armed group tried to take five armored personnel carriers near the 
village of tazikend 
since then attempts to take apcs have stopped because before 
this they werent used to having weapons used against them he 
said by telephone 
combatants in the nagornokarabakh region had seized stores of 
hand grenades the interior ministry said 
the flareup is the most violent between mainly moslem 
azerbaijanis and mostly christian armenians since their decadesold 
feud over nagornokarabakh erupted in bloody clashes two years ago 
the enclave has been ruled by azerbaijan since 1923 and the 
current troubles were sparked by its demand in february 1988 to be 
annexed by armenia 
internal security troops already in the region have been 
incapable of halting the most protracted ethnic conflict in 
gorbachevs nearly fiveyear tenure as kremlin leader 
we cant bring ourselves to pronounce it out loud but what is 
happening now can unambiguously be termed a civil war 
correspondent o shapovalov wrote in the newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda 
the bush administration supported gorbachevs use of troops in 
the region known as the southern caucasus and criticized feuding 
azerbaijanis and armenians for revisiting old ethnic hatreds 
the kremlins emergency decree empowers local officials to ban 
demonstrations and strikes impose curfews censor the media 
confiscate weapons disband unofficial organizations and detain 
people for up to 30 days interior ministry officials said they 
could not recall such measures being imposed in the country since 
world war ii 
gennady i gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman denied the 
decree was a backtracking of gorbachevs reforms which have led to 
greater openness and liberalization of society since he became 
soviet leader in march 1985 
i would not interpret this step as being at odds with glasnost 
and democracy gerasimov said on the contrary the step 
opposes anarchy 
spokesman vladimir a yanchenkov of the interior ministry which 
is in charge of police affairs said in moscow tuesday that the 
death toll in the caucasus had reached 56 in azerbaijan with 156 
people injured 
two of the dead were members of law enforcement agencies he 
said most of the victims were armenians the ministry said 
yanchenkov said authorities had recorded 167 pogroms 
meaning ethnic attacks and cases of arson 
in saturday nights antiarmenian riots in baku people were 
reported burned alive and a witness said women were thrown from 
apartment windows 
fighting rapidly spread to nagornokarabakh and nearby areas of 
azerbaijan with the belligerants using helicopters armored 
vehicles machine guns and other arms seized from government 
arsenals or offered by compatriots 
soviet tv on tuesday showed interior ministry troops firing in 
the air as they rode in armored personnel carrier through an 
azerbaijani village near nagornokarabakh to enforce the emergency 
decree 
the ministry said the azerbaijani peoples front a grassroots 
political group that has organized antiarmenian protests was 
preventing arriving troop reinforcements from traveling to battle 
areas by blocking roads 
in nagornokarabakh about 26000 people about a sixth of the 
population had been detained and nearly 3000 firearms and other 
weapons confiscated since the conflict began izvestia said 
azerbaijanis were said tuesday to be continuing a virtual rail 
blockade of armenias 35 million people cutting short fuel and 
other supplies azerbaijan has 69 million people 
in baku detachment of security troops patrolled the city and 
armored vehicles moved through the suburbs of the caspian sea port 
azerbaijani activist alesker siyabov said by telephone 
tass said 2000 armenians were evacuated by ferry and plane from 
baku an oilproducing center of 17 million 
of the 220000 armenians who lived there before the strife over 
nagornokarabakh began only a few thousand remain it said 
in february 1988 azerbaijanis went on an antiarmenian rampage 
in the industrial city of sumgait near baku and 32 people mostly 
armenians were killed

president najibs government claims to 
have made tangible gains in its 3yearold program of national 
reconciliation even though it has not succeeded in ending the 
countrys protracted civil war 
government officials acknowledge that fighting between their 
sovietarmed troops and usbacked moslem guerrillas continues to 
claim heavy tolls in life and property 
but they also claim to be achieving success through a campaign 
of offering amnesty to any guerrillas who surrender and cash for 
their weapons 
najib former head of the feared khad secret police launched 
his national reconciliation program in january 1987 with the first 
of a series of shortlived ceasefires that have been routinely 
rejected by the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
the last three years have been really difficult and full of 
problems because of the enemies of national reconciliation but we 
have made a number of fruitful gains government spokesman naquib 
sameer said 
he asserted that 70 percent of armed opposition commanders 
have laid down their weapons and joined national reconciliation 
guerrilla leaders based across the border in pakistan admit that 
some of their fighters in afghanistan have struck deals with 
najibs government but they say the majority are still fighting 
azim nasserzia spokesman for the national islamic front of 
afghanistan one of the seven pakistanbased mujahedeen factions 
scoffed at sameers claim 
maybe 70 percent of the mujahedeen have taken najibs arms and 
money but only to use it against him he said 
kabul officials claim that 168 armed opposition groups have 
joined najibs national reconciliation process and that an 
additional 351 groups have signed ceasefire agreements 
these officials estimate that between 30000 and 40000 
mujahedeen are still fighting the najib government whose combat 
troops number about 50000 
mujahedeen leaders however claim they have a fighting force of 
150000 who move freely in much of the afghan countryside but have 
failed to capture a single major city in the nearly 12yearold 
civil war 
the mujahedeen denounce najibs peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan as godless communists and steadfastly refuse to 
enter into any powersharing arrangements 
abdul rahim spokesman for the mujahedeen news agency midia 
said battlefield reports contradict najibs claims of massive 
support for the reconciliation process 
if anyone has joined the communists its because they were 
communists before rahim said the real mujahedeen commander 
would never join najib 
the afghan war started in 1978 when the peoples democratic 
party seized power in a military coup and embarked upon the marxist 
policies that najib now seeks to disavow 
in 1979 internal rivalries spurred another military coup within 
the party by december 1979 soviet troops swooped in to install 
yet a third marxist government and stayed on to fight the growing 
mujahedeen insurgency 
the red army managed only a stalemate before withdrawing its 
troops over a ninemonth period that ended last february 
najib has since been massively supplied by moscow with weapons 
and food but has not achieved a military victory over the fierce 
mountain guerrillas 
but he has foiled american and other western predictions that 
his government would quickly tumble once the soviets withdrew their

caused a christmas eve fire that killed 16 people at a retirement 
center according to investigators who dont expect criminal 
charges

who was described as a chain smoker by other residents of the john 
sevier retirement center officials said tuesday 
a senior state arson investigator johnny robertson and other 
investigators held a news conference to discuss their findings but 
they did not say whether ms jones 67 was home at the time of the 
fire 
all other causes were eliminated said robert frost a fire 
investigator for the tennessee department of commerce and insurance 
we didnt find anything that would allow us to eliminate it 
smoking frost said 
the fire the second fatal blaze in two months at the 10floor 
center spread to the second floor and parts of the third floor and 
smoke permeated the building before flames were brought under 
control

fire at the center

residents on the tiny 
atlantic island of porto santo used shovels and buckets to battle a 
mysterious 12milelong oil slick that blackened beaches and 
threatened a valuable nature reserve 
help was sent to the portuguese island on tuesday when the 
lisbon government sent an air force transport plane carrying an 
antipollution team armed with floating barriers pumps and other 
equipment to combat the slick 
since monday patches of oil have washed up on the vacation 
islands famous sixmile white sand beach on the south coast while 
more crude coated the rocky north and east coasts with thick slime 
some of the islands residents using shovels and buckets to 
fight the slick said the oilsoaked corpses of gulls turtles and 
fish washed onto the island 
the slick off the coast stretched over 12 miles posing a threat 
to the water supply for the 5000 residents of porto santo and to a 
nature reserve on the uninhabited desertas islands 37 miles to the 
south 
the origin of the oil slick was still undetermined 
portuguese navy officers said it was unlikely the crude came 
from the iranian tanker khark 5 which leaked more than 70000 tons 
into the atlantic in the area in december the lusa news agency 
reported 
the oil that washed up this week was dense and black suggesting 
a more recent leak oil that has been in the sea longer turns 
yellowish and foamy the report said 
in a portugese television interview a merchant marine official 
said the oil could have been dumped from a number of tankers which 
passed along the busy sea lanes off the madeira islands 
the volcanic islands famed for their rocky beauty and 
subtropical climate are about 625 miles southwest of lisbon and 
about 435 miles west of the moroccan coast 
madeira biologist manuel biscoito told lusa he was worried the 
damage the slick could cause to the desertas 
the craggy islands are home to a variety of rare maritime 
animals including one of the worlds last breeding colonies of the 
mediterranean monk seal an endangered marine mammal 
madeira island itself the largest member of the achipelago and 
a major winter vacation destination was not immediately threatened 
by the slick officials said but could come into danger if wind 
directions changed 
an emergency meeting of the madeira regional government called 
to discuss the situation was alerted to the threat to drinking 
water on porto santo 
the islanders take 80 percent of their drinking water from 
desalination plants drawing water from the sea the pumps supplying 
sea water to the system would have to be stopped if the slick 
approached the intake area officials said

the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition forced to operate covertly since being 
banned two years ago announced today that it is resuming 
fullscale aboveground operations 
the move is intended as a test of the whiteled governments 
professed commitment to reform 
senior leaders of the united democratic front representing more 
than 600 organizations with more than 2 million members said they 
would reopen offices across the country and begin planning for a 
national conference in april 
in what we see as a challenging period ahead of us we have 
decided to claim our rights to engage in open opposition 
activity murphy morobe one of the coalitions chief spokesmen 
told a news conference we owe it to our people that the 
leadership of our movement is openly available at this crucial 
moment in the struggle 
morobe also said a delegation of 22 leaders of the front planned 
to meet soon with nelson mandela jailed leader of the african 
national congress guerrilla movement mandela is expected to be 
released in the coming weeks after nearly 28 years in prison 
the united democratic front which shares the ancs goals of a 
nonracial democracy was established in 1983 to mobilize 
resistance to a new constitution that entrenched the exclusion of 
the black majority from parliament 
many leaders of the organization were detained for two to three 
years after a nationwide state of emergency was declared in june 
1986 and in february 1988 the government listed the front among 17 
organizations prohibited from engaging in any activities 
the emergency has hurt us and at some levels disorganized 
us said azhar cachalia a member of the fronts executive 
commitee but the the main purpose of the emergency to smash the 
udf has failed we are probably stronger now than we have ever 
been 
he said the decision to resume overt operations was intended as 
a challenge to president fw de klerk who since taking office in 
august has eased restrictions on antigovernment protests and 
invited black leaders to help negotiate a new constitution that 
would extend some form of political rights to blacks 
we are now in a concrete way beginning to test his 
intentions and his commitment to a new south africa cachalia 
said 
morobe said no date had yet been set for the meeting between 
front leaders and mandela who has been conferring at his prison 
residence with government officials and prominent antiapartheid 
activists 
we believe he is in a historically unique position that can 
open up new possibilities and opportunities which can only advance 
the cause of liberation morobe said 
morobe said the front and the anc agree on the preconditions 
needed before the two organizations will enter negotiations with 
the government these include the release of mandela and other 
political prisoners lifting of the state of emergency unbanning 
of the anc and other opposition groups removal of soldiers from 
black townships and an end to political trials 
under apartheid the countrys 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

a highranking soviet general 
acknowledged today that political upheaval in moscows east 
european allies will affect the structure of the warsaw pact 
military alliance 
there will be changes in structure said gen nikolaj 
chervov head of the directorate of the soviet general staff 
he spoke to reporters on the second day of unprecedented talks 
among the top officers of 35 nations about their military policies 
the threeweek meeting opened tuesday with gen colin powell 
chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff and his soviet 
counterpart gen mikhail moiseyev outlining the superpowers 
strategies officers from poland czechoslovakia and east germany 
were scheduled to speak later today 
western military experts have been anxious to hear the east bloc 
reports hoping to learn more about how recent political events 
will shape future policies of the sevennation warsaw pact 
popular uprisings have driven out the hardline communist 
leaderships in poland hungary bulgaria east germany romania and 
czechoslovakia 
the united states and 15 of its allies belong to the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
chervov speaking through an interpreter said the warsaw pacts 
top governing body the political consultative committee will 
likely be disbanded 
the panel is made up of the top communist party officials of the 
seven nations 
the fast pace of change in those countries he said has led to 
the multiplicity of parties 
the communist parties are no longer leading the states he 
said therefore the political consultative committee will 
probably cease to exist of itself and perhaps there will be another 
supreme body 
the new body he said could be made up of the heads of state of 
those countries 
he also said the top military officers in the warsaw pact 
countries have confirmed their states will remain true to their 
alliance obligations western officials have been looking for 
hints of a dramatic weakening in the warsaw pact 
on tuesday sir david craig chief of the british defense staff 
said he did not see signs of a collapse in the sevennation 
alliance 
clearly i think they would all recognize amongst the seven of 
them that there are changes afoot he said but to talk about 
the breakup of the pact was not the impression i was left with 
today 
moiseyev told the gathering the soviet union was trimming its 
armed forces as part of plans to rework its military policies 
the west contends the soviets powerful military might could 
seize and hold foreign territory in time of war the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization argues its forces are the 
minimum necessary to defend against an attack 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced in december 1988 
plans to unilaterally slash 500000 troops and reduce conventional 
or nonnuclear arms substantially moiseyev said half the 
reductions were carried out last year and the rest will be 
completed in 1990 
as of jan 1 he said soviet armed forces were down by 265000 
he said 9320 tanks more than 5050 artillery systems and 835 
warplanes have been reduced in europe 
the military budget he said was cut by 82 percent last year 
and will be pared by more than 14 percent in the next two years 
we also intend if the situation permits to drastically by 
15 to 2 times reduce the share of the national incomes spending 
on defense by 1995 he said 
craig said the west wanted to believe the kremlin intends to 
change its military policy 
but he said there is a long way to go between intentions 
and execution we must wait and see how that execution is carried 
out 
the meeting at viennas hofburg palace the former imperial 
residence is part of negotiations on confidence and 
securitybuilding measures which are designed to reduce military 
tensions in europe 
the united states canada and nearly all european nations are 
taking part

black and mixedrace children were 
admitted to formerly whitesonly schools for the first time today 
as namibia prepares to end south african rule and become 
independent 
also today police said that thousands of mortar rounds and 
other munitions are being destroyed following the winding down of 
the war between south african forces and nationalist guerrillas 
twentytwo black and mixedrace students enrolled at centaurus 
high school in windhoek as the new school year began school 
officials said 
a similar number of nonwhite applicants were refused admission 
after failing english tests they said 
aside from the normal requirements regarding uniforms and 
fees etc our only requirement is that pupils must be able to 
speak and understand english said a school spokeswoman who 
declined to be named it was just like any school enrollment on 
the first day of term 
education officials said they had no immediate figures on how 
many blacks and mixedrace students were admitted today to formerly 
all white schools in the territory 
south african officials announced last week that whitesonly 
schools would be allowed to admit blacks for the first time this 
year special schools and hospitals have been reserved exclusively 
for whites in the past 
south africa is about to end its rule of namibia following a 
long bush war with the black nationalist southwest african peoples 
organization or swapo which won elections in november and is to 
head the government when independence is declared in the next few 
weeks 
south africa had ruled namibia also known as southwest africa 
since seizing the territory from germany during world war i 
police officials said today that the munitions including mortar 
rounds rocketpropelled grenades and land mines were being 
destroyed with explosives rather than returning them to south 
africa the munitions were used by south african and allied 
southwest african forces 
explosive experts this week detonated 4000 south africanmade 
mortar rounds in one huge blast at kwambi in the north of the 
country

us marshals acting under a 
federal law aimed at stripping drug dealers of their means of doing 
business seized the house of a 73yearold psychiatrist accused of 
illegally writing prescriptions there 
tuesdays seizure of the home of henry spitzer marked the first 
use of the forfeiture statute against a doctor in california 
authorities said 
spitzer surrendered his license to practice last year after he 
was charged with 16 felonies in 1988 undercover agents had 
concluded he was prescribing valium and an amphetamine in cases 
where it was not medically warranted 
federal law provides for the seizure of a home car or other 
property if the property was purchased with drug profits or used in 
drug trafficking 
he was practicing in his home issuing prescriptions from 
there so this case met the test said dan goldsmith a senior 
investigator for the state medical board which worked with the 
drug enforcement administration on the case 
were breaking new ground here goldsmith said this hits 
them where it hurts in the wallet 
a medical board spokesman said spitzer can remain in his 
150000 house pending a hearing in court if the seizure is 
upheld the house will be auctioned and the proceeds divided among 
agencies that participated in the investigation 
under a 1989 plea bargain spitzer agreed to surrender his 
medical license and pay restitution to the board in return for 
dismissal of the criminal charges but the board decided to pursue 
seizure of the home 
i think he figured this whole thing was over and done with

the rhode island philharmonics entire 
percussion section quit after its leader was told he would be fired 
unless his playing improved 
george goneconto a 33year veteran of the orchestra said 
tuesday he resigned rather than fight a notice putting him on 
probation his decision led to the resignations last month of the 
three other percussion members all former students of the drummer 
conductor andrew massey who sent warning letters to eight 
members of the orchestra at the end of november was in california 
and could not be reached for comment 
philharmonic manager karen dobbs said the resignations just 
added to the instability of the orchestra 
if they end up with new people back there all the time its 
very difficult she said 
goneconto said he and massey had a friendly discussion about 
his performance in the fall and he received the letter soon 
afterward which he called a complete shock 
under the orchestras contract with the providence federation of 
musicians players who receive warning letters have until the end 
of the season to improve they can appeal to a panel of fellow 
orchestra members who can overrule massey 
goneconto 53 joined the philharmonic when he was 18 and has 
been the principal percussionist for 30 years 
i felt it was time to look for warmer and comfortable places 
to perform in where the atmosphere is less confrontational 
goneconto said 
dobbs said she received letters from goneconto bruce dyer 
ronald stabile and john beaulieu on dec 11 the day before 
rehearsals began for the christmas pops program the musicians 
offered no explanation for their resignations she said 
i just no longer wanted to be part of an organization like 
that stabile said 
goneconto played the kettle drums for the orchestra and the 
three others played an array of instruments including triangle 
marimba and cymbals

lebanese media today clashed with 
christian gen michel aoun over his ban on recognizing president 
elias hrawi with newspapers and broadcasters calling a news strike 
in protest of his orders 
aoun who does not recognize the president or government chosen 
under an arabbrokered peace accord issued a directive tuesday 
threatening to punish news organizations if they refer to the 
syrianbacked hrawi as president and to salim hoss a sunni moslem 
as prime minister 
the army command of gen emile lahoud which is loyal to hrawi 
quickly responded by warning the media against applying aouns 
directive or reporting any of his activity terming him an 
impostor 
the conservative daily addiyar defied aouns ban in a 
frontpage editorial by publishereditor charles ayoub 
following aouns instructions he wrote would mean 
suffocation it is a serious beginning to limit the freedom of 
the press 
ayoubs article was repeatedly broadcast by moslem radio 
stations operating in west beirut which is outside aouns control 
aouns 20000 troops control the 310squaremile christian 
enclave which includes beiruts eastern sector and a narrow strip 
northeast of the capital 
the nations most prestigious newspaper annahar based in 
moslem west beirut failed to publish in an apparent protest of the 
ban 
and christian radio and television stations observed a news 
strike for a second day to express rejection of aouns orders but 
have avoided a direct confrontation with him 
aoun in a statement released by his office said attorney 
general joseph fraiha was instructed to take legal action 
against addiyar which operates in an area controlled by aouns 
troops 
the short statement did not clarify what legal action would be 
taken but aoun told newspaper editors tuesday that violators of 
his instructions would be dealt with legally not under the press 
law but under the criminal code 
the leftist assafir which publishes in syrianpoliced west 
beirut said aoun was placing freedom of the press under house 
arrest 
a frontpage banner headline said aouns directive was another 
separationist decision by the 54yearold general who has refused 
to acknowledge the election of hrawi as president by 
parliamentarians nov 24 
aoun who was appointed by former president amin gemayel as head 
of an interim military cabinet sept 22 1988 has declared the 
nations onechamber house dissolved to prevent the election of a 
prosyrian head of state 
the general is on a crusade to drive from lebanon the 40000 
syrian troops that control much of the countryside making damascus 
the main power broker in lebanon 
aouns opponents said his decision to dissove parliament was 
unconstitutional noting that only a president has the right to 
dissolve the legislature 
in addition to addiyar four other daily papers publish in the 
christian enclave and six in beiruts moslem western sector 
the conservative daily alanwar based in beiruts christian 
suburb of hazmiyeh near aouns headquarters followed the generals 
instructions 
the voice of lebanon radio of the rightist phalange party and 
the voice of free lebanon of the christian lebanese forces militia 
did not report news for the second straight day in another apparent 
protest 
the lebanese broadcasting corp the television station of the 
lebanese forces also suspended its newscasts monday 
the three christian news organizations said they were 
considering aouns directive 
the strike and addiyars defiance of aoun reflected a growing 
split within christian ranks over an arab leaguebrokered peace 
plan to end the 14yearold moslemchristian civil war that has 
killed more than 150000 lives 
hrawi was elected president under the peace plan worked out by 
lebanese legislators in saudi arabia 
the internationally recognized hrawi immediately dismissed aoun 
as prime minister and army commander but the defiant general held 
out in the christian enclave refusing to hand over the 
presidential palace to hrawi

african national congress leader walter 
sisulu today said the group should increase its military and 
political pressure in the fight against apartheid although racial 
tensions are easing in south africa 
sisulu told about 1000 exiled anc members that they should work 
toward negotiations with the south african government but pursue 
their armed struggle to maintain pressure for rapid change of 
racial laws and societal structures 
sisulu and seven anc colleagues all of whom served lengthy 
prison terms in south africa are on a visit to lusaka the 
guerrilla movements exile headquarters they came to help 
coordinate anc strategy in the face of a fastchanging political 
climate in south africa 
the ancs political and military wings and the international 
community should intensify the struggle against apartheid even 
though there may be an easing of tensions at home sisulu said 
the political struggle and the armed struggle go side by 
side he said 
the 60 and 70yearold men received a rousing welcome from the 
anc members who chanted sang freedom songs and gave clenched fist 
salutes the hall was draped in the green black and gold banners 
of the anc and many members wore anc scarves 
since south african president fw de klerk assumed power in 
august he has allowed opposition groups to protest openly and has 
urged negotiations on a new constitution that would include a 
political voice for the black majority 
but de klerk says the anc the main group fighting to undermine 
the white government must commit itself to peaceful solutions and 
end its military campaign before participating in negotiations 
the anc says the government must lift the state of emergency 
legalize the anc and end trials and hangings of guerrillas before 
talks begin 
sisulu and his colleagues campaign openly for their organization 
in south africa but the anc remains outlawed 
sisulu praised the anc and its ally the south african communist 
party for taking the initiative and setting down conditions 
for talks 
the anc has an estimated 15000 members many of whom are at 
guerrilla camps in tanzania and uganda the organization has no 
offices or military bases in countries bordering south africa but 
it has millions of supporters inside the country 
the anc meetings occur amid widespread speculation that the 
groups best known figure nelson mandela will be freed within 
weeks after more than 27 years behind bars 
mandela and the recently released anc leaders no longer hold 
formal titles in the organization and leadership is a major issue 
facing the organization 
the current president oliver tambo 71 is in a swedish clinic 
recovering from a stroke sisulu said he intends to visit him 
before returning home the anc in tanzania said the leaders were 
expected there jan 23

amnesty international today accused south korea of 
reversing a twoyear trend of human rights improvements citing 
mass arrests and the reported torture of prisoners 
the worldwide human rights organization said 800 political and 
trade union activists have been arrested in major cities in a 
crackdown on political opposition by president roh taewoos 
government 
thousands more were briefly detained for participating in 
demonstrations or industrial strikes the londonbased group said 
and leading dissidents and students leaders went into hiding to 
escape arrest 
kwang sik kim press attache at the south korean embassy in 
london said officials had not seen the report and could not 
comment on it 
in south korea today several newspapers quoted unidentified 
government intelligence officials who accused north korea of 
holding more than 150000 political prisoners in concentration 
camps called dictatorial districts 
the situation in north korea is much worse than that of the 
notorious stalinist era in the soviet union the national yonhap 
news agency quoted one official as saying 
in april south korea banned from political activity people with 
unacceptable views on reunification with north korea or labor 
activities amnesty said many people who have since been arrested 
were denied regular access to lawyers and relatives 
some alleged they were tortured or illtreated 
amnesty said the arrests reverse a trend in human rights 
improvements that had resulted in presidential amnesties in 1987 
and 1988 and the release of more than 1000 political prisoners 
hundreds of prisoners were believed being held for political 
reasons at the end of 1989 and another 200 political prisoners 
have been held for between one and 39 years the group said 
it called for the release of 100 prisoners of conscience 
believed to have been arrested for the nonviolent exercise of their 
fundamental rights 
amnesty alleged that rohs government has done little to review 
the cases of longterm political prisoners or to investigate human 
rights abuses under the previous government 
it said the majority of political prisoners have been charged 
with antistate activities under the national security law that 
provides for long sentences for illegal travel to north korea 
contact with groups supporting north korea or even possessing books 
about or from north korea 
the mere fact of traveling to north korea without evidence 
either of espionage activities or of the use of advocacy of 
violence cannot justify imprisonment amnesty said 
the report said many of south koreas 200 longterm prisoners 
were convicted of being north korean spies or agents it said the 
definition of espionage is so broad that some may actually be 
prisoners of conscience 
the countrys national assembly discussed amendments to the law 
in 1989 but no changes were made amnesty said 
the group said it was also concerned about reports of torture 
and illtreatment of prisoners despite government measures to 
prevent torture after the death of a student under torture in 
january 1987 
it said prosecution authorities investigating allegations of 
torture made by several former political prisoners have begun 
judicial proceedings against police officers for assault in only 
one case 
amnesty said seven prisoners were executed last year in a bid to 
curb an increase in violent crime after two years of no executions

the chief of state security has 
resigned following allegations that his agency illegally monitored 
opposition activities the official mti news agency reported today 
the report did not say when jozsef horvath resigned 
horvath in a letter sent recently to interior minister istvan 
horvath asked to be relieved of his post because of the loss of 
confidence in the service and in himself mti said the two men 
are not related 
horvath rejected allegations that his service carried out 
illegal activities including monitoring of opposition leaders as 
they prepare for elections march 25 
leaders of the league of free democrats and the alliance of 
young democrats last week showed reporters copies of documents they 
said belonged to the interior ministrys state security service 
containing information on their organizations and their campaign 
strategies 
the opposition leaders refused to say where or how they acquired 
the documents 
jozsef horvath said the loss of public confidence would do 
great damage to the secret service operations in the future 
i deem it unfair that at the very beginning of the 
investigations we were subject to prejudice and were pronounced 
guilty he said in the letter according to mti 
the opposition groups said they had asked the state prosecutors 
office to launch an investigation and criminal proceedings against 
persons unknown for violating the constitution and the penal 
code 
hungarys security organs regularly monitored dissident 
activities during four decades of communist rule in october the 
communist party formally disbanded reconstituting itself as the 
hungarian socialist party and aspiring to democratic ideals 
parliament rewrote the constitution to incorporate multiparty 
democracy and adopt laws allowing several parties to contest this

an abortion protester who faced no more 
than 30 days in jail but wound up spending a year behind bars 
because he wouldnt give his name has been released his identity 
still in question 
i did what i think was right the man who has identified 
himself only as baby john doe told judge randall nichols at a 
hearing tuesday in which he won his freedom 
nicholls ordered the protester who had been in custody since 
his arrest exactly year ago for blocking the doors to a knoxville 
health clinic to pay 12547 to the county for the cost of jailing 
him 
the protester said he hoped his demonstration to make abortion 
illegal in tennessee had advanced his cause 
maybe not with the legislature he said but the hearts 
of some people 
the protester was charged with criminal trespassing after 
refusing to leave the clinic during a protest by the antiabortion 
group operation rescue the charge carried up to 30 days in jail 
nichols convicted him in september but refused to impose the 
sentence until the man who was booked as baby john doe and is 
reportedly 25 years old and from out of state identified himself 
on tuesday assistant district attorney david jennings recounted 
his offices unsuccessful efforts to determine the mans identity 
and said a guard at the penal farm where the man was held told 
authorities his name might be gary christopher 
when asked if that was his name the protester said i cannot 
comment on that sir 
the judge agreed to release the man under the names baby john 
doe and gary christopher saying his decision was affected by 
nightly questions from his 8yearold son on the protesters fate 
letters from all over the united states on his behalf and 
overcrowding in the county jail 
asked how the court will be able to track down the man if he 
fails to pay the 12547 the judge said it was a valid question 
i would hope to be able to use the powers of the state of 
tennessee to find out he said

a quarter of polands farmland is so polluted 
with lead zinc cadmium and mercury that it might be dangerous to 
grow vegetables in it ninetyfive percent of the countrys rivers 
are undrinkable and half so toxic that the water cant even be 
used in industry for fear of destroying equipment 
in hungary air pollution accounts for one in 17 deaths a 
quarter to a third of the forests in four of the six countries of 
eastern europe show signs of dying from air pollution 
small wonder then say american environmentalists that in the 
upheavals which have thrown out the old regimes of poland east 
germany czechoslovakia hungary and romania one of the persistent 
demands has been for environmental repair 
pollution was part and parcel of the system that molested the 
people in their daily lives says jeffrey leonard of the world 
wildlife fund author of several books on eastern europes 
pollution problems 
now environmentalists take hope that the new leaders of eastern 
europe site of some of the worlds worst pollution will seek to 
alleviate the conditions which are turning their countries to ruin 
and threatening the health of the people 
environmental conditions are so bad they affect the very 
possibility of having economic growth said jessica tuchman 
mathews of world resources institute a research organization 
how does a country rebuild a shattered economy when it cant 
breathe its air till its soil or drink its water 
said richard liroff director of the eastern european 
environmental affairs program of the conservation foundation 
people there are saying weve had enough our health is being 
threatened our lungs damaged our forests destroyed our children 
harmed by lead and heavy metals in the environment 
but the question remains whether east europeans having to cope 
with unemployment inflation and bankruptcy as they move toward 
market economies will be tempted to put environmental concerns 
aside as they struggle to remodel their economies and political 
structures 
theyre going to have to make some extremely hard choices 
said liroff a lot of their industry especially in poland is 
antiquated rather than trying to place pollution control equipment 
on it it might be better to shut it down entirely and eventually 
replace it with modern equipment that is energy and resource 
efficient and doesnt pollute as much but that means unemployment 
is society willing to accept that cost i just dont know 
civic forum which formed the basis of the new government of 
czechoslovakia appeared to provide its answer in laying out its 
program for the nation last fall 
we all must seek a method of restoring harmony between man and 
his environment civic forum said we will strive for a 
gradual repairing of the damage which has been inflicted upon 
nature during recent decades we are aware that this will mean 
sacrifices on the part of all of us this will require a change in 
value scales and lifestyles 
said playwright vaclav havel upon taking office as the new czech 
president we have laid waste to our soil and the rivers and the 
forests that our forefathers bequeathed to us and we have the 
worst environment in the whole of europe today adults in our 
country die earlier than in most other european countries 
william chandler senior scientist with battelles pacific 
northwest laboratories and he is confident the poles will make the 
sacrifices necessary to build an energyefficient and 
environmentally clean industrial plant for its future 
us environmentalists say the attempt to combat the air 
pollution that leads to global warming could be undermined unless 
the pollution of eastern europe and the soviet union is curtailed 
what happens in eastern europe is very important for global 
warming because they burn so much coal said liroff the 
eastern european countries need to be put on an energy diet in much 
the same way as the united states and other industrialized nations 
need to be put on one

yugoslavias communist government 
said today that it will ask parliament to approve legislation that 
would legalize opposition parties 
the proposal would allow independent political parties and 
citizens associations to register with authorities to gain 
official recognition the staterun tanjug news agency reported 
but groups advocating the violent overthrow of the 
constitution violations of guaranteed human rights or 
spreading national and religious hatred still would be 
prohibited according to the draft law 
tanjug did not say when the draft would be submitted to 
parliament 
prime minister ante markovic who has moved to introduce 
sweeping marketoriented economic reforms since he took office in 
march has said he also wants democratic reforms in yugoslavia 
earlier this month the communist leadership announced the 
nations first free parliamentary elections in 45 years 
tentatively scheduled for april 812 
when they came to power in 1945 the communists abolished all 
opposition parties but last month the party leadership unveiled a 
draft declaration that pledges full support for the establishment 
of a multiparty parliamentary system the communist party is to 
adopt the declaration at a national congress on saturday 
despite a lack of official recognition several dozen political 
parties and independent citizens groups have been formed over the 
past 18 months 
the liberal leadership of yugoslavias northern state of 
slovenia has led the drive for democratic reforms communist 
hardliners in some southern regions particularly serbia at first 
strongly opposed the drive but later gave their support for reforms

hijack a jetliner to cuba but was overpowered by a police officer 
who sneaked up an escape chute after the plane made an emergency 
landing authorities said 
no one was seriously hurt late tuesday during the america west 
flight that was supposed to fly nonstop from houston to las vegas 
the boeing 737 carrying 39 people landed in austin shortly 
before midnight after the pilot told the wouldbe hijacker the

in front of him complaining loudly about american tv programs 
authorities identified the man as jose manuel gonzalezgonzalez 
a 39yearold cuban native who lives in new orleans fbi agent 
byron sage said he expected the man to be charged with air piracy 
and kidnapping 
gonzalezgonzalez told reporters as he was being put in a police 
car that he tried to hijack the plane because he thought he was in 
danger because of my political beliefs 
when asked what those beliefs were he said i feel this 
country is in peril he was driven away before he could comment 
further 
authorities said police capt lloyd polk climbed into the 
jetliner after gonzalezgonzalez released the 34 passengers and 
three of the five crew members allowing them to slide down an 
emergency chute to freedom 
polk said he had hoped to negotiate with the man but once 
inside polk said it appeared that a flight attendant was in 
danger 
i saw he had the stewardess so i took action immediately

hold him to the ground until more help arrived 
no bomb was found several passengers said it appeared the man 
carried a flashlight and a rope which he used to choke flight

thirty men suspected of being part of a 
band of rebels that launched attacks in liberia have been arrested 
in neighboring ivory coast a newspaper said today 
the daily observer said the suspected rebels were arrested in 
the town of danane 25 miles from liberias border the story 
quoted unidentified diplomats as saying the men were being 
questioned in abidjan capital of ivory coast 
fighting was first reported in liberias northeastern nimba 
county on dec 24 after liberian officials said about 100 
dissidents entered the country from ivory coast in an attempt to 
overthrow the government 
an estimated 20000 liberians have fled to guinea and ivory 
coast since then to escape fighting ivorian president felix 
houphouetboigny said this month that 8000 to 10000 liberians had 
entered his country 
liberian authorities say rebels killed about 200 people 
including 16 government officials before troops brought the 
situation under control 
however the human rights organizations amnesty international 
and africa watch have accused liberian soldiers of killing unarmed 
civilians during the unrest 
jenkin scott liberias justice minister admitted last week 
that soldiers had killed civilians but said they acted in 
selfdefense 
daniel sio chief of the small liberian border town of butuo 
where rebels first attacked told the observer a different story 
sio said troops rounded up all local officials on arrival and 
accused them of failing to repulse the rebels then the soldiers 
opened fire and set the town on fire he was quoted as saying 
sio who was shot in the right leg was left for dead and later 
fled to ivory coast the observer said 
the united states on tuesday expressed concern over the civilian 
casualties caused by the dissidents and the troops 
the west african nation of liberia was founded in 1847 by freed 
american slaves and maintains strong cultural and economic ties 
with united states 
liberias military placed nimba county under a state of 
emergency and last week evacuated about 5000 people from the 
village of karnplay and surrounding areas where the fighting was 
heaviest 
the dissidents who call themselves the liberian patriotic 
front are led by charles taylor a former liberian civil servant 
taylor said tuesday his fighters had launched a new offensive but 
gave no indication of its size 
president samuel doe a former master sergeant who seized power 
in a 1980 bloody coup has accused ivory coast of harboring the 
dissidents a charge ivory coast denies

the grandsons of a prospector killed in 
1949 in a dispute over a buried treasure plan to resume the search 
in what is now an army missile range 
even if it proves to be fools gold terry and james delonis 
hope their as yet unscheduled expedition will remove the stigma 
attached to their family for 30 years 
this is more exciting than i can describe terry delonis 
said last week 
the delonises grandfather milton e doc noss claimed to 
have discovered a cache of gold bullion and coins inside a cavern 
on victorio peak while he his wife and some friends were hunting 
deer in 1937 
noss and his wife ova said they made several efforts to 
recover the gold but accidentally sealed the entrance while trying 
to expand it 
during world war ii the army took over the area and it now 
lies on the restricted white sands missile range 
noss was shot to death during an argument with a backer in a 
treasure hunt in 1949 ova noss died in 1979 but the grandsons 
plan to continue the quest for the fabled treasure 
the brothers said they grew up hearing tales of the buried 
treasure from their grandmother who told the stories in great 
detail 
she also had a good mind for numbers james delonis said 
she could recall depths distances degrees etc 
the army allowed a professional treasurehunting company 
expeditions unlimited of florida onto the range in 1977 the 
company which represented several claimants to the treasure found 
nothing but said ground radar did indicated a cavern beneath the 
peak 
the company headed by norman scott ran out of time before the 
cavern could be excavated 
two previous searches also failed to turn up any gold and the 
army said after the 1977 hunt that the range would be closed to 
searchers 
but rep joe skeen rnm sponsored an amendment to the 1989 
defense authorization act to allow noss family heirs to dig for the 
legendary treasure although they must pay the expenses skeen said 
anything found would be turned over to the courts to decide 
ownership 
the brothers hired expeditions unlimited to head the operation 
and announced they have formed a foundation to help in searching 
for the treasure 
terry delonis said recent ground radar readings again revealed a 
cavern in the same place indicated by the 1977 expedition 
no date for the search has been announced 
but the army has agreed to take reporters to the site jan 25 
the gold according to various stories was said to have been 
stored in the peak by spanish conquistadores who mined it nearby 
or was loot gathered by the apache chief victorio for whom the 
mountain was named 
some have contended the federal government found and removed the 
gold years ago but the army has denied those stories

domestic oil production in 1989 took the 
steepest yearly fall in history and petroleum imports rose to a 
10year high the industry said today 
the american petroleum institute the trade association of the 
major oil companies also said that while us oil consumption 
increased only slightly imports rose to 46 percent of total 
supplies that was the secondhighest level on record 
the figures confirm a continued decline of the domestic oil 
industry and are expected to add heat to a debate in congress this 
year over whether exploration and production companies should get 
new tax breaks to stimulate drilling activity 
the bush administration has argued that declining us oil 
production and increasing reliance on foreign producers is 
undermining national energy security 
in its yearend report the petroleum institute said us crude 
oil production averaged 76 million barrels a day in 1989 that was 
the lowest in 26 years and a decline of 553000 barrels per day or 
68 percent from the 1988 total 
alaskan oil production which had increased almost every year 
since the start of production from the huge prudhoe bay field in 
1977 fell by 140000 barrels per day in 1989 
the report said the alaska decline was exaggerated by 
maintenance work and traffic restrictions following the exxon 
valdez oil tanker spill last march and that the underlying 
decline trend in alaska was about 100000 barrels per day 
oil imports rose to 79 million barrels a day last year up 82 
percent from 1988 and nearly 60 percent above the 1985 level when 
imports sank to a low of 5 million barrels a day before prices 
collapsed on the world market in 1986 
the report said that while imports from western hemisphere 
sources still accounted for about 43 percent of total imports in 
1989 imports from the persian gulf continued to grow to 21 percent 
of the total 
total imports accounted for 46 percent of oil consumed in the 
united states last year that was the secondhighest ever after 
the 477 percent level of 1977 as recently as 1985 imports share 
of domestic consumption was only 315 percent 
the rise in total us energy consumption last year slowed to 
19 percent after increases of 35 percent in 1987 and 40 percent 
in 1988 the report said

yasser arafat today denounced a statement 
by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir that israel must retain 
the west bank and gaza strip to settle jews from the soviet union 
as racist and expansionist 
in jerusalem today vice premier shimon peres prepared for a 
meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo next week in 
an effort to break the stalemate in middle east peace efforts a 
peres aide said 
arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization said 
shamirs claim on the status of the occupied territories poses a 
threat to palestinians arabs and the international community 
we the palestinians are going on with our resistance to the 
israeli occupation but it is a challenge to all arabs which we 
should confront arafat told the associated press 
shamir declared monday that israel needs to retain the west bank 
and gaza the focal points of the middle east conflict to settle 
an influx of jewish immigrants from the soviet union 
for a large immigration we need the land of israel a great 
and strong israel shamir told the likud we will need a lot of 
place to absorb everybody 
the term land of israel is used by members of the rightwing 
likud bloc in references to israel and the occupied territories 
which were captured from jordan and egypt by israel in 1967 
arafat said shamirs statement clearly demonstrates israels 
ambitions and shamirs unwillingness to accept a peace settlement 
this reveals the true ugly face of israel which wants to 
swallow more land and reject all peace efforts arafat added 
calling shamirs statement impudent racist and expansionist 
arafat claimed shamirs latest statement and his rejection of a 
plo role in peace talks reflect a crisis in israeli policy toward 
peace efforts in the middle east 
shamir is swimming against the tide of history he doesnt 
understand new developments in the world he cannot go on with 
his occupation of our land arafat said 
he also lashed out at the united states for its support of 
israel and alleged failure to pressure shamir to get involved in a 
peace process in the middle east 
without american support shamir wouldnt have dared to 
make such a statement on the status of the territories arafat 
said 
the us state department said tuesday it had asked israel to 
explain shamirs comment that the occupied territories should be 
used to settle jews from the soviet union 
the meeting between peres and mubarak on jan 24 will be the 
first toplevel encounter between israeli and egyptian officials 
since defense minister yitzhak rabin held talks with mubarak in 
cairo in september 
peres spokesman avi gil said the middle east peace process will 
be at the top of the agenda he refused to elaborate saying only 
when youre in egypt you dont just talk about the pyramids 
us secretary of state james a baker is urging threeway peace 
talks that would include the foreign ministers of egypt the united

president bush is offering sneak previews of 
his maiden state of the union address in speeches and appearances 
around the country that seek to highlight his agenda for a world 
at peace 
bush has been laying down the basic themes that aides say he 
will sound in the annual presidential speech to a joint 
housesenate session on the evening of jan 31 
he highlighted key domestic priorities strengthening the clean 
air act a lower capital gains tax the war on drugs and crime 
education and an overhaul of farm programs in a kickoff speech 
last week to the american farm bureau in orlando fla 
a few days later bushs address to the cincinnati chamber of 
commerce laid down his basic defense position he would not 
naively cut the muscle out of our defense posture despite a 
relaxation of tensions in eastern europe 
bush said congress shouldnt expect a peace dividend as some 
democrats have urged in which military savings can be diverted 
directly into domestic programs 
the president is to further outline his agenda for 1990 in a 
speech on friday to the national association of homebuilders in 
atlanta 
he also has been staging events to bolster selected parts of his 
program for instance tuesdays unannounced visit with housing 
secretary jack kemp to a public housing development to push his war 
on drugs and his proposal to make it easier for public housing 
residents to buy their dwellings 
the president today was spotlighting his anticrime program at a 
luncheon with law enforcement agencies 
and he has clearly set the stage for confrontations with the 
democraticled congress 
although he has vowed to repeat the offer of an extended hand to 
congress made in his inaugural last year th president complained 
in orlando about democratic demagogues who oppose his capital 
gains cut 
and he told the chamber of commerce in cincinnati that many of 
his firstyear programs remain bogged down in the jungles of 
capitol hill 
bush also has saluted developments in eastern europe praised 
us troops who fought in panama talked about the daybreak of a 
new decade and reveled over the opportunity and optimism of a 
world at peace 
bushs speeches leading up to the state of the union address are 
largely focusing on the issues that remain unfinished in some 
cases from last years legislative session said white house 
communications director david demarest but the state of the union 
is likely to be more forwardlooking and expressed in more lofty 
language 
the president wont have to share the billing when he delivers 
that address but that wasnt so on tuesday when he and kemp 
dropped by the public housing development in alexandria 
the president sat mostly impassive as kemp delivered a long and 
impassioned exposition on public housing the drug problem 
community involvement the desirability of home ownership and the 
civil rights movement 
when the housing secretary finally yielded the floor bush 
observed when the berlin wall came down they said i wasnt 
enthusiastic enough 
how do you follow this bush asked pointing at kemp 
a community activist complained of a lack of funds for fighting 
drug pushers kemp reached into his wallet and jokingly held out a 
wad of bills and as he took one question after the other kemp 
kept patting the president seated beside him on the sleeve 
when the former buffalo bills quarterback former house member 
and unsuccessful 1988 republican presidential contender finally got 
around to introducing bush he began ladies and gentlemen the 
next president 
kemp stopped midsentence looked at bush and laughed at his 
mistake then he added quickly i used to be the next 
president one time too

a delegation of coal miners met with the 
finance minister today to discuss the demands of more than 6000 
striking miners the pap news agency said 
workers were striking at the czerwone zaglebie and niwka 
modrzejow mines near the industrial city of katowice 185 miles 
south of warsaw pap reported all 6000 workers stayed off the job 
today at the czerwone zaglebie mine and another 40 continued their 
strike at niwka modrzejow 
but miners at two other locations near walbrzych a city 12 
miles from the border with czechoslovakia suspended their strike 
because of the talks the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza said 
a delegation of workers met with finance minister leszek 
balcerowicz in the morning in warsaw said andrzej moroz a 
spokesman for balcerowicz he said details of the talks were not 
immediately available 
the miners main demand is higher pay and the strike is the 
biggest over wages since radical reforms to introduce a market 
economy took effect in poland on jan 1 
part of the plan calls for a tight wage policy to bring down 
inflation which soared to about 900 percent last year after some 
price controls were lifted in august 
almost all the remaining price controls were lifted jan 1 and 
prices again are racing ahead of wages 
mine strikes late in the summer of 1988 led to widespread labor 
unrest that forced the communist authorities who ruled at the time 
to start talks on political reform 
the talks led to the legalization of solidarity last year and to 
partially free elections in june 
solidaritys sweeping victory in those elections paved the wave 
for the election of solidarity editor tadeusz mazowiecki as the 
first noncommunist head of government in 40 years

afghan rebels today announced a 
formula for a new leadership despite bitter divisions within their 
own ranks 
the announcement coincided with us undersecretary of state 
robert kimmitts threeday visit he is the highestranking state 
department official to visit pakistan since februarys soviet troop 
withdrawal from neighboring afghanistan 
rebel sources said the formula was an offering to kimmitt who 
was reportedly in pakistan to take a new look at the politically 
troubled rebels 
he is expected to meet the guerrilla leadership thursday in 
pakistans rugged frontier city of peshawar 30 miles from the 
afghan border 
abdul rahim a spokesman for a joint rebel news agency said 
kimmitt wanted something to give secretary of state james a baker 
iii to take to next months meeting with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze 
the complicated formula provides for a grand council or 
shura of between 2000 and 3000 people selected from inside 
afghanistan these people will also represent the estimated 5 
million afghans living in squalid refugee camps in pakistan and 
iran 
however it does not allow for participation of afghanistans 
ruling communists something moscow has repeatedly demanded 
the grand council would then choose 200 to 300 people who will 
form a national assembly or parliament 
the assembly according to the formula will select a new 
leadership or give a vote of confidence to the existing selfstyled 
government criticized for its bitter infighting and narrow 
composition 
the renegade among the major rebel groups headquartered in 
pakistan gulbaddin hekmatyars hezbiislami rejected the 
formula demanding elections other smaller groups also have 
denounced it 
nasrullah mansoor who represents a small guerrilla organization 
based in pakistan said his group as well as those headquartered in 
iran want no part of the newly announced formula 
a rebel source who asked not to be identified said the 
iranianbased guerrillas rejected the formula because they had no 
part in its creation 
most war refugees living in iran belong to afghanistans 
minority shiite sect of islam which is practiced by most iranians 
those in pakistan are sunni moslems 
the rebels who have fought for 11 years to topple successive 
communist governments in kabul formed their own government about a 
year ago but it has been wracked by internal feuding unable to 
entice the iranianbased guerrillas or other minority groups to 
join 
afghan sources in pakistan said the united states has come under 
heavy criticism for its support of this rebel government which 
they charge was created by washington and islamabad

a 5yearold boy who was submerged in 
an icy pond for 40 minutes remained unconscious and 
unresponsive in critical condition today and his chances for 
survival were slim doctors said 
his heart and lung functions are improved somewhat but he is 
going through a period of brain swelling now as was expected 
dr craig futterman a pediatric internist at fairfax hospital 
said of george sader he has a 2 to 10 percent chance to survive 
at all and about a 2 percent chance to survive neurologically 
intact 
the boy was playing on an icecovered pond in centreville va 
with two older girls on monday when he fell through a crack into 
six feet of water 
futterman said doctors would perform a cat scan today to 
determine whether the boy suffered brain damage 
there have been about two dozen reported cases of people 
surviving submersion in cold water for long periods some up to an 
hour officials said 
futterman said on nbctvs today program this morning that 
the reason why some people survive and some dont remain unclear 
but he said it is believed that the way people cool down is linked 
to their chances of survival 
if the temperature of their tissues cools down to a very cold 
temperature prior to their heart stopping its felt that thats 
the most physiologic way to preserve those tissues futterman 
said if however the heart stops prior to cooling down then 
their chance of surviving are much lower 
george whose body temperature had dropped to 90 degrees was in 
cardiac arrest when he arrived at the hospital and was hooked up to 
a heartlung machine to warm his blood

a message purported to be from 
colombias drug lords today declared the government the winner in 
the war on drugs and offered to halt illegal activities in exchange 
for an amnesty 
the communique was given to patricia echavarria who was set 
free today after being kidnapped with her daughter dec 16 mrs 
echavarria is the wife of a prominent doctor in the drug capital of 
medellin 
we accept the triumph of the state said the communique from 
the extraditables the armed wing of the nations powerful drug 
lords thus we will lay down our arms and abandon our objectives 
for the benefit of the highest interests of the fatherland 
the communique came in response to a call monday by the catholic 
church and political leaders for drug cartels to release their 
hostages and end drug trafficking 
we submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of 
obtaining from the government and from society respect for our 
rights and our return to our families and communities it said 
we have decided to suspend the shipment of drugs and surrender 
the weapons explosives laboratories hostages the clandestine 
landing strips and other effects related to our activities at such 
a time as we are granted constitutional and legal guarantees the 
communique continued 
their statement appeared to demand an amnesty that would 
guarantee they would not face criminal charges 
the drug barons have previously demanded a full amnesty and an 
end to extraditions of drug suspects to the united states 
while president virgilio barco said tuesday he would not rule 
out talks with drug traffickers interior minister carlos lemos 
simmonds said colombian law does not allow an amnesty for common 
criminals 
barco began his crackdown on the cocaine cartels after the 
assassination in august of a leading presidential candidate as 
part of the crackdown he revived an extradition treaty with the 
united states which drew up a list of the 12 mostwanted drug 
traffickers 
the extraditables take their name from the list 
the communique said mrs echavarria and her daughter dina had 
been freed as proof of the cartels desire to make peace 
the two were released in a neighborhood built by medellin cartel 
leader pablo escobar gaviria for the poor people of medellin 
in the 11point message the extraditables said we undertake 
that there will be no explosive bombings in any part of the 
national territory and have ordered the suspension of all type of 
executions of political figures government and labor officials 
members of the judiciary newsmen policemen and the military 
they also offered to act as mediators in efforts to end 
activities by other groups operating outside the law for the 
sole purpose of ending the violence which harms and shatters our 
colombian fatherland 
so far colombia has sent 11 drug suspects to the united states 
to face charges but none is on the mostwanted list 
in an effort to stop extraditions traffickers responded with a 
campaign of bombings and other violent attacks that killed at least 
209 people 
the government also believes drug traffickers bombed a colombian 
passenger jet that crashed outside bogota in november killing 107 
people 
the traffickers also are believed responsible for many of 85 
kidnappings in colombia in the last 45 days 
for its part the government has seized millions of dollars in 
property and arrested hundreds of people to try to destroy the 
private army of the leader of the medellin cocaine cartel 
it also has killed one of the leaders of the cartel gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha who died in a shootout with police dec 15 on 
colombias north coast 
on tuesday barco for the first time said he would not rule out 
the possibility of negotiating to end the drug war 
at a news conference barco said in answer to a question about 
the possibility of talks we in the government are not 
inflexible 
the communique monday by the church and political leaders stated 
openly what many colombians have been saying privately that the 
nation does not have the resources to fight a long war against the 
billionaire traffickers 
the church and political leaders including two former 
presidents suggested that in return for drug lords halting their 
campaign of terror they might expect less rigorous treatment 
from the government

settled in for another day of scientific experiments on the eighth 
day of the 10day mission

resolidifying a metal in zero gravity and learning how the body 
adapts to weightlessness in preparation for longer space trips 
shortly after 11 am one of two smoke alarms went off in a bay 
where computer equipment is stored but the astronauts found no 
evidence of smoke or damage to the equipment which includes the 
shuttles guidance systems

considered a false alarm mission control commentator jeff carr 
said 
earlier lead flight director al pennington at nasa reported the 
spaceship was operating just beautifully were in good shape 
pilot jim wetherbee and mission specialists bonnie dunbar 
marsha ivins and david low joined brandenstein in working quietly 
with communications between ground and spaceship kept to a minimum 
so they could concentrate on their work 
on thursday the astronauts will start packing up the 
experiments and other equipment for fridays return to earth a 
darkness landing is scheduled at 255 am pst at edwards air force 
base calif 
the national aeronautics and space administration reported that 
some of edwards dry lakebed runways were not useable because of 
recent rains but the concrete strip brandenstein planned to touch

men in bangladesh one of the worlds poorest 
countries have a better chance than men in harlem of living past 
age 40 a study shows 
when adjusted for age the death rate in harlem a poor black 
neighborhood in upper manhattan was the highest in new york and 
more than double that of us whites the researchers found 
the report compiled by drs colin mccord and harold p freeman 
of harlem hospital was published in thursdays new england journal 
of medicine the findings were based on an analysis of new yorks 
central harlem health district where 96 percent of the population 
is black and 41 percent live below the poverty line 
the researchers found that 6415 people died in harlem from 1978 
to 1981 if the death rate in harlem had been the same as for 
whites across the united states 3994 would have died 
eightyseven percent of the 2421 excess deaths were in people 
under age 65 
to dramatize their figures the researchers noted that in 
bangladesh 55 percent of men and 50 percent of women live to age 
65 in harlem 40 percent of men and 65 percent of women live this 
long 
cirrhosis homicide accidents drug dependency and alcohol use 
were considered to be the most important underlying causes of death 
in 35 percent of all those under 65 for harlem residents over age 
75 the death rate was essentially the same as for us whites 
the study also found that the rate of hospital admissions in 
harlem was 26 percent higher than in the rest of the city 
a major political and financial commitment will be needed to 
eradicate the root causes of this high mortality vicious poverty 
and inadequate access to the basic health care that is the right of 
all americans the authors wrote 
in a separate letter to the editor christopher jl murray of 
harvards center for population studies said a world bank study 
also shows that blacks nationwide have a substantially elevated 
risk of dying at an early age 
sixteen percent of american males die between ages 15 and 60 
compared with 30 percent of black men nine percent of white 
females die between those ages compared with 16 percent of black 
women 
he said the high death rate among black men exceeds the rates in 
gambia india and el salvador 
he said a major reason for the excess deaths among american 
black men was injuries most of them homicides however they also 
had a higher risk of dying from some diseases such as cancer and 
heart disease

hanging dead cats from an outdoor christmas 
tree and failing to care for a pet goat landed members of a 
louisiana tech university fraternity in court officials said 
the local animal control official stuart hitt said the two 
dead cats found during a dec 13 investigation apparently were 
killed by cars not by fraternity members 
so a charge of failure to dispose of a carcass was thrown out 
tuesday by municipal judge robert c james 
it was a tasteless pledgeclass prank said matt saurage 
president of the delta kappa epsilon chapter only a couple of 
guys were involved and theyve been reprimanded 
the same december investigation led to an animal cruelty charge 
when it was found that a fraternity mascot a goat called wool e 
goat had heartworms and hadnt received treatment 
james said that case would be suspended without a trial date if 
the chapter paid for the goats care accepted the universitys 
sanctions of probation until midmay and 100 hours of community 
service and allowed no more animals at the house

a quadriplegic who won a court battle 
for the right to turn off the ventilator that keeps him alive is 
leaving the machine running and is looking for a job 
after discussions with staff members at united cerebral palsy of 
greater birmingham and other advocates for the disabled larry 
mcafee has entered an employment program run by ucp for people with 
disabilities 
the amount of time theyre spending with me is impressive 
mcafee said tuesday from his bed at the briarcliff nursing home in 
alabaster outside birmingham their sense of total commitment 
has been stimulating 
mcafee a mechanical engineer and sportsman before a 1985 
motorcycle accident left him paralyzed below the chin called 
jobhunting an avenue i wanted to explore 
he said brenda carson an employment specialist with the 
birmingham cerebral palsy group and her colleagues have not only 
caught my interest but stimulated my desire to give it a real good 
try if it doesnt work out then it doesnt work out 
mcafee 33 came to briarcliff from atlanta in august because of 
its special unit for ventilatordependent patients 
he decided life dependent on a machine was not worth pursuing 
and asked a judge in his home fulton county ga for permission to 
turn off his breathing system judge edward johnson ruled in 
mcafees favor in september and the georgia supreme court upheld 
the decision in november 
by that point however several people in the birmingham area 
who work with the disabled had befriended him and offered him hope 
of something other than life in an institution 
ms carson said mcafees experience which includes designing 
industrial conveyor belt systems and other equipment gives him 
marketable skills 
though he no longer can visit job sites he would be able to do 
computerassisted design she said mcafee said he already has the 
necessary computer equipment and software 
we feel there is a very good prospect of finding an employer 
who can use his talents ms carson said

when it comes to agricultural exports beef 
used to be the puny kid on the block but lately says the 
agriculture department beef has put on some muscle and is still 
growing 
according to the latest usda estimates beef exports jumped 
about 57 percent last year to nearly 107 billion pounds from 680 
million in 1988 an additional increase of at least 12 percent to 
12 billion pounds is expected in 1990 
japan which accounts for about twothirds of all us beef 
exports opened its doors wider last year and has agreed to boost 
the 1990 quota by an additional 60000 metric tons approximately 
1323 million pounds 
the us will have to share this market with the australians 
who are expected to price their beef very competitively said 
steve reed of the departments economic research service 
although australian beef output was down last year because of 
cattle herd rebuilding production is expected to rise in 1990 
and a larger share probably will be earmarked for the japanese 
market 
reed writing in the january issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said japans storage facilities for frozen beef are 
strained because of large inventories a substantial amount of us 
beef is frozen he said and a larger portion of australian beef is 
fresh chilled 
some beef stockpiling in japan likely occurred at the 
beginning of 1989 under the expectation of strong consumer 
demand he said retail beef prices do not yet reflect the 
lower prices for imported beef under the new system 
reed said also there are apparently some problem in developing 
outlets for frozen us beef in japan 
according to a usda supplyanddemand analysis last week 
exports estimated at 12 billion pounds this year will comprise 51 
percent of us beef output projected at 235 billion pounds 
in 1989 the 107 billion pounds exported were equal to about 
46 percent of total us beef production the 680 million pounds 
exported in 1988 was 29 percent 
despite the increase in overseas sales the united states is 
still a net importer of beef this years shipments primarily from 
australia and new zealand but also more than a dozen other 
countries are forecast at 208 billion pounds nearly twice the 
amount of exports

agriculture department scientists are looking 
at some foreign grasses to see if droughtresistant livestock 
pastures can be developed to help us cattle and sheep producers 
a prairie brome grass called matua from new zealand shows 
promise for the eastern united states it was brought to the united 
states in 1986 as a coolseason grass spring and fall for 
grazing or hay 
gerald a jung of the departments agricultural research service 
said matua was slowed down by the 1988 drought in central 
pennsylvania but added that it thrived compared to other 
coolseason grasses 
jung works at the agencys regional pasture research laboratory 
in university park pa his findings were reported here recently by 
the department 
in our tests in pennsylvania last year matua prairie grass 
remained green and growing into december he said thats about 
a month after other coolseason grasses went dormant for the 
winter 
jung said matua is not readily available in the united states 
and that about five more years of tests will be required 
plant explorers also have returned from two expeditions to the 
soviet union with more than 1000 forage and grass seed samples 
the usda agency said the eventual payoff could be new varieties of 
range grasses that come up annually and also extend the grazing 
season in the fall and winter 
kay h asay plant geneticist at the agencys forage and range 
laboratory in logan utah said he and other scientists collected 
the samples over the last two summers many of the collections will 
be grown from seed and evaluated this summer he said

the united states will allow a 14 percent 
increase in the amount of foreign sugar that can be imported by 
us processors from 39 countries 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday the increase 
boosts the sugar import quota to 2584865 metric tons for the 
period jan 1 1989 through sept 30 1990 an increase of 325000 
tons 
this change in the level of the quota is necessary to counter 
the tightness in domestic sugar supplies caused by the unexpectedly 
low production of beet sugar and damage to the florida and texas 
sugar cane crops resulting from the december freeze yeutter said 
quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can 
enter the united states thus protecting domestic producers from 
lowerpriced foreign sugar being dumped on the us market

east german communists said today the 
countrys peaceful revolution has taken a dangerous turn that could 
threaten free elections planned for may 
the warning came in a newspaper editorial that denounced the 
storming on monday of secret police headquarters in east berlin and 
blamed it on the new forum opposition group 
new forum which organized the demonstration that led to the 
rampage denied it was to blame for the violence although the 
flier calling for the protest did call on people to bring stones 
the stones that were to be taken along were meant only to 
symbolically seal up the doors of the building new forum 
spokesman rainer rodenwald said 
the fliers we sent out clearly said no violence the 
spokesman said there is no one from new forum who wanted or 
planned the violence 
late today the christian democratic party threatened to bring 
down communist premier hans modrows coalition government by 
leaving it the christian democrats who control three of the 27 
cabinet seats object to the communists continued grip on power 
before the may 6 elections 
christian democratic spokesman lothar lueck said his partys 
leadership was showing a very strong tendency to leave the 
government west germanys ard television said a decision was 
expected during a party meeting on friday 
the party also threatened to quit the cabinet last week 
the coalition has been running the country since a popular 
uprising ousted the nations hardline communist government and 
the coalition is supposed to step down once it can be replaced by a 
freely elected government 
new forum east germanys largest prodemocracy movement has 
more than 200000 members nationwide the movement has repeated its 
call to avoid violence and has promised to investigate mondays 
incident 
the official communist party daily said today the autumn 
revolution has lost its innocence 
is the revolution eating its own children neues deutschland 
asked in its frontpage editorial recalling the line from 
playwright georg buechners account of the violence of the french 
revolution 
no one should underestimate that question since violence has 
increased and so has fear the newspaper said voting freely on 
may 6 also means voting free of fear free elections are 
scheduled may 6 
the newspaper called for a security partnership linking 
government opposition and law enforcement officials to guarantee 
free elections it said the rampage at the secret police 
headquarters caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage 
since the fall of hardline leader erich honecker on oct 18 
east germanys leaders routinely have called for calm and warned 
that violence could hurt efforts to establish true democracy in the 
country 
nationwide protests have continued by hundreds of thousands of 
people who have demanded that the communists give up their virtual 
control of the government media bureaucracy and economy 
the unrest apparently prompted chancellor helmut kohl of west 
germany to scrap plans for negotiating stronger ties with the 
government kohl said tuesday the talks could wait until after free 
elections 
kohl said the east german situation has become more 
difficult adding that quick and effective measures were 
needed to shore up the economy 
modrows government has called for scrapping centrally planned 
socialism and replacing it with a freemarket system 
it has thus started to abolish state subsidies by raising prices 
for childrens clothes and related articles apartment rents and 
prices of other essentials are also to rise 
the price hikes have sent panic through a population accustomed 
to decades of rockbottom prices for goods services and housing 
modrow visiting west berlin on tuesday blamed the 
prodemocracy opposition for mondays incident 
i hope the storming remains a onetime event and isnt any 
kind of signal modrow said during his visit the first by an 
east german premier to the western sector 
he complained he had been greeted with shouts of red pig 
after he rushed to the storming scene in an attempt to halt the 
rampage 
tens of thousands of people took part in the rampage monday 
night after a demonstration against the dreaded secret police 
force which modrow has promised to have completely dismantled by 
june 30 
many of the demonstrators looted the building carrying away 
clothing bottles of wine and various pieces of equipment

government officials were criticized wednesday for 
using a photo of a wounded chinese student to illustrate a voter 
registration campaign 
the ad published by the scottish office which governs scotland 
showed a student being carried away prostrate on a delivery 
bicycle it was taken after chinese troops crushed prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing on june 34 
the picture appeared in several scottish newspapers in september 
above a caption that said youll only have to give your name and 
address 
the advertising standards authority an independent watchdog 
organization said in its latest report that it received 20 
complaints from people who believed it was in appallingly bad 
taste 
it said the scottish office defended it as being a reminder to 
the public of the importance of the right to vote in a free 
society but it believed the argument did not justify this 
deplorable approach 
the scottish office said we regret that some people found it 
distressing it was never our intention to shock or offend the 
advertisement will not be used again

the newsleader springfield mo on soviet unrest 
mikhail gorbachev has come face to face with the horror of blind 
hatred in two soviet provinces one is christian armenia the 
other is shiite moslem azerbaijan they share one attribute 
hatred for its own sake 
thus what began as a territorial dispute over nagorno karabakh 
an armenian enclave within azerbaijan has become the latest 
threat to mikhail gorbachevs goodwill and perhaps to his future 
the hideous carnage of armenians in a section of baku 
azerbaijan is precisely the kind of religious hatred that has 
destroyed entire cultures earlier in this century armenia was the 
target of one of the most severe acts of genocide in history 
the questions for americans is a simple one where is the 
outcry from americans most especially christians from americans

salvador never before has a military officer ranking as high as 
col guillermo alfredo benavides moreno been accused of a human 
rights crime 
the arrests so far undoubtedly have sent shock waves through the 
militarys ranks this could precipitate a confrontation with the 
civilian government and with cristianis own human rights 
feelings 
the president had to have known the risks he was taking in 
pursuing the case thus far and may have chosen this way to assert 
civilian control over the military 
how the priests murder is resolved will determine whether el 
salvador is a nation of laws and whether its deserving of the free 
worlds continued favor

the albuquerque nm tribune on china 
the peoples daily says china has been restored to complete 
normality sadly whats normal to beijings official press is a 
climate of intense political repression that mocks the recent 
lifting of martial law 
it was disturbing then to find the bush administration 
welcoming the news about martial law as if it were a move of 
substance the president praised the announcement by prime minister 
li peng as a very sound step and very positive without 
noting that chinas rulers have actually tightened their grip on 
society 
for years after richard nixon reopened diplomatic ties to 
beijing back in 1972 americans overlooked human rights abuses in 
china only last summers images of tanks crushing the bodies of 
peaceful protesters cured the american public of its romance with 
this totalitarian regime 
curiously george bush alone remains all discretion too polite 
to publicly criticize the country where he served as president 
gerald fords ambassador 
bush is right to keep an eye on longterm relations with china 
that legitimate purpose doesnt mean he should laud a cosmetic move 
as if it were a win for liberty

the west central tribune willmar minn on noriega 
anybody who thinks general manuel noriega walked out of panama 
to spend the rest of his life in a us jail cell is either very 
naive or does not understand politics 
the general obviously a multimillionaire maybe a billionaire 
is accustomed to the best in life and theres no question he 
either has arranged or fully intends to ultimately return to that 
lifestyle had he thought otherwise he undoubtedly would have 
flown the coop as have other dictators and taken up residency in 
a country of one of his buddies 
the money he stashed away is probably still hidden it is either 
under secret bank codes or entrusted to former aides his hierarchy 
also is not only still in panama but probably remains in positions 
of authority 
the former general is unquestionably a guy who raped his 
country but dumb he aint and in politics as we all know there 
are deals and counterdeals many of which are secret some 
ultimately surface but many never do 
as the saying goes if we were betting people wed hock the 
farm that before many years pass the general will undoubtedly 
be out and about

mail tribune medford ore on defense spending 
despite changes worldwide that signal a thaw in the cold war 
president bush doesnt appear ready yet to cut into the fat of the 
pentagons budget congress may have to play the role of butcher to 
ensure that the bloated defense establishment created in the 1980s 
doesnt continue to gorge itself in the 1990s 
bush and secretary of defense dick cheney reportedly favor a 
fiveyear defense plan to increase spending from the 293 billion 
level in the 1990 budget to 312 billion by 1995 the argument used 
to support this approach is that the amounts actually represent a 2 
percent annual reduction after inflation 
in washington this is known as cutting a budget 
this costly war machine is a legacy of former president ronald 
reagan in 1981 he began an eightyear defense spending spree that 
was unparalleled in us history he said the buildup was necessary 
to stay ahead of the soviet union and to protect us interests 
around the globe 
today the soviet union is in a state of economic collapse its 
fighting force the armies of the warsaw pact nations has 
disintegrated in the face of the prodemocracy movement sweeping 
eastern europe 
based on recent events defense spending in the 200 billion 
range for the 90s should be adequate

idahonian moscow idaho on airline threats 
it is as refreshing as it is rare to see candor from an airline 
especially when such openness affects revenue one sterling example 
is the manner in which northwest airlines handled a bomb threat to 
an international flight over the new years weekend the action 
stands in stark contrast to pan americans fatal silence a year 
earlier 
when northwest was threatened with sabotage to its 
paristodetroit dc10 flight it promptly informed potential 
passengers of the danger steppedup security precautions 
notwithstanding it allowed ticketed passengers to postpone their 
flights or book passage on a competing airline 
about three dozen people did so the flight made it safely to 
its us destination a week later a belfast teenager was 
arrested on a charge of making the threat 
a year ago christmas pan am flight 103 from frankfurt to new 
york also was under a bomb threat information known only to pan am 
and the us state department fearing loss of business if the 
flying public knew of the threat the information deliberately was 
kept confidential 
we all know of course what happened over lockerbie scotland 
on dec 21 1988 
northwest took the responsible route even when it most 
certainly would mean a loss of fares travelers nearly always have 
a choice of air carriers they might consider rewarding northwest 
for its special concern for our safety the next time they fly to a 
destination served by that airline

the registerherald beckley wva on disposable diapers 
vermont gov madeleine kunin has stirred considerable 
controversy with her proposal to ban all disposable diapers the 
move may be a signal of what is to come nationwide 
last year kunin was successful in making vermont the first state 
to ban the sale of vehicles which use ozonedepleting chemicals in 
air conditioning if the diaper ban becomes law vermont will be 
the first state to prohibit all disposable diapers nebraska has a 
similar ban although it permits sale of biodegradable diapers 
kunin argues that while disposables have a usable life of a 
few hours their decomposition takes hundreds of years in dumps 
according to estimates about 85 percent of all parents use 
disposable diapers exclusively and the disposables account for 
about two percent of the nations waste vermont officials estimate 
that in their state alone some 43 million diapers go to the dump 
annually 
america is largely a throw away society convenience has 
supplanted prudence and many reusable resources are discarded 
rather than reemployed in the manufacturing process while todays 
society may find that affordable future generations may find it 
regrettable 
the bush administration has backed off from a proposal to tax 
paper glass plastic and metals that arent recycled that was 
done to make sure the president lived up to his no new taxes 
pledge but bush also promised to gear the nation into a mindset of 
recycling and conserving he needs to act on that immediately 
gov kunin may be paving the way for him

the americans for democratic action long 
considered the nations leading liberal group said wednesday the 
bush administration failed in its first year to be kinder and 
gentler to the poor and threatened the constitution with its 
invasion of panama 
americans should be prepared to fight and die for what is 
right rep charles rangel dny told a news conference the 
question i ask is whether it was morally and constitutionally 
right 
rangel president of the 47yearold liberal group said that 
the democratic leadership of the house as well as the news media 
have failed to be critical enough of president bushs record the 
comments came as part of what ada billed as a report card on the 
first year of the administration 
the harlem congressman acknowledged bush scores high in 
nationwide polls but faulted the president on education minority 
rights the environment homelessness drug addiction and abortion 
he said poverty is worsening 
rangel said that as a former congressman bush is often treated 
as a friend by house leaders and thus his policies do not come in 
for sufficient criticism he said the news media liked the panama 
invasion and as a result the press hysterically supports the 
tattering of the constitution of the united states 
he said national drug policy director william bennett has been 
a real disappointment and was skeptical about the 
administrations war against drugs i dont see anything to 
knock i dont see anything to support i dont know where bill 
bennett is 
obviously the president has done a lot of things right if you 
are middle class and white and really involved in military 
maneuvers rangel said i give the president an a for military 
preparedness holding down the minimum wage and staying out of 
getting involved with the homeless 
rep don edwards dcalif a former ada president told the 
news conference that in civil rights mr bush has not been 
kinder and gentler 
he said the civil rights division of the justice department has 
a vacancy in its top position and as a result people who have 
been discriminated against whose civil rights have been violated 
have no champion 
the democraticcontrolled senate judiciary committee killed the 
administrations nomination of former wayne county mich sheriff 
william lucas for that position calling the

snakes are popular here or at least 
the boa constrictor is that slithered its way into a secondfloor 
apartment and was found wrapped around a toilet 
i had no idea so many people were all that attached to 
snakes said police spokesman jerry fisher after the department 
in this houston suburb took more than 100 calls from people wanting 
the snake the phone has not stopped ringing for five seconds 
around here 
the snake was first spotted by a stunned chris atkinson when he 
got out of bed to use the bathroom at 4 am monday the boa was 
coiled in and around his commode 
one of those wanting to adopt the 6footlong snake was bob 
miller director of the living materials center at la porte high 
school located in another houston suburb 
miller said he would like the snake for a breeding program 
fisher said the police department will wait a couple of days to 
see if the snakes owner surfaces 
atkinson has said he has no plans to keep the snake joking that 
he probably could only use it as a new pair of boots maybe 
if the snake is adopted fisher said he may hold a drawing for 
all those who want it and give it to the winner 
but they wont be able to keep it in league city owning a wild 
or exotic pet is illegal and punishable by fines of up to 200

the seattle times on the exclusionary rule 
as eastern europe struggles with the concept of individual 
rights the us supreme court continues to make the gritty 
decisions that convert ideas into a way of life 
last week the court affirmed a principle known as the 
exclusionary rule which requires that illegally obtained evidence 
be excluded from criminal trials 
for 75 years the court has said society has more to fear from 
police misconduct than the consequences of letting a guilty person 
go free 
very narrow exceptions have been allowed over the years most 
recently in 1984 the latest challege involved an illinois murder 
case and the use of illegal evidence to impeach the credibility of 
a defense witness 
a majority of the court including a justice who had written an 
earlier narrowing of the exclusionary rule said the conviction 
must be overturned 
justice william brennan said that while arriving at the truth is 
important the suppression of valid but illegal evidence is 
necessary to protect constitutional rights 
so long as we are committed to protecting people from the 
disregard of their constitutional rights inadmissibility of 
illegally obtained evidence must remain the rule not the 
exception brennan wrote for the 54 majority 
living up to tough rules is the test of a true democracy

the milwaukee journal on the ncaa convention 
the national collegiate athletic association recently held what 
its executive director aptly called a convention of the 
studentathlete the meeting was dominated not so much by debate 
over the rules of sport as by concern over the intense and often 
competing social pressures that are put upon studentathletes and 
the schools they attend 
with one important exception the convention delegates 
confronted these issues in a way that will ease such stresses 
that single exception was the ncaas adoption of proposition 26 
which significantly undercut a controversial measure the ncaa 
enacted last year in an effort to encourage scholastic achievement 
that measure called proposition 42 denied athletic scholarships 
to incoming freshmen who failed to meet basic academic requirements 
while in high school prop 42 had sent a muchneeded message to 
these young people if you want an athletic scholarship to college 
better start hitting the books now 
proposition 26 does not repeal prop 42s restriction on athletic 
scholarships but does allow universities to grant aid based on 
financial need to freshmen athletes who fail to cut the mustard in 
their high school classrooms in short the ncaa created a giant 
loophole in prop 42 at some schools the new measure might also 
mean less scholarship money for poor but academically motivated 
students who happen not to be athletes 
but at its meeting the ncaa did reduce the length of the 
basketball season and spring football practice that will make it 
possible for students to give more attention to their most 
important responsibility intellectual development 
the ncaa also approved a plan to conduct random yearround drug 
testing of players in major football programs the link between 
bigtime sports and bigtime money has become so intimate and 
competition has become so ferocious that many athletes have 
resorted to drugs that they think will let them run a little 
faster grow a little stronger hit a little harder but these 
performanceenhancing drugs have dangerous sideeffects they 
belong in doctors offices not in athletes lockers and testing 
is one of the few ways to help make sure of that 
the mere fact that academics drugs and other social issues 
dominated the ncaa agenda shows that the major universities are 
aware of the problems they face however imperfectly the ncaa has 
begun to confront that new challenge and opportunity

the westerly ri sun on the americas cup 
the americas cup is again generating news not a result of 
tautlyset windfilled sails driving sleek hulls through 
whitecapped waves but because of litigation in the new york state 
court of appeals 
at issue is the san diego yacht clubs use of a 6000pound 
catamaran manned by a crew of five and powered by a high technology 
airfoil and rigid sail in a successful 1988 american defense of 
the cup 
a group of former americas cup compeition skippers contend 
this premier sailing competition will become purely an exhibition 
unless the new york court voids the stars and stripes victory 
 
they are right the spirit of the americas cup is one of honest 
competition involving men and boats seamanship and design skilled 
crews and the vagaries of the wind and sea 
a catamaran sailing against a sloop is akin to a 12meter yacht 
sailing against a barge unfurling a bedsheet no contest 
may the 12meter yachts that have been entered in fair and 
honest competitions since their development in the years shortly 
before and after world war ii return to the sea in glorious pursuit 
of the americas cup and what it was meant to stand for

are very many i think their elder generation is to blame for 
that 
anne 39 who separated from her husband capt mark phillips 
in august said she is not very strict with her 12yearold son and 
8yearold daughter 
i dont go along with the seen and not heard it would be 
very nice but i think its rather an impractical suggestion 
really said the princess 
she said her travels on behalf of the save the childrens fund 
of which she is president have made her more concerned about what 
she sees at home 
you find if you go to any number of countries where the small 
rural communities have very strict codes of behavior you dont find 
much thieving and pilfering and murder is almost unheard of the

a year after a bloody massacre at a california 
elementary school a teacher wounded in that attack called today 
for a ban on all assaultstyle weapons domestic and foreign 
how many more people how many more children must face the 
power of a bullet before something is done asked teacher janet 
geng who was wounded in the jan 17 1989 attack by a man 
wielding an ak47 assaultstyle rifle in stockton 
how many more must die how many more must be disabled before 
congress will act mrs geng asked at a capitol hill news 
conference called by the coalition to stop gun violence the gun 
violence must stop now 
mrs geng still limping from the wound in her leg said she 
would lobby congress for bills outlawing some domestically produced 
assaultstyle weapons her bid to meet with president bush was 
unsuccessful said coalition executive director michael k beard 
the bush administration responded to the public outcry following 
the jan 17 1989 shootings in stockton by banning imports of 43 
types of semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles including the ak47 
in the incident drifter patrick purdy opened fire at the school 
playground killing five children and wounding 29 others and mrs 
geng 
the coalition to stop gun violence says the government must go 
further and ban the manufacture and sale of all assaultstyle 
rifles including domestically produced models unaffected by the 
import ban 
beard said the coalition also supports a ban on imports of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle pistols as advocated by handgun 
control inc in a petition today to the treasury departments 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the importation of significant numbers of semiautomatic 
assault pistols and their increasing use by drug traffickers and 
other hardcore criminals is a relatively new phenomenon says the 
petition prepared by handgun control incs legislative counsel 
david g mengebier 
all of the factors which atf considered persuasive in banning 
the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles are present and 
applicable to semiautomatic assault pistols the petition says 
handgun control is concerned about the israeli military 
industries uzi pistol the heckler and koch hk94 pistol smaller 
versions of the uzi carbine and hk rifle that were banned last july 
and the australian automatic arms sap pistol the fie spectre 
p pistol and the sterling mark 7 pistol 
semiautomatic assault pistols are virtually identical to 
semiautomatic assault rifles in terms of development design and 
intended use the petition said in fact because semiautomatic 
assault pistols have similar firepower but are more concealable 
than their assault rifle counterparts they present an even greater 
danger to public safety 
the atf and the national rifle association said it would be 
extremely difficult to ban the handguns because rules enacted under 
the gun control act of 1968 were designed to rule out cheap 
saturday night specials not wellmade sophisticated semiautomatic 
pistols 
i dont know how one would design criteria that would exclude 
the firearms theyre talking about and not exclude all the other 
firearms said jim baker the nras director of governmental 
affairs 
i think that handgun control would like to ban anything that 
theres a political or emotional opportunity to ban and this is 
consistent with that policy baker said 
atf spokesman jack killorin said he could not comment on the 
handgun control petition since he had not seen it 
all imported weapons must be considered suitable for sporting 
purposes killorin said that because of the extensive legislative 
history and longstanding regulations for handgun imports it would 
be more difficult to ban styles of handguns than to ban the 
assaultstyle rifles for which there was virtually no legislative 
history 
one of the things that drove the issue of the semiautomatic 
assault rifles were the astonishing numbers that were beginning 
to appear for importation he said we may take a look at how 
many of these are coming in these may not be a significant import 
item 
mengebier said his organization did not have access to import 
figures for 1989 because they are considered proprietary 
information but he said its safe to say that thousands have 
been authorized for importation or are being imported 
added susan whitmore of handgun control even one is too many 
these are killing machines 
mengebier said the semiautomatic assaultstyle pistols represent 
a new phenomenon and that regulations should be changed to 
satisfy the statutory requirement that firearms have a sporting 
purpose 
a study by cox newspapers last year of almost 43000 gun trace 
requests submitted to the atf from police departments nationwide 
found that the top five guns used by criminals were all handguns 
produced in the united states including the tec9 assaultstyle 
weapon three handguns made the list of the top 10 assaultstyle 
weapons found in crimes but all were manufactured domestically 
the miamiproduced tec9 and the atlantamade mac11 and mac10 
according to the cox study

police in the nations capital said today they 
have no idea what has caused a surge in homicides that has left 17 
people dead since last friday 
the latest victims include a high school athlete three 
teenagers and an automobile dealer 
of the 28 homicides this year police said arrests have been 
made in five cases 
the district of columbias homicide toll stood at 18 at this 
time a year ago and totaled a record 438 for all of 1989 
we keep searching for the answer said lt reginald smith a 
police spokesman if we had all the answers we could certainly 
bring this under control a lot sooner 
at a news conference mayor marion barry said he planned to meet 
with police chief isaac fulwood to plan new strategies barry noted 
that the homicide rate last january was the worst month in the 
citys history 
of the latest surge four deaths were on friday and saturday 
two on sunday and four on monday two on tuesday and one early 
today 
homicide detectives have complained about their heavy workload 
we might as well surrender one unidentified detective told 
the washington post at least that would be taking action 
smith said community involvement is a key element of the police 
departments plan to battle the increase in homicides of which 60 
percent are drugrelated 
they community members have to be a part of our eyes and 
ears he said

the jerry lewis labor day telethon an 
entertainment fixture here for 17 years will move to los angeles 
this year officials of the muscular dystrophy association said 
wednesday 
its really a matter of economics jerry weinberg director 
of field organization for the mda said in a telephone interview 
from the associations new york city headquarters weve always 
brought most of the talent in from los angeles and there was a cost 
involved it was much more costeffective to move to los angeles 
in recent years there had been less and less talent in las 
vegas that we could tap into weinberg said 
the telethon has raised more than a halfbillion dollars during 
its las vegas run including a record 42209727 in september 
we really feel sort of sad to be leaving las vegas said bob 
ross mda executive director and vice president he said the city 
that helped make the telethon a labor day entertainment event will 
continue to play a very important part in the show with some 
remote broadcasts planned from las vegas 
ross said mda officials met several weeks ago with lewis a 
longtime las vegas resident and he understood the rationale 
lewis 63 did not immediately return calls made to both his 
home and office for comment on the move 
mayor ron lurie and other city officials were at a city council 
meeting and not immediately available for comment the mayors 
secretary said 
frank sain executive director of the las vegas convention and 
visitors authority said the move came as a surprise but he didnt 
think it would hurt the city it gave us the dateline but it 
didnt pull any people into las vegas he said 
the lewis telethon began in new york city in 1966 emanating 
from a single tv station and raising 1 million it moved to las 
vegas in 1973 and raised 135 million that year 
the telethon is now carried by 200 stations and is viewed 
annually by an estimated 100 million people the mda fights 40 
neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple thousands of people

a federal judge wednesday ruled that police 
officers may not make drug arrests and search for narcotics by 
climbing aboard buses and randomly questioning passengers 
us district court judge stanley sporkin declared that the 
indiscriminate stopping and questioning of people on interstate 
buses as part of the nations war on drugs seems to have gone too 
far 
sporkins opinion came in the case of dennis s lewis a bus 
rider arrested in washington dc and accused of carrying drugs 
from new york the judge said police made an illegal seizure in 
their questioning of lewis and granted the defendants motion to 
suppress as evidence drugs taken in the arrest 
on oct 19 in the bus terminal at union station lewis denied 
carrying narcotics or weapons when he was approached by an officer 
of the metropolitan police narcotic interdiction unit 
lewis consented to a patdown search by the plainclothes 
detective who found a packet of cocaine stuffed in one of lewis 
socks subsequently marijuana was found in lewis jacket pocket 
and heroin was found in a bag on the floor at lewis seat on the 
bus 
the detective testified at a dec 14 hearing that he had no 
particular reason for questioning lewis and that sometimes ill 
just walk up to anyone who may be on the bus and ask to talk to 
them 
the specter of passengers riding on a public vehicle of mass 
transportation being approached by police officers and searched on 
a strictly random and indiscriminate basis really does not square 
with the rights protected under the constitution said the judge 
sporkin said a passenger would not feel free to walk away when 
approached by police officers in the cramped interior of a bus a 
federal appeals court has upheld searches of baggage that occurred 
in the concourse of union station where a citizen confronted by 
police would not feel constrained from walking away 
to walk away from this encounter lewis who was waiting for the 
bus to continue to richmond va would have had to stand up from 
his seat work his way out of the narrow row in which he was 
situated and negotiate his way past the plainclothes 
detective sporkin said 
even in our druginfested society it is clear that our legal 
system demands the existence of some cause before a police officer 
will approach a citizen to determine whether that individual may be 
engaged in some illicit activity said the judge

african national congress leader walter 
sisulu on wednesday urged intensifying the political and military 
fight against apartheid even though racial tensions are easing in 
south africa 
sisulu told about 1000 exiled anc members that they should work 
toward negotiations with the south african government but pursue 
their armed struggle to maintain pressure for rapid change of 
racial laws and societal structures 
he called on the ancs political and military wings and the 
international community to intensify the struggle against 
apartheid even though there may be an easing of tensions at home 
the political struggle and the armed struggle go side by 
side sisulu said 
later wednesday sisulu spoke at the us information center at 
a ceremony marking the birthday of the rev martin luther king jr 
us ambassador jeffrey davidow spoke about kings commitment to 
nonviolence he understood that violence in the pusuit of 
justice provides the proponents of injustice the rational to 
continue oppression davidow said 
the us government supports the ancs aim of a nonracial 
democracy in south africa but opposes its use of bombs sabotage 
and military attacks on police and civilians 
in martin luther king we saw a prophet for african 
liberation sisulu said martin luther king provided us with a 
glorious vision a sense of selfconfidence the assurance of the 
certainty of victory 
sisulu and seven anc colleagues all of whom served lengthy 
prison terms in south africa are on a weeklong visit to lusaka 
the guerrilla movements exile headquarters they came to help 
coordinate anc strategy in the face of a fastchanging political 
climate in south africa 
the 60 and 70yearold men received a rousing welcome from the 
anc members who chanted sang freedom songs and gave clenched fist 
salutes the hall was draped in the green black and gold banners 
of the anc and many members wore anc scarves around their suit 
collars 
since south african president fw de klerk assumed power in 
august he has allowed opposition groups to protest openly and has 
urged negotiations on a new constitution that would include a 
political voice for the black majority 
but de klerk says the anc the main group fighting to undermine 
the white government must commit itself to peaceful solutions and 
end its military campaign before participating in negotiations 
the anc says the government must lift the state of emergency 
legalize the anc and end trials and hangings of guerrillas before 
talks begin 
sisulu and his colleagues campaign openly for their organization 
in south africa but the anc remains outlawed 
sisulu praised the anc and its ally the south african communist 
party for taking the initiative and setting down conditions 
for talks 
the anc has an estimated 15000 members many of whom are at 
guerrilla camps in tanzania and uganda the organization has no 
offices or military bases in countries bordering south africa but 
it has millions of supporters inside the country 
the anc meetings occur amid widespraed speculation that the 
groups bestknown figure nelson mandela will be freed within 
weeks after more than 27 years behind bars mandela and the 
recently released anc leaders no longer hold formal titles in the 
organization and leadership is a major issue facing the 
organization 
the current president oliver tambo 71 is in a swedish clinic 
recovering from a stroke sisulu said he intends to visit him 
before returning home the anc in tanzania said the leaders were 
expected there on jan 23

while in prison police said 
keith eugene goodman 30 was arrested with two companions 
sunday while visiting another of goodmans pen pals peter g 
jones a carnegiemellon university professor on sabbatical in 
laguna beach police chief albert c ehlow said tuesday

police chief said 
jones was among an estimated 20 to 25 pen pals goodman had while 
serving time in an indiana prison for burglary and sexual assault 
on an 80yearold woman authorities said 
its very frightening jones said in an interview i see 
myself as very lucky because the police told me i was the next 
victim 
the new york victim and one mississippi victim were pen pals 
ehlow said 
its a cons con game ehlow said they write to people to 
tell them how bad off they are asking for money to help them 
through get a better defense lawyer that sort of thing and 
people send them money and befriend them 
authorities say goodman and mead left for new york on dec 16 to 
meet harold d williams of windsor ny one of goodmans pen 
pals williams 60 was found shot to death dec 21 in an upstairs

changes in south africas whitedominated 
society have been largely cosmetic and the united states should 
prepare to impose tougher sanctions three members of congress said 
wednesday 
pronouncing themselves disappointed after a sixday trip to 
south africa that included a meeting with president fwde klerk 
the lawmakers said all the significant components of the apartheid 
system of racial inequality remained in place 
the government seems to be clinging to the fantasy that 
somehow conflict in south africa can be reduced and the pressures 
from without will be eased while the white minority continues to 
hold to power and privilege said rep howard wolpe dmich 
chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa 
unless farreaching reforms are made soon there will be a 
growing movement in the congress and internationally to intensify 
sanctions said rep alan wheat dmo 
the africa subcommittee will begin hearings next month on 
proposals to further restrict ussouth african economic ties 
wolpe said congress in 1986 barred the importation of south 
african coal steel and agricultural products imposed banking 
restrictions and cut direct air links between the two countries 
rep ronald dellums dcalif has introduced a bill that would 
prohibitvirtually any commercial links with south africa a version 
of the bill cleared the house in 1988 but died in the senate 
lacking the support of republicans who had backed the 1986 
sanctions 
another house bill would impose credit restrictions 
the bush administration has spoken against tightening sanctions 
as long as de klerk who assumed power in august appears to be 
moving toward reform but wolpe said he was encouraged by the 
attitude of administration officials who had agreed to discuss the 
matter 
weve been speaking much more with one voice than during the 
reagan administration which had an ideological aversion to 
sanctions wolpe said 
there have been improvements since de klerk assumed power in 
august said wolpe wheat and rep constance morella rmd who 
were in south africa jan 49 some political prisoners have been 
freed and the government is allowing opposition rallies they said 
in a joint statement 
but hundreds of political prisoners remain in jail some under 
death sentences and politically motivated trials continue they 
said likewise purported relaxation of speech restrictions have 
been offset by harassment of opposition voices in the media they 
said 
for that reason even the expected release of jailed african 
national congress leader nelson mandela would be little more than a 
public relations gimmick without genuine reforms wheat said 
there is an enormous gap between some of the highly publicized 
initiatives taken and the much broader reality that is still in 
place wolpe said 
he said discussions with leaders of a crosssection of south 
african society including government and opposition figures led 
the americans to believe forms of persecution were getting worse 
there have been recent reports of political assassinations by 
death squads that appear to be operating under the direction and 
sanction of police and government authorities wolpe said 
de klerk has said he wants to negotiate a new constitution that 
would bring blacks into the national government within five years 
however he opposes black majority rule and envisions a mechanism 
that would give whites veto power on major policy decisions

the 12 nations in the european 
community must greatly boost financial and economic aid to the 
newly emerging democracies in eastern europe the president of the 
ec commission said wednesday 
in a proposal one official termed very ambitious commission 
president jacques delors suggested the trading bloc provide an 
extra 228 billion annually for five to 10 years to east european 
countries 
that is what the community pays annually to improve conditions 
in its own poorest regions he said 
by comparison the ec has so far given less than 36 billion to 
hungary and poland with some of these funds to be spread across 
three years 
addressing the european parliament delors said he will make 
firm aid proposals for eastern europe later this year and the 
figures he mentioned here were widely seen as indicating the scope 
of those proposals 
delors said the ec states must renegotiate the communitys 
funding rules they did this in february 1988 when ec spending on 
regional development was raised and spending on runaway farm 
subsidies was curtailed another february 1988 equally 
significant equally historic is needed to demonstrate our 
solidarity with eastern europe delors said 
the ecs 1990 budget totals 56 billion up 47 percent from 
1989 
under current spending rules the ec budget has 48 billion in 
uncommitted funds which could be used for aid to eastern europe 
delors plea that the ec nations make available almost 23 
billion a year for hungary poland east germany bulgaria 
czechoslovakia and romania was received with disbelief by some 
officials 
it is very ambitious said a british source who asked not to 
be named he asks for a lot probably hoping he will end up with 
half of that 
a dutch source called the proposal a trial balloon 
the trade and economic cooperation accords that have recently 
been signed with the six eastern european nations or are now being 
negotiated are unlikely to meet our requirements and their 
individual needs delors said 
also he said more money must be forthcoming over a five to 
10year period if the ec aid is to be effective given the backward 
nature of the east european economies 
delors in a speech outlining the work program of the ec 
executive commission also said the ec nations must forge ahead 
with plans for political and monetary union for the sake of 
stability across europe 
the community can only meet its destiny if the structures the 
decisionmaking methods and the democratic control of european 
unity are thought about at the highest levels of political debate 
before the end of this year 
delors said the community had helped to inspire the millions in 
central and eastern europe who had revolted against their communist 
regimes in recent months 
let us not forget that it was our prosperity our freedom our 
community governed by the rule of law that served as a pole of 
attraction 
delors said the community must reach its goal of economic and 
monetary union by the end of 1992 before accepting new members he 
made an exception for east germany 
i must repeat clearly today he said that east germany 
has its place in the community if it asks for it 
he said east germany could join if the decision to do so was 
taken through free selfdetermination peacefully and 
democratically respecting the principles of the helsinki final 
act in the context of an eastwest dialogue and in the perspective 
of european integration

east germanys former communist party chief 
egon krenz said wednesday he misjudged dissidents in the past but 
he denied being responsible for the brutal suppression of fall 
prodemocracy protests 
krenz appeared before an investigating commission of the east 
berlin city government that is looking into police brutality during 
oct 78 street protests 
the protests coinciding with the visit of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev provided a turning point in the prodemocracy 
movement that led to the ouster of hardline leader erich honecker 
10 days later 
krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudging 
dissident citizens and dissident groups for years 
from todays viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was 
no general politburo discussion about the negative developments 
then taking place in society said krenz an influential 
politburo member even before honeckers fall krenz succeeded 
honecker and himself was ousted six weeks later 
krenz added that he and other politburo members at the time 
failed to realize that the roman catholic and lutheran churches 
were not working against but rather for the german democratic 
republic 
krenz who was in charge of many police functions at the time of 
the october protests criticized the attacks by clubswinging 
officers 
the excessive action of law enforcement authorities was 
neither politically nor morally justifiable he told the panel 
but he said he was not personally responsible for orders to attack 
protesters 
another ousted politburo member told the commission honecker 
himself ordered the attacks 
honecker took things into his own hands guenter schabowski 
said like krenz schabowski denied personal responsibility for the 
orders to attack the demonstrators most of them young people 
the panel members are investigating the possibility of filing 
criminal charges against the ousted leaders 
communist premier hans modrow is struggling to hold together the 
coalition government formed to govern the nation until elections 
may 6 
the christian democrats one of the noncommunist parties in the 
coalition threatened wednesday to pull out to protest the 
communists continued tight grip on power 
party spokesman lothar lueck said the party leadership was 
showing a very strong tendency to leave the government the 
party holds three of the 27 cabinet seats 
leaders of the same party threatened to pull out of the 
coalition last week over modrows plans to create a new internal 
security agency modrow dropped plans for the security agency in 
the face of widespread opposition 
a protest outside the east berlin headquarters of the 
honeckerera security agency which is being dismantled turned 
into a rampage monday night 
the communist party daily neues deutschland on wednesday blamed 
the opposition group new forum for the rampage and said the popular 
revolution had taken a dangerous turn 
new forum denied responsibility for the rampage although it 
said the fliers it distributed in advance of the demonstration 
called on people to bring stones 
the stones that were to be taken along were meant only to 
symbolically seal up the doors of the building said new forum 
spokesman rainer rodenwald 
the fliers we sent out clearly said no violence he said 
there is no one from new forum who wanted or planned the 
violence

while a house panel investigates in private 
rep barney frank has been working to show his public career can 
survive the scandal surrounding his relationship with a male 
prostitute 
the fiveterm massachusetts democrat has regained visibility as 
one of the houses betterknown liberals and with no wellknown 
challengers set to run against him frank supporters have been 
raising funds at a healthy clip for his campaign and legal defense 
barney frank has weathered the storm said larry rasky a 
democratic consultant in boston the whole incident has almost 
become a nonissue 
but the private work of the house ethics committee into his case 
continues with no indication yet what the panels next move might 
be 
and massachusetts republican executive secretary alexander 
tennant said franks credibility has been irreparably damaged 
though tennant concedes the gop has had a hard time coming up with 
a strong opponent for frank if he decides to run for reelection 
in washington legal activist john f banzhaf iii with the 
financial backing of the conservative caucus filed a lawsuit 
tuesday seeking to force frank into court for allegedly tolerating 
a prostitution operation that stephen gobie contends he ran out of 
franks capitol hill apartment 
late tuesday dc superior court judge harold l cushenberry 
dismissed the request for an injunction 
frank admits he paid gobie 80 in 1985 for sexual relations and 
later hired gobie with personal funds as a housekeeper and driver 
but he says he dismissed gobie in august 1987 when he learned gobie 
was using his apartment for prostitution 
gobie told his story to the ethics committee for more than four 
hours behind closed doors on dec 5 borrowing a line from 
shakespeares julius caesar he told reporters afterward i 
came to praise congressman frank today not to bury him 
frank hinted strongly in a recent interview that he has 
testified before the ethics committee 
meanwhile frank is leading a democratic move to cut defense 
spending and shift the funds into deficit reduction and domestic 
programs even president bush singled frank out at a recent 
billsigning ceremony for his work on housing legislation 
if youre being complimented by the president you must be 
doing something right said rep joseph moakley dmass 
with few exceptions frank has not commented at length on gobie 
since the scandal broke last summer 
i wont discuss it he said recently when asked about the 
case im not going to contribute to a nonstory 
penthouse magazine is to publish next month an interview with 
gobie purchased by the magazine for a reported 50000 
theres some sense that theres going to be another wave that 
will coincide with the penthouse publication and the results of the 
ethics hearing said rasky the bay state political consultant 
but at this point unless theres something startlingly new 
revealed and i dont see any reason to expect that there will 
its just going to be treated more as the final act of last 
seasons play

north korea on wednesday demanded the 
united states and south korea call off their annual joint military 
exercises saying the war games pose a nuclear threat to the 
divided peninsula 
during a meeting of the military armistice commission in this 
truce village chief north korean delegate choe ui ung also urged 
south korea to remove an alleged concrete border wall to ensure 
free travel between the nations 
us rear adm larry g vogt refused to discuss the demand for 
an end to the annual team spirit exercises saying the matter 
was outside the purview of the commission he told north korea 
to take the issue up directly with seoul 
as in the past vogt invited choe to visit south korea and 
observe the defensive nature of the exercises set for march 
he also asked north korea to reciprocate by inviting us and south 
korean officials to its exercises 
choe did not respond pyongyang has rejected all such 
invitations in the past and last year it protested the military 
exercises by suspending talks between lawmakers from both nations 
that were aimed at improving relations 
north korea traditionally has opposed the exercises as a sign 
that south korea and the united states are preparing to attack 
this year however it said it was concerned about a nuclear threat 
the 43000 us troops based in south korea under a mutual 
defense treaty are believed to have nuclear forces but washington 
has refused to confirm or deny this 
north korean president kim il sung first raised the issue of a 
concrete border wall in his new years speech and called for talks 
with south korean political leaders on demolishing it 
kim claimed his nation had not built such barriers on its side 
of the demilitarized zone and was ready to remove barbed wires 
which mark a boundary 
vogt speaking for the un command based in seoul denied the 
existence of a concrete wall on the southern side of the 
demilitarized zone and urged choe to go with him to the site to 
verify this 
under the armistice that ended the 195053 korean war the 
demilitarized zone is not supposed to be fortified by either 
nation and only a limited number of lightly armed troops are 
authorized to police it 
outside the 2mile zone however the border area on both sides 
is sealed and heavily fortified by fences concrete bunkers mine 
fields and hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops 
vogt displayed pictures that he said showed north korean 
bunkers barbed wire fences and other barriers in the demilitarized 
zone on the northern side 
he proposed joint investigations but choe again did not respond 
south korea has welcomed kims call for talks on ensuring free 
travel across the border 
but seoul has accused north korea of making a false claim 
regarding a concrete wall to mislead world opinion perhaps to try 
to head off pressure on the authoritarian nation to carry out 
democratic reforms similar to those that have swept eastern europe

political instability in east germany combined 
with talk of a reunified germany are potentially dangerous 
situations that threaten a new european order a foreign policy 
expert said wednesday 
former amb george f kennan 86 told the senate foreign 
relations committee it would be foolish to reunify germany until 
the soviet union the united states and germanys neighbors agree 
on a new framework 
the security arrangements existing today in much of europe 
the presence of foreign military forces on the territories of both 
parts of germany the existence of powerful indigenous german 
forces in both parts of germany are totally incompatible with 
an immediate reunification 
kennan a professor emeritus at the institute for advanced 
studies at princeton nj said developments in east germany 
should not been allowed to serve as a catalyst for a hasty 
reunification 
east germany is a very very delicate dicey and dangerous 
situation said kennan saying that in a few more days the 
situation could disintegrate to the point there is no central 
government 
its hard to talk to crowds on the street he said 
opposition has been mounting to east germanys communistled 
transition government which has scheduled elections on may 6 this 
week the police said opposition figures were involved in the 
ransacking of the state security headquarters on monday 
kennan said east germanys political crisis and the ensuing talk 
of reunifying germany present the greatest potential danagers 
as a first step kennan suggested the four powers that govern 
berlin the united states france britain and the soviet union 
establish a unified government 
that entity would not jeopardize any future reunification and a 
timetable could be worked out for combining the two germanys he 
said 
more generally kennan said the situation in all the eastern 
european countries is unstable and not without dangerous 
aspects 
those countries now governed by reform communists face economic 
problems and upcoming elections it will be at least a year or 
two before the emerging democratic establishments can be smoothly 
functioning 
as for soviet leader mikhael gorbachev kennan said the united 
states could help him survive recent upheaval in his country by 
removing trade impediments and proposing further reductions in 
conventional arms in europe 
kennan an architect of the cold war containment theory in 
the 1940s has long advocated that the superpowers withdraw their 
troops from europe in 1981 he was criticized by hardline 
conservatives for suggesting both countries cut their nuclear 
arsenals by 50 percent 
but that position basically was endorsed by gorbachev and 
president bush at their malta summit in december

elementary school teacher janet geng wounded 
a year ago when a drifter opened fire at her california school 
said wednesday the emotional trauma is still with us many of us 
walk in fear 
she remembers the smallest details of jan 17 1989 when 
patrick purdy fired more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic 
assaultstyle ak47 rifle in the schoolyard of cleveland elementary 
in stockon calif 
purdy 24 killed five children and wounded 29 others as well as 
mrs geng in less than two minutes before he killed himself 
my wounded leg rested on my good one she told a capitol 
hill news conference the pressure of the wound was tremendous i 
tried to get hold of the blacktop to pull myself but i couldnt 
move either leg i tried to look out on the playground but all i 
saw was the sparks and the popping of the gravel coming closer i 
was going to die 
she spent 31 days in the hospital and underwent four operations 
in an effort to fix what was called a grapefruit size hole in 
her left leg 
at the time she wasnt involved in the gun control movement 
today she is a committed member appearing at a news conference 
called by the coalition to stop gun violence and lobbying congress 
to approve pending legislation that would ban the sale and 
manufacture of certain domestically produced assaultstyle weapons 
were not talking about just a simple little gun anymore 
thats out there she said were talking about a war 
weapon 
last july in part as a response to the outcry over the stockton 
shootings the bush administration banned the imports of 43 types 
of semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons including the ak47 
that action was taken by the treasury departments bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms which has control over firearms 
imports and requires that the weapons be suitable for sporting uses 
the coalition wants president bush to call for legislation that 
would limit or ban production or sale of similar domestically 
produced weapons coalition members argue that without a clear sign 
from the president that he will sign such a bill congress wont 
act 
meanwhile handgun control inc petitioned the government 
wednesday to prohibit imports of semiautomatic assaultstyle 
pistols including the uzi and hk94 handguns which are similar to 
the riflesize uzi and hk94 weapons banned last july 
asked wednesday about white house reaction to the petition 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said we dont have any reaction 
well be guided by atf 
a study by cox newspapers last year of almost 43000 gun trace 
requests submitted to the atf from police departments nationwide 
found that the top five guns used by criminals were all handguns 
produced in the united states including the tec9 assaultstyle 
weapon 
three handguns made the list of the top 10 assaultstyle weapons 
found in crimes but all were manufactured domestically the 
miamiproduced tec9 and the atlantamade mac11 and mac10 
according to the cox study 
atf spokesman jack killorin said tuesday that it would be much 
more difficult to ban pistol imports than it was to ban the rifle 
imports because there have been two decades of regulations and 
legislative history covering what handguns may be imported 
the rifles he said reflected relatively new technology not 
covered by the rules developed since the gun control act of 1968 
jim baker the nras director of governmental affairs said i 
dont know how one would design criteria that would exclude the 
firearms theyre talking about and not exclude all the other 
firearms 
but the handgun control petition said all of the factors which 
atf considered persuasive in banning the importation of 
semiautomatic assault rifles are present and applicable to 
semiautomatic assault pistols 
mrs geng had wanted to present bush a petition signed by 59 
staff members from cleveland elementary asking for federal 
legislation that would match california measures banning sales of 
assaultstyle weapons 
but white house aides said bush did not have time to meet her 
according to coalition spokesman jeffrey muchnick 
the white house press office did not immediately respond to a 
request for comment wednesday 
elsewhere the center to prevent handgun violence at a news 
conference unveiled eight public service tv advertisements to 
enhance awareness of handgun safety and to keep the weapons away 
from children

a tiny generator placed in the body to 
deliver lifesaving electrical shocks to the heart has dramatically 
cut the death rate in people with heart rhythm disorders a study 
shows 
patients who have been given the device faced a 25 percent 
chance of dying each year without it and practically none would 
have survived five years 
with the device 94 percent survive five years and 85 percent 
survive 10 years said dr levi watkins jr of johns hopkins 
university in baltimore 
each year 600000 americans die suddenly from heart attacks 
that trigger abnormal heart rhythms the american heart association 
says 
about 50000 to 100000 americans each year could benefit from 
the device watkins said they are patients who have already 
survived one cardiac arrest or have been diagnosed with severe 
heart rhythm disorders additionally their disorders have been 
shown not to respond to drug treatment watkins said 
he spoke wednesday at the american heart associations annual 
science writers forum 
the device which is inserted under the skin of the abdomen is 
connected to the heart by means of two flexible electrodes 
it monitors the hearts rhythm continually when it detects an 
abnormality it quickly delivers a shock powerful enough to restore 
normal heart rhythm watkins said 
the device is a miniaturized equivalent of the large generator 
or defibrillator with two paddlelike electrodes that is used in 
hospitals to correct abnormal rhythms the small version is called 
an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
it differs from a pacemaker in that it operates only when it 
detects an abnormality a pacemaker delivers a steady stream of 
pulses to the heart to cause it to beat and a pacemaker cannot 
correct the kinds of rhythm disorders that lead to sudden death 
the implantable defibrillator has been put into more than 7000 
patients worldwide with remarkable results watkins said 
the hopkins team has used the defibrillator which is approved 
by the us food and drug administration in more than 310 
patients mostly men watkins said about 4 percent of the patients 
died during the surgery to implant the defibrillator he said 
the 85 percent 10year survival free of sudden cardiac death 
must be regarded as the most significant advance in the treatment 
of malignant cardiac arrhythmias in this decade watkins wrote in 
a paper describing the research 
the defibrillator costs 15000 and its implantation requires an 
additional 15000 to 20000 worth of hospital care but it may be 
cheaper than the costs of the longterm hospital care needed to 
find suitable drug treatments for the patients said dr myron 
weisfeldt president of the american heart association 
improvements in the device coupled with growing doubts about 
the effectiveness of some antiarrhythmia drugs should lead to 
much greater use of the device in the near future weisfeldt said

striking coal miner kenny wallace says hes 
worked underground long enough to know when you see the light at 
the end of the tunnel and it always takes longer to get out than 
you think 
while the united mine workers on strike against pittston coal 
group are frustrated by a delay in getting to vote on a contract 
wallace said wednesday theyre confident the settlement negotiated 
two weeks ago by union leaders will bring an end to the labor 
dispute 
its just like being down in a mine said wallace a 
38yearold electrician from haysi you see the light and it 
takes time to get there it just takes time 
when umw and company negotiators worked out the tentative 
settlement they agreed to try to dissolve hundreds of legal 
actions that arose during the two years the miners have been 
without a contract including 65 million in fines against the 
union for illegal strike activities 
the mountain of litigation is proving harder to dig through than 
union officials originally envisioned umw president richard 
trumka badgered by reporters to make an estimate on new years 
day said the contract might be sent down to the miners in eight to 
10 days 
now no union official will estimate when the vote will take 
place and wont even talk about a timetable on the record its 
not that we want to keep people in the dark were just not ready 
to ballpark it one union representative said 
copies of the contract havent even been printed yet attorneys 
for the union and company were still tying up loose ends 
wednesday the representative said hearings before the judges who 
levied the fines have not been scheduled 
trumka sent a letter last week to each of the 1700 striking 
miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky explaining the 
delay praising them for forcing pittston to make concessions they 
sought and urging them to remain patient 
while the terms of the contract remain a secret industry 
analysts with secondhand knowledge of it have said the union won 
on their two key issues better health and retirement benefits and 
improved job security 
i dont think mr trumka will send down a contract we cant 
live with wallace said 
but the delay is starting to frustrate some of the miners such 
as clifford redbone steffey of st paul who is known for his 
good humor and flatfoot dancing to bluegrass music 
i makes it hard after we struggled this hard to get a contract 
and it just lingers on id like to get back to work steffey 
said at a rally tuesday at the unions camp solidarity in russell 
county its aggravating knowing youve got a contract and cant 
see it

a delegation of coal miners met with the 
finance minister wednesday to discuss the demands of more than 
6000 striking miners the pap news agency said 
the strike began tuesday at five mines in southern poland and is 
the most significant labor protest since jan 1 when a radical 
reform plan took effect to create a marketoriented economy and 
check inflation 
since then prices have gone up dramatically and the miners are 
demanding higher pay 
tomasz gorski a spokesman for the solidarity trade union in the 
katowice region said a delegation of miners met with finance 
minister leszek balcerowicz but neither gorski nor a spokesman for 
balcerowicz could provide details 
about 6000 workers were on strike at the czerwone zaglebie mine 
and another 40 at the niwka modrzejow mine both in the city of 
sosnowiec just outside katowice a major industrial center 185 
miles south of warsaw 
workers returned to work at kazimierz juliusz another mine near 
katowice pap said 
strikes also continued at three small mines in walbrzych a city 
12 miles from the border with czechoslovakia the news agency 
reported 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza had reported 
wednesday that workers at two of the mines had suspended their 
strikes telephone calls to the walbrzych area could not be put 
through 
the miners at czerwone zaglebie were demanding a 26 supplement 
to their wages for december 
the 130 workers on strike at the thorez mine in walbrzych were 
demanding higher pay and polish tv earlier reported that the 
demands were similar at the other two mines in the city 
the workers also are demanding a reduction in mine office 
employees and assurances that the strikers will not face 
retaliation 
the economic reforms being carried out include a tight wage 
policy as part of the attack on inflation prices are soaring 
however because they are no longer controlled by the government or 
kept artificially low by budget subsidies 
top finance ministry officials say it will take at least six 
months for prices to stabilize and that the interim period will be 
difficult for workers 
none of the mines involved in the current strike participated in 
the august 1988 walkouts that led to the widespread labor unrest 
that forced the communist authorities who ruled at the time to 
start talks on political reform 
the talks led to the legalization of solidarity last year and to 
partially free elections in june 
solidaritys sweeping victory in those elections paved the wave 
for the election of solidarity editor tadeusz mazowiecki as the 
first noncommunist head of government in 40 years

profitsharing plans coupled with giving 
workers a say in daytoday decisionmaking can boost productivity 
at little or no cost to businesses a study suggests 
you can get productivity on the cheap if it works said 
alan blinder an economist at princeton university and editor of 
paying for productivity 
the book is a collection of studies examining ways to boost us 
productivity considered by many to be a crucial issue facing the 
country as it struggles to compete with japan and other rising 
economic powers 
allowing workers to participate in decisions and rewarding their 
efficiency with part of the profits can boost productivity at 
little if any cost to the employer blinder said other methods 
of boosting productivity such as improving education and capital 
investments use many resources he noted 
the studies published this month by the brookings institution 
a generally liberal think tank explore whether flexible pay 
employee stock ownership profitsharing and incentive bonuses make 
workers more productive by linking pay to performance 
evidence offered by the economists suggests that extra pay is 
likely to be most effective when businesses also encourage employee 
participation in the daytoday decisions of the workplace 
putting the two together as a package in the workplace creates 
a good environment where workers have incentive and the inclination 
to do things that are good for the company blinder said 
between 15 percent and 20 percent of american firms have some 
sort of profitsharing plans for their employees he said 
productivity or the amount produced by each worker for every 
hour he or she is on the job increased at an annual rate of nearly 
3 percent between 1947 and 1973 but since then has averaged a gain 
of only about 1 percent 
blinder said management and labor have been reluctant to shift 
to allowing more worker participation partly because it upsets 
the strong hierarchical bosstoworker relationship 
theres an atmosphere of distrust there some workers view 
anything as a plot to make them work harder blinder said 
robert litan director of brookings center for economic 
progress and employment said labor has been slow to back 
profitsharing plans because theres a perception that 
profitsharing is not gravy that its coming out of their 
paycheck 
masanori hashimoto an ohio state economist studied japanese 
management techniques that enlist workers in socalled shop floor 
decisions he stopped short of recommending a wholesale import of 
those techniques to the united states citing differences between 
the two nations economies 
part of the explanation is that in the past managers felt 
threatened by dilution of their power but the american industry 
seems to be heading in that direction hashimoto said 
he noted that some firms have begun experimenting with worker 
participation techniques for instance at the new united motor 
manufacturing inc or nummi plant in fremont calif a joint 
venture by general motors and toyota teams of six to eight workers 
are responsible for job rotation balancing work assignments and 
equalizing workloads 
nummi spokesman michael damer said plant officials believe 
worker participation is at least partly responsible for a huge drop 
in absenteeism at the old gm plant 20 percent to 25 percent of 
the work force would fail to show on any given day now the 
absenteeism rate is 4 percent he said 
some workers have balked at the team concept but frank joyce a 
spokesman for the united auto workers said the uaw has 
traditionally pushed for more worker input 
management is too important to be left just to managers 
joyce said at the same time he said the union has been keenly 
interested in who benefits from the fruits of increased 
productivity noting it is not in labors interest to make jobs so 
efficient that certain workers arent needed anymore

a trumpeter swan a huge bird with a 
booming call and wingspan wider than a bald eagles has been seen 
in mississippi for the first time since records started being kept 
and perhaps for centuries 
birdwatchers speculate a harsh winter that froze northern lakes 
drove the bird this far south 
the trumpeter swan is not even on our checklist said nona 
herbert a member of the mississippi ornithological society 
the trumpeter a snowwhite blackbilled birds that weighs about 
25 pounds with a wingspan of 5 to 6 feet has apparently settled 
with smaller tundra swans in a flooded bean field four miles from 
herberts home in the choctaw community of bolivar county 
trumpeter swans are among the biggest birds in north america in 
flight they stretch about 4 feet from the tips of their bills to 
the tips of their tails they normally winter along the alaskan and 
washington coasts or in the northern great basin and can be seen 
yearround at yellowstone national park in wyoming and montana 
herbert and don simon an arkansas wildlife expert identified 
the bird as a trumpeter swan sunday and spread the word to other 
birders 
ive been out seeing them every day taking somebody to see 
them every day herbert said estimating that at least 100 
birders have come to glimpse the trumpeter and tundra swans 
marvin davis of oxford president of the states birdwatching 
society said he had been skeptical of herbert and simons claim 
until he saw the bird for himself 
it is all improbable but thats what makes birdwatching so 
exciting birds have wings so they fly where books say they 
shouldnt be birds havent read the books davis said 
the species has never been sighted since the societys bird 
records committee began keeping a formal list in 1962 davis said 
trumpeter swan bones have been found among 500yearold indian 
artifacts but its not even certain that the birds were in 
mississippi even then because the bones could have been traded 
among indians from across large geographic areas 
theres no definite record of live birds being in mississippi 
before now he said as far as i know this is a first 
davis said he knows of a book that mentions a 19thcentury 
sighting but he said that sighting was questionable

sen tom harkin said wednesday that too much 
of the money meant for eradicating the deadly swine virus 
pseudorabies appears lost in a black hole of administrative 
costs 
harkins state iowa is getting only 6000 more funds to fight 
the disease this year despite the 600000 overall increase in the 
federal program some states are actually being cut back 
wheres the black hole the iowa democrat said 
its my intention to work with the inspector general and the 
gao general accounting office to get some accounting breakouts 
harkin told a senate hearing 
the 10year federal program to rid the nations swine population 
of pseudorabies began last january with 31 million for 1989 the 
amount was increased by 600000 for fiscal 1990 the program also 
calls for state and pork industry contributions 
over 20 percent of the iowa swine herds are infected with 
pseudorabies and nearly 47 percent of the nations infected herds 
are located in iowa said harkin 
rep tom tauke riowa who says he represents the leading 
porkproducing district in the nation also has blasted the 
agriculture department for spending so much on administration 
instead of testing vaccination and other efforts directly related 
to getting rid of the virus 
this vital federal program dedicated to eradicating deadly 
swine disease has been rendered virtually useless by bureaucratic 
red tape tauke said in a press release monday 
under questioning wednesday from harkin two agriculture 
department officials admitted a greater percentage of the 
appropriated funds was going to administration than congress 
intended 
but they defended the use as necessary and said there still was 
enough money to make progress in the eradication program 
lonnie king deputy administrator at usdas animal and plant 
health inspection service said that in 1989 other programs within 
the agency helped support the administrative costs of running the 
pseudorabies program 
because pseudorabies will pay its fair share of expenses and 
because of the consolidation of purchases to save money some state 
allocations will be reduced king said we are confident that 
the funds allocated to the states are adequate to further the 
progress of the national eradication program 
but harkin wasnt satisfied 
this confirms everyones worst fears about government he 
said

the withdrawal of all soviet 
troops from czechoslovakia by the end of 1990 will be a key issue 
when president vaclav havel visits moscow next month a foreign 
ministry spokesman said wednesday 
we consider the soviet pullout to be a key issue in the 
relations between our two countries said spokesman lubos 
dobrovsky 
earlier this week soviet and czechoslovak delegations failed to 
produce a tangible result in their talks in prague despite of a 
draft agreement proposed by the czechoslovak side the talks ended 
tuesday 
dobrovsky said he believed the soviet delegation did not quite 
fully comprehend the depth of transformations that took place in 
czechoslovakia 
the czechoslovak delegation left no doubt on the soviet side 
that it will seek the withdrawal of soviet troops with utmost 
consistency dobrovsky said we have reasons to believe that a 
solution satisfying both sides will be found as soon as possible 
dobrovsky also confirmed czechoslovakia would seek a complete 
soviet pullout by the end of 1990 and the withdrawal of a 
decisive part of soviet troops before scheduled elections in june 
the dates we have proposed were neither accepted nor rejected 
by the soviet side he stated 
the soviet union stationed 75000 soldiers in czechoslovakia 
after the 1968 sovietled warsaw pact invasion crushed the prague 
spring liberal reforms of alexander dubcek

a graduate student was frantic when the 
worm program he designed went berserk and he couldnt stop it from 
paralyzing a federal nationwide computer network a friend of his 
testified wednesday 
paul graham a 25yearold graduate student at harvard 
university testified that defendant robert t morris designed the 
worm to break into the internet system but it wasnt intended to 
replicate wildly as it did or cause any damage 
it was just supposed to go from computer to computer to see 
how far it could get once it got in it wasnt supposed to do 
anything said graham a witness for the government in the 
federal trial 
morris is charged with designing and setting loose the program 
that crippled an estimated 6000 computers linked to internet in 
november 1988 
if convicted morris 25 of arnold md a suspended cornell 
university student faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
graham who met morris when he was an undergraduate at harvard 
told jurors that morris deliberately added safeguards to limit the 
growth of his program to ensure it would cause no permanent file 
damage to the computers it attacked 
he put in a wrong number and instead of just allowing a few 
copies every onceinawhile it made lots of copies every time 
said graham 
morris telephoned graham from cornell the night of the attack 
after realizing his worm was out of control graham testified 
he sounded like he had a final the next day that he hadnt 
studied for he sounded miserable he sounded in a state of shock 
and horror graham told the jury adding that the usually 
puritanical morris was even using profanities 
morris tried to regain access to his computer at cornell to try 
to stop the worm but his program already had immobilized cornells 
computers preventing him from getting back into the system said 
graham 
we thought maybe we could send out another program that could 
eat the worm and stop its processes he said but there was no 
way to send something after the virus it wouldnt get through it 
was pointless 
graham said morris first told him about designing the worm when 
the cornell student visited harvard for a weekend in late october 
1988 
morris whom graham said could do anything on a computer first 
mentioned his plan to design a virus to infect internet after 
discovering a software bug or flaw in harvards unix system that 
would allow unauthorized entry 
graham told the jury that unix was widely regarded as an 
insecure system 
graham said he never told anyone about morris worm because the 
plan was mentioned to him in confidence and he hadnt realized 
morris was so close to having it finished 
graham said he saw nothing wrong about what morris was doing 
because breaking into systems is a common practice of fledgling 
computer security students

an extended january thaw featuring springlike 
temperatures has melted the usual snow here but planning and 
technology have kept the citys annual winter festival on ice 
organizers of the monthlong big cool winterfest were prepared 
for an uncooperative forecast building a refrigeration unit for 
the skating rink and stockpiling snow for the collegiate snow 
sculpting contest 
the city which sponsors the festival spent 150000 to ensure 
the olympicsize rink would remain cold after four years of warm 
januarys ruined past festival events said winterfest executive 
director elizabeth black 
with this warm weather we wouldnt have been able to open the 
rink it would have been a big cool pond if we wouldnt have 
refrigerated she said 
temperatures wednesday the 21st straight day milwaukee exceeded 
its seasonal norms peaked into the low 50s threatening to break a 
centuryold temperature record the thaw is forecast to continue at 
least through the weekend 
rain has covered most of wisconsin this week and milwaukee thus 
far has received just 18 inches of snow in january well below the 
monthly average of 13 inches 
luckily the festival organizers had taken precautions against 
that development stockpiling snow that fell in december and 
storing the piles under tarps and plywood boxes to keep it fresh 
for the sculptors 
the student captain of a 25member sculpting team from the 
milwaukee school of engineering said they decided to adjust the 
theme of their submission in this weekends snow sculpting 
competition 
mark piszczek 21 of glendale heights ill said the crew of 
architectural engineering students plan to create a snowman sitting 
in an open refrigerator roasting a marshmallow over an campfire 
the balmy weather has cut sales for snow removal businesses like 
blizzard wizzard and snowbird plowing service and shops that sell 
skis snowmobiles and other seasonal equipment 
several wisconsin ski areas have begun to report concerns about 
the unseasonal weather at crystal ridge near milwaukee a 5foot 
snow base which formed in middecember has melted to 10 inches in 
some areas 
obviously it hurts people dont think about skiing when its 
raining crystal ridge manager daphne reed said 
kay decker a chamber of commerce spokeswoman in hurley in 
northern wisconsin said the continued warmth would hurt the 
economies of communities like her own that depend on winter 
tourism 
they call us the snowbelt our januarys are usually cold for 
us to have 20 to 30 degrees isnt natural thirty degrees is like 
spring ms decker said

the food and drug administration said on 
wednesday that some bottles of wet cote contact lens solution 
contain a bacteria that could cause serious eye infections 
the contaminated batch carries the lot number w3028 and the 
expiration date 691 on the label 
it was distributed in texas florida georgia wisconsin 
pennsylvania ohio north carolina maryland tennessee and 
illinois the fda said 
wet cote made by occumed inc in sarasota fla is a wetting 
solution designed for use with hard contact lenses 
seven of 20 bottles of wet cote from the batch that were 
analyzed were found to be contaminated with a bacteria called 
pseudomonas cepecia which can cause serious eye infections that 
are difficult to treat and in rare cases lead to blindness the fda 
said 
the manufacturer recalled the product but only about a third of 
the 1500 bottles produced were recovered the agency said 
the fda advised consumers who have bottles of wet cote to check 
the label and if the lot number shows it was from the contaminated 
batch not to use it but return the product to the place of 
purchase 
the contaminated liquid looks the same as the safe product the

when the shuttle columbia returns to 
earth on friday scientists will spend weeks debriefing the 
astronauts but an engineer dubbed dr flush will be interested in 
only one thing how did the toilet work 
don rethke a mechanical engineer at hamilton standard for 27 
years is hard at work refining a space toilet that he says will 
solve the delicate problems that have plagued astronauts since the 
early days of space exploration how to cope with zero gravity 
limited storage and well the smell when answering natures call 
in space 
we wanted it to be more earthlike rethke said recently as 
he showed off a prototype of his commode during an interview in his 
cramped research trailer about half the size of the shuttle cabin 
the national aeronautics and space administration has already 
given rethkes design its preliminary approval but the five 
columbia crew members will be quizzed when they return and their 
reports passed on to rethke so he and his assistants can further 
refine the commode 
its going to be a pretty userfriendly type system said 
eugene winkler of nasas shuttle support team at the johnson space 
center in houston weve put the best minds in the country 
together on this new potty so i think it should work out pretty 
well 
hamilton standard which has been designing space suits for nasa 
since the 1960s last year won a 35 million contract to design a 
toilet that will meet the demands of larger crews and longer 
missions 
rethkes commode will be installed on the extendedduration 
orbiter shuttle to be launched in march 1992 for 16 days but is 
ultimately headed for the space station freedom an orbiting 
laboratory where astronauts will live for months at a time later 
this decade 
the aeronautics division of the giant defense contractor united 
technologies corp hamilton standard lost a fierce competition 
with general electric to design space commodes in the early 1970s 
but got a second chance after ge dropped out of the spacewaste 
game the firm last year also won the maintenance contract for the 
disposal system now in use 
things have come a long way since that day in 1961 when alan b 
shepard jr wet his space suit as he sat helplessly strapped in his 
freedom 7 capsule atop a redstone rocket waiting to become the 
first american launched into space 
during the gemini and apollo programs astronauts urinated into 
cups that were just dumped into space they used stickon plastic 
bags for solid waste they carried back to earth winkler said 
it was all very messy smelly and uncomfortable and zero 
hygiene for the astronauts who went to the moon rethke said 
the shuttles have had improved commodes that resemble portable 
toilets but the accommodations are still pretty spartan capacity 
is a problem and the astronauts have to use the same bowl that 
cant be flushed rethke said 
rethkes aim for the space toilet was simple make it 
comfortable and clean 
his commode looks much like the ordinary toilet but instead of 
water there are individual collection bags for solid waste urine 
is funneled into a separate container and will be chemically 
treated for hygienic use washing but not drinking water 
the commode in a closet similar to the cramped restrooms on 
commercial jetliners has biodegradable wipes a rearview mirror to 
help astronauts with delicate manuevers and padded bars to hold 
them in place 
a vacuumlike device solves the zerogravity problem by drawing 
the waste downward also controlling ordor and bacteria 
instead of flushing the astronauts will simply press a button 
after they are done the collection bags are then automatically 
sealed moved along a metal track and dropped into a compacter that 
can hold a weeks worth of waste from four astronauts rethke said 
when full the 25inch fiberglass cannister is stored on board and 
replaced with a fresh one 
each astronaut inserts a fresh bag for the next user

the united states top military officer 
said wednesday the sovietled warsaw pact was undergoing change but 
no member has yet suggested pulling out of the alliance 
clearly there is a transformation taking place in the warsaw 
pact said gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff after two days of unusual talks with his east bloc 
counterparts 
i had no discussions with any member of the pact that 
suggested they were considering leaving the formal structure of 
the warsaw pact he told a news conference 
gen nikolaj chervov head of the directorate of the soviet 
general staff acknowledged earlier that there will be changes in 
the alliances structure 
he disclosed that a key policymaking body of top communist 
party officials would likely be disbanded 
the highranking military officers were in vienna for the start 
of an unprecedented meeting of 35 nations to discuss eastwest 
military strategies the aim is to lift the secrecy surrounding 
military activities and ease tensions in europe 
western experts were eager to hear whether any of the emerging 
democracies in eastern europe was considering leaving the 
sevennation warsaw pact 
east european officers speaking on the second day of the 
meeting stressed the importance of their national defense 
interests rather than those of their military alliance 
we proceed from the fact that our national interests are 
fundamental said gen anton slimak chief of czechoslovakias 
general staff 
the principles of our military doctrine are being adapted to 
the newly created realities on the domestic and international 
scale he said 
he said money was tight and that troops and weapons were being 
trimmed 
starting feb 1 he said we shall reduce by onethird the 
number of forces and equipment trained to fulfill combat tasks 
east germanys military chief gen manfred graetz said his 
nation was drafting a new military policy based on protection 
against foreign aggression according to the east german news 
agency adn 
powell said some of the eastbloc governments appeared to be 
making unilateral judgments about their armed forces and weapons 
production 
yet they continue to say they are part of an alliance he 
said so i think the warsaw pact alliance is shifting in its 
character to a more political institution 
those nations he said generally were cutting their armed 
forces because of economic problems and an assessment of defense 
needs 
the west has long complained about the military might of the 
warsaw pact 
the soviets top military officer gen mikhail moiseyev said 
tuesday the kremlin was sharply reducing arms troops and spending 
as part of a new military doctrine 
chervov speaking through an interpreter said the warsaw pacts 
governing body the political consultative committee would likely 
be scrapped the panel is made up of the top communist party 
officials of the seven nations 
he said political changes in some of the countries has led to 
the multiplicity of parties 
the communist parties are no longer leading the states he 
said therefore the political consultative committee will 
probably cease to exist of itself and perhaps there will be another 
supreme body 
the new one he said could be made up of the heads of state of 
those countries 
powell said moiseyev indicated in private talks that the soviets 
did not intend to use military force to reverse the events in 
eastern europe 
powell also said the changes were contributing to smaller us 
defense spending 
theres a general feeling we can take more of a chance 
and that we can cut back on our spending because the world does 
seem to be moving in a new and positive direction he said 
the threeweek meeting is part of negotiations on confidenceand 
securitybuilding measures designed to reduce military tensions in 
europe

a palestinian died wednesday of gunshot wounds 
from an earlier confrontation with troops and a police officer was 
removed from his job for using unnecessary force in breaking up a 
peace rally last month 
palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip to protest what they perceive as antiarab us 
policies 
there were scattered stonethrowing clashes in the territories 
and troops shot and wounded at least nine palestinians arab 
hospital officials said the army confirmed six wounded 
yousef hatem shusha 19 of the west bank village of husan died 
at hadassah hospital in jerusalem after being shot in the head and 
back during a clash tuesday night arab reports said 
an army official confirmed the death and said the circumstances 
were under investigation 
the death brought to 648 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis during the 25month palestinian uprising against the 
israeli occupation 
palestinian vigilantes have killed 170 fellow arabs suspected of 
cooperating with israel fortythree israelis have died as well 
israeli police commissioner david krauss ordered an unidentified 
officer removed from his post after viewing film of police 
dispersing a demonstrators on dec 30 police spokesman uzi sandori 
said 
we saw in the film that the policeman was beating two people 
without any need with a billy club krauss said on army radio 
more than 50 people were injured in the melee the european 
community and peace activists criticized police for using 
unjustified violence during the demonstration 
at the time police said officers acted only after outlawed plo 
flags were waved and stones hurled at police 
i can understand that an innocent citizen in this situation 
felt very bad he saw people running about heard explosions saw 
horses and maybe was sprayed with water and tear gas but after 
you see the film you understand that police had to do it krauss 
said 
stores were shut and transportation came to a halt throughout 
the territories as palestinians heeded a strike call by the 
plobacked unified national leadership of the uprising 
the underground leaders ordered the strike to condemn american 
policy which is against the rights of our people according to a 
leaflet circulated this month 
the plo has accepted the united states as a mediator in middle 
east peace efforts but many palestinians believe washington favors 
israel in the conflict 
in other developments troops bulldozed a house in gaza city 
because the owners son was suspected of killing a palestinian 
allegedly collaborating with israel the army said 
the chief of police in northern israel albert musafia reported 
a 30 percent rise in politically motivated attacks by israeli arabs 
in 1989 over the previous year he did not provide figures 
the events in judea samaria and gaza exercise an influence on 
nationalist radicalism among israeli arabs that is expressed in 
firebomb attacks painting of slogans and palestinian flags he 
said using biblical names for the west bank 
but musafia attributed most of the attacks to marginal groups 
of youths

lawmakers on wednesday extended 
zimbabwes 25yearold state of emergency by six months to meet 
what they say are military threats from neighboring south africa 
and mozambique 
the laws give authorities the power to arrest without warrant 
detain indefinitely without trial and search without authority 
parliament approved their renewal by a vote of 733 the other 
legislators in the 100member national assembly where absent 
home affairs minister moven mahachi arguing for an extension 
cited several reasons for retaining the powers 
an escalation in offensives across zimbabwes eastern frontier 
by right wing guerrillas of the mozambique national resistance in 
which 60 zimbabweans were slain in the last six months 
reports that young zimbabweans belonging to opposition 
political parties were being trained by the guerrillas to fight 
against the government 
threats by south africa to attack neighboring states and 
the need to give security forces flexible powers so they can 
maintain law and order 
mahachi recalled that south african defense minister magnus 
malan recently said south africa might raid zimbabwe and other 
countries in the region 
i do not regard these threats as hollow he said this has 
been proved by past events he added apparently referring to 
sabotage attacks in zimbabwe by south african soldiers and agents 
opponents including the catholic commission for justice and 
peace and independent newspapers contend emergency powers were 
unnecessary in a relaxed security climate and that the laws were 
often abused 
alexio mudzingwa told parliament that under the regulations the 
government was committing the same human rights violations as south 
africa as well as under the former white minority government of 
ian smith 
can we have the audacity to condemn south africa when we are 
guilty of the same he asked 
mahachi accused the catholic commission a watchdog on human 
rights of being a spokesman for south africa 
commission chairman mike auret later said the charge was 
patently absurd 
the commission is concerned by the fact that the state of 
emergency created by the smith government still pertains today in 
what should be a free and democratic zimbabwe auret said the 
powers of the state of emergency have been abused on many 
occasions 
smith introduced the emergency in 1965 shortly before he 
unilaterally declared the whiteruled british colony of rhodesia 
independent to forestall black majority rule 
the laws were largely used against black nationalist politicians 
and parties which a decade later wages a seven year war for 
independence 
when president robert mugabe came to power in 1980 he retained 
the emergency powers

lockheed aircraft corp said it was 
negotiating with the chadian government for the release of three 
us technicians detained nearly two weeks ago for destroying a 
maintenance manual 
we are very close to a resolution of this misunderstanding 
said len r webb the companys regional manager for africa and the 
middle east and we hope the men will soon be freed to leave the 
country 
irving thrash marvin gambill and ernest ruse all from the 
atlanta area were detained jan 5 after they completed a year of 
training chadians to service a lockheed c130 transport plane 
company officials said 
the aircraft built in marietta ga near atlanta was the 
first of several the government of president hissene habre bought 
for his air force 
lockheed spokesman dick martin in atlanta said when the year 
ended in december the men packed up and destroyed some documents 
including manuals on the aircraft martin said the chadian 
government felt those documents belonged to it while lockheed 
maintains the papers were company material 
martin said chad officials then confiscated the technicians 
passports pending resolution of the conflict 
essentially the dispute was over a single highlevel 
technical overhaul document said webb he said the document was 
not needed for the daytoday maintenance of the aircraft and in 
any case lockheed did not have the state department export permit 
for it this authorization has now been obtained and the chadians 
have been given another copy of the document he said 
webb and another technician paul a lanegger were flown to 
ndjamena by lockheed after the men were detained the pair had 
several highlevel meetings with chadian authorities to resolve the 
issue and webb said they were very close 
webb who is based in amman jordan stressed that the men were 
not held hostage and had not been mistreated or harassed two of 
them thrash and ruse were accompanied to chad by their wives but 
the wives were not detained or mistreated webb added 
the three men held in a chadian police compound until monday 
have since been put under house arrest in ndjamenas biggest 
hotel la chadienne part of the frenchowned novotel chain webb 
said 
thrashs sister barbara porter of marietta has called the 
incident a hostage situation and expressed fear for her 
brothers safety 
but martin said wednesday that thrash had not been separated 
from the others and the five americans were wellfed 
they have not missed a meal he said no one is starving 
and no one is threatened

a colombian who prosecutors say ran a network 
to help traffickers hide the source of their drug money pleaded 
guilty wednesday to his part in a 32 million global 
moneylaundering case 
gonzalo mora jr was considered a key player in a sophisticated 
moneylaundering ring that prosecutors say had ties to panamanian 
gen manuel noriega 
one of the remaining six defendants in the case is amjad awan a 
former official for the latin american division of the bank of 
credit and commerce international or bcci he once told a us 
senate committee that he was a personal banker to noriega who 
according to court documents controlled accounts the fallen 
panamanian leader kept at bcci banks 
the government accused mora of helping traffickers hide the 
source of their money by funneling cash from smugglers to an 
undercover agent posing as a highstakes launderer 
mora switched his plea to guilty on all 33 counts one each of 
drug trafficking and moneylaundering conspiracy plus 31 charges 
of specific laundering activities 
defense attorney joel rosenthal told us district judge w 
terrell hodges there was no agreement with prosecutors 
there were no deals no promises no nothing rosenthal said 
later he said mora has never denied laundering activities but 
he always denied the legal conclusion that there was a 
drugtrafficking conspiracy 
rosenthal said the plea came over the objections of prosecutors 
but they had no grounds to fight the plea since it included all the 
charges 
however moras admission to the trafficking count came 
reluctantly rosenthal said 
hodges agreed to allow mora the opportunity to withdraw the 
guilty plea to that count if during trial the court decides there 
is insufficent evidence to support it hodges also said mora would 
not be sentenced until after the trial ends and appeals are 
exhausted 
the drugtrafficking conspiracy charge carries a possible term 
of up to life in prison and 4 million in fines 
he could face up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine on 
the moneylaundering conspiracy count and 20 years plus a 500000 
on each of the remaining counts 
his plea came as defense attorneys fought to suppress statements 
from remaining defendants after bcci pleaded guilty to 
participating in the money laundering conspiracy 
in a deal with the government tuesday bcci sa and bcci 
overseas ltd admitted laundering 14 million in drug profits and 
agreed to forfeit the cash the money was put in an escrow account 
when the bank was indicted in 1988 the account has accumulated 
more than 1 million in interest which the government also gets to 
keep 
bcci one of the worlds largest private financial institutions 
became the first international bank to admit us moneylaundering 
charges the bank also agreed to cooperate in undisclosed 
investigations making available information books and documents 
relating to relevant matters 
prosecutors also agreed tuesday to drop conspiracy charges 
against one bank officer citing lack of evidence trial continued 
for five other bcci officers and another colombian

jesse jackson on wednesday urged television 
executives to pay more attention to programming and marketing aimed 
at minority group viewers 
not only is racism painful it is unprofitable jackson told 
a workshop audience at the national association of television 
program executives convention the prime marketplace of syndicated 
tv programs 
jackson a civil rights activist and a democratic presidential 
candidate in 1984 and 1988 and other panelists contended that 
blacks and other minorities constitute a billiondollar market that 
is not effectively targeted by programmers and advertisers 
jackson said africanamericans suffer from five rather deadly 
stereotypes every day on television 
we are projected as less intelligent than we are less 
hardworking than we work less universal than we are less 
patriotic than we are and more violent than we are jackson said 
so we say to programmers give the audience a chance dont 
use your brain as a strainer a kind of way of denying people the 
option to make judgment he said 
don jackson no relation who produces soul train and many 
other blackoriented tv programs told the workshop that when he 
entered the business 12 years ago he got conflicting signals from 
the marketplace 
the advertisers including the black agencies and the general 
market agencies said to me if you dont have the stations and 
the time periods we cannot advertise on your show 
and when he went to programmers i found that i did not have 
the clout to get the stations nor the time periods time periods 
that i did get were close to midnight the problem is common 
among black producers he said 
only a joint venture with tribune broadcasting co gave him the 
clout he said 
you have to reach out entertain whats in the marketplace and 
then when you run it dont embarrass yourself or that market by 
putting it on at 130 or 2 in the morning don jackson told the 
programmers 
take a look at the advertisers who are willing to support our 
shows and finally take a look at our shows they are no longer 
public affairs or urban affairs shows they are great dynamic 
entertainment vehicles the producer said 
jesse jackson is entering the syndication market with warner 
bros to produce an issuesoriented talk show voices of 
america 
the show has commitments in 64 markets despite trade magazine 
reports of anxiety among programmers lets call that anxiety 
creative tension were winning jackson said 
communication is the key to walls collapsing jesse jackson 
said as i witnessed the celebration of dr kings birthday these 
last few days i wished so fervently that when he was alive 
americans could have heard him in life and not just in sound 
bites for the biters control the sound

vicki peterson a school teacher and fulltime 
college student on a tight budget loves to see movies on the big 
screen 
but with firstrun movies going for 550 or more she has 
turned to a cheaper alternative discount theaters running older 
movies and sometimes double features these costcutting movie 
houses cater to a more dollarconscious crowd 
i only go to 99cent movies said peterson at paul sanchezs 
fourscreen flowers 99 cent theater in takoma park md near her 
home 
you can bring the whole family said another filmgoer stu 
jarboe you dont always have to eat the food and save some 
money 
but moviegoers such as peterson and jarboe might face more 
limited choices because of a dispute between paramount pictures 
corp and discount theater operators paramount has raised its 
rentals and some operators have responded by ceasing to show 
paramount pictures 
its either that they say or tell customers that the buck 
stops here 
since last spring paramount has been charging operators 105 
for each adult ticket and 75 cents for each childs ticket prior 
to that the annual charge was a flat 35 percent of gross ticket 
sales paramount says the new pricing is a more equitable way of 
spreading the high cost of making movies 
however paramounts action might threaten the discount theater 
industry 
if any of the other companies go ahead with the same type of 
thing discount theaters are either going to have to close or raise 
the price says sanchez who owns four theaters in the washington 
area 
jack clark president of the national association of discount 
theaters said the new pricing by paramount caused him to lose 
money when he ran a discount theater in pullman wash 
he showed indiana jones and the last crusade and under the 
new policy made 1641 in a week charging customers 150 per 
ticket under the old price scale from paramount he made 3148 in 
a week showing the same movie clark said he was 269 in the hole 
after expenses with paramounts new rates 
discount theater operators who number several hundred 
nationwide are fighting back with a lobbying and public relations 
campaign aimed at forcing the company to cut prices 
board member randy hester of the national association of 
discount theaters a trade organization based in seattle urges 
moviegoers and even members of congress to write letters of protest 
to paramount 
hester director of corporate development of the dallasbased 
cinemark usa chain hopes lawmakers will see what this is going to 
do to many moviegoers and will try to take action to stop it 
there are many many people in the country that cant afford 
more than a dollar for a movie ticket he said it wouldnt 
take long after visiting a discount theater to see that this is not 
the same group of people that are shelling out 5 6 or 7 for a 
firstrun movie ticket 
there are no lines for movies at dollar theaters thats because 
dollar theaters show movies long after theyve had their first run 
at pricey movie palaces and multiplexes some discount movie 
theaters are rundown with dimly lighted lobbies worn carpets and 
floors sticky from spilled soft drinks and gooey candy 
thats moviegoer les andersons biggest complaint it costs a 
lot in shoes because they stick to the floor and they dont leave 
when you leave 
still the theaters are havens for the elderly the poor and 
students 
at the request of the discount theater association sen howard 
m metzenbaum dohio has asked the justice department to 
investigate possible antitrust violations to see if paramount may 
be hiking rates in conjunction with other studios 
paramounts pricing system has a negative impact on the poor 
senior citizens and others on fixed incomes says metzenbaum who 
is chairman of a subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business 
rights 
barry london president of paramount pictures denies any 
antitrust violation saying the companys change in its rental 
policy is in no way conspiratorial 
london says his company is just trying to make discount theaters 
bear their fair share of the cost of production distribution and 
marketing he says the overall success of the movie is the engine 
that pulls the whole locomotive 
hester however considers this a form of buckpassing to the 
dollar theaters he insists the cost of making the movie is already 
recovered from many sources 
we pay the film shipping cost both ways they make no 
additional prints for us and give us no money for advertising he 
says we get the print after the firstrun exhibitor has told us 
they can make no more money 
he says the higher rental charges are nothing but extra 
income for paramount london counters that hesters charges are 
ridiculous and he says dollar movie houses arent in 
business as a public service 
what theyre basically doing is using our product to attract 
patrons so they can charge them concession prices equivalent to 
firstrun movie houses he says 
concession prices vary from movie house to movie house sanchez 
for example charges 150 for popcorn and 1 for drinks hester 
says his prices are comparable to regular theaters clark charged 
150 for a large soda and 325 for a large popcorn 
sales of popcorn and other goodies london said generate the 
profits that keep the discount theater business popping

the owner of two partpit bull dogs that 
fatally injured his elderly grandmother in a halfhour attack wants 
the dogs destroyed but authorities said wednesday the animals 
deaths must await an investigation 
marjee lilly 70 died wednesday at countyusc medical center 
despite six hours of surgery that included the amputation of her 
left arm 
she had puncture wounds on most of her torso and all the flesh 
had been eaten off both arms from the wrist to the shoulder 
police lt alan kerstein said tuesdsay the dogs gnawed on the 
woman for about 30 minutes 
the san diego woman had been visiting her grandson clarence 
hubbard when the dogs attacked tuesday 
mrs lilly who remained conscious during the mauling told 
police the dogs attacked while she was trying to feed the 45 to 
50pound animals 
hubbard 34 who found his 4foot11 130pound grandmother on 
the floor said hes owned the 14monthold pit bull terrierboxer 
mixed breed dogs since they were puppies and they had never 
attacked anyone before 
hubbard told police he wanted the dogs destroyed but city 
department of animal control lt michael burns said the dogs would 
remain in quarantine at the north central animal care and control 
center 
our investigation is far from being complete burns said 
we are going to hold the dogs for two reasons first we dont 
know if they have bitten anyone else so we are holding them on a 
10day rabies quarantine and second we have to see if there is 
any kind of negligence 
kerstein said there apparently was no criminal violation because 
the dogs were on private property 
gov george deukmejian said during a morning news conference on 
another subject that he would be willing to consider legislation 
restricting ownership of pit bull terriers 
im as disturbed and distressed as anybody the governor 
said we have to have some kind of law against owning them or 
some other way of completely controlling them 
burns said he would never own a pit bull terrier or recommend 
one for a pet because of their unpredictable vicious nature 
they have a greater propensity for harming for injuring an 
individual they will continue to attack where another dog will 
just bite and run away burns said 
a pit bull has a propensity for viciousness but some people 
like breeds for a vicarious experience they identify with tough 
big aggressive dogs he added 
because there are more of them german shepherds are the 
nations no 1 biting dog but per capita you will have greater 
injuries with pit bulls burns said

the united states sent nearly 15000 troops to panama for the 
strike against noriega and his panamanian defense forces more than 
doubling the 12000 troops on permanent duty there to defend us 
bases and the panama canal 
we want them out of there as soon as possible bush said 
its my objective to get the troops out and get back to the 
levels before this military action

cartagena at all this is prudent it is right im not driven 
by the summit

won extraordinary acclaim for the quality and impact of its work 
benefiting higher education and the nations learners 
the courses generally air on local public television stations 
and through national cable systems including the learning channel 
last september the project introduced an audioprint course 
collection which offers a series of halfhour audio programs 
textbooks study guides and instructors manuals 
all of the courses are designed for students seeking a 
baccalaureate degree in the liberal arts and sciences

the number of political action committees 
registered to participate in federal elections declined by 90 last 
year to 4178 the federal election commission said wednesday 
the fec to which all pacs that spend money on presidential and 
congressional elections must report said there has been a net gain 
of 160 political action committees during the last five years 
that rate of growth is meager compared to the mushrooming growth 
of federally registered pacs in the fiveyear period from 1979 to 
1984 when their number more than doubled from 2000 to 4009 
the number of federally registered pacs rose steadily throughout 
the 1980s until peaking at 4268 as of dec 31 1988 before 
falling by 90 last year the fec said 
the fec data covers only those political action committees 
registered to participate in federal elections and not all pacs 
registered with the fec remain active financially thousands more 
pacs are registered at the state level

authorities on wednesday banned the 
transport of all fruit out of central chiles aconcagua valley 
after the discovery of at least 12 mediterranean fruit flies in the 
area 
the government agricultural service chief juan carlos 
sepulveda said the flies were found in a residential neighborhood 
in los andes a city 48 miles northeast of santiago he said none 
had been detected in the fruitgrowing areas 
nonetheless sepulveda said an emergency plan was immediately 
implemented that included banning the transport of all fruit out of 
the valley 
grapes peaches nectarines and kiwis are grown in the aconcagua 
area about 16 million crates are expected to be harvested this 
year in the valley virtually all for export to the united states 
japan and western europe 
police roadblocks were established to enforce the quarantine 
which coincides with the start of fruit harvesting in the southern 
hemispheres summer 
regional governor raul celis said authorities believe the 
problem the first time mediterranean fruit flies have been found 
in chile since 1978 will be resolved quickly 
the emergency plan sepulveda said includes fumigation of fruit 
and trees with chemicals harvested fruit will be placed in cold 
storage three to four days a common procedure to kill the fly and 
its larvae 
sepulveda said the mediterranean flies found in los andes are 
believed to have been come from neighboring argentina where 
outbreaks of the insect which is harmless to humans has occurred 
he said the finding had been reported to the united states 
japan and to the united nations agricultural agency the fao 
ronald bown president of the chilean fruit exporters 
association called the situation seious but controllable 
last year chiles fruit exporters suffered a major blow when 
two grapes laced with cyanide were found in a chilean shipment in 
philadelphia 
the finding prompted the food and drug administration to 
temporarily ban the sale of chilean fruits in the united states 
the government estimated the losses sustained by chile at 300 
million 
fruit exports have boomed in recent years earning about 900 
million annually 
as part of an agreement with the united states to resume the 
sales of its fruits chile allows fda officials to check security 
measures in the entire export process including harvesting 
packing and transport of the fruit 
two fda experts however who came to chile this month to check 
the security measures were killed last wednesday when the small 
police plane they were flying crashed in a remote andean mountain 
in northern chile

republican and democratic organizations 
wednesday charged that nicaraguas government may be intentionally 
blocking the creation of programs to educate the countrys voters 
about democracy before next months national elections 
the groups which use us government funds to promote democracy 
overseas said nicaragua has thrown up bureaucratic roadblocks to 
the groups efforts to fund what they described as nonpartisan 
programs to educate voters and to scrutinize the election process 
we are seriously concerned that this pattern of delay is the 
result of a political decision taken by your government to inhibit 
action on programs designed to support the democratic process 
the two organizations wrote in a letter to victor tinoco 
nicaraguas deputy foreign minister 
the letter from j brian atwood president of the national 
democratic institute and keith schuette president of the national 
republican institute appeared to be an effort to break loose money 
intended for ipce a civic group affiliated with the political 
opposition to the ruling sandinista party 
the delay will seriously undermine nicaraguan and 
international confidence in the electoral system they wrote 
the charge comes on the heels of reports of electoral 
intimidation and violence by sandinista supporters and the denial 
of visas to a presidentially appointed us observer group for the 
feb 25 national elections 
the two institutes are seeking to provide a total of 15 
million to ipce to pay for training of poll watchers pay workers 
to comb through voter registration lists looking for errors or 
fraud and air television spots explaining how to vote 
these are voters whove either voted in crooked elections or 
never voted before in their lives said one institute official 
speaking to reporters only on condition of anonymity 
but by wednesday all efforts to get the money to local 
officials had been thwarted said officials of both institutes 
there is already a significant deterioration in what we expected 
to accomplish said one 
there has been relatively little trouble getting equipment 
bought and delivered directly to uno the opposition political 
coalition the officials said some 800000 in equipment mostly 
vehicles and office machines is in the process of being 
delivered they said 
meanwhile an organization of american states report submitted 
by an oas observer group said that as of dec 15 191 
nonsandinista candidates had dropped out as candidates in the feb 
25 elections because of intimidation or harassment slightly more 
than half of the dropouts represented the uno coalition the 
largest opposition grouping 
most of the 191 had been candidates for municipal council posts 
the remainder had sought seats in the national assembly said the 
report which was signed by oas secretary general joao baena soares 
the study calls intimidation one of the biggest problems of the 
electoral process and said both pro and antisandinista partisans 
have been affected 
it said that at times the problem consists of threats of loss of 
benefits or employment of phone calls or anonymous messages of 
damage to personal property or of physical threats or death 
threats 
the report also said there have been incidents of violence at 
campaign rallies but added that it has not been easy to uncover the 
causes 
the report was issued a day after elliot richardson the 
personal representative of the un secretary general for the 
nicaraguan elections said he believed the feb 25 voting will be 
carried out fairly 
but like the oas report he expressed concern about the 
atmosphere surrounding the campaign citing use of government 
assets by the sandinistas for campaigning

the bush administration is moving forward with 
plans to relocate a us tactical wing from spain to italy despite 
congressional calls for reducing active forces overseas a lawmaker 
said wednesday 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member of the house 
armed services committee said she received a letter from defense 
secretary dick cheney indicating that he is going full speed 
ahead on crotone the planned site for the tactical wing 
in january 1988 the united states accepted spains demands that 
the air force withdraw its 401st tactical wing of 72 f16 fighter 
bombers from the joint usspanish air base at torrejon de ardoz 
just east of madrid 
italy agreed to provide a new home for the jets approximately 
3600 troops and 600 civilians at crotone 
the average person seeing everyone pulling out will be 
astounded schroeder a longtime opponent of relocating the 
tactical wing in italy said in a telephone interview this isnt 
even a warfighting base 
the pentagon has estimated the total cost of crotone at 885 
million under the administration plan the united states would pay 
470 million or 55 percent of the total cost with nato picking up 
the remainder of the expense 
historically the united states picks up 28 percent of the costs 
of such base construction under the nato infrastructure program 
house and senate negotiators who had agreed on differing numbers 
for the us cost compromised in the fiscal 1990 defense bill and 
capped expenditures at 360 million limiting us payments to 40 
percent and forcing the administration to renegotiate with nato on 
the remaining cost 
that provision was included in the defense bill that president 
bush signed into law late last year 
in may 1989 the relocation came under attack as sen carl 
levin dmich a member of the senate armed services committee 
raised the possibility of returning the unit back to the united 
states and turning it into a reserve unit 
levin noted that former defense secretary frank carlucci had 
announced withdrawal of the wing before nato offered to help 
john a woodworth deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
european and nato policy warned against that step saying we 
will harm ourselves seriously with the allies

housing secretary jack kemp on wednesday 
killed a program that allows private lenders to commit the 
government to insuring mortgages and that has cost taxpayers nearly 
1 billion because of sour loans 
because of projects in the approval pipeline kemp said the 
program would have to be phased out a period department of housing 
and urban development officials said was likely to last several 
months or perhaps longer because of necessary regulatory approvals 
in the interim kemp ordered effective immediately that 
private lenders preparing to approve a coinsured loan first submit 
all documentation to hud for approval 
kemps decision comes four months after hud officials said the 
coinsurance program would be reformed and revived it was one of 
many hud programs investigated during last years allegations of 
mismanagement and influence peddling at hud during the reagan 
administration 
democrats in congress have told kemp not to use the scandals as 
an excuse to kill programs but a key congressional aide said he 
expected no battle over ending the troubled coinsurance program 
but the aide donald campbell staff director of the senate housing 
subcommittee said democrats likely would question whether hud has 
enough qualified staffers to oversee another insurance program kemp 
promoted as an alternative to coinsurance 
the coinsurance program created in 1983 was part of the 
reagan administrations effort reduce the federal bureaucracy by 
turning over work to the private sector 
the program allows private lenders to process mortgages for 
multifamily housing developments and unilaterally commit hud to 
insuring roughly 80 percent of them in the event of default audits 
by huds inspector general have criticized many of the coinsurance 
lenders for approving bloated mortgages that far exceeded the value 
of the property 
the general accounting office has estimated that defaults and 
other related losses have cost taxpayers at least 960 million 
the most notorious case which kemp cited in his statement 
announcing the decision was the hudbacked loan for the colonial 
house apartment complex in houston 
the development was coinsured for 472 million and ultimately 
defaulted because of vacancy problems blamed on rents that were too 
high for the depressed houston real estate market but necessary to 
cover the mortgage hud was forced to take over colonial house and 
recovered just 89 million when it auctioned the development last 
year 
kemp suspended the program last summer as evidence of shoddy 
mortgage underwriting mounted and he has suspended six 
participating lenders and placed seven more on probation kemp had 
placed a moratorium on admitting new lenders into the program 
pending a restructuring 
in september hud officials said privately that the department 
was on the verge of announcing reforms to the coinsurance program 
they then said the announcement was on hold because of delays in 
drafting the necessary regulations 
but in his statement wednesday kemp said extensive reviews of 
the program by hud staff and outside auditors had convinced him to 
kill it 
the coinsurance method is structurally flawed and 
fundamentally unsound as well as administratively unfixable kemp 
said in comparing the losses resulting from coinsurance to the 
housing it provided it is clear that coinsurance has been a bad 
deal for the american taxpayer 
as an alternative financing method kemp promoted huds full 
insurance program under which the government fully insures 
multifamily housing mortgages in this program hud is 100 percent 
liable in the event of default but the department handles the 
underwriting as opposed to the private lenders in the 
coinsurance program presumably giving it the oversight necessary 
to identify risky or bloated mortgages 
the problem here is that they are going back to full insurance 
and there is no evidence that the have the staff to handle the 
demand campbell said noting that the bush administration 
resisted attempts by democrats to boost hud staffing levels this 
year 
kemp said he was taking a number of steps to restructure the 
full insurance program including allowing private lenders to 
process and service those loans in exchange for a fee but only hud 
would have the authority to issue the insurance necessary for the 
loans to be approved and it also would receive 100 percent of the 
mortage insurance premiums 
kemp said the restructuring of the full insurance program would 
be completed by years end 
among the revelations concerning the coinsurance program made 
last year during congressional hearings and through documents 
released by hud was that one company drg funding corp had a 
coinsurance loan portfolio that included nearly 600 million of 
the more than 900 million in losses 
drg had been placed on probation during the reagan 
administration by thenhud secretary samuel r pierce jr and 
required to submit all of its proposed coinsurance loans to hud 
for approval 
but pierce lifted the restrictions after being lobbied by carla 
hills a former hud secretary who at the time was in private law 
practice and now serves as the bush administrations trade 
representative

environment minister 
fernando real and antipollution experts flew to porto santo 
wednesday in the fight to contain an oil slick that blackened 
tourist beaches here and threatened a nature reserve 
authorities flew dissolvants floating barriers pumps and other 
equipment from lisbon to this atlantic island part of portugals 
madeira archipelago 
the madeiras lie 625 miles southwest of lisbon and about 425 
miles west of morocco 
more than 50 tons of crude oil washed up on the island since 
monday mostly on porto santos rocky north and east coasts said a 
portuguese naval official 
witnesses said the oilsoaked bodies of gulls turtles and fish 
washed onto the island 
oil patches covered about one mile of white sand on the vacation 
islands famed 6mile south coast beach 
the portuguese news agency lusa said public health authorities 
banned the sale of fish in porto santo and desalination plants 
producing 80 percent of the drinking water were shut down because 
of fears of oil contamination 
the origin of the oil spill remained a mystery 
ensign adriano queiros of madeira naval command said by 
telephone that small amounts of oil reached the north coast of 
madeira island 28 miles southwest but that madeira was in no 
immediate danger of major polution 
he said the 12mile slick was lying stationary off porto santo 
raimundo quintao president of the madeira ecological club said 
he saw 15 oilcovered turtles dying at porto santo and many more 
may have died at sea 
these are endangered animals because of this alone its an 
environmental disaster he said in a telephone interview 
portuguese navy officers said it was unlikely the oil came from 
the iranian tanker khark 5 which leaked about 19 million gallons 
into the atlantic last month lusa reported 
they said the oil that washed up this week was dense and black 
while oil that has been in the sea for some time turns yellowish 
and foamy 
officials said the oil could have been dumped from tankers that 
passed along the busy sealanes off madeira 
navy spokesman cmdr antonio monteiro coelho said oil samples 
would be analyzed to try to find the origin of the spill 
porto santo had few resources of its own to fight an oil spill 
residents scraped up oil with shovels brooms and buckets 
ecologists accused portuguese authorities of reacting slowly to 
the crisis the ways they have of dealing with it are ridiculous 
its been very slow said quintao 
madeira biologist manuel biscoito told lusa he was concerned 
over the damage the slick could cause to a nature reserve on the 
desertas islands 37 miles south of porto santo 
the craggy islands are home to rare maritime animals including 
one of the worlds last breeding colonies of the mediterranean monk 
seal an endangered marine mammal

alternatives to bringing reagan to court to testify during 
poindexters trial 
alternatives might be having reagan give a videotaped deposition 
or giving written responses to questions 
poindexter is seeking court approval to subpoena reagans 
testimony asserting that the president authorized some of the 
activities in the irancontra affair for which the exnational 
security adviser now is accused of crimes 
the judge said the lawyers should address what kind of showing 
poindexter must make regarding the materiality or necessity of 
reagans testimony before the former national security adviser is 
allowed to subpoena his exboss 
reagans lawyers have cited substantial constitutional 
questions about subpoenaeing the former presidents testimony and 
they are asking that a decision be put off until prosecutors 
complete their case against poindexter 
poindexter scheduled to go to trial feb 20 is charged with 
conspiracy obstructing congress and three counts of making false 
statements in the irancontra scandal 
on another matter greene ordered independent counsel lawrence 
walsh whose office is prosecuting poindexter to provide by monday 
the former presidents written answers given to a federal grand 
jury that investigated the irancontra affair 
greene will decide whether to turn over the written answers to 
poindexter reagans answers given while he was still president 
have never been publicly disclosed 
in connection with a separate subpoena reagan was ordered by 
greene to turn over to the court by jan 7 portions of the former 
presidents diaries pertaining to irancontra matters 
greene is expected to rule on whether the excerpts will be 
turned over to poindexter in preparation for his trial

the kremlin wednesday told the thousands of 
soldiers it sent to the caucasus to shoot if need be to halt bands 
of azerbaijanis and armenians fighting each other in hills around 
the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
thousands of armenian refugees poured from the southern republic 
of azerbaijan many beaten or chased from their homes by angry 
mobs some blamed the attacks on azerbaijanis who earlier fled 
ethnic violence in armenia 
the death toll rose to 58 mostly armenians and the number of 
injured to 169 in five days of civil warfare an interior ministry 
official said 
the evening tv news show vremya ran a statement from the kgb 
and the interior and defense ministries which control troops in 
the area that said 
risking their lives they have so far refrained from using 
arms against criminals to prevent bloodshed 
however a sharp increase in outrageous attacks has made the 
situation unbearable and the soldiers now were permitted to use 
their weapons in accordance with military rules and soviet law 
four burned bodies were found in baku the capital of 
azerbaijan the official news agency tass said wednesday eighteen 
armenian residents were injured in azerbaijan the past 24 hours 
the violence erupted saturday with antiarmenian riots in baku 
fighting rapidly spread to nagornokarabakh and nearby areas of 
azerbaijan with the belligerents using helicopters armored 
vehicles machine guns and other arms seized from government 
arsenals or offered by compatriots 
it was the worst fighting between mainly moslem azerbaijanis and 
mostly christian armenians since their decadesold feud over 
nagornokarabakh erupted in violence two years ago the enclave 
populated mainly by armenians has been ruled by azerbaijan since 
1923 and the current troubles were sparked by its demand in 
february 1988 to be annexed by armenia it has about 160000 people 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei said wednesday 
that islamic fervor was behind events in soviet azerbaijan and 
warned moscow not to deal harshly with the shiite moslem upsurge 
tehran radio reported 
the broadcast monitored in cyprus quoted khamenei as saying 
anyone who thinks or pretends that the motives behind these 
movements are ethnic or nationalistic is making a big mistake 
these sentiments are islamic and soviet leaders should face this 
fact with realism 
the kremlin has empowered local officials to ban demonstrations 
and strikes impose curfews censor the media confiscate weapons 
disband unofficial organizations and detain people for up to 30 
days interior ministry officials said they could not recall such 
measures being imposed since world war ii 
foreign reporters have been barred from the region 
president mikhail s gorbachev sent 11000 army and internal 
security troops to the southern region tuesday but they have been 
slowed by azerbaijanis who erected barricades on roads and at a 
military airfield 
the reinforcements havent helped yet because they havent 
started to act said dmitri seleznyov spokesman for the interior 
ministry in moscow 
troops engaged in at least one battle tuesday when an armed 
group tried to seize five armored personnel carriers near the 
village of tazikend soldiers fired on the group wounding two men 
tass reported 
since then attempts to take apcs have stopped because before 
this they werent used to having weapons used against them 
seleznyov said 
reinforcements also were sent to the nearby border with iran 
tass said more than 7000 armenians have been evacuated from baku 
many in ferry boats across the caspian sea 
in baku a handful of soviet soldiers for nearly three hours 
held back a crowd of 5000 people trying to prevent the detention 
of 10 nationalists who broke into the apartment of a russian 
family tass said they finally agreed to release the 10 and led 
the russians and an armenian family out of the house protecting 
them with shields 
in armenia residents broke into police stations and other 
buildings seeking weapons seleznyov said about 50000 people 
attended a rally in the armenian capital yerevan to hear reports 
about the fighting said armenian activist karen shakhbazyan 
azerbaijanis staged protests in baku and elsewhere to demand 
they be armed and allowed to defend their claim to 
nagornokarabakh newspapers and officials said 
azerbaijanis continued their rail blockade of armenias 35 
million people cutting short fuel and other supplies azerbaijan 
has 69 million people 
the soviet government and the communist party issued a joint 
statement of condolence to families of the dead 
in moscow a 49yearold armenian woman spoke sadly of the night 
azerbaijani thugs beat her in front of her 15yearold son 
they are killing us said alisa arakelova her face swollen 
and black from a fractured jaw her left wrist and two fingers 
broken and encased in plaster and fingernails blackened and 
smashed she escaped baku for moscow after the attack in her 
apartment just days before ethnic hatred erupted in the latest 
most deadly round of two years of ethnic violence in the caucasus 
armenian refugees milling about the moscow office of the 
armenian republic traded horrendous stories of atrocities but none 
claimed to be direct witnesses many blamed gorbachev for failing 
to halt the violence that has torn the two southern republics for 
nearly two years 
both arakelova interviewed at the armenian office and the 
government newspaper izvestia said much of the violence in baku 
involves azerbaijani refugees from armenia forcing armenians from 
their apartments so they will have a place to live izvestia said 
tens of thousands of azerbaijanis who fled ethnic violence in 
armenia in late 1988 remain without homes or jobs in baku 
arakelova an armenian who has lived her entire life in baku 
said some azerbaijani men broke into her apartment a week ago and 
they began beating me with everything they could find 
including a brick and a heavy wooden pole 
she fled that night and her hometown a few days later not even 
stopping to find the identity papers she must produce to check into 
a soviet hotel they took all my property and there is somebody 
living in my apartment already she said 
she said the police advised them to leave and said they have 
lost control of the city 
ambartsyum galstyan an armenian activist reached by telephone 
in yerevan said soldiers were advising armenians in villages along 
the border between the republics to evacuate leading them to fear 
that the government has decided to solve the ethnic violence by 
permanently separating the two populations 
vremya showed elderly armenian women being treated for 
injuries in yerevan and said 72 of the evacuees from baku were 
hospitalized including 20 in grave condition 
in tbilisi capital of neighboring georgia 3000 armenians 
rallied at the house of government to show support for their 
brothers in azerbaijan activist sergei dandurov said in a 
telephone interview protesters also shouted their support for 
independence for georgia and armenia

irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei said wednesday that islamic fervor was behind events in 
soviet azerbaijan and warned moscow not to deal harshly with the 
shiite moslem upsurge tehran radio reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted khamenei as saying 
anyone who thinks or pretends that the motives behind these 
movements are ethnic or nationalistic is making a big mistake 
these sentiments are islamic and soviet leaders should face this 
fact with realism 
official reports from soviet azerbaijan and armenia say at least 
58 people have been killed in violence over who should control of 
nagornokarabakh the region contains mostly christian armenians 
but has been part of predominantly moslem azerbaijan since 1923 
moscow on monday enforced a state of emergency in parts of both 
republics and sent in red army units and kgb troops to protect 
citizens from violence 
khamenei praised the admirable courage of soviet authorities 
in allowing free expression to islam but warned they should not 
through wrong analysis respond harshly and oppressively to these 
islamic sentiments 
the animosity between armenians and azerbaijanis flared into 
violence saturday when some azerbaijanis in baku went on the 
rampage against armenians living there 
the clashes were preceded by demonstrations in azerbaijan when 
hundreds of soviet moslems gathered on the bank of the aras river 
which forms part of the frontier with iran and demanded an open 
border and free trade with their kin on the other side 
the soviet azerbaijanis are bound by a common language culture 
and religion with their brethren across the frontier who 
constitute a third of irans 55 million people 
tehran radio reported more than 70 soviet moslems swam across 
the river for short visits with their iranian kin since the 
religious upsurge on dec 31 
the tehran government has said it welcomes soviet moslems who 
would like to visit iran and free trade across the border 
a soviet delegation is expected to visit iran soon to discuss 
tourist travel and trade between the iranian and soviet azerbaijans

ronald reagan in recent political elections and served as an 
adviser to president reagan on commissions dealing with central 
america 
to win a spot on the sept 18 primary ballot silber needs at

urban campus and with decisions such as a ban on overnight 
dormitory visitors of the opposite sex he frequently is at odds

plans by the university thomas 
jefferson founded that threatened to blot out a view of his home 
overlooking the blue ridge mountains were the wakeup call for 
preservationists a spokesman said wednesday 
the university of virginia announced this week that it has 
decided against putting an 11 million office complex near the 
entrance to the house the third president built it was the second 
time in about 10 years that a view of jeffersons home monticello 
had been threatened 
the complex would have blocked the view from those driving on a 
nearby road the house which sits on a hill on the outskirts of 
charlottesville can now be seen from some distance away the 
proposed complex would have been between the road and the house 
the setting of monticello was important to mr jefferson and 
its important to us said daniel p jordan executive director 
of the thomas jefferson memorial foundation which owns monticello 
and the surrounding 2000 acres that was the wakeup call and 
were concerned about protecting whats left 
what this thing has done is alert monticello to take care of 
its entrance said robert carter a foundation trustee 
the complex was to have housed the state department of forestry 
and some other offices it was not to have been part of the campus 
which is on the other side of town 
the foundation is trying to buy an easement from the university 
to provide permanent protection from future development jordan 
said other options include having the entrance designated a scenic 
parkway he said 
university spokesman william fishback said the school jefferson 
founded in 1819 is now considering half a dozen other sites 
from an economic development standpoint any community would 
be delighted to have a clean industry fishback said 
jordan said the foundation also is working with the trust for 
public land to develop a strategy to protect monticello that 
group helped protect mount vernon george washingtons home 
monticello is depicted on the back of the nickel 
about a decade ago there was an attempt to change a cemetery 
along the corridor jordan said they wanted to construct a 
mausoleum that would have been a replica of monticello that 
provoked a furor and was beaten back 
jordan hailed the universitys decision saying it was the 
right decision and best for everybody including the university 
its real important that our nation recognize that this was a 
tough decision for the university and we commend their willingness 
to reconsider and their decision to look elsewhere jordan said 
we think this shows sensitivity on their part on this issue

a judge wednesday threw out an 11 million 
claim by two fired telephone workers who contend their reputations 
were damaged when the company denied their accusations that it 
engaged in illegal wiretapping 
hamilton county common pleas judge fred cartolano ruled that 
leonard gates and robert draise both former cincinnati bell 
telephone co employees had not proved they were defamed by the 
company 
gates and draise claimed they set 1200 illegal wiretaps on 
telephones of criminal suspects reporters and public officials 
from 1972 to 1984 at the direction of company supervisors or police 
cincinnati bell denied the allegations and sued gates and draise 
for defamation the two fired workers countersued for 11 million 
a jury has been hearing the lawsuits since nov 20 the 
telephone companys suit against the pair is continuing 
the judge said he based his decision on several factors 
including gates and draises refusals to submit to polygraph 
tests the judge also said he found inconsistencies in their 
allegations about when some of the wiretaps took place 
cartolano also cited an opinion by us magistrate robert 
steinberg who said gates was not a credible witness steinberg 
presided over gates employment case against cincinnati bell which 
fired gates in 1986 
gates said steinbergs opinion should not have been considered 
since the case has been appealed to the 6th us circuit court of 
appeals 
the judge said gates and draise could be defined as public 
figures who sought out the media to press their claims of 
corruption at the phone company 
at this time youre subjected to a higher standard of proof 
cartolano said you must prove that the false statements were 
made with actual malice 
gates and draise who were acting as their own attorneys argued 
that they were not public figures and that the media sought them 
out 
i dont feel were public figures gates said we didnt 
ask to be sued we only countersued because they were suing us 
cartolano ruled after draise and gates rested their case against 
the phone company 
we are pleased with the judges decision to dismiss gates and 
draises claim cincinnati bell spokeswoman cyndy cantoni said 
well have further comment after the jury rules

west german chancellor helmut kohl said wednesday 
that the german people have no intention of reviving the national 
border issue because it could be divisive 
kohl has been criticized for refusing to call specifically for 
permanent confirmation of the current border between poland and 
east germany leading some to fear a reunited germany might seek to 
regain territory it ceded to poland after world war ii 
in a speech before the french institute of foreign relations 
kohl repeated his governments policy that the definitive 
establishment of the countrys borders can only come in a freely 
negotiated peace settlement involving all of germany 
but he said most germans do not want to raise the question of 
the countrys borders an issue that has arisen since poland and 
east germany shed their hardline governments last year and began 
instituting reform 
the germans and no one should doubt it have no intention 
of starting in tomorrows europe a discussion about frontiers that 
would necessarily compromise the order of european peace to which 
we all aspire together he said 
the germans want a durable reconciliation with their polish 
neighbors and for that the poles must equally have the certitude 
of living within sure frontiers he said 
kohl said this is why nobody wants to link reunification with 
the movement of existing borders borders which in a future europe 
of freedom are bound to lose their importance

state capitol in which agents posed as businessmen and dispensed 
cash for political favors 
in a ruling last week schwartz upheld 10 other counts covering 
extortion racketeering and money laundering allegations but put 
off a decision on the bribery charges 
the two counts stem from montoyas videotaped acceptance of a 
3000 check from an undercover fbi agent and a 500 contribution 
from a group of independent oil and natural gas producers 
schwartz said wednesday that contending that the 5000 
threshhold had been reached stretches the language of the law 
beyond a sensible reading 
montoya 50 took the stand for the first time tuesday and was 
crossexamined by prosecutors wednesday he has denied he demanded 
money in return for votes or political favors 
i never made that suggestion in any fashion shape or form 
the democrat said when asked by defense attorney michael sands if 
he had ever implied that he would drop a bill opposed by the 
national football league players association in exchange for 
financial support 
however montoya acknowledged he benefitted personally from some 
campaign fund expenditures including videotapes and investment 
newsletters 
he insisted that nearly all the expenditures were motivated 
primarily by legislative reasons politics never leave my 
personal life and my personal life never leaves politics he said 
prosecutors claim the legislator from the district east of los 
angeles put his vote and political influence up for sale in an 
attempt to become wealthy 
assistant us attorney john panneton questioned how the 
lawmaker spent his campaign funds and at one point recited the 
oath of office in which montoya promised to uphold the law 
it is illegal for state senators to spend campaign funds for 
personal use 
montoya acknowleged that among his campaign fund expenditures 
were 4300 he spent for clothing 
he also spent 20000 in campaign funds to help pass proposition 
73 one of two campaign reform measures passed by california voters 
in june 1988 among its provisions are restrictions on campaign 
contributions and honorariums 
montoya said he regarded the 3000 check from the undercover 
agent as a legal honorarium for going to breakfast with undercover 
agent george murray and senate staffer john shahabian who was 
acting as an fbi operative in federal agents 3year undercover 
probe of alleged capitol corruption

life in a quiet residential section of the city 
isnt the same since a nocturnal intruder snatched four sleeping 
girls from their homes 
officers patrol on foot homeowners use security systems even 
when theyre home and parents and school officials grapple with 
protecting children without traumatizing them 
since september four sleeping girls have been taken from their 
north dallas homes in the middle of night a man sexually assaulted 
three of them police say 
police say they believe the assailant has been spotted twice 
more prowling outside girls bedroom windows before being scared 
off by passersby 
the latest episode occurred a week ago when an intruder carried 
an 8yearold girl from her bedroom but dropped her outside the 
house unharmed after she screamed 
some neighborhood men have quit taking evening walks for fear 
people will suspect them other residents worry that someone will 
get shot accidentally as tensions rise 
some parents tell of changing the pink drapes in their 
daughters rooms to white to avoid tipping someone to the location 
of girls rooms 
the parents are really struggling with how to protect their 
children and at the same time keep from instilling fears in their 
children so that they cant sleep at night said lori 
messerschmidt who has coordinated counseling for families in the 
neighborhoods where the attacks occurred 
more than 500 parents from the middle to upperclass 
neighborhoods came to meetings tuesday at two schools to talk about 
the attacks with school officials and police 
in the exclusive bent tree west development where the latest 
attack occurred the homeowners association passed out fliers 
asking parents to take safety precautions locking doors watching 
their children using security systems even when theyre at home 
our neighborhood knows each other thats why it was so 
shocking said jane hood who lives in the development but i 
think everybody on our street is remembering to lock their doors 
police said wednesday they have no solid leads in the attacks 
the victims all elementary schoolage girls havent been able to 
give good descriptions although all say the attacker was a white 
man with dark hair police said 
investigators say some of the victims have been in heavily 
secured homes complete with elaborate alarm systems and fences 
but in at least the last attack an unlocked patio door provided 
the intruder an easy way in 
in each case a man has taken the children just outside the 
house and assaulted or tried to assault them there never taking 
them far 
its a daring offense said deputy police chief grant lappin 
police are talking to crime watch groups and at schools to make 
sure parents and children protect themselves theyve set up 
special surveillance units and a task force to work on nothing but 
the child snatchings 
officers patrol the areas on foot day and night and have woken 
up several residents in the middle of the night to tell them to 
lock their doors lappin said 
its our belief that despite the publicity that there are 
still some people in the area that are not aware of what is 
happening said police spokesman ed spencer some officers up 
there on foot patrol on sunday observed quite a few unlocked garage 
doors 
while parents want their children to be aware they worry about 
traumatizing them 
you have to choose your words carefully said meg sherard 
i have a 10yearold daughter and you have to be careful that 
you dont get the children so paranoid that they think someones 
going to break into the house and take them 
so ive maintained a lowkey approach but i pick them from 
school and i dont let them outside in the front yard she said 
and if theyre in the back fenced in im always in a place 
where i can see them

the top legislative aide to attorney general 
dick thornburgh said wednesday night she is resigning because she 
considers herself unsuited to be the justice departments 
spokeswoman on capitol hill 
assistant attorney general carol crawford blamed privately by 
department officials and legislative aides for an abrasive style 
that has hurt thornburgh on capitol hill said she told the 
attorney general last week of her plans to leave on feb 1 
there is no eloquent way of saying this this is not the right 
job for me ms crawford said in a telephoen interview the 
functions of this position are not really functions that i enjoy or 
i am particularly well suited for 
aides to members of congress who spoke on condition of 
anonymity have said ms crawford has alienated lawmakers by 
refusing requests for information and taking a confrontational 
stance on a number of issues 
one democratic aide said ms crawford antagonized house 
appropriations committee members by suggesting cuts in other 
departments notably at the commerce department so that the funds 
could be allocated to the justice department 
she was still wearing her omb hat said the aide referring 
to ms crawfords previous position as associate director at the 
office of management and budget a post she held for 3 years 
the office of legislative affairs was also faulted for refusing 
to honor the appropriations committees request that the fbi delay 
plans to scale back field offices in butte mont and savannah ga 
the department had customarily deferred to the committees 
objections to reprogramming money during a fiscal year 
but ms crawford informed congress last june that the two fbi 
offices would be scaled back despite objections from lawmakers 
the decision prompted congress to attach a rider to a 
supplemental appropriations bill that prohibited further 
reorganization at the justice department until the end of the 1989 
fiscal year 
the measure delayed until recently thornburghs plan to merge 14 
organized crime strike forces into us attorneys offices 
ms crawford expressd surprise that she was criticized for being 
antagonistic one of the functions of the person in ths position 
is to deny members of congress or staff information that they are 
not permitted to have she said 
i cant think of anybody ive had unpleasant relations with 
she said but noted that there is a natural tension between the 
justice departmen an the conress 
i am mostly a mouthpiece she said if they dont like 
something you are saying they are going to blame you but she 
said she had tried to improve relations with congress 
justice department spokesman david runkel said ms crawford 
brought on some talented people 
the office appears to be functioning well said runkel who 
declined to comment on criticism of ms crawfords performance 
ms crawford said her decision was not prompted by any pressure 
from thornburgh and she has no immediate plans for another job

nasa discouraged people 
wednesday from trying to watch fridays predawn landing of the 
space shuttle columbia after flooding from recent storms closed the 
public viewing area 
its going to be cold its going to be dark and you wont see 
a thing when columbia touches down at 255 am friday said 
spokeswoman nancy lovato of the national aeronautic and space 
administration 
i would sure advise people who want to see a shuttle landing 
to wait for a daylight landing 
recent storms dumped heavy rain and snow on southern california 
leaving standing water and mud on parts of rogers dry lake 
including the east shore where up to 500000 spectators have 
gathered on the normally hardpacked clay to watch shuttles land 
lovato said 
the dirt roads are impassable she said the air force 
decided to shut that site down 
people may go to the socalled hillside site near nasas 
facilities on this mojave desert military base but lovato said the 
site is 6 miles from concrete runway 22 where the shuttle will 
land at the very best spectators will briefly see the shuttle as 
it hurtles past the runway lights shuttles lack running lights so 
columbia will not be visible as it approaches 
columbias landing will end a 10day mission during which the 
shuttles crew launched a navy communications satellite and 
retrieved an 11ton science satellite for return to earth 
fridays landing will be only the second time a shuttle has set 
down in complete darkness it also will be the heaviest shuttle 
ever to land 
a national weather service snow advisory was in effect wednesday 
for portions of southern california above 2000 feet including 
edwards air force base but forecasters said the latest storm would 
leave the region thursday 
lovato said the forecast for columbias landing time calls for 
mostly clear skies with very light winds and possibly some 
scattered clouds at 5000 feet and broken clouds at 8000 feet 
temperatures were expected to be below freezing 
another storm front is expected friday afternoon or saturday 
lovato said

preparations have been completed for 
starting daily flights to tehran and opening the land borders with 
iran for visits by moslem pilgrims the government said wednesday 
the official iraqi news agency quoted an unidentified iraqi 
airways official as saying four jumbo jets were ready to leave for 
tehran to transport as many as 1500 iranian pilgrims daily to iraq 
as soon as iran agreed 
interior minister samir mohammed abdelwahab said in an 
interview with the magazine alef ba that the decision for the air 
and land links was based on a proposal by president saddam hussein 
last month 
saddam proposed new direct talks to revive the stalled peace 
negotiations with iran iraqs foe in an eightyear war that halted 
with a ceasefire in august 1988 saddam also proposed an exchange 
of prisoners of war the opening of air links between baghdad and 
tehran and visits by pilgrims to religious sites in both countries 
tehran which insists on talks under united nations auspices 
called the proposal a deception and said it fell short for not 
calling for an iraqi troop withdrawal from iranian territory 
captured during the iraniraq war 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said iranian foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati addressed a conference of iraqi opposition 
groups wednesday the conference closed with a resolution pledging 
to overthrow saddams government it said 
also wednesday 50 sick and disabled iraqi pows released by iran 
arrived in baghdad aboard a plane chartered by the international 
red cross 
akram alwitri a foreign ministry legal adviser said iraq 
would reciprocate by releasing 20 iranian sick and disabled 
prisoners on thursday 
there was no explanation why iraq would not release an equal 
number of prisoners 
the red cross has registered some 50000 prisoners held by iran 
and more than 19200 by iraq but united nations officials and 
diplomats estimate the two sides hold about 100000 pows between 
them 
the red cross secured an agreement to repatriate ailing 
prisoners immediately after a unsponsored ceasefire halted the 
persian gulf war on aug 20 1988 
but the deal collapsed after the exchange of only 400 disabled 
and wounded prisoners with both sides accusing each other of 
falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum 
unsponsored peace talks launched a few days after the 
ceasefire have been deadlocked mainly over the troop withdrawal 
issue and iraqs demand for the demarcation of the border to give 
it sovereignty over the shattalarab waterway its main outlet to 
the sea

the us government was so concerned about 
reaction to nbctvs drug wars miniseries that a top justice 
department official called mexicos attorney general the day after 
the first episode aired the attorney general said wednesday 
he asked me how i was taking it enrique alvarez del 
castillo told reporters laughing the attorney general said he had 
replied with a mexican profanity and added that he had appreciated 
the gesture 
the miniseries based on the death of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena in 1985 was broadcast jan 7 
8 and 9 it caused a controversy in mexico because of its graphic 
portrayal of corruption in the mexican legal system 
mexican officials thought it would deal a blow to president 
carlos salinas de gortaris efforts to change mexicos image while 
us officials feared mexican anger and hurt pride would inhibit 
relations especially in the fight against drug trafficking 
officials of both nations have insisted that is not happening 
and us officials have praised the salinas administration efforts 
to fight drug trafficking and corruption mexican officials are 
quick to point out that 36 tons of cocaine has been seized since 
salinas took office 13 months ago more than was seized the 
preceding 10 years combined 
drug kingpins rafael caro quintero and ernesto fonseca carrillo 
were sentenced in december to 40 years in prison without parole for 
the camarena killing 
alvarez who was governor of jalisco when camarena was kidnapped 
in the state capital guadalajara said he found the miniseries 
portrayal of mexican justice irritating but emphasized that it 
had not affected relations and that the governments were keeping 
things on an even keel 
as an example of the close usmexico relationship under 
salinas and bush alvarez said he had received a sympathetic 
telephone call he received from a top us drug enforcement 
official on behalf of us attorney general richard thornburgh 
the call came after the first episode of drug wars was 
broadcast in the united states and on mexico citys cable system 
alvarez said 
at a news conference alvarez said the government is 
interested in press reports that allege camarena was involved 
in drug trafficking himself but that it is not reopening the 
camarena investigation 
us officials have indignantly denied the reports which 
originated with a dispatch by the government news service notimex 
on tuesday alvarez had said there was no independent 
corroboration of the allegations which were repeated on a mexican 
television program that purported to point out falsehoods 
broadcast by nbc 
alvarez noted 26 others were convicted with caro quintero and 
fonseca and said he did not expect any more indictments 
at another news conference members of a us congressional 
delegation minimized the impact of the nbc miniseries 
it was just like a soap opera like lonesome dove dynasty 
or dallas and thats how people will regard it said kika de la 
garza dtexas who represents a border district 
but rep ronald d coleman dfla said the program properly 
did not gloss over problems within mexicos lawenforcement 
establishment 
for us to forget that you have bad guys here just like we have 
bad guys in the united states does a disservice to the many 
mexicans who have lost their lives fighting the drug problem and a 
disservice to the americans who have also lost their lives 
coleman said 
it overdramatized it it stretched the truth but the kernels 
of truth were there all of those people are real people and we 
cant forget that coleman added

in 1984 and 1985 up to a million people died of starvation in 
tigre and eritrea in 1987 and 1988 a huge international relief 
operation prevented a similar tragedy during another crop failure

or have been pledged said john riddle the aid press officer for 
egypt and africa

no shortage of food working out an agreement for delivery is the 
critical element left to be resolved

four opposition activists were 
arrested for aggression offenses and lack of respect regarding 
president daniel ortega as he was leaving a sandinista rally the 
interior ministry said wednesday 
an opposition candidate said police used tear gas tuesday night 
to break up the demonstration in granada nicaraguas second 
largest city 28 miles southeast of managua 
luis sanchez sancho a spokesman for the united national 
opposition coalition accused police of attacking a small rally the 
coalition was holding but conceded they had no permission to stage 
it 
julia mena 36 uno candidate for national assembly deputy for 
region 4 said about 1000 supporters had gathered for the rally on 
a street about three blocks from the hotel where ortega was to dine 
at about 6 pm riot police arrived and ordered the crowd to 
disperse but stayed about a halfblock away she said 
she said police then threw tear gas canisters to break up the 
gathering people dispersed and police withdrew at about 630 pm 
she said 
later i found out there were some people arrested she said 
the government identified those arrested as pedro rafael guzman 
roger rafael rocha alberto jose roman and pablo valencia mora 
the ruling sandinista national liberation front and uno are the 
main contenders in general elections scheduled for feb 25 
ortega is running for reelection against uno presidential 
candidate violeta barrios de chamorro publisher of the only 
opposition newspaper la prensa 
an interior ministry communique said ortega was leaving the 
sandinista rally for a dinner at a hotel about six blocks away when 
uno sympathizers started the disturbance 
the sandinista police exhausted its persuasive resources in 
order to make them desist from their aggressive attitude without 
result it said 
police were forced to proceed with energy to dissolve the 
provocateurs and detain the main instigators 
diplomatic sources who witnessed the incident blamed uno they 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
although its hard in such instances to say precisely who 
started it it was mostly a provocation by uno one said 
it was the first report of violence at a political gathering 
since a uno march on dec 10 turned into a riot between sandinista 
and uno activists in masatepe a small town south of managua 
that riot led to eight political parties signing a code of 
conduct on dec 15 that calls on party activists to respect 
political foes and avoid violence 
uno did not sign uno spokesman danilo lacayo said wednesday the 
bloc refused to sign the pact because sandinistas continue to 
intimidate opposition activists 
in washington two groups one republican one democratic 
which use us government funds to promote democracy overseas said 
the sandinista government may be intentionally blocking creation of 
programs to educate nicaraguas voters about democracy before the 
elections 
presidents j brian atwood of the national democratic institute 
and keith schuette of the national republican institute wrote to 
deputy foreign minister victor tinoco saying nicaragua put up 
bureaucratic roadblocks to their efforts

jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts 
in the mcmartin preschool molestation case said wednesday they are 
deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nations longest 
costliest criminal trial 
superior court judge william pounders received a note from the 
jurors as they ended their days deliberation and called a hearing 
for thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 
sealed verdicts 
in an interview wednesday evening pounders said he would deal 
with the deadlocked counts first either declaring a mistrial on 
those counts and reading the sealed verdicts or sending the jury 
back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts 
he said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury 
back however the judge noted that the attorneys are hopeful all 
the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts 
pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before 
quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further 
the jurors are deciding whether raymond buckey 31 and his 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 are guilty or innocent of 
charges they molested children at their familyowned mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach 
the jury that spent 2 years hearing evidence in the case have 
agreed on 52 verdicts they have all been sealed none of the 
verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by 
the jury 
jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations buckey and his 
mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one 
shared count of conspiracy 
one of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is 
the conspiracy charge which names both defendants 
jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict 
one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge but seemed 
perplexed after they received an explanation earlier wednesday 
after conferring with lawyers pounders told jurors they could 
convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that 
the defendant conspired with one or more other persons 
however he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged 
overt acts some of them naming only one defendant a split 
verdict he said would require elimination of overt acts alleged 
against a defendant acquitted of the charge 
it was at that point he said that some jurors began shaking 
their heads in confusion 
buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand 
trial after an 18month preliminary hearing five women teachers 
who worked at the mcmartin preschool had charges against them 
dismissed among those were buckeys sister peggy ann and his 
grandmother virginia mcmartin who founded the prestigious but now 
defunct nursery school 
on tuesday deliberations were halted at midday because a juror 
became ill on wednesday the talks did not begin until 1 pm 
because another jurors child was ill 
no alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that 
losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial

expected to reach as many as 100000 people this year 
the comments came in response to a statement tuesday by the 
senate minority leader bob dole who said a 5 percent cut to big 
aid recipients such as israel could free up money to support 
democracy efforts in poland and eastern europe 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the idea was 
well worth looking at triggering concern in israel 
the jewish state receives 3 billion a year in military and 
civilian assistance from the united states making it the largest 
american aid recipient 
vice premier shimon peres head of the leftofcenter labor 
party responded indignantly to doles remarks noting israel 
spends nearly a quarter of its budget on defense 
there is totally no justification to deal a blow to us instead 
of just dividing it up a little bit with the europeans peres 
told economists in jerusalem he called doles comments a very 
worrisome declaration 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said he too was worried 
over the idea of reduced us aid 
we and the united states enjoy strategic cooperation based on 
the assumption that a strong israel is a cause of stability in the 
middle east as long as this is the basis i hope very much that 
the united states would not cut its military and economic aid 
shomron said on israel television 
other leaders said the talk of cutting aid seemed to be an 
attempt to persuade rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir to 
bend on his refusal to involve the plo in peace talks the issue 
has long delayed progress on middle east peace efforts 
i have no doubt that the remarks by dole are serious and 
that if there will be no political progress then this mood could 
yield tough consequences such as aid cuts communications 
minister gad yaacobi of labor said 
but he said such a move would be a mistake 
by past experience we know that israels reaction to such 
steps is a hardening of its positions he said i am worried 
this will be counterproductive 
israel often digs in its heels in response to outside threats 
including criticism from allies such as the united states 
we understand the new needs of the us in east european 
countries the new developments but these developments also affect 
us deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu told parliament 
finance officials noted that inflation has eroded us aid by 
about 40 percent in the last decade and that much of a 18 billion 
package in civilian aid was going toward debt repayment to the 
united states 
any major cut in aid is going to create a very tough situation 
for us because we are already pushing our budget to the limit 
said david naveh director of the finance ministrys international 
division and investment authority 
netanyahu also told reporters a strong israel is a secure 
israel and one that is more able to progress along the course of 
peace this is something i think is in the interest of american 
policy as well and i would hope very much that all sides of the 
equation be taken into account 
netanyahu noted that less us aid could hurt efforts to house 
feed and make jobs for thousands of new soviet immigrants hundreds 
of newcomers have been arriving on a daily basis 
we understand the new needs of the usin east european 
countries the new developments but these developments also affect 
us netanyahu said its a very difficult time we have a great 
migration and defense needs 
the government is trying to raise 1 billion immediately for the 
immigrants hoping the united states will provide about half the 
sum and the rest will come from american and european jewry

a federal judge on wednesday scheduled manuel 
noriegas drug trafficking trial to begin in early march after 
attorneys for the deposed dictators codefendants demanded a 
speedy trial 
but us district judge william m hoeveler noted that the trial 
on charges brought in a february 1988 indictment in miami would be 
complex and expressed strong doubts it would actually start that 
soon 
the trial date was set shortly after noriega issued a statement 
denying prosecution claims that one of his codefendants luis del 
cid headed panamas intelligence agency or served as his 
righthand man 
hoeveler set the trial for the week of march 5 after he 
continued the bond hearing for del cid to give his defense more 
time to respond to new allegations by prosecutors 
we will set the date for that week hoeveler said but of 
course there will be further motions and we will just have to see 
what will happen 
del cids attorney samuel burstyn reminded the judge that he 
has yet to rule on motions calling for separate trials for del cid 
and several other codefendants 
outside the courtroom noriega attorneys steven kollin and frank 
rubino refused to comment when asked whether they would be ready 
to conduct their clients defense in court by the first week in 
march 
sam wants to try his case was rubinos only comment 
del cid 46 has pleaded innocent to charges of collecting bribe 
money and acting as a liaison between noriega and drug traffickers 
who allegedly used panama as a conduit for drug shipments to the 
united states he faces 70 years in prison and 550000 in fines if 
convicted on all counts 
also wednesday another panamanian codefendant named along with 
noriega in a federal indictment in tampa surrendered to fbi agents 
in panama and was extradited to the united states 
enrique pretelt 47 charged with trying to smuggle more than 1 
million pounds of marijuana to the united states was being held in 
florida on wednesday night and was scheduled to make an apperance 
in a tampa courtroom thursday said justice department spokesman 
michael w robinson in washington 
during wednesdays bond hearing in miami burstyn read noriegas 
statement on del cid who surrendered and was taken into custody on 
drug charges after the us invasion of panama last month 
burstyn said prosecutors who have called del cid one of 
noriegas righthand men were using his supposed status as an 
intelligence director to argue he should not be given bond 
burstyn told the judge that prosecutors had erred and pulled 
out noriegas statement 
at no time was lt col del cid the head of g2 or 
intelligence at no time was he my personal secretary or attache 
the document read in part 
previously burstyn has pointed to what he calls discrepancies 
in the february 1988 indictment against noriega and del cid saying 
they undercut the reliability of the witnesses responsible for much 
of the evidence considered by the grand jury 
rubino said both he and kollin were present when the statement 
was taken in a courthouse jail cell 
later wednesday hoeveler delayed his ruling on del cids bond 
for a second time giving defense attorneys 10 days to respond to 
evidence raised tuesday by assistant us attorney myles malman 
hoeveler set no date to recovene the hearing and del cid 
remained jailed at the federal metropolitan correctional center 
south of miami without bond

religious items sold by television evangelists 
through the mail or at crusade appearances may be taxed by states 
just like any other merchandise the supreme court ruled wednesday 
the court said such taxes do not violate religious freedom and 
unanimously upheld lower court rulings that forced the 
louisianabased jimmy swaggart ministries to pay 183000 in back 
taxes to california 
now we have the real threat of intrustion of government into 
the religious ministry of churches and synagogues swaggart said 
in baton rouge reading from a prepared statement a few hours after 
the ruling 
the immediate impact of this decision on jimmy swaggart 
ministries will not be disastrous because we have been in this 
battle for 10 years and have prepared for the consequences 
swaggart said most churches probably have not prepared for it 
most states tax the proceeds of at least some mail order sales 
to their residents but california and virginia appear to be the 
only states that do not exempt religious organizations 
other states searching for additional tax revenues now could 
follow californias lead 
californias nondiscriminatory sales and use tax law 
imposes no constitutionally significant burden on swaggarts 
religious practices or beliefs justice sandra day oconnor wrote 
for the court 
the tax at issue was imposed on the sales of religious books 
tapes and other merchandise sold by swaggarts organization from 
1974 through 1981 
swaggart did not challenge californias taxing tshirts mugs 
bowls and crownofthorns replicas sold by his ministry 
mailorder sales from swaggarts base in baton rouge la to 
california consumers during those years totaled 17 million sales 
of merchandise at california crusades totaled 240000 
swaggarts challenge of the tax had been supported by an array 
of religious groups from hare krishnas to mainline protestants 
lawyers for the national council of churches representing most 
protestant denominations called the california tax a serious 
threat a tax on the dissemination of religious messages and 
thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion 
backing californias authority to impose such a tax were two 
organizations not usually allied in court the american civil 
liberties union and the national conference of state legislatures 
swaggarts lawyers had relied heavily on a 1943 high court 
ruling that overturned the convictions of jehovahs witnesses who 
violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in 
doortodoor canvassing to get licenses and pay fees 
the jehovahs witnesses were distributing religious literature 
and the 1943 ruling said this form of religious activity 
occupies the same high estate under the first amendment as do 
worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits 
but wednesdays decision drew a distinction between those fees 
and the california tax 
our concern in the 1943 ruling that a flat license tax would 
act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is 
simply not present where a tax applies to all sales and uses of 
tangible personal property in the state oconnor wrote 
the justices also rejected swaggarts argument that the tax 
fosters a constitutionally impermissible excessive entanglement 
between church and state 
under a 1967 supreme court ruling mail order businesses are 
exempt from a states taxes if they do no more than ship orders 
there but they can be taxed by that state if they have stores 
outlets or certain other business contacts there 
the justices citing a procedural flaw did not rule on 
swaggarts arguments that the 1967 ruling should shield his 
organization from the california tax 
swaggart is free to raise that argument if he challenges his 
california tax bill for any other year than the eight covered by 
wednesdays ruling 
in two other unanimous decisions the court 
ruled that a new jersey corporation accused by a competitor of 
bribing nigerian government officials to win a contract in that 
country may be sued in us courts 
said a denver union official convicted of embezzling may not be 
forced to repay the union from his own pension benefits

china on wednesday further hardened its line 
toward hong kong by deciding that top officials in the post1997 
government could not possess the right to live abroad hong kong 
government radio said 
a top chinese official also announced that hong kong civil 
servants with british passports would not be allowed to seek 
british consular protection while in the territory after it returns 
to chinese rule in seven years 
local newspapers quoted lu ping deputy secretarygeneral of the 
basic law drafting committee which is writing hong kongs 
post1997 blueprint as saying civil servants would not be allowed 
to renounce their chinese citizenship 
in london the british foreign office said it was seeking 
clarification of the announcement 
the announcements threw into doubt a british plan to offer 
passports to 50000 key hong kong professionals and officials 
including civil servants 
the passports were being offered as a security net for hong kong 
residents confidence in chinas promise to retain hong kongs 
freewheeling economic system for 50 years evaporated after the 
bloody june 4 crackdown on a movement for democracy in beijing 
the moves marked new restrictions on the territorys future 
political system last month china outlawed subversive groups 
from operating in the territory after 1997 
the basic law drafting committee decided in canton that the 
territorys chief executive its principal officers and all its 
executive councilors could not possess the right of abode in 
another country 
government radio said the committee still must decide whether to 
ban the territorys two top judges and all its legislators from 
possessing the right to live abroad 
under the basic law hong kongs top officials are already 
prohibited from holding a foreign passport the move by the 
committee thus marked a further restriction on politicians 
activities prohibiting them from holding for example a us 
green card or a residence permit for canada or britain 
britain has said it hopes the passport package will boost 
confidence by encouraging key residents to stay in the territory by 
giving them a last resort 
but china says the package violates the 1984 agreement under 
which britain will hand the colony back to china 
lu said the british consulate in hong kong would be prohibited 
from helping hong kong civil servants with british passports after 
1997 
he said that without the right of abode in britain hong kongs 
people would settle in hong kong 
now you britain grant them right of abode so just in case 
they commit corruption offenses or get into trouble they can flee 
hong kong lu said 
lus statement directly contradicted assurances made tuesday by 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd who said all hong kong 
residents with british passports would be granted consular 
protection 
china does not recognize dual nationals 
the committee is expected to finish drafting the basic law in 
four days then it will go to chinas parliament the national 
peoples congress for a largely ceremonial vote in march 
still to be decided are questions concerning the percentage of 
hong kongs 60 legislators to be directly elected after the 1997 
transfer of power china has said the maximum will be around 30 
percent but hong kong politicians want at least 50 percent to be 
voted in 
currently no legislators are directly elected

when republican national chairman lee atwater 
and his strategy team look at the abortion issue they see a loser 
so they are urging gop candidates to deal with it early in the 
campaign year and try to put the subject to rest 
they figure that in 1990 state or congressional campaigns in 
which abortion becomes the dominant issue in the final weeks before 
the nov 6 elections republican candidates who campaign against 
abortion rights probably will be defeated 
thats an ironic judgment in a party pledged by platform to 
oppose abortion and led by a president who enforced his own 
opposition with three vetoes late last year despite those 
positions president bush and atwater both maintain there is plenty 
of republican room for abortion rights advocates 
those crosscurrents are likely to come up at republican national 
committee meetings today and friday with antiabortion republicans 
pressing to put the party out front on their issue 
the numbers would indicate there is more mileage in atwaters 
pragmatic approach to the abortion issue 
the abortion rights argument clearly worked to democratic 
advantage in the handful of 1989 elections notably in the election 
of virginia gov l douglas wilder this year with the house 34 
senate seats and 36 governorships to be filled the gop problem 
could worsen 
pollsters peter hart a democrat and robert teeter a bush 
republican see the issue as one that could offer an important 
opening to the democrats in 1990 
in a poll they conducted for nbc news and the wall street 
journal voters said they would prefer abortion rights candidates 
by a margin of nearly two to one that survey conducted in 
november showed that in a contest between a candidate favoring 
womens right to an abortion and a candidate who wanted to ban most 
abortions 48 percent would be more likely to vote for the 
prochoice candidate twentyfive percent said they would more 
likely vote for the antiabortion candidate the rest said they 
would base the choice on other issues or werent sure 
people who identified themselves as republicans leaned that way 
39 percent to 33 percent 
asked which party could better deal with the abortion issue 
voters said democrats 29 percent to 21 percent 
bush used vetoes to block two appropriations bills that would 
have provided government funds to pay for abortions for poor women 
pregnant because of rape or incest the poll indicated that voters 
disagree 
it showed 75 percent favored public funding of such abortions 
20 percent opposed 
atwater says he is advising candidates to be clear concise and 
quick in spelling out their abortion views having done so he 
says they should stand firm on that position and move on to other 
issues 
so i tell candidates stake your position out loudly and 
clearly dont back off and the second piece of advice im giving 
them is you define your position dont let your opponent define 
your position for you 
atwater and other party leaders maintain that the voters will 
accept differences and vote for a candidate anyhow on other 
issues but that they dont like politicians who waffle or shift 
sides 
perhaps 
but thres a lot of shuffling and shifting going on among 
politicians in both parties as the campaign year begins 
and the issue is not likely to be pushed off or even down the 
agenda by candidate efforts to get it out of the way early it is 
too emotional and it has been recharged by the 1989 supreme court 
decision empowering states to impose some restrictions on abortion 
in most states legislatures are meeting for the first time since 
that ruling 
all of that points to an escalating debate in the 1990 campaign 
that is not promising for a gop effort to settle the issue early 
and put it aside

which statement best describes the state of the 
economy a were in a recession b inflation remains a serious 
threat c stagflation is here d all of the above 
the answer depends on where you live or work many experts 
maintain 
its a very difficult economy to analyze says irwin l 
kellner chief economist at manufacturers hanover trust co in new 
york whether youre in a recession or have to worry about 
inflation has to do with a lot of different things 
he points out for example that the manufacturing sector which 
includes the nations automakers easily could be described as 
suffering a recession or a period of declining business activity 
the financial services and defense industries also appear to be in 
trouble 
the service sector on the other hand continues to show growth 
energy production and agriculture have picked up too but housing 
remains a tossup from region to region kellner says 
where does this leave the average person trying to decide how to 
invest or borrow a bit confused 
investment advisers urge consumers to ignore every little 
economic blip and focus on longterm goals 
too many investors in america are looking at the one or 
twoyear window they need to look at the five to 15year 
potential for growth says denver money manager scott l shires 
if you can work your way through the soothsayers youll do well 
in bluechips stocks and quality residential property 
robert k heady publisher of bank rate monitor a north palm 
beach fla publication that tracks interest rates among banks and 
thrifts agrees each time an economic number comes out its the 
heart attack of the hour 
for instance recent worries about inflation due partly to 
reports showing a jump in food and energy prices have pushed up 
interest rates in the bond market even as consumers and business 
were digesting a jan 8 drop in the prime lending rate the 
inflation news helped to temporarily lift some consumer mortgage 
rates 
the rates had been on the decline amid concerns the nation might 
be falling into a recession the federal reserve had been loosening 
credit policies to prevent that from happening 
economists say both conditions when combined produce 
stagflation a period when prices continue to rise even as the 
economy weakens 
some newspapers have used recession inflation and stagflation 
in their headlines all in the same week complains heady 
for the shortterm investor money market accounts are probably 
the safest bet these days investment advisers say 
even though interest rates have been declining since last spring 
because of an overall economic downturn rates on these accounts 
have fallen the least among savings vehicles 
the banks are trying to attract volatile money in a period 
where people are unsure of where interest rates are going heady 
says 
the average yield on a money market account last week was 633 
percent down only 029 percentage point from april 26 bank rate 
monitor says 
rates on bank certificates of deposits fell about 15 percentage 
points during the same period the average rate on a oneyear cd 
was 793 percent last week down from 951 percent in april while 
the rate on a fiveyear cd fell 129 percentage points to 791 
percent 
investment advisers say those considering a cd might do better 
locking in a rate now than waiting since most economists expect 
rates to continue dropping for awhile 
heady says he expects cd rates to drop between 030 and 040 
percent point in the next eight weeks alone in continued response 
to the jan 8 prime rate cut to 10 percent from 105 percent the 
prime was also cut a half percentage point in july 
for borrowers rates havent fallen as much as those on savings 
accounts new car bank loans fell only 042 percent to 1212 
percent from the end of april to last week and heady expects the 
decline in response to the primerate cut will be between 010 to 
015 percentage point in the next eight weeks 
personal loan rates actually rose to an average 1716 percent 
from 1699 percent as did rates on credit cards to 1865 percent 
from 1809 percent bank rate monitor says 
while mortgage rates have remained below 10 percent for several 
months some analysts predict they could rise this spring as the 
homebuying season comes into full swing 
the average rate on a 30year conventional mortgage was 990 
percent last week down 002 percentage point from the previous 
week says hsh associates a butler nj publication that tracks 
mortgage rates

from a rustic suburban house 
with a yard full of overgrown weeds five dogs and a rusting pickup 
truck the man who would be king of albania plots a return to the 
homeland he scarcely knows 
king leka i an exile for all of his 50 years believes the 
rapid political reforms in eastern europe will light a fire in 
longisolated albania the last hardline stalinist state in the 
region 
if a revolution comes leka said in an interview he would be 
proud to follow the footsteps of his father the selfmade monarch 
king zog i 
if the people dont want a king hed settle for the chance to 
return to the country he left in 1939 when he was 3 days old to 
escape invading italian troops during world war ii 
my only home is albania said leka who has lived in seven 
countries and speaks eight languages but ive learned to feel at 
home wherever i have my family and my dogs 
hes 6feet8inches tall with glasses and a full head of 
graying hair for a meeting at his home he wears a pistol and a 
combat knife in his holster and his militarystyle shirt has an 
albanian crest pinned on his collar 
leka in a statement issued in december called on albanians 
inside and outside the country to rise up acting in unity and 
cohesion against the tyrannical and atheist regime that has for so 
long misruled our beloved homeland 
he said the message has been broadcast to albania from radio 
stations in yugoslavias adjacent kosovo region and also has been 
reported on radio moscow and the voice of america 
albanias communist party chief ramiz alia says he will resist 
reforms in the rigidly controlled nation the poorest and most 
rural in europe the country has been largely cut off from the 
outside world since the communists came to power in 1946 under 
enver hoxha who ruled until his death in 1985 
the communist party daily newspaper zeri i populit recently 
accused albanian exiles of trying to foment an uprising that would 
bring leka to power yugoslav newspapers have published reports of 
unrest in albania which have not been confirmed and which the 
albanian government has denied 
leka said that more than four decades of repressive rule will 
make it difficult to mobilize opposition forces but he and his 
supporters have offices in france and elsewhere in europe and 
maintain clandestine contacts with government and military figures 
disgruntled with the communist leadership he said 
because albania is such a closed society no accurate measure of 
lekas support within the country can be made but he believes he 
could serve as a unifying force among albanians opposed to 
communist rule and is confident of his stature despite his familys 
long absence 
but for now leka can do little more than wait 
leka and his australianborn wife susan left spain in 1979 
when communist states put pressure on the madrid government leka 
claims the communist governments acted on behalf of albania because 
he had been building strong support inside and outside his homeland 
a year later the couple rented a ranchstyle house at the end 
of a dirt road here in the far northern suburbs of johannesburg 
intending to stay only six months 
during his exile lekas backers have included the late 
president anwar sadat of egypt the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
of iran saudi arabias king faisal and belgiums king baudouin he 
honored their support in naming his 8yearold son the crown 
prince leka anwar zog reza baudouin 
he has used his contacts to support himself as a businessman 
exporting minerals and heavy machinery to the middle and far east 
he also travels extensively to maintain contacts with the estimated 
3 million ethnic albanians who live outside the countrys borders 
a number almost equal to those inside 
it has been difficult to wear several different hats to try 
to be a businessman and lead a normal family life and to head an 
opposition movement said leka 
lekas father the head of an albanian clan became albanias 
prime minister in 1922 when he was still in his 20s 
in 1928 the national assembly gave him a title that translated 
into prince according to burkes royal families of london 
however zog proclaimed himself his majesty king zog i and the 
constitution called for his son to succeed him 
zog died in france in 1961 and leka was sworn in by the 
governmentinexile 
i am the king in exile and i believe one day i will return 
said leka

soviet dissident natan sharansky languished nine 
years in the gulags for speaking his mind now hes getting paid to 
talk 
jailed in 1977 on charges of spying after speaking out on human 
rights and easier emigration for soviet jews sharansky focuses on 
the crumbling of communism and the decline of the soviet empire in 
a us lecture tour 
but rather than lionizing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as a 
champion of democracy sharansky credits comrades who were 
imprisoned for their beliefs 
if the dissidents didnt struggle 20 years ago we could never 
celebrate what were celebrating now the dissidents and their 
supporters in the west are the midwives of glasnost and 
perestroika the 41yearold author said in an interview 
millions of people are freely expressing their beliefs there 
is such a hole in this iron wall that nobody can ever rebuild it 
again there is no question communist ideology has failed 
sharansky recounted the horrors of soviet prisons in his 1988 
book fear no evil published by random house he plans about 
10 paid lectures a year to talk about soviet restructuring under a 
contract with the harry walker agency of new york a speakers 
bureau he launched the tour on jan 16 at the university of 
california at davis and made stops in santa barbara calif and 
toronto he is to appear in new orleans on tuesday other cities on 
the tour will be announced later in the year 
for sharansky the breakdown of the old order in the soviet bloc 
was the most exciting moment since his release from prison after 
nine years of a 13year sentence for spying a charge that he and 
the united states have denied 
we dissidents had such deep beliefs in our hearts that sooner 
or later this system had to become bankrupt morally socially 
economically and politically nobody could expect it to go so 
quickly he said 
gorbachev is a loyal communist his aim was to save the 
communist system by changing it he deserves credit for one thing 
he was the first soviet leader to say that communism would lose to 
capitalism if urgent changes werent made in the economy 
he had to decide between saving the economy or saving the 
empire there is no way to save both of them he let eastern europe 
go its own way but i dont think he had a choice 
sharansky also noted there are dissidents still in soviet 
prisons who were jailed for saying the same things as gorbachev 
now living in israel with his wife and two daughters sharansky 
is amazed at the speed of change a stark contrast to the tedious 
days in prisons when he played mental games of chess or sang hebrew 
songs on the cold concrete floor of his punishment cell 
i told my wife that by the time our youngest daughter grew one 
tooth two more dictators in eastern europe had fallen down said 
sharansky looking relaxed in a sweater and opencollared blue 
shirt 
sharansky asked to leave the soviet union in 1974 he was 
detained although his wife avital was allowed to leave a day 
after they were married 
she worked tirelessly for his release after he was sentenced to 
prison camps even meeting with president reagan to plead her 
husbands case reagan and gorbachev arranged for his release at a 
summit meeting and sharansky passed to freedom in a prisoner 
exchange on a frozen feb 11 1986 
he crossed glienicke bridge through a section of the berlin 
wall and he rejoiced when the wall opened last november 
the events of the last year were the realization of our 
wildest dreams he said for me the wall opened for a moment 
and then it closed now its falling apart 
he was a comrade of soviet dissident and nobel prizewinning 
physicist andrei sakharov but was denied permission to visit the 
soviet union for sakharovs funeral in december 
sharansky who has a street marker near the united nations named 
after him now works for immigrant absorption in israel he dropped 
his soviet name anatoly to use his hebrew name natan in 1986 
as chairman of the soviet jewry zionist forum he helps soviet 
jews find housing and jobs in december his group received a 20 
million gift from a billionaire american banker to assist in 
resettlement 
we are seeing the biggest exodus of jews in modern history 
they are afraid to stay in the soviet union because of 
antisemitism its absolutely inevitable this exodus will 
continue sharansky said there is practically no place for 
jews in the soviet union in the future

junon and avos the first soviet rock opera 
has come to new york with the original cast and new optimism 
in the concluding scene the narrator tells the audience that 
the operas russian hero and his californian lover tried to bridge 
the distance between the two countries with love the entire cast 
of 60 then sings hallelujah with such abandon that the plots 
tragic finish is all but forgotten 
eight years ago when we sang hallelujah about a 
sovietamerican love affair it was virtually an act of sedition 
yelena shanina the lead female singer recalls of the early days 
of the production now its celebrating a new beginning 
even the name of the opera has changed with the times to the 
orginial title junon and avos producers lucy jarvis and 
pierre cardin have attached a subtitle the hope 
whether the good feelings and exotic music will succeed in 
filling new yorks city center theater for a fiveweek run is still 
uncertain a spokesman said ticket sales were slow before the jan 
5 opening but have picked up since the first reviews favorable 
though not ecstatic appeared 
regardless of whether the 2 million production is a commercial 
success its arrival represents the culmination of an extraordinary 
political journey 
when it somehow squeaked past the censors in 1981 the opera 
caused a sensation in moscow though set in 1806 it contained a 
thinly disguised caricature of soviet leader leonid brezhnev as a 
doddering old man with a chest full of medals and a gold mask with 
huge eyebrows 
that alone might have ensured a throng of soviet theatergoers 
but andrei vosnesensky a leading soviet poet added two other 
politically daring elements in his libretto one was a reverent 
treatment of religious symbols including words from the russian 
orthodox mass 
the other was an implied message that the soviet union shared 
the blame for an impasse in relations with the united states that 
message was expressed through the story of count nikolai rezanov 
who courageously sails off to explore trading links with california 
then a spanish colony and falls in love with the governors 
daughter 
junon and avos named for rezanovs two ships ends in 
tragedy as politics and illness foil rezanovs mission and separate 
him from his lover the beautiful conchita she waits 35 years for 
his return then enters a convent when she learns he died before 
obtaining the czars permission to marry her 
vosnesensky says the plot is loosely based on historical truth 
there was indeed a count rezanov who helped found the 
russianamerican trading co traveled to california in 1806 and 
died in siberia on his way home 
but the rest of the story is pure fiction vosnesensky now 
acknowledges that he conceived it following the outline of his 
earlier poem avos as a metaphor for the strained 
sovietamerican relations of the brezhnev era 
my hero historical count rezanov was not a great fighter for 
freedom but i have put in his mouth all the words of our 
intellectuals vosnesensky said in an interview 
when he says the russian empire is a prison our audiences 
understood what i was saying now its ok just to say it but in 
1981 it wasnt ok so i put the words in rezanovs mouth and it 
worked 
it didnt work right away however vosnesensky and director 
marc zakharov repeatedly modified the opera in an effort to gain 
permission for it to open at moscows lenin komsomol theater after 
the authorities had rebuffed them for the second or third time 
vosnesensky recalls he began to despair 
i was worried but zakharov said to me there is one more 
person i know who can help us so i didnt ask questions i got in 
his car we went to the main cathedral of moscow and we lit 
candles to the virgin mary 
i dont know whether maybe zakharov called someone else that 
night but the next morning junon and avos was allowed 
timothy ryback a harvard university researcher who has written 
a book about rock n roll in eastern europe and the soviet union 
says that despite official condemnation rock music had developed a 
huge following in russia by the end of the 1960s nevertheless 
junon and avos is believed to have been the first full rock 
opera to receive a public staging in the soviet union 
cardin the french fashion designer who has set up clothing 
factories in the soviet union heard about the show and asked to 
see it while on a threeday business trip to moscow in 1982 it was 
not playing that weekend and the komsomol theater was busy with 
another show 
so the ministry of culture eager to please the famous designer 
and perhaps secure business links with his fashion empire moved 
the entire set and company to a vacant theater 25 miles outside 
moscow there the ministry staged a command performance on little 
more than a days notice much to cardins embarassment he said 
enraptured by the music an eclectic mix of folk melodies 
thumping electric guitars and gregorian chants arranged by 
contemporary composer alexei ribnikov cardin decided on the spot 
to try to bring the show to his paris theater espace cardin 
soviet cultural officials tried to persuade him to take the 
bolshoi ballet or the moscow circus instead but he held firm and 
eventually got his wish after appealing to brezhnevs successor 
yuri andropov 
i say i want to make something young for the young people 
cardin recalled i tell them the bolshoi that is from before the 
revolution 
then just a few days before the shows paris opening in 
september 1983 a soviet fighter pilot shot down korean air lines 
flight 007 with 269 people aboard after it apparently strayed 
into soviet air space over the sea of japan suddenly cardin began 
to worry about bombings and security 
my friends say to me pierre you cannot do this opera now 
because if you do that your theater poof bomb people were so 
mad but i say i make this only for talent for respect for the 
russia i am not a politician cardin said 
although the paris production went off without a hitch cardin 
hesitated bringing junon and avos to the united states until 
superpower relations began to improve under soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
the arrangements in new york were made by jarvis a new york 
television and theatrical producer who took the broadway musical 
sophisticated ladies on a sevenweek tour of the soviet union 
in 1988 she and cardin say the production might travel to san 
francisco and japan 
i am not a politician said cardin but maybe with art 
you can build something stronger than with politics

faced with complaints that arbitration is biased 
against small investors wall street officials have agreed to 
consider establishing a unified system to resolve disputes between 
stockbrokers and their customers 
the proposal made by the securities industry association would 
remove arbitration from control of the nations stock exchanges and 
other selfregulatory organizations to a single industrywide body 
i dont think it would be detrimental to take a look at 
whether it could be feasible said john katovich general counsel 
of the pacific stock exchange were certainly aware of some of 
the criticisms that have been made of the system 
arbitration has come under increased scrutiny following a 
supreme court decision last may upholding the constitutionality of 
contracts requiring brokerage customers to settle disputes in 
arbitration rather than in court 
plaintiffs lawyers claim the current system is biased against 
investors because it is run by the stock exchanges and the national 
association of securities dealers and because arbitration panels 
contain at least one industry representative 
meeting tuesday in san francisco the securities industry 
conference on arbitration endorsed studying the plan to set up a 
unified arbitration system or any other alternative to the current 
structure 
the group said the study should focus on the costs of 
arbitration funding legal status and government oversight of any 
program katovich said 
katovich said the study likely would be conducted by the 
securities industry association whose president edward i 
obrien initially made the proposal last month no timetable for 
the study was set 
arbitration panels typically are composed of two independent 
arbitrators and one from the securities industry unlike 
litigation arbitration is not governed by complex rules of 
evidence and panels make their decisions based on the facts 
presented 
proponents say arbitration is quicker and faster than litigation 
and investors do just as well as they would in recovering losses in 
court opponents say the process is skewed in favor of the industry 
and investors appeal rights are limited 
theres a reluctance in industry people to do anything that is 
going to cause them to be criticized by anyone else in the 
industry said william f davis a los angeles lawyer who handles 
arbitration cases 
the exchanges though they are public are basically composed 
of people in the industry he said theres a builtin bias 
there 
with several major court rulings and the stock markets 1987 
crash the number of arbitration cases soared in the 1980s a total 
of 6100 cases were filed in 1988 compared with just 830 in 1980 
investors won 48 percent of the 1561 cases decided in 1988 in 
an independent study of about 100 cases decided in a threemonth 
period last year plaintiffs recovered about half of their total 
alleged losses 
the nasd and the new york stock exchange handle more than 90 
percent of the cases the american stock exchange boston stock 
exchange chicago board options exchange midwest stock exchange 
municipal securities rulemaking board pacific stock exchange and 
philadelphia stock exchange also run arbitration programs 
obrien has said that setting up a single arbitration system 
would reduce costs to the exchanges and the securities firms that 
finance the selfregulatory organizations he said the industry 
spends 12 million to 15 million a year on arbitration 
he also has said that a unified system within the industry would 
eliminate disparities in the quality of arbitrators 
katovich said the arbitration group also would consider any 
other possible alternatives for instance wall street could decide 
to remove the process from industry control entirely to an 
organization such as the american arbitration association or set up 
an independent regulatory organization 
the securities and exchange commission last year approved a 
series of reforms designed to address some of the complaints it 
required the exchanges to publicize awards in specific cases and 
required brokerage to highlight arbitration agreements in customer 
contracts 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee of energy and finance 
committee last year introduced legislation that would ban 
predispute arbitration agreements altogether

growing role of the companys consumer business and the need to 
split the sophisticated corporate finance business that 
characterizes citicorp operations in europe north america japan 
and australia from its more traditional international business in 
developing nations 
some banking analysts said they werent sure why citicorp 
decided to fill the vacancy left by spencer although they praised 
braddocks appointment 
rick braddock is one of the best in the business he has a 
long range of experience especially on the marketing side of 
banking said james j mcdermott jr of keefe bruyette amp woods 
in new york its not surprising he was named president

car and truck sales jumped 27 percent in the 
first 10 days of this year prompting us automakers to say their 
recipe for success works increase incentives 
but one industry analyst called the figures misleading because 
they are being compared to a yearago period when sales were weak 
on tuesday the eight major companies with us assembly plants 
said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily rate of 32539 
during jan 110 compared with a 25629aday pace during the same 
period in 1989 
car sales rose 298 percent in early january and truck sales 
rose 228 percent 
the increased sales come against a backdrop of decreased 
production general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp 
together have part or all of 13 assembly plants idled this week to 
slow the flow of cars into dealerships 
my supply of vehicles has dwindled substantially said sales 
manager bill griffith of hayes chrysler plymouth and dodge in 
lawrenceville ga near atlanta 
chryslers car sales rose 144 percent in early january while 
the companys truck sales which include minivans jumped 437 
percent 
griffith said he has noticed an increase both in sales and in 
the number of people entering his showroom the most popular 
vehicles are the minivans griffith said 
the solid increases in sales are the direct result of the 
guaranteed rebates said james p holden of chryslers sales and 
marketing division 
he referred to the no 3 automakers pledge that if it increases 
its rebates later this year customers who buy using the current 
incentives will receive a check for the difference 
analyst mary ann sudol of fitch investors service inc of new 
york agreed saying incentives that started in december on the 
dodge caravan and plymouth voyager minivans boosted consumer 
interest in the vehicles 
the minivan has become very popular and chryslers strategy to 
protect their crown jewel is working she said 
gms car sales rose 404 percent in early january over the 
yearearlier period despite production being scaled back by the 
automaker gm truck sales rose 284 percent 
gms recent adjustments in production schedules and 
improvements in vehicle selling rates are evidence of the 
corporations commitment to balancing inventories with consumer 
demand said jb fitzpatrick vice president of marketing 
sudol said the overall increase in auto sales was surprising 
its a flaky kind of year traditionally january is not a 
robust time for sales but theres a lot of noise coming from the 
automakers about incentives said the analyst adding that she 
believes the sales increase wont last 
the economy is just not generating enough new jobs and enough 
higherpaying jobs to keep the sales going sudol said most 
people whove bought cars in the last five years are still paying 
for them 
earlyjanuary sales appear high because they are compared with a 
yearago period that was unusually low sudol said in december 
1988 automakers were offering a variety of incentives that expired 
with the end of that year 
it is not an easy comparison to make since the first 10 days 
in 1989 were so poor you always get a payback period whenever 
there are incentives she said 
fords sales increased the least among the big three automakers 
rising 154 percent for cars and 109 percent for trucks 
in 1989 automakers saw car and truck sales slump 55 percent to 
146 million from 1988s 154 million even so 1989 was the 
automakers seventhbest selling year on record

although campeaucorp plans to keep its 
coasttocoast department store empire running while it reorganizes 
its shattered finances the bankruptcy case could have farreaching 
consequences 
experts say the financial imbroglio eventually could endanger 
jobs of some of the 100000 employees at campeaus 258 stores 
around the country lessen the immediate trend toward pricecutting 
competition among department stores and prompt investors to be 
more critical of proposed retail deals 
this is a onceinalifetime kind of thing for all of us in 
this business said one 30year veteran of the retail trade who 
asked not to be identified the ramifications are so widespread 
the domino effects are remarkable and difficult to conceive 
by seeking bankruptcy court shelter from creditors on monday 
campeaus federated department stores inc and allied stores corp 
can continue operating covering payrolls and meeting suppliers 
bills while restructuring their debts 
the fate of the chains depends on how they untangle their 
balancesheet problems in filing the largest retailing case ever 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code federated and 
allied said their liabilities total 77 billion while their assets 
amount to 91 billion 
theres no guarantee that federated and allied would be healthy 
even after they complete a bankruptcy courtsupervised 
reorganization experts said tuesday 
lewis s rosenbloom an attorney who is head of the bankruptcy 
department at the chicago law firm winston amp strawn said the 
success of any restructuring could be affected by such factors as 
the stores ability to continue getting credit 
retailers generally buy merchandise on credit so if credit 
dries up manufacturers may refuse to ship leaving stores short of 
inventory and customers disenchanted 
business hasnt been booming at us department stores in recent 
months but analysts say campeauowned stores largely have been 
moneymakers however profitability at allied and federated was 
eroded by their enormous debt payments 
the chains including such famous retailing names as 
bloomingdales richs and lazarus mostly are regarded as wellrun 
retailers from a merchandising standpoint 
i dont think there is a division there that loses money 
said monroe greenstein an analyst at bear stearns amp co 
individual stores operating in weak markets might be liquidated 
in a reorganization possibly jeopardizing local jobs however 
greenstein said closing poor performers would enhance overall 
operations 
analysts said that in terms of the retail industrys health the 
pluses will probably outweigh the minuses of the federated and 
allied reorganization 
richard baum of sanford c bernstein amp co inc said the stiff 
price competition that marked the christmas shopping season and 
affected profits for many retailers will ease allied and 
federated stores no longer must mark down prices to prop up sales 
in order to generate enough income to meet heavy debt payments 
another impact could be from sales of allied and federated 
stores bankruptcy reorganizations often involve asset sales to 
satisfy creditors claims and there is speculation some of the nine 
allied and federated chains could be put on sale 
the 17 stores in the new yorkbased bloomingdales division 
already are on the auction block 
but even if the retailing environment improves divesting 
portions of allied and federated could be tough especially because 
many other department stores are on the market 
besides bloomingdales other chains looking for buyers include 
saks fith avenue and marshall fields both owned by bat industries 
plc and bonwit teller owned by lj hooker corp which is 
operating under bankruptcy court supervision 
sanford c sigoloff a turnaround expert who has been running 
lj hooker a subsidiary of australias hooker corp said its 
a very unstable time right now 
lj hooker failed in its effort late last year to find a buyer 
for its upscale b altman amp co department store chain and was 
forced to liquidate it 
retailing property development also could be affected by the 
campeau case developers and investors who provide financial 
backing might not want to build new complexes when big stores 
needed to anchor shopping malls are facing uncertain futures 
richard echikson chairman of millburn njbased retail 
consultants inc a company that advises on retail property 
investments said a slowdown in development of new sites might not 
be all bad he said there arent many prime us locations left and 
there are plenty of existing shopping malls that could be 
refurbished 
also malls dont automatically go under when their main stores 
run into trouble he said the glitzy mall at short hills in short 
hills nj still had a terrific christmas even though its four 
anchors are two campeauowned stores and two owned by hooker 
including an altmans that has closed 
developers say federated and allied stores are better off back 
in the hands of retailing experts rather than in campeaus allied 
and federated were split from their torontobased parent as part of 
restructuring steps leading to the bankruptcy filing 
its probably going to hurt mall development in the shortterm 
but in the longterm it would help said frank pasquerilla 
chairman and chief executive officer of crown american corp one 
of the countrys biggest shopping mall developers when the dust 
settles retailing will be back in the hands of retailers

g william miller the former treasury 
secretary and federal reserve board chairman has taken on a new 
challenge turning around the troubled campeau corp retail 
operations 
miller 64 was named chairman and chief executive officer 
tuesday of campeaus us subsidiary his appointment came a day 
after the retailing giant owner of 258 department stores filed 
for bankruptcy protection 
in miller the american chainstore operation which was given 
operating independence from its torontobased parent last week has 
turned to a man viewed as a savior by other oncefailing companies 
including chrysler corp 
but miller doesnt lack for critics especially from his days at 
the fed and then as jimmy carters treasury secretary 
at treasury miller oversaw the government loan program that 
brought chrysler back from the brink as a merchant banker later 
he has revived companies large and small earning millions often 
in the form of stock which has increased dramatically in value 
unlike an investment bank or a commercial bank a merchant bank 
takes a longterm stake in the companies it is advising miller 
formed one g william miller amp co after leaving carters cabinet 
id like to move from being quarterback so to speak to being 
coach he said 
he has close ties to the wealthy ojjeh family headed by 
syrianborn akram ojjeh and other middle east investors for whom 
he has engineered several acquisitions 
several years ago creditors were about to pull the plug on 
steeloriented korf industries of charlotte nc when the 
company approached miller for help he launched a restructuring 
program that included the sale of steel mills and replacement of 
debt by stock the firm now is principally owned by kuwaiti 
interests 
at the time he compared the rescue of korf which he renamed 
georgetown industries to his role at the treasury during the 
chrysler crisis sell off assets to raise cash work with lenders 
to pay off debt reduce debt convert debt to equity we end up 
with a company that has a sturdy balance sheet 
in the korfgeorgetown case miller reduced debt from 265 
million to 40 million in just two years 
miller could not be reached for an interview tuesday over his 
ideas for campeau us inc which will be renamed federated 
stores inc lisa astudillo his assistant would say only that he 
was traveling 
miller a former chairman of textron inc has long been a 
director of federated and remained a director of the new unit 
created by campeau even though he had resisted the takeover 
during that battle he assailed the acquisitions trend of the 
decade saying the largest company gets thrown in turmoil and 
employees suffer 
yet he has never been ready to call for government 
intervention either to halt takeovers or give takeover targets 
more defenses and during his precarter days at textron the 
conglomerate whose products range from zippers to helicopters he 
certainly wasnt shy himself on the acquisitions front 
born march 9 1925 in sapulpa okla miller grew up in borger 
texas studied marine engineering at the coast guard academy and 
served from 1945 to 1949 as a coast guard officer he received a 
law degree from the university of california at berkeley in 1952 
and joined a law firm in new york city where one of his first 
assignments was to help royal little the founder of textron make 
an acquisition 
little was so impressed with the young lawyer that he asked 
miller to join textron for a oneyear trial four years later at 
age 35 miller became president of the company in 1974 he was made 
chairman a post he held until carter named him chairman of the 
federal reserve in 1978 a little over a year later carter made 
him treasury secretary 
since leaving the government miller generally has shunned the 
limelight though he continues to serve a wide variety of civic 
organizations 
for decades he has been active in minority affairs and is 
crediting with helping move more women into the nations 
boardrooms including textrons

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp can restructure their debt and emerge from chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection without selling groups of stores or greatly 
reducing their work force says james m zimmerman president of 
the two retail operations 
if we run good stores during this chapter 11 customers will 
look right through this issue zimmerman said tuesday we 
believe the shopper will separate the two issues and view the 
bankruptcy as corporate mumbo jumbo stuff 
the scope of the indebtedness that drove federated and allied to 
seek federal bankruptcy court protection took about 6000 pages of 
court filings to detail 
the two campeau corp retail divisions listed 91 billion in 
assets and 77 billion in debts owed to 50750 creditors ranging 
from investment houses that made speculative investments to fund 
the buyouts of the divisions to clothing companies that supplied 
their goods 
in its bankruptcy court petition filed monday and released 
tuesday federated listed 28 billion in secured debt and 7948 
million in unsecured debt most of it carried by bondholders 
allied listed 586 in secured debt and 700 million in unsecured 
debt with the parent campeau corp listed its the biggest 
bondholder at 100 million 
on tuesday g william miller 64 a federated director former 
us treasury secretary and federal reserve board chairman was 
named chairman and chief executive officer of the us operations 
he succeeds john w burden iii who was said to have quit 
effective jan 31 to pursue other interests 
ronald w tysoe president of campeau corp and campeau us 
the us operation will phase out his responsibilities at the 
canadian parent to concentrate on the us retail operation which 
will change its name to federated stores inc the company said 
zimmerman will remain as president and chief operating officer 
of federated and allied and the management teams at all department 
store chains will continue in place the company said 
zimmerman said federated and allied are not looking to sell 
divisions to pay creditors other than previously announced plans 
to sell federateds new yorkbased bloomingdales division 
this is a reorganization not a liquidation zimmerman said 
our objective is to maximize the treatment of all the creditors 
but we have a bias toward keeping the companies intact and 
restructuring the debt 
because of our tax structure it is not efficient to sell off 
divisions one at a time as a way to produce cash he said 
zimmerman said some layoffs are possible but large numbers are 
not expected 
we have a serious capital structure problem he said a 
major mistake was made in the accumulation of too much debt on the 
part of campeau during the takeover that has to be fixed 
miller said holders of highyield junk bonds campeau sold to 
finance its takeover of allied in 1986 and federated in 1988 should 
expect to take losses 
they bought speculative securities and they had high interest 
rates which were compensation miller said on nbcs today 
show i think the marketplace has already reflected in the 
discounts at which they are selling the fact that they probably 
will not be paid in full 
in listing its unsecured bondholders federated and allied did 
not say whether the creditors owned the bonds themselves or were 
holding them for clients as trustees 
federated said first boston corp is its largest creditor 
holding 4288 million in bonds but jack cowell a managing 
director for the new york investment house called federateds 
figure vastly inflated 
the figure is well over 100 million off he said 
cowell said first boston bought many of the bonds at lower 
market prices investing about 75 million to 100 million in 
federated bonds 
after first boston federated listed state street bankcustodian 
co independent election corp of america at 1599 million 
manufacturers hanover trust co at 1083 million and painewebber 
funding inc at 961 million 
after campeau allied listed first boston corp at 975 million 
and manufacturers hanover trust at 384 million 
among the largest trade creditors listed by some of the store 
groups were liz claiborne with 14 million owed by lazarus and 
381076 by abraham and straus 450780 owed to sony corp of 
america by lazarus 402456 owed to fieldcrest cannon inc by 
lazarus 401605 owed to parfums stern inc from maas brothers and 
301151 from burdines and 346303 owed to farberware by maas 
federateds stores are abraham and straus bloomingdales 
burdines lazarus and richs allied operates the bon marche 
jordan marsh maas brothers and sterns 
mondays filing was the largest under chapter 11 by an american 
retailer affecting about 100000 employees and 258 stores in the 
united states it also was the secondlargest ever by a 
nonfinancial company after texaco inc which sought court 
protection in april 1987

atampt is seeking to regain its aura of 
invulnerability following a ninehour outage to longdistance 
service nationwide that was traced to a bug in a new software 
program 
atampt chairman robert e allen on tuesday said he believed the 
outage in a callswitching network was a onetime hit 
during a news briefing at the sprawling network operations 
center allen announced plans for a discount day on which all of 
atampts approximately 80 million longdistance customers could make 
calls at reduced rates 
the company had not decided about the amount of the discount or 
when it would be offered 
american telephone amp telegraph co officials said other options 
for compensation were being reviewed and billings would be 
adjusted to reflect the outage but details were not given 
allen said the advertising campaign was designed to show that 
atampt is still the right choice as it battles to maintain its 70 
percent share of the market 
some analysts said the disruption could be a boon to atampts 
rivals 
the conventional wisdom among telecommunications managers is 
that you dont get fired for choosing atampt because it has this aura 
of invulnerability frank governali an analyst with first 
boston told the new york times on tuesday 
that wisdom changed yesterday the failure of atampts network 
helps give the perception that the other guys can do just as well 
the problem was discovered midafternoon monday and corrected 
nine hours later until it was fixed more than half of the calls 
placed on its nationwide network did not go through the company 
said 
atampt said said the problem stemmed from a bug or logic 
problem inadvertently written into the software in a computer in 
new york city that helps direct calls through the vast network the 
problem spread to more than 100 switching centers 
this is not a virus said spokesman gary morgenstern it 
was a human error in writing the software 
allen said he could not estimate losses to atampt or its customers 
we estimate we lost many thousands of calls during the outage 
and thousands of potential bookings said karen ceremsack an 
eastern airlines spokeswoman 
the problem had minimal effect on reservations for marriotts 
530 hotels worldwide said chain spokesman roger conner in omaha 
neb 
our feeling is that it affected us financially very little if 
at all he said its not a matter to disenfranchise us in 
terms of our satisfaction with atampt 
atampt has insurance to cover customers losses stemming from the 
trouble with its 800number tollfree service but does not have 
coverage for business customers using regular longdistance 
circuits 
we dont have any liability in that sense allen said we 
have to look at each customer on a casebycase basis 
neither mci communications corp nor us sprint atampts main 
competitors plan to change their marketing strategies to 
capitalize on atampts problem spokesmen said 
but us sprint spokesman john landsberg in kansas city mo 
noted an increase in the number of calls for information on its 
service 
people are taking a look at having an alternative carrier to 
atampt he said

general motors corp facing forecasts of sagging 
car sales expects to advertise less and cut sponsorship as part of 
an overall plan to slash spending according to a published report 
the detroit news said tuesday it obtained an internal gm memo 
called the 1990 quick start program which said the carmaker 
would cut or delay media spending by 25 percent in the first six 
months of this year 
the memo also said that gm would reduce sponsorships in motor 
sports and related activities by 20 percent the newspaper said 
were looking at a lot of things said phil guarascio gm 
executive director of advertising i dont think the door is 
closed on cutting anything 
spokesman terry sullivan confirmed the memo tuesday but said he 
had no details on specific cuts and said there was no firm target 
for cuts gm does not disclose its advertising budget 
the nations largest automaker launched a 13billion 
costcutting program in 1987 and last week it confirmed another 
round of cuts that published reports put at 1 billion 
sullivan said daily operating budgets in all departments 
companywide are being reviewed in search of ways to cut or more 
efficiently handle costs 
i think the key there is the term cut or defer he said 
defer it just means hold off spending for a time period and then 
see if we really need it and how important it is to us i mean 
everything in general i dont just mean advertising 
car sales were slow in 1989 and the big three automakers have 
shut down or slowed production at 13 us plants this week to 
lighten the 90day supply of cars on hand incentives launched in 
1989 to try to get rid of slowselling cars have proven costly 
gm on tuesday reported a 40 percent increase in car sales and 28 
percent increase in truck sales for the first 10 days of january

one of the worlds largest banks pleaded 
guilty in a 32 million cocaine moneylaundering case but critics 
call the plea bargain a slap on the wrist that wont discourage 
such illicit banking practices 
the focus of the case now shifts to evidence that may link one 
of the banks top officials to ousted panamania dictator manuel 
antonio noriega 
as part of tuesdays plea luxembourgbased bank of credit and 
commerce international bcci must forfeit a record 14 million in 
assets frozen by the us government it also must cooperate 
against other defendants including one of its bankers who once 
claimed to be noriegas personal banker 
amjad awan a former latin american assistant division director 
for bcci told a us senate panel in 1988 he managed noriegas 
secret accounts at the banks panama branch that held up to 23 
million 
defense attorneys are trying to exclude any testimony linking 
awan with noriega including statements they say awan gave 
involuntarily after his arrest 
if the government insists on interjecting noriega into the case 
defense attorneys have threatened to request sensitive government 
files they say would show the us government was aware of 
noriegas ties to drug smuggling 
charges were dropped late tuesday against one of six bankers 
charged proceedings against the remaining bankers and two 
colombians continued before us district judge w terrell hodges 
and are expected to last five months 
jury selection is not expected to begin until later in the week 
besides the 14 million forfeiture the largest ever by a 
financial institution in the united states bcci sa and bcci 
overseas ltd received suspended fines and five years of 
governmentsupervised probation 
if convicted of all charges 45 million in fines could have 
been imposed 
bcci overseas ltd pleaded guilty to 26 counts of money 
laundering seven other counts were dropped the other bcci 
subsidiary pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering 
twentyfour other counts were dropped 
hodges accepted the plea but did not set a date for sentencing 
he imposed a gag order to prevent parties in the case from 
commenting 
i think its a good deal said bonnie tischler head of the 
us customs service in tampa 
bcci the worlds seventhlargest privately held bank is a 20 
billion institution with offices in 73 countries including the 
united states 
its pretty outrageous said scott malone washington bureau 
chief of the monthly newsletter money laundering alert its 
just a slap on the wrist all they have to do is return the 
proceeds of their crime and pay no penalty 
it sends the wrong signal to bankers all over the world 
many bankers in switzerland montevideo and elsewhere are probably 
snickering in their martinis malone said 
sen john kerry dmass who conducted the senate hearings also 
lambasted the penalty 
we send drug people to jail for the rest of their life and 
these guys who are bankers in the corporate world seem to just walk 
away and its business as usual said kerry chairman of the 
senate foreign relations subcommittee on narcotics 
to simply let this bank go on doing business after giving up 
its drug profits is to slap it on the wrist while a whole lot of 
other people in the criminal justice system have a different 
standard applied to them kerry told cbs news 
my impression is when banks engage knowingly in the laundering 
of money they should be shut down its that simple it really 
is 
the indictment resulted from a twoyear sting during which 
an undercover agent conned his way into an international money 
laundering network authorities said later agents helped direct 
profits from cocaine sales in american cities to colombia through 
panama eventually building a global laundering operation worth an 
estimated 32 million investigators said 
the agents said bcci bankers taught them how to use cash to buy 
certificate of deposits then use the cds as collateral for loans 
the loan proceeds were wired into accounts controlled by the agent 
or smugglers prosecutors said 
the branches used reportedly included locations in france 
panama uruguay the bahamas luxembourg and england 
customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for 
colombian drug traffickers including the medellin cartel 
the defendant dropped late tuesday was iqbal ashraf 39 a 
manager of bccis los angeles office his attorneys successfully 
moved to suppress statements given without counsel present 
when we lost that we just didnt have enough evidence left 
against him said assistant us attorney michael rubenstein

japan will voluntarily limit its auto exports to 
the united states to 23 million passenger cars again in fiscal 
1990 trade minister hikaru matsunaga said today 
the limit is the same as in the current fiscal year which ends 
march 31 although actual exports this year are expected to be only 
2 million because of increased overseas production by japanese 
automakers 
japan began voluntary auto export restraints in fiscal 1981 in 
response to pressure from the us government to help us 
automakers recover they have been considered obsolete for several 
years however because japans actual auto shipments have been 
less than the quotas 
matsunaga said the decision was made after considering auto 
market conditions in japan and the united states including the 
yendollar exchange rate 
when the export restraint started japanese automakers had a big 
price advantage over us companies but the rise of the yen 
against the dollar since 1985 has made japanese cars more expensive 
overseas 
matsunaga also said that most capital investments by japanese 
automakers in the last few years have been aimed at increasing 
production efficiency and product quality not increasing 
production capacity 
but still keeping the quotas is regarded as politically 
important while usjapan friction continues over japans 50 
billion annual surplus in trade with the united states 
todays announcement was virtually identical to last years 
when the government said the export quota should be kept even 
though exports to america were declining 
japanese car companies have turned increasingly to producing 
autos in the united states although some us lawmakers have 
argued that japanese cars built in the united states should be 
considered imports

karsten cash mahlmann has been reelected to 
a fourth consecutive oneyear term as chairman of the chicago board 
of trade in the exchanges first contested election in a decade 
mahlmann 52 the head of one of chicagos leading commodity 
trading firms turned back a spirited challenge from leslie 
rosenthal a millionaire and veteran trader who had called for 
rapid change in the worlds largest futures exchange 
mahlmann defeated rosenthal by a vote of 630524 cbot officials 
reported late tuesday 
i am very gratified by the membership endorsement that has 
been handed to me by this vote and i am pleased the membership 
will allow me to lead for another year said mahlmann the 
managing partner of stotler amp co the exchanges thirdlargest 
clearing member firm 
rosenthal 56 managing partner of rosenthal collins group was 
not immediately available for comment 
the election took place against a backdrop of turbulence during 
the past year at the cbot marked by an ongoing fbi investigation 
into trading fraud and complaints about the exchanges handling of 
julys soybean market crisis 
exchange officials estimated that nearly 75 percent of the 
cbots 1402 full members and 739 associate members who get 
onesixth of a vote cast ballots tuesday 
william f oconnor chairman of oconnor amp co who is viewed as 
a mahlmann ally was elected vice chairman defeating donald 
andrew senior vice president of shearson lehman hutton inc 685 
to 458 
the race for chairman pitted mahlmann against rosenthal who 
campaigned on a platform calling for maximizing exchange profits 
and increasing member income 
rosenthals proposals included introducing new exchange products 
and the possible sale or refinancing of the cbots landmark 
building in the heart of the financial district with profits going 
to the members 
mahlmann opposed selling or refinancing the exchanges loop 
building saying the tax liability for members would be too high 
under current law 
rosenthal who served as cbot chairman in 1981 and 1982 is 
known for his daring aggressive style 
mahlmann who is considered more cautious and lowkey stressed 
continuity in his campaign and building on the accomplishments of 
his past three terms 
mahlmann portrayed himself as the best choice for seeing the 
cbot through upcoming congressional hearings on exchange issues 
such as the reauthorization of its regulatory agency the commodity 
futures trading commission and the federal probe that so far has 
resulted in the indictment of 47 traders and a clerk in the cbot 
and chicago mercantile exchange

the 68yearold mansion owned by nelson bunker 
hunt who recently emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
is up for sale according to a report published today 
the dallas times herald said the hunt and his wife caroline 
intend to move into a smaller home 
the asking price on the sixbedroom sixbathroom house which 
overlooks turtle creek and features marble fireplaces and a garden 
room reportedly is 28 million 
the home was valued in papers filed in the hunts bankruptcy 
case at 18 million 
the hunts bought the house in 1962 from george mcghee who was 
named ambassador to west germany by president kennedy 
because of the bankruptcy proceedings they were forced to turn 
over holdings valued at more than 220 million hunt also had to 
give up his annual salary of 300000 and income from widespread 
holdings 
but because texas law grants homeowners an unlimited exemption 
for a homestead in bankruptcy proceedings the hunts wont have to 
give any proceeds from the sale to creditors 
the hunts financial problems began in 1980 when nelson bunker 
hunt and his brother william herbert hunt lost 15 billion 
speculating in the silver futures markets the silver losses were 
compounded by falling real estate prices and the collapse of the 
oil market 
the brothers filed for protection from their creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act in september 1988 shortly 
after a new york jury found the hunts had conspired to corner the 
silver market 
the hunts emerged from bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month

former us federal reserve board chairman paul 
a volcker urged china on wednesday to keep its economy open to the 
world 
volcker guest speaker at a threeday conference on central 
banking said he hoped chinas opendoor policy would continue 
because international cooperation in monetary matters was 
irrelevant if you have a closed society 
the conference sponsored by the un development program the 
international monetary fund and the peoples bank of china focused 
on such areas as the role of monetary policy and the functions of 
the central bank 
chen yuan deputy governor of the peoples bank chinas central 
bank told a news conference that one thing learned from volcker 
and other participants was how to resist strong demand for funds 
from local governments and enterprises 
volcker head of the fed from 1979 to 1987 was known for 
sticking to a tight money policy in the face of strong political 
pressure in a winning battle against inflation 
in late 1988 china began restricting credit and took other 
austerity measures in a drive to bring inflation under control 
the government succeeded by late 1989 in bringing the inflation 
rate under 10 percent compared to 30 percent a year earlier but 
at a cost of rising unemployment and thousands of factories having 
to shut down or reduce production because of lack of operating 
funds 
in the long run inflation is destructive for growth and 
unemployment said volcker who now teaches economic policy at 
princeton university theres a great deal to be said for giving 
priority to stabilizing prices 
chen acknowledged that under the current retrenchment 
policies the government has given priority to price stability 
rather than the pricing reforms western economists say are crucial 
for a modern marketoriented economy 
but that doesnt mean we have stopped price reform chen 
said pointing to new pricing systems in the coal and transport 
industries 
richard d erb deputy managing director of the imf also 
praised china for its ability to rein in inflation saying there 
were very few nations that have achieved chinas level of growth 
without having severe deterioration in terms of inflation 
erb said the speakers at the conference including central bank 
of mexico governor miguel macera and former national bank of 
belgium governor jean godeaux stressed the need for a central bank 
with autonomy and accountability and a commitment to competition 
among financial markets and price and wage flexibility

industrial production rose 04 percent in 
december the second consecutive monthly gain as unseasonably cold 
weather fired up output by utilities the government said today 
despite the 63 percent gain in utilities manufacturing 
production remained sluggish also partly because of the weather 
the slow pace was reflected by the loss of 25000 factory jobs and 
an unchanged 407hour average work week 
the manufacturing sector particularly durable goods items 
such as cars and household appliances expected to last more than 
three years has been affected by the federal reserve boards 
tight rein on credit designed to curtail inflation since many such 
items are financed by loans 
in its report today the board said decembers gain in 
production followed a revised 03 percent advance in november up 
from the 01 percent reported initially output had declined 04 
percent in october and 01 percent in september 
the extremely cold weather in december caused a sharp rise in 
utility output but also resulted in some production disruptions 
particularly in petroleum refining and construction supplies the 
fed said 
aircraft production returned to normal in december following 
the settlement of a strike at the boeing co it said 
in another report the central bank said the operating rate at 
the nations factories mines and utilities rose 02 percentage 
point to 833 percent in december reflecting the increase in the 
production rate the operating rate measures not only output but 
also changes in productivity levels 
a surge of five percentage points in the operating rate for 
utilities which was the largest in the 23year history of this 
series resulted from the abnormally cold temperatures experienced 
in december the fed said elsewhere utilization in 
manufacturing edged down 01 percentage point while the rate for 
mining fell nearly a percentage point 
factory use had remained unchanged at 831 percent from october 
to november the rate posted 10year highs of 843 percent in 
december 1988 and january 1989 
the operating report is watched as a barometer of future 
inflation the closer us industry gets to full operating 
capacity the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet 
demand leading to shortages and price increases 
analysts general consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures 
production at manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods rose 02 percent in december after advancing 04 
percent in november and falling 05 percent in october 
production at plants manufacturing durable goods edged up 02 
percent compared with a 04 percent gain in november and a 15 
percent decline in october nondurable manufacturing fell 01 
percent in december after rising 03 percent in november and 07 
percent in october 
output at mines fell 12 percent after a 03 percent hike in 
november 
the fed said its industrial production index in december stood 
at 1428 percent of its 1977 base up from 1423 percent a month 
earlier 
in the capacity utilization report the fed said the 
manufacturing plant operating rate slipped to 831 percent in 
december from 832 percent in november the rate had peaked at 847 
percent in january 1989 
the rate at factories producing durable goods edged up 01 
percentage point to 811 percent the rate at factories producing 
nondurable goods dipped 04 percentage point to 858 percent 
the operating rate at mines was up 01 percentage point to 834 
percent while it shot up five percentage points to 863 percent at 
utilities

local heating oil dealers and major oil 
companies took advantage of record heating oil demands in the 
december cold snap to sharply boost their profit margins the 
government says 
refiners boosted their margins the difference between their 
buying and selling prices by 46 cents a gallon above october 
levels as part of an average 54 percent runup in heating oil prices 
in new england last month the energy department said 
local distributors also increased profit margins by 93 cents a 
gallon although more than half the increase happened in the first 
week of january after the worst of the cold temperatures 
according to the data 
the figures presented tuesday to the senate governmental 
affairs committee are the first government data indicating that 
producers and local heating oil dealers among others took advantage 
of the coldest december in 70 years to boost profits 
representatives of both the refining industry and local 
retailers said the margin figures alone are misleading because they 
exclude higher profiteating operating costs in scrambling to keep 
consumers supplied 
since the middle of november my wholesale cost has increased 
59 cents per gallon while my retail price has increased by 47 
cents said robert wesson a waterbury conn home heating oil 
dealer testifying on behalf of the petroleum marketers association 
helmut merklein head of the departments energy information 
agency said the extent of actual profits from the december freeze 
will not be known until may after oil companies file quarterly 
income statements with the securities and exchange commission 
we know that the american consumer was the loser we dont 
know who the winners are yet said john easton assistant energy 
secretary for energy emergencies 
since the first of the year average refiner margins and 
wholesale prices on heating oil sold in new england have dropped 
about 22 cents a gallon according to the new data 
average retail prices are also down but by a smaller 17 cents a 
gallon to an average 129 as of last thursday meanwhile jobbers 
are now enjoying a peak margin of 38 cents a gallon compared with a 
current margin of 364 cents a gallon for refiners 
edwin rothschild of citizen action a consumer energy policy 
group said local dealers may try to build or maintain higher 
profit margins now that wholesale prices are falling 
however he blamed the bulk of the increase on major oil 
companies who seized on the colderthannormal weather to drive 
prices to the highest levels in history predicting they will 
reap 850 million in profits 
charles j dibona president of the american petroleum 
institute said some of the refineries increased price margin was 
absorbed by higher operating and transportation costs 
the committee was told of one case in which the price of a 
tanker to carry heating oil from a texas refinery to new york 
jumped from 800000 to 2 million at the cold waves peak 
nevertheless industry profits probably rose just as they 
fall in a glut dibona acknowledged 
glenn f tilton president of texaco refining and marketing 
said profits his company made on price increases the third week of 
december will likely be offset by losses on 24 million gallons it 
bought at 95 cents each the last week of the month 
with much of the country enjoying warmer weather many gallons 
remain unsold and wholesale prices are now in the range of 76 cents 
to 86 cents a gallon said tilton 
not surprisingly no one is asking why prices have dropped or 
expressing concern that we may have to sell product for less than 
its purchase price he said

analysts said a widening in the us trade deficit to 105 
billion in november from 1025 billion in october caught some 
market participants off guard 
a separate report on industrial production was interpeted as 
evidence that manufacturing remained sluggish a rising 04 percent 
increase in december was attributed in large measure to a cold 
weatherinduced bulge in output by utilities 
brokers also said an earnings report from international business 
machines provided little assurance for investors who have been

the us trade deficit widened in november to 
105 billion its worst showing in 11 months the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said that while imports declined by 593 
million to 4069 billion us exports dropped a larger 843 
million to 3019 billion the trade deficit is the difference 
between imports and exports 
the government blamed much of the setback on the boeing aircraft 
strike which severely cut into exports of expensive commercial 
airliners 
but private analysts were still disheartened by the deficit 
figure many had been looking for a slight improvement following a 
sharp deterioriation in october 
the trade report is most distressing said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co even accounting for civilian 
aircraft us exports are going nowhere the us is simply not 
competitive on goods 
the bush administration was more upbeat in its assessment with 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher saying officials were still 
looking for continued moderate improvement in the trade deficit 
this year 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
deficit is moving in the right direction we think are policies are 
sound no plans to change them 
in other reports today the federal reserve board said output at 
the nations factories mines and utilities rose 04 percent in 
december a modest gain it attributed to the return of striking 
boeing workers and unusually cold weather that boosted utility 
output the increases helped push the operating rate for us 
industry to 833 percent of capacity last month 
the october trade deficit totaled 1025 billion both october 
and november represented the worst performance since a 108 
billion deficit in december 1988 
for the first 11 months of 1989 the us trade deficit ran at 
an annual rate of 111 billion compared with a deficit of 11853 
billion in all of 1988 
many economists believe that americas trade deficit will 
increase in 1990 reversing a twoyear trend of improvements 
this is an unsettling forecast for the bush administration 
which is counting on continued growth in exports to bolster the 
us economy and dampen demands in congress for protectionist trade 
legislation 
the 27 percent drop in us exports left them at their lowest 
level since last march 
almost half of all economic growth in the past two years has 
been supplied by a boom in export sales but economists are worried 
that these strong increases are in danger of stalling out in 1990 
in part because the dollar was rising in value most of last year a 
stronger dollar makes us goods more expensive on overseas markets 
on the import side the 14 percent november decline represented 
a drop from an alltime high set the previous month economists 
said us consumer demand for foreign goods is showing little sign 
of slackening 
in addition the country is growing more dependent on foreign 
oil petroleum shipments climbed to 438 billion in november the 
highest total in six months as the number of barrels imported rose 
2 percent to 842 million barrels daily and the price climbed by 24 
cents to 1733 
as usual the biggest trade deficit in november was with japan 
40 billion down from 49 billion in october the deficit with 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
totaled 18 billion while the deficit with canada was 12 
billion 
other large deficits included 1 billion with taiwan 800 
million with china and 700 million with western europe 
many economists are pessimistic about the nations trade 
prospects believing that the deficit will grow in 1990 because of 
the dollars strength during the past year 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill predicted 
americas trade deficit would rise to 115 billion this year up 
from an expected 110 billion for all of 1989 
i dont think we are going to get any improvement in trade in 
1990 wyss said we are running bigger and bigger deficits with 
taiwan south korea singapore and hong kong and with oil prices 
going up we are hurting with opec as well 
samuel kahan chief economist for fuji securities inc of 
chicago said that for the trade gap to narrow more us 
consumption will have to slow considerably while overseas growth 
accelerates boosting foreign demand for us products 
he said neither of these events was likely to occur especially 
because interest rates are rising in many countries 
the trade balance pretty much has stalled out he said 
many analysts were predicting the trade deficit will average 
around 95 billion per month for the foreseeable future until the 
dollar begins to decline further

soybean futures prices opened narrowly mixed 
today on the chicago board of trade after a steep decline in the

inspected 94 million bushels of soybeans for export last week a 
number slightly higher than the markets had expected 
wheat inspections also were above expectations while corn 
inspections were about as anticipated

beneficial precipitation in soybeangrowing areas of the united

states may tax the sales of religious books 
tapes and other merchandise sold by television evangelists the 
supreme court ruled today 
the court unanimously upheld taxes imposed by california on the 
louisianabased jimmy swaggart ministries ruling that forcing the 
tv preachers organization to pay such taxes does not violate 
religious freedom 
californias nondiscriminatory sales and use tax law requires 
only that swaggarts ministry collect the tax from its california 
purchasers and remit the tax money to the state justice sandra 
day oconnor wrote for the court 
collection and payment of the generally applicable tax in this 
case imposes no constitutionally significant burden on swaggarts 
religious practices or beliefs she said 
the decision upheld rulings that forced swaggarts organization 
to pay california 183000 in back taxes and interest for the years 
1974 through 1981 
the justices were told during oral arguments in october that 
california is the only state imposing such taxes on religious 
organizations but now that the tax has been upheld other states 
are free to do the same 
most states have laws requiring payment of sales taxes on goods 
bought by their residents through the mail but many of those 
states do not actively seek to enforce those laws 
for the years at issue in the case mailorder sales from 
swaggarts base in baton rouge la to california consumers 
totaled 17 million sales of merchandise at california crusades 
totaled 240000 
during the oral arguments swaggarts lawyer michael mcconnell 
told the court this ministry is not in the business to make 
money the purpose of all this is to spread the gospel 
he said such taxation must be prohibited unless we are to say 
that all religious leaders are charlatans 
but oconnor wrote for the court that the california tax is 
not a tax on the right to disseminate religious information ideas 
or beliefs per se rather it is a tax on the privilege of making 
retail sales of tangible personal property 
swaggarts challenge of the california tax was supported by an 
array of religious groups from hare krishnas to mainline 
protestants 
lawyers for the national council of churches representing most 
protestant denominations called the california tax a serious 
threat a tax on the dissemination of religious messages and 
thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion 
backing californias authority to impose such a tax were two 
organizations not usually allied in court the american civil 
liberties union and the national conference of state legislatures 
in other action the court 
ruled unanimously that a doctrine restricting us court 
review of foreign policy does not automatically shield american 
corporations from being sued for allegedly bribing foreign 
government officials 
the court permitted a lawsuit against ws kirkpatrick amp co a 
new jersey corporation accused of bribing nigerian government 
officials to win a contract in 1982 for development of a medical 
center at kaduna air force base in nigeria 
the socalled act of state doctrine a rule adopted by the 
federal courts is designed to bar us courts from inquiring into 
the validity of a foreign governments acts committed within its 
own territory 
ruled that a union official convicted of embezzlement may not 
be forced to repay the union with his own pension benefits 
the court in a case from colorado unanimously threw out a 
275000 judgment awarded to the sheet metal workers against a 
former chief executive officer of a union local 
in the evangelisttaxes case swaggarts lawyers had relied 
heavily on a 1943 high court ruling that overturned the convictions 
of jehovahs witnesses who violated a city ordinance requiring all 
people engaged in doortodoor canvassing to get a license and pay 
a fee 
the jehovahs witnesses were distributing religious literature 
and the 1943 ruling said this form of religious activity 
occupies the same high estate under the constitutions first 
amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the 
pulpits 
but todays decision drew a distinction between those fees and 
the california tax 
our concern in the 1943 ruling that a flat license tax would 
act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is 
simply not pressent where a tax applies to all sales and uses of 
tangible personal property in the state oconnor wrote 
the case is swaggrt ministries vs california board of

international business machines corp today 
announced fourthquarter earnings fell 74 percent largely because 
of previously announcd restructuring costs aimed at making the 
worlds biggest computer company more profitable 
ibm said earnings for the three months ended dec 31 totaled 
600 million or 104 a share compared with 23 billion or 397 
a share a year earlier fourthquarter revenue totaled 205 
billion up 23 percent from 20 billion 
the company attributed the decline mostly to a previously 
announced charge against its fourthquarter results to reflect the 
expenses of restructuring its us business which has been in a 
prolonged slump 
ibm on dec 5 announced it expected a 23 billion charge 
against earnings due to the restructuring although today it stated 
the charge actually came to 24 billion 
ibms earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader 
trends in the computer business the company is the largest 
manufacturer of of information processing equipment and systems and 
is a historical leader in shaping the direction of the industry 
for the year ibm said earnings fell 40 percent to 38 billion 
or 647 a share from 58 billion or 647 a share in 1988 
revenue totaled 627 billion up 51 percent from 597 billion 
ibm stock was up 12 cents to 10025 a share in midday new 
york stock exchange trading following the earnings report 
the company on dec 5 announced a restructuring aimed at cutting 
costs and enhancing its share price the program included plans to 
cut 10000 more jobs ibms fourth jobcutting program since 1986 
and repurchase 4 billion worth of its own stock 
the 24 billion charge against earnings stemmed from costs of 
the job cuts and related steps 
ibm also stated that its earnings and revenue were hurt by the 
strengthening of the us dollar during the quarter 
ibm has been squeezed because of sluggish spending by customers 
increasing competition and the personal computer revolution which 
is cutting into sales of the big mainframes and minicomputers that 
account for most of its profits 
john f akers ibms chairman said in a news release that 
demand for ibm products and services continued to be strong in 
1989 pointing to growth on nonus business revenue he also said 
the company expanded business alliances and strengthened product 
and services offerings 
these initiatives coupled with our continuing drive to reduce 
our costs and expense structure will enable us to take advantage 
of the growth opportunities we see for our business while enhancing 
shareholder value akers said 
ibm expanded rapidly in the early 1980s but has been cutting 
back since 1985 when it became apparent that the industrys rapid 
15 percent annual growth was slowing 
the job cuts announced in december are intended to reduce the 
companys us workforce to 206000 by the end of 1990 a reduction 
of more than 37000 from 1985 levels ibm had 387000 employees 
worldwide at yearend 1988 and has been cutting jobs abroad as well 
the cuts are to occur through attrition and early retirement 
incentives

bass has more than 7300 pubs and other food and drink outlets 
in the united kingdom the company also brews bass carling black 
label and other beers and has annual sales approaching 6 billion 
in 1988 bass bought the rights to franchise holiday inn hotels 
outside north america as the result of that and other purchases it 
already owns 14 holiday inn hotels in the southeast united states 
and is a major franchisee in canada 
holiday has sold off numerous assets in recent years while 
concentrating on property management rather than ownership 
the sale will allow it to retire 21 billion in outstanding

gentler to the poor 
americans should be prepared to fight and die for what is 
right rep charles rangel dny the ada president told a 
news conference the question i ask is whether it was morally and 
constitutionally right 
the comments came as part of what the 47yearold americans for 
democratic action often called the nations leading liberal group 
described as a firstyear report card for president bush 
rangel also said that house democratic leaders often regard 
former congressman bush as a friend and thus are too soft on his 
policies he said the news media have enjoyed the spectacle of the 
panama invasion and that as a result the press hysterically 
supports the tattering of the constitution 
rangel said he was unimpressed by the bush administrations war 
on drugs i dont see anything to knock i dont see anything to 
support he said he expressed disappointment in national drug 
policy director william bennett i dont know where bill bennett

federal regulators negotiating with president 
bushs son to settle alleged banking law violations anticipate the 
matter will be resolved late this week or early next week an 
official said today 
enforcement officials met with neil bush several times last week 
in washington to discuss allegations stemming from his role as a 
board member of silverado banking savings and loan association in 
denver said karl hoyle a deputy director of the office of thrift 
supervision 
after the thrift institution failed in december 1988 regulators 
blamed the collapse on managements decision to invest heavily in 
colorados ailing commercial real estate market they also cited an 
unusually large number of transactions between officers of the 
thrift and borrowers 
neil bush who owned an oil exploration firm jnb exploration 
had business deals with two of silverados major borrowers bush 
was a director of silverado from 1985 until august 1988 when his 
father won the republican presidential nomination 
in an interview last week he denied any wrongdoing and said he 
had nothing to hide 
three top officers of silverado its chairman chief executive 
officer and chief financial officer have already agreed to accept 
a thrift office order banning them from working again at a bank 
sampl or credit union

said he anticipated a settlement or a decision by regulators on 
whether to move against bush absent a settlement by early next week 
bush would not have to admit wrongdoing as part of the 
settlement hoyle said the agreement would not preclude regulators 
from pursuing criminal charges against bush in the future if that 
is indicated 
it also would not interfere with the right of the federal 
deposit insurance corp to pursue a civil suit against bush and 
other silverado officers to recover part of the taxpayers losses 
bushs mother first lady barbara bush told reporters tuesday 
im sorry for him he hasnt done anything wrong hes

union leaders today rejected a twoyear pay offer 
from ford motor co ltd and called a strike vote for next week 
the company said it already has laid off more than 10500 workers 
because of wildcat strikes 
fords latest offer was a 102 percent pay raise in the first 
year and a choice between 8 percent or the inflation rateplus25 
percent in the second year 
it was rejected during talks at the companys london offices 
outside about 500 ford workers staged a noisy demonstration urging 
managers to increase their offer 
if the union votes tuesday to reject the proposal union members 
will begin an allout strike beginning with the final shift jan 
26 officials said 
about 9000 employees already were off the job today some for a 
24hour strike and some continuing indefinite strikes begun monday 
ford said it responded by laying off more than another 10500 
employees it employs 32000 workers at 22 british plants most 
earn an average of 371 a week 
the latest offer was an improvement over fords previous offer 
of a twoyear deal of a 102 percent pay raise in the first year 
and 75 percent in the second year 
the company estimated the strikes would cut production by 2400 
vehicles or 15 million a day 
we had an understanding from the trade unions at last weeks 
talks that there would be no industrial action taking place 
certainly not before talks started today and although these 
strikes are unofficial we are very disappointed said a ford 
spokesman who requested anonymity 
an engine plant in bridgend wales engine and final assembly 
operations at dagenham east london and an assembly plant at 
halewood in northwest england were brought to a standstill ford 
said production was disrupted at other plants 
jack adams chairman of the national negotiation committees 
trade union side said they will certainly have to improve the 
offer and if there is not an agreement today there will be a 
dispute 
last month workers voted 4to1 for an allout strike if 
necessary

a cornell university graduate student 
accused of crippling a federal computer network wanted to break 
into the system but had no intention of causing any damage a 
friend testified today 
he wanted to make a virus that would spread over the network 
but there was never any question of having it do anything bad 
paul graham a harvard graduate student and friend of robert t 
morris told jurors this morning 
graham testified that morris told him in october 1988 he had 
discovered a bug or flaw in the internet network i think he 
had just discovered it he had to tell someone about it he was 
very excited graham said 
graham said that he believed morris just wanted to break into 
university computers but that his friend must have known there 
were other computers on the internet system such as business and 
military facilities 
graham testified he didnt tell anyone about morris plan 
because it was told to him in confidence and at this stage i 
didnt know how close he was 
in testimony tuesday a computer specialist said researchers at 
an army lab fearing that a foreign enemy was trying to steal 
weapons information shut down their computers for nearly a week 
after the runaway program variously described as a virus or 
worm appeared 
michael muuss leader of the advanced computer systems team at 
the army ballistics research laboratory said the aberdeen md 
installation shut down its computers after the rogue program showed 
up in their system nov 2 1988 
our specific concern was that it was an attack by a foreign 
power he said we had a real fear that someone had broken in 
and was trying to take data inside and send it to somebody outside 
or that it would modify data 
however defense attorney thomas guidoboni suggested that army 
officials overreacted 
the suspended cornell university graduate students computer 
tampering trial is in its second week of testimony 
guidoboni said morris 25 of arnold md created the worm as 
an experiment and made a mistake that allowed it to go berserk 
morris did not intend to cause any damage he said 
prosecutors were expected to conclude their case today against 
morris who is accused of crippling an estimated 6000 computers 
if convicted morris could receive up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
muuss testified that the army lab shut down 200 computers linked 
to milnet a global network carrying unclassified military 
information when morris worm infected one machine hooked up to 
another network known as internet milnet carries information such 
as computational chemistry and data on improving projectiles and 
armors 
the research center disconnected itself from milnet and two 
supercomputers at aberdeen were shut off to outsiders for six days 
while a team worked to eradicate the worm muuss said 
guidoboni asked why the shutdown lasted so long when most 
universities attacked by the worm were operating within a few days 
at a university the end result may have been that someone 
didnt get a paper published said muuss who added that his 
computers contained information on the evolution of weapons to 20 
years in the future 
protecting defense information is a critical part of the 
defense business he said we had to certify that no data was 
stolen or modified and make sure our system could resist such an 
attack if it happened again 
muuss acknowledged under crossexamination that computer 
security at the lab had been improved because of the worms 
invasion 
jurors also listened to testimony from computer system managers 
at purdue university carnegiemellon georgia tech and the 
university of rochester 
some witnesses said although no data was permanently lost or 
damaged the worm was costly in terms of eradication and followup 
investigations 
but daniel nydick a systems manager at carnegiemellon said he 
got rid of the worm simply by crawling under his computer and 
unplugging it

while many fellow economists are contemplating a 
soft landing if not a recession for the economy in 1990 russell 
redenbaugh an experienced forecaster is preparing for a soft 
takeoff 
a soft takeoff is a safe one although perhaps undramatic it is 
not a sudden ascent its characteristics are moderation 
sustainability steadiness it is a positive reassuring economy 
in more specific economic terms it means growth of between 2 
percent and 3 percent accompanied by moderation of the extremes 
and negatives that marred the 1980s 
it means lower inflation lower interest rates a lower federal 
budget deficit it means more exports and a reduction in the trade 
imbalance it is one accompanied by lower capital gains taxes and 
rising returns on capital 
it is an economic situation that redenbaugh says professional 
economists with a negative outlook have grossly misread 
because they have misread events he says they have come to 
patently wrong conclusions 
that is they are talking about economic deterioration obsessed 
with a handful of gloomy statistics for specific sectors of the 
us economy unable to measure an historic event that he calls 
the key indicator 
to him the key to the immediate economic future is the freeing 
of the eastern european economies from 40 years of 
deindustrialization a discontinuity that the economics 
profession cannot comprehend 
redenbaugh knows that his forecast puts him way out on a limb 
especially in the conservative business in which he operates but 
he claims to like it there saying i feel comfortable its never 
crowded 
most economists and investment advisers run in a herd he says 
adding in this business you must have an aversion to crowds 
crowds are comfortable but they never produce good results 
redenbaugh needs results is measured by them and expects to 
get them as chief strategist for cooke amp bieler inc a 
philadelphiabased asset management firm for fortune 500 pension 
funds and profitsharing accounts 
he believes that recent economic events will produce a real 
peace dividend an immediate expansion of commerce and a 
lengthening investment horizon that as a consequence will means 
higher priceearnings ratios for stocks 
he isnt entirely alone in his optimism edward yardeni of 
prudentialbache is probably as far out on a limb and the 
conference board said today that the us economy is rebounding 
rather than eroding with exports leading the way 
but if you attended a convention of economists almost anywhere 
this month you might not be pleased with what you heard based on 
their published reports almost any uplifting news would be 
balanced off with depressing reminders 
redenbaugh believes many professional economists are unable to 
deal with changes in europe because it doesnt fit their 
orthodoxy of using statistical models to explain everything 
he contends they want to say something to the effect that 
three out of the last four times when the iron curtain collapsed 
the following happened which is of course absurd 
while the suddenness of the collapse of managed economies in 
europe amazed redenbaugh he had suggested it might happen 
although more slowly in a paper one year ago 
at that time he said economic considerations were dismantling 
the iron curtain and undermining communist ideology and that if 
the soviet union was to survive it would have to abandon marxist 
economic systems 
what has since occurred he says is now the key factor in 
economic forecasting whether or not it fits the conventional 
forecasting models 
as the 1990s begin he states it is not the health of the 
economy that is questionable for it is healthy it is the health 
of the economics profession that is questionable

a unanimous supreme court ruled on wednesday 
that american corporations may be sued for allegedly bribing 
foreign government officials 
the court permitted a lawsuit against ws kirkpatrick and co 
which has been accused of bribing nigerian government officials to 
win a contract in 1982 for development of a medical center at 
kaduna air force base in nigeria 
the could held that a doctrine restricting us court review of 
foreign policy does not automatically shield corporations from such 
suits 
the actofstate doctrine is designed to bar us courts from 
inquiring into the validity of a foreign governments acts 
committed within its own territory 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the doctrine 
does not bar a court from deciding the suit since the validity of 
no foreign sovereign act is at issue 
the case might embarrass the nigerian government scalia said 
but that alone is not enough reason to kill the lawsuit 
actofstate issues only arise when a court must decide 
the effect of official action by a foreign sovereign he said 
the actofstate doctrine does not establish an exception for 
cases and controversies that may embarrass foreign governments but 
merely requires that in the process of deciding the acts of 
foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdictions shall be 
deemed valid 
scalia noted that over the years the interpretation of the 
doctrine has changed so that recently the high court has used it to 
guarantee separation of powers between three branches of government 
the idea is to assure that courts will not interfere improperly 
in the presidents conduct of foreign affairs scalia said he 
noted that the administration of president george bush and 
particularly the state department do not oppose the suit against 
the kirkpatrick company 
the company was sued by environmental tectonics corp another 
american corporation 
environmental tectonics submitted a lower bid than kirkpatrick 
for the nigerian project and said it would have won the contract 
but for kirkpatricks bribery of nigerian officials 
the justice department investigated the contract prompting the 
company and its chief executive harry carpenter to plead guilty 
to one count of violating the foreign corrupt practices act 
kirkpatrick was fined 75000 
carpenter was accused of paying benson tunde akindele a 
nigerian citizen a commission to be turned over to nigerian 
government officials the commission was 20 percent of the value of 
the contract 
a lowercourt judge threw out environmental tectonics civil 
suit but it was reinstated by the 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals and the supreme court was upholding that reinstatement 
in other businessrelated cases the court ruled that a union 
official convicted of embezzling may not be forced to repay the 
union with his own pension benefits 
the court unanimously threw out a 275000 judgment won by the 
sheet metal workers international association against curtis 
guidry former chief executive officer of the unions local 9 in 
denver 
guidry head of the local from 1964 to 1981 pleaded guilty in 
1982 to embezzling more than 377000 from the union 
the union said it was missing nearly 1 million of its funds 
while guidry was in prison the union sued in federal court and 
was awarded 275000 
a federal judge ordered guidrys pension benefits placed in a 
special trust to repay the union and the 10th us circuit court 
of appeals upheld the ruling 
but the supreme court said wednesday that the federal employment 
retirement income security act erisa protects the pension 
benefits of even dishonest union officials 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said the law 
reflects a considered congressional policy choice to 
safeguard a stream of income for pensioners even if that 
decision prevents others from securing relief for the wrongs done 
them 
there may be a natural distaste for the result we reach 
here blackmun said but it is the job of congress and not the 
courts to correct it

unabashed workaholic who says he shaves and eats breakfast in his 
car to save time 
kim woochoong heads daewoo group maker of products ranging 
from leading edge computers to pontiac lemans exports to the us 
market kim says he wrote the book to tell young people how to find 
inspiration and direction in life or as the suggested title for 
the english version suggests work 
in south korea one of the fastest growing asian countries the 
drive to succeed and make money is a passion kims position as 
head of a conglomerate with 1988 sales of 172 billion hasnt hurt 
his credibility as an author 
nothing comes free in this life and nothing is accidental 
writes kim 53yearold father of four the more you dig the 
deeper the hole and the deeper the hole the more water from the 
well thats what its all about 
more than 900000 copies of its a big world and theres lots 
to be done have been published since it came out last august by 
this month the book was in its 89th printing 
south koreas largest bookstore named it one of the five best 
sellers of the decade daewoo says it has even sold the rights to a 
professor in china for a chinese version 
although the book has been translated into english daewoo is 
looking for a us publisher and negotiations are under way for 
publication in other countries 
the 211page paperback sells for 450 and features 39 essays 
with pithy fatherly advice on school working women choice of 
jobs relationships and making money 
his commentary is full of personal anecdotes ranging from his 
school life not exemplary to religion better than not 
having one to observations on why nations in southern europe 
waste so much time napping 
kim says he doesnt exercise takes no vacations sleeps five 
hours a night and spends the rest of the time working and making 
business deals he wrote the book nights while waiting out a 
shipyard strike last spring 
my generation didnt eat well and couldnt dress well but 
look at the korea that weve built he says advising young 
people not to become smug by the countrys new consumerism and 
leisure time 
days are too short for me he writes i wish they were 30 
or 40 hours long i sometimes shave and wash with a towel in the 
car on the way to work i even occasionally have breakfast in the

an expert 
as founder and chairman of daewoo kim oversees 70 overseas 
offices and 93000 employees involved in trade construction 
shipbuilding the manufacture of cars industrial robots 
telecommunications consumer electronic products textiles and home 
appliances 
the book skips over the ways daewoo rose from a small textile 
exporter to the worlds 46th largest industrial company in 22 
years omitting mention of its ties to past authoritarian 
governments low wages easy bank credit and protectionist barriers 
that allowed daewoo and other conglomerates to grow 
theres a frantic trend nowadays to think only in terms of 
immediate profits kim writes people are looking for comfort 
and satisfaction rather than having a fighting spirit to overcome 
difficulties and succeed in the long run 
he advises korean women to stamp out sex discrination by 
considering a job professionally not a bus stop on the way to 
marriage 
you have to find places that people have never been to and you 
have to do things that people havent done before he advises 
both sexes of course theres danger in pioneering pioneers take 
paths that havent been paved 
there is too much egocentricism he says if everyones an 
egoist then theres always going to be trouble 
he recommends forming close lifetime friendships a code 
followed closely among korean businessmen who often judge each 
other by the schools theyve attended 
although kim exalts nonstop work he encourages daydreams 
dreams are like the rudder of a ship setting sail the rudder may 
be small and unseen but it controls the ships course

one giant us paper companys hostile 
attempt to buy another has developed into a multibilliondollar 
emotional brawl peppered with accusations of mismanagement lies 
and coverups 
georgiapacific corps 38 billion offer to acquire great 
northern nekoosa corp has become a war with several fronts 
ranging from courts to fullpage newspaper advertisements aimed at 
swaying shareholders 
the focus of the fray has moved to georgia pacifics attempt to 
oust great northerns board at a special shareholders meeting in 
portland on march 2 
its pure fighting said george b adler a securities 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co it sounds like a 
political campaign 
if the merger succeeds it will create the nations largest paper 
and forestproducts company with operations in every state but 
alaska 
great northern employs 20000 workers nationwide and had 
estimated sales of 39 billion in 1989 of products ranging from 
corrugated shipping containers to the yellow sheets used in 
adhesive postit notes 
ever since atlantabased georgiapacific announced oct 31 it 
would pay 58 a share for great northern then raised the price to 
63 a share the takeover has been a dominant story in maine a 
lumber state not known as a corporate battleground the only point 
all sides agree on is the stakes are high 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr envisions a very 
highquality strategic business combination better able to 
compete globally great northern chairman william r laidig says 
the deal would create a highly leveraged junk company that 
would run afoul of antitrust laws 
hahn is confident the merger will proceed saying 75 percent of 
great northerns stock has been tendered by shareholders laidig 
calls great northerns chances of staying independent excellent 
mainers are perhaps paying closest attention to the fight 
because two company mill towns millinocket and east millinocket 
and 21 million acres held by great northern are caught in the 
cross fire natives ingrained suspicion of any outofstate 
corporation with interests in maine and their hopes of preserving 
the vast northern woods have inflamed their passions 
whether this is right or wrong georgiapacific does not have 
the quality of reputation that great northern has said dave 
smith a university of maine history professor part of it is 
because great northerns here and georgiapacific is from away 
great northern was founded and incorporated in maine although 
its corporate office is now in norwalk conn 
georgiapacific points to two decades of ownership of more than 
500000 acres of maine and a mill in woodland as evidence it is a 
good corporate citizen but its merger attempt has faced intense 
scrutiny in maine 
during the week that georgiapacific announced it was going 
after great northern hahn said his company disclosed its 
intentions to top government officials in states where great 
northern has major holdings wisconsin georgia virginia 
arkansas mississippi and maine 
maine officials immediately sought written assurances that jobs 
would be protected and sensitive woodlands would not fall into the 
hands of developers when georgiapacific offered assurances in 
letters conference calls and lengthy meetings at the state house 
in augusta the maine officials said the response was not good 
enough 
we have not really encountered the level of concern or 
questions that developed in maine in other states hahn said in a 
telephone interview he said georgiapacific with 44000 employees 
and projected 1989 sales of 10 billion intends to improve great 
northerns maine assets 
great northern which has refused to even discuss the merger 
with georgiapacific has gotten plenty of public relations mileage 
out of the uncertainty the deal has raised 
lawyers are fighting part of the battle in us district court 
in portland where georgiapacific challenged maines antitakeover 
law and great northerns poison pill bylaws intended to thwart 
a hostile takeover 
great northerns responses allege georgiapacific has violated 
federal securities laws by masking secret plans to sell the maine 
woodlands and mills as its executives waged a campaign of cynical 
propaganda to mislead mainers and make the deal more politically 
palatable 
great northern alleges georgiapacific executive vice president 
ad pete correll jr who has often visited the state to 
promote the deal privately told consultants the maine properties 
were losers and dawgs that would be sold to make the merger 
more affordable 
great northern later accused hahn of lying when he said 
georgiapacific had ruled out sales of the maine properties 
actually great northern said georgiapacific told its bankers 
privately that it would sell the mills 
georgiapacific said it had studied the possibility of selling 
the maine properties but hahn concluded the sales werent 
necessary 
its unfortunate that these kinds of allegations have been 
made hahn said as far as the personal attack goes i 
personally feel it was unconscionable 
correll said he had no recollection of referring to the maine 
properties as losers and dawgs although that is certainly 
not how he views them today correll too was surprised by great 
northerns allegations 
im not normally called a liar in the press correll said 
were not that kind of company im concerned that both great 
northern and georgiapacifics image has been harmed 
georgiapacific meanwhile has accused great northerns 
directors of seeking to entrench themselves in highpaying jobs at 
shareholder expense and setting up lucrative golden parachute 
payments for executives to be paid if the merger goes through 
great northern has denied the accusations 
great northerns stock was selling around 40 a share prior to 
the takeover offer so shareholders would make a healthy profit if 
the deal proceeds georgiapacific says 
georgiapacific also accuses great northern of financially 
starving the aging millinocket mill saying georgiapacific will 
offer workers a better future great northern claims 45 billion 
in credit assembled by georgiapacific would leave the merged 
company drowning in debt 
analysts agree the debt would be a concern although several 
said the merged company probably would survive 
its safe to say that this company would end up either at the 
bottom end of the investment grade or the top end of the junk bond 
grade said nelson noel an anlyst with moodys investor service 
i dont think the company is going to fall into the junk junk 
category 
the other hurdles faced by georgiapacific are a federal 
antitrust suit filed by great northern in bridgeport conn and an 
antitrust suit filed in state court by maine attorney general james 
e tierney 
georgiapacific does not view those lawsuits as serious threats 
hahn said 
analysts say that other large paper companies are eyeing the 
outcome although corporate raiders have gone after paper makers in 
the past this is the first time a competitor has waged such a 
fight 
there would be a feeling that if the courts and the justice 
department and the ftc would allow this merger some others would 
consider making some acquisitions noel said 
end advance foor sunday jan 21

soybean and corn futures prices fell slightly 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as rain continued in the 
midwest wheat futures closed slightly higher 
the action marked the fourth consecutive daily decline in the 
soybean market where attitudes have turned bearish due in part to 
increased rainfall in the us corn and soybean belt and in 
southern brazil an important soybeanproducing region where the 
new crop is in the early stages of growth 
the rise in wheat futures reflected sentiments that recent 
losses were not justified by supplyanddemand factors including 
tuesdays agriculture department exportinspections report 
the usda said it inspected 226 million bushels of wheat for 
export last week a number higher than the market had expected 
soybean inspections also were above expectations while corn 
inspections were about as anticipated 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 3 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 400 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with march at 241 a bushel oats were 2 
to 4 cents lower with march at 139 a bushel soybeans were

skyrocketing jet fuel prices in 
december shot down amr corp profits last year the parent of 
american airlines said wednesday in reporting a 667 percent fall 
in fourthquarter earnings 
the fourthquarter decline pulled down amrs annual earnings 46 
percent below the record level of 1988 despite record passenger 
traffic 
for the three months ended dec 31 amr said its net profit 
dropped to 389 million or 57 cents a share from 1167 million 
or 187 a share in the fourth quarter of 1988 
the fall occurred despite a 92 percent increase in 
fourthquarter revenue to 259 billion from 237 billion 
amr chairman robert crandall began in september to predict lower 
earnings for amr and the airline industry because of rising labor 
costs and amrs own expansion plans 
in addition to those conditions jet fuel prices began rising 
sharply in december as cold weather and refinery problems raised 
the cost of petroleum products american the nations largest 
airline has twice raised fares in recent weeks to help offset fuel 
costs as have its competitors 
but even the latest round of fare increases does not come 
close to covering the costs said american spokesman al becker in 
fort worth 
americans fuel costs in the fourth quarter were up 302 percent 
from 1988 in the last week of december jet fuel cost around 96 
cents a gallon a 655 percent jump over the year 
the company said the fuel price rises accounted for 27 percent 
of its increased expenses 
despite record profitability during the first nine months of 
1989 an extraordinarily rapid rise in fuel costs during the final 
quarter of the year badly penalized the fullyear results 
crandall said in a statement 
for all of 1989 amrs profit fell to 4548 million or 715 a 
share from 4768 million or 766 a share the previous year 
fullyear revenue jumped to 1048 billion from 882 billion in 
1988 
during the fourth quarter amr escaped an attempted 7 billion 
buyout by new york billionaire donald trump whose offer collapsed 
after troubles arose with a proposed employee buyout of united 
airlines parent ual corp becker would not disclose how much amr 
spent fighting off trump or its effect on earnings 
last month amr announced a 471 million deal to buy the prized 
latin american routes and certain other assets of eastern airlines 
and its parent texas air corp

first interstate bancorp said wednesday that 
chairman and chief executive joseph j pinola would be succeeded by 
company president edward carson on june 1 after pinolas 65th 
birthday 
william eb siart who heads first interstate of california 
will succeed carson as president of the parent company the 10th 
largest bank holding company in the country 
pinolas retirement this spring had been widely expected and 
the naming of carson was seen as a sign of continuity 
carson has been in the shadow of pinola for a long time but 
hes also been the righthand man said dan williams a banking 
analyst at sutro amp co in san francisco it makes sense 
it was the second orderly toplevel change announced at a big 
los angeles bank in two days 
security pacific corp the fourth biggest us banking concern 
said tuesday that its top two managers chief executive richard j 
flamson iii and chief operating officer george f moody were being 
replaced by their heirs apparent robert h smith and jerry a 
grundhofer 
in his 12 years as first interstates chief pinola aggressively 
pursued interstate expansion presiding as first interstate swelled 
to its present 58 billion in assets operating 28 banks in 14 
states and franchising banks in 11 other states 
but pinola leaves at a time when first interstate has been 
hammered by huge losses at its subsidiaries in arizona and texas 
where the real estate market has collapsed 
first interstate added 400 million to its reserves in december 
as it tried to get the texas losses off its books as quickly as 
possible six months earlier it had set aside a 350 million 
reserve against arizona losses 
putting those problems behind is clearly the greatest task 
confronting the 60yearold carson who joined first interstate of 
arizona in 1951 became its chairman in 1977 and was promoted to 
president of the parent corporation in 1985 
we made mistakes when the texas and arizona realestate 
markets were booming carson said in a telephone interview from 
arizona 
he said first interstate has tightened lending practices to try 
to prevent overaggressive lending even in boom markets 
our strategy has been developing over the last three years 
he said were trying to get rid of those suboptimal performers 
and improve or help the good performers to be higher 
the big writedowns also have depressed first interstates stock 
price causing many analysts to regard it as a takeover candidate 
williams noted that first interstate would be by far the cheapest 
of the big california banks for any eastern bank hoping to enter 
the lucrative markets in california 
but carson said first interstate was not interested in a merger 
which he said was not in the best interest of shareholders 
we are not interested at the present time based on the fact 
that we have an extremely valuable franchise with a lot of 
synergies available to us he said 
as an example he said that first interstate is wellpositioned 
to take advantage of computer technologies that continue to break 
down the barriers between states 
for example in utah we had a bank that really was not doing 
very well basically because utah is an overbanked state i think 
they have more banks per capita there than anywhere else in the 
united states carson said 
on the other hand we have a very profitable bank in nevada 
and therefore we have gone as far as we can go to combine those 
banks doing away with nearly all the utah administrative staff 
technology and other advances have allowed us to bring 
together the operations of those two banks into a very profitable 
combined unit carson said if you expand that to the 
northwest the southwest you can see that there would be 
tremendous opportunities 
california obviously will remain a standalone operation he 
said

prime minister margaret thatcher is proceeding 
with bigger more complicated sales of stateowned companies in a 
privatization program that has more than tripled the number of 
british shareholders 
helped by the booming stock market of the 1980s mrs thatchers 
conservative government has raised 53 billion by selling such 
industries and services as steel gas and telephones next in line 
is electricity 
not all the flotations have succeeded and mrs thatcher has 
faced a barrage of accusations that she is giving away the nations 
assets harold macmillan the late prime minister once likened it 
to an impoverished family selling off its heirlooms 
but privatization has become one of the most striking features 
of mrs thatchers decade in office and a powerful weapon in her 
crusade to bury british socialism 
the prime minister who believes companies perform better when 
the government isnt running them has overseen the transformation 
of stodgy nationalized industries into thriving competitive 
businesses a prime example is british airways plc or ba which 
as business week described it has been turned from bloody 
awful into bloody awesome 
but mrs thatchers aim isnt just to resuscitate ailing 
industries but to create an army of small shareholders who having 
tasted the thrills of the stock market wont ever want to reelect 
the socialist labor party 
ten million britons now own stock roughly as many as belong to 
trade unions and 13 percent of the adult population has bought 
into the privatized companies treasury figures show 
mrs thatcher has used the sales revenue to convert budget 
deficits into surpluses and to cut the income tax rate to just 40 
percent for top earners and 25 percent for the rest a postwar low 
even some of mrs thatchers ideological adversaries admire her 
for the privatization campaign hugo young for example political 
columnist for the leftleaning guardian newspaper has praised her 
for reducing the role of government in british life 
privatization has been so successful its supporters say that 
britain has become an exporter of privatization knowhow copied by 
countries as diverse as japan turkey france and chile 
but critics say mrs thatcher has become too radical during her 
third consecutive term taking her privatization program too far 
they say the government is selling britons what they already own 
as taxpayers or underpricing shares to ensure success 
particularly contentious is the sale of water and electricity 
which critics say should remain stateowned at least for reasons 
of national security 
moreover they say many privatized industries remain 
monopolies insufficiently regulated to protect consumers 
but investors have bought shares enthusiastically and generally 
have profited the government has reserved most of the shares for 
the british public 64 percent in british gas plcs case selling 
the rest to british institutions and foreign investors 
a shareholder who bought 100 british gas shares for 219 each in 
december 1986 could have sold them at a 34 percent profit as soon 
as they began trading or have kept them and be 76 percent richer 
today plus dividends sweeteners included paying for the shares in 
installments bonus shares or vouchers for free gas 
the one big flop was the sale of the governments onethird 
interest in british petroleum co plc that 12 billion sale the 
largest so far coincided with the october 1987 stock market crash 
and many of the shares were left in the hands of stockbrokers 
the most recent selloff of the 10 water authorities of england 
and wales was widely expected to fail because the stock market 
faltered badly last october and water seemed too vital a commodity 
to expose to market forces 
but the 8 billion sale proved the second most popular 
privatization after gas drawing 27 million applications for 
shares 
the government began privatization by selling relatively small 
companies like cable and wireless plc then it moved to privatizing 
utilities in one piece like british gas which fetched a record 
47 million share applications 
now it is going even further restructuring utilities as well as 
selling them 
selloffs must be approved by parliament but the conservatives 
large majority virtually assures assent 
the government spent years and billions of pounds grooming its 
targets for the competitive world it wrote off their debts 
injected them with capital closed plants and laid off workers 
for instance the government wrote off 26 billion in losses in 
british steel plc which cut its work force from 186000 in 1978 to 
51600 in 1987 
the steel giant has gone from a net loss of 29 billion in 
1979 which got listed in the guinness book of world records to an 
aftertax profit of 909 million in its first year in the private 
sector 
the government also has spent more than 160 million on 
advertising campaigns and publicity gimmicks to promote 
privatizations 
in one memorable stunt men rappelled down the side of a 
highrise building unfurling huge banners that revealed the price 
of bp shares 
the privatization program has been so successful that the 
opposition labor party which was responsible for nationalizing 
most of the now privatized companies has abandoned its pledge to 
renationalize them 
its an acknowledgement that were in a different world 
said labor lawmaker doug henderson 
but henderson remains critical privatization has been done by 
and large on the cheap to make sure that they were sold if you get 
a bargain most people take it they got a bargain on gas 
telecommunications and water 
shares of the water companies for example soared to premiums 
as high as 64 percent on the first day of trading on dec 12 
others say consumers have enjoyed some advantages from the 
privatization a wider choice of telephones at cheaper prices for 
example but some groups want tighter regulation 
it really doesnt matter who owns state utilities what does 
matter is that they tend to be natural monopolies and that they 
need to be regulated in such a way that they do not screw 
consumers said wendy toms spokeswoman for the national consumer 
council 
privatization also has exposed some commercial crown jewels to 
foreign takeovers creating some nationalist backlash as happened 
when ford motor co of the united states acquired british luxury 
car maker jaguar plc in november 
the government had gone against its own freemarket principles 
by retaining ultimate control in privatized companies to protect 
them from foreign control but it made jaguars takeover possible 
by waiving its golden share and has indicated it might 
relinquish other such blockers 
next on the list is the sale of the electricity industry which 
could raise more than 32 billion dwarfing all the other 
privatizations the government also hopes to privatize british rail 
and british coal

a trade group representing mortgage bankers 
complained wednesday that the federal home loan mortgage corp is 
shirking its responsibility to finance lowcost apartments 
earlier this month the company known as freddie mac tightened 
its standards for buying multifamily housing loans from lenders 
freddie mac which is congressionally chartered but stockholder 
owned provides money for housing by purchasing mortgages from 
lenders and packaging them into securities which are then sold to 
investors last year it acquired more than 14 billion in mortgage 
loans on more than 20000 apartments 
on jan 2 the agency said it would only purchase mortgages on 
apartments when the borrower has made at least a 30 percent down 
payment and unless the borrower has made at least a 40 percent 
down payment the agency is requiring the original lender to make 
good on the loan in the event of a default earlier rules required 
only a 15 percent down payment 
warren lasko of the mortgage bankers association of america said 
the new rule represented a complete withdrawal from freddie 
macs commitment to finance affordable rental housing 
we believe that a federally chartered agency has an obligation 
to follow a steady stable course in meeting its public purposes 
lasko said complaining that the decision was made suddenly without 
open discussion 
however john nash a spokesman for freddie mac the new rule 
was an act of prudent management taken to reduce freddie mac 
loan losses half of the losses in the first nine months of 1989 
were from apartment loans he said 
our assignment as defined by congress was not to purchase 
loans that go into default we will certainly continue to support 
affordable housing he said adding that the agency hoped this 
year to increase the amount of multifamily mortgages it purchased

energy futures prices tumbled wednesday on the 
new york mercantile exchange in response to an industry report that 
showed a sharp rise in petroleum supplies 
i was shocked flabbergasted by the report said peter 
beutel energy analyst for elders futures inc 
the report by the american petroleum institute a trade 
association representing major oil companies said inventories of 
crude oil heating oil and gasoline in the nations storage tanks 
grew substantially during the week ended jan 12 while refineries 
continued to pump out refined products at a brisk pace 
were seeing runs of a million barrels a day its the biggest 
ive seen since i started looking at these statistics in 1982 
beutel said 
heating oil for february delivery plunged 351 cents to 6052 
cents a gallon while the march contract fell 164 cents to 5782 
cents and april lost 113 cents to 5545 cents a gallon 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for february delivery dropped 288 
cents to 6142 cents a gallon march was down 2 cents to 6182 
cents and april closed at 6178 cents down 192 cents 
the february contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil closed down 68 cents at 2210 a barrel 
all other crude contracts also lost ground 
analysts said the rise in gasoline stocks was the biggest 
surprise since recent indicators suggested demand for gasoline was 
on the rise after warmer weather halted the heating oil rally 
the market reacted violently to the unexpected build in 
gasoline said michael broder energy broker for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
particularly surprising was the rise in refinery utilization he 
said 
i think it caught the industry by surprise broder said 
api statistics released after the close of trading on tuesday 
showed gasoline stocks rose 5 million barrels to 2149 million 
barrels heating oil and other distillates increased 2 million to 
1084 million and crude oil was up 29 million barrels to 3451

international business machines corp said 
wednesday its fourthquarter earnings fell 74 percent due to 
restructuringrelated costs that some analysts said were bigger 
than expected 
the worlds biggest computer company posted a profit of 600 
million or 104 a share in the three months ended dec 31 that 
was down from 23 billion or 397 a share in the same period a 
year earlier 
fourthquarter revenue totaled 205 billion up 23 percent 
from 20 billion a year earlier 
ibm attributed the decline mainly to a 24 billion charge 
against fourthquarter pretax profit to pay costs associated with 
cutting 10000 jobs and restructuring other aspects of its us 
business which has been in a prolonged slump 
ibm in december had projected a charge of about 23 billion 
amounting to about 225 a share against expected earnings the 
actual charge came to some 258 a share analysts said 
i was surprised in that 104 a share in profit was lower 
than i expected but only because the company took a 
largerthanexpected onetime charge said william easterbrook 
an analyst with kidder peabody amp co 
it has to do with a greater number of people taking voluntary 
severance he said 
ibm stock fell 125 a share to 9887 on the new york stock 
exchange wednesday 
for the full year ibm earnings fell about 35 percent to 38 
billion or 647 a share from 58 billion or 980 a share in 
1988 revenue totaled 627 billion up 51 percent from 597 
billion a year ago 
ibm also attributed the lower earnings to a strong dollar which 
makes its business less competitive overseas and growth in leasing 
of its equipment which reduces shortterm earnings because 
customers pay on a periodic basis 
in addition to the job cuts in the restructuring plan announced 
dec 5 ibm also said it was repurchasing 4 billion of its own 
stock 
ibm spokesman peter w thonis said the company had not changed 
its earlier projection of 500 million in costs for separation 
payments and still expected to reduce its us work force to 
206000 from the current 216000 
thonis said the cuts ibms fourth jobcutting program since 
1986 would be completed by the end of march the cuts were being 
made through attrition and early retirement incentives 
he also said the results of the restructuring were within ibms 
expectations by 1991 the computer giant expects to reduce costs 
and expenses by about 1 billion as a result of the restructuring 
he said 
that works out to about 1 in earnings per share and we will 
see some of that benefit starting in 1990 he said 
ibms earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader 
trends in the computer business the company is the largest 
manufacturer of information processing equipment and systems and is 
a historical leader in shaping the direction of the industry 
industry growth which had slowed substantially in recent years 
now appears to be stabilizing 
ibm chairman john f akers said growth in overseas revenue was 
strong in 1989 and while us revenue grew more modestly it 
nevertheless recorded its first gains in four years 
demand for ibms products and services remains good akers 
said adding that the restructuring would produce a more 
competitive company in the 1990s 
analysts generally agreed saying ibms recent cost controls 
could result in a good payoff in the 1990s most said they would 
continue to recommend ibm stock to investors 
theyre finally taking serious steps in organizing the company 
and changing the cost structure said barry bosak analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co they have a better product 
compliment than they have had in recent years my assessment is 
there are no real negatives

gold prices were mixed on the commodity exchange in new york 
gold rose 170 to 41250 a troy ounce republic national bank of 
new york later quoted a bid of 41290 up 310 from late tuesday 
foreign exchange dealers said investors were concerned because 
the poor trade performance in november was partly due to a drop in 
exports some analysts believed the decline indicated a further 
slowing of the us economy 
the commerce department said the trade deficit grew in november 
to 105 billion its worst showing in 11 months imports declined 
by 593 million to 4069 billion but exports dropped 843 million 
to 3019 billion 
the government blamed much of the increase on a strike at boeing 
co which severely cut into exports of expensive commercial 
airliners but private economists were still disappointed by the 
figure 
ronald holzer chief foreign exchange dealer with harris trust amp 
co in chicago said any possible upward moves by the dollar were 
being limited by traders skeptical view of the economy 
however he said the us currency was beginning to base at 
these levels 
although the trade news pushed the dollar lower foreign 
exchange traders largely focused on the west german mark and other 
currencies wednesday holzer said 
overseas dealers said continuing tensions in the soviet union 
and eastern europe gave the dollar some underlying support 
the dollar did manage a gain against the british pound in 
london one pound cost 16525 late wednesday cheaper than late 
tuesdays 16560 in later new york trading the pound was quoted 
at 165235 down from 16585 late tuesday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
tuesdays prices included 16873 west german marks down from 
16950 15055 swiss francs down from 15116 57325 french 
francs down from 57630 125650 italian lire down from

14575 yen tuesday in london trading the dollar closed at 14545 
yen and in new york it rose to 145395 yen from late tuesdays 
14530 yen 
gold prices fell below 410 a troy ounce in moderate trading in 
europe piquing the interest of new york traders who then moved 
bullion higher

oil and gasoline futures prices plummeted wednesday after an 
industry report showed an increase in us stocks of petroleum 
products after several weeks of declining supplies 
on other commodity markets precious metals futures rose 
livestock and meat futures were higher and grains and soybeans 
were mixed 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 68 cents lower to 4 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in february at 2210 a 
barrel heating oil was 60 cent to 351 cents lower with february 
at 6052 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 145 cents to 
288 cents lower with february at 6142 cents a gallon 
the selloff followed tuesdays weekly american petroleum 
institute supplies report which showed sharp increases in stocks 
of crude oil gasoline and petroleum distillates last week 
crude oil stocks rose by 29 million barrels gasoline stocks 
increased by 5 million barrels and distillates which include home 
heating oil climbed by 21 million barrels the api reported 
the api also said refinery activity rose 68 percent a huge 
increase and a strong contrast to recent weeks in which refining 
operations were slowed by coldweather damage to equipment in the 
gulf states and a variety of other refinery problems elsewhere 
energy futures had risen sharply over the past two months 
largely as a result of strong demand for heating oil caused by 
unusually cold weather in europe and then in the united states 
but warmer temperatures have prevailed since the new year began 
and demand has eased 
the weather pattern weve had so far in january has been a 
contributing factor said michael rothman vice president of 
energy securities and futures research at merrill lynch capital 
markets inc but the return to normal refinery operations as 
reflected in the api report is really what youre seeing reflected 
in todays market 
gold and silver futures finished moderately higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange boosted late in the session by reports that the 
soviet union planned to send more troops to azerbaijan a southern 
soviet republic where fighting between armenians and azerbaijanis 
is escalating 
gold futures settled 150 higher across the board with february 
at 41370 a troy ounce silver was 23 cents to 27 cents higher 
with march at 5308 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures rose on the chicago mercantile 
exchange led by sharp increases in cattle futures linked to tight 
supplies of marketready animals and relatively light slaughter 
rates 
live cattle finished 35 cent to 62 cent higher with february 
at 7822 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 102 cents 
higher with january at 8387 cents a pound live hogs were 
unchanged to 43 cent higher with february at 4977 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 73 cent to 182 cents higher with 
february at 5642 cents a pound 
soybean and corn futures fell slightly on the chicago board of 
trade as rain continued in the midwest wheat futures closed 
slightly higher 
the action marked the fourth consecutive daily decline in the 
soybean market where attitudes have turned bearish due in part to 
increased rainfall in the us corn and soybean belt and in 
southern brazil an important soybeanproducing region where the 
new crop is in the early stages of growth 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 401 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
to 1 cents lower with march at 241 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
to 4 cents lower with march at 139 a bushel soybeans were 
cent to 2 cents lower with january at 557 a bushel

shares of northeast bancorp inc tumbled 
by 17 percent on wednesday after the company reported a 
fourthquarter loss that reflected the impact of a declining new 
england economy 
the bank holding companys shares fell 950 a share to 46 in 
national overthecounter market trading 
northeast posted a net loss of 25853 in the three months ended 
dec 31 compared with a profit of 106 million in the same period 
a year earlier 
the company increased its provisions for possible loan losses to 
71 million from 13 million during the quarter due to 
deteriorating loan quality loan chargeoffs totaled 39 million 
during the quarter 
earnings for the entire year fell to 632000 or 8 cents per 
share from 346 million or 439 per share in 1988 
company spokesman john c kline attributed the stock price 
plunge to the fourthquarter financial report 
i think people were reacting to the numbers more than anything 
else he said thats the only thing i can determine 
northeast bancorp has an agreement to be acquired by bank of new 
york co pending changes in state laws prohibiting acquisitions by 
nonregional banks that agreement is to expire aug 15 
a number of new england banks have felt the effects of declining 
real estate values bad real estate loans and a general downturn 
in the regions economy 
northeast bancorp said it has been conservative in lending money 
since 1987 especially in real estate which allowed the company to 
avoid many of the loan problems experienced by other banks 
but it said the problems finally caught up with the companys 
businesses which include union trust co connecticuts

americas trade deficit widened to 105 
billion in november its worst showing in 11 months as us 
exports took a tumble caused in part by a strike at boeing the 
commerce department said wednesday 
the commerce department said that while imports dipped slightly 
from an alltime high set in october us exports sales declined 
even more falling to their lowest level since last march 
as a result the trade deficit the difference between imports 
and exports rose 24 percent 
the increase coming on the heels of an even worse 20 percent 
surge in the october deficit left private economists disheartened 
about the chances for further improvement in the countrys trade 
performance any time soon 
wall street reacted to the trade report with disappointment as 
well sending the dow jones industrial average down by 3349 points 
to close at 265913 its lowest closing since nov 22 
however in better economic news the government reported 
wednesday that industrial production rose 04 percent in december 
its best showing since august while the operating rate at american 
factories mines and utilities rose 02 percentage point to 833 
percent of capacity 
much of the strength was attributed to a return of striking 
boeing workers and a record jump in utility usage caused by 
unusually severe weather in december 
but analysts noting that industrial production figures for 
september october and november were all revised upward said the 
newfound strength in us industry provided further evidence that 
the current economic slowdown should not worsen into a recession 
for the first 11 months of this year the us trade deficit has 
been running at an annual rate of 111 billion only a marginal 
improvement from the 11853 billion deficit for all of 1988 
many economists are forecasting that the trade deficit this year 
will begin rising again reflecting a growing us dependence on 
foreign oil a further slowdown in us export sales abroad and 
continued demand by american consumers for foreign products 
the trade report is most distressing said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co the united states simply is 
just not competitive on goods we are not selling enough overseas 
and americans keep on buying imports 
michael k evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
was not looking for any improvement in the trade deficit either 
this year or in 1991 saying a balanced trade sector is just not 
going to happen we like imports too much 
the bush administration which is counting on continued solid 
growth in exports to bolster the domestic economy was more upbeat 
in its assessment of the november trade report 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the administration was 
still looking for continued moderate improvement in the trade 
deficit in 1990 
the trade improvement over the past two years has accounted for 
almost half of total us economic growth but with the export boom 
showing signs of running out of steam many analysts are predicting 
that the overall economy will grow at just half the rate turned in 
during 1989 
the november trade deficit and a revised 1025 billion 
imbalance in october were the worst imbalances since a 108 
billion deficit in december 1988 
the 27 percent drop in exports to 3019 billion included an 
895 million decline in commercial airplane exports caused in 
large part by the 45day strike at boeing which ended on nov 21 
however analysts noted that even without the big drop in 
airplane shipments in november export sales have been basically 
flat since last june 
imports totaled 4069 billion in november down only a slight 
14 percent from their alltime high set in october 
while shipments of autos from japan fell by 141 percent during 
the month americas foreign oil bill climbed to 438 billion the 
number of barrels imported daily edged up to 842 million while the 
price per barrel rose by 24 cents to 1733 
economists are predicting even higher oil bills in the future as 
americas dependence on foreign oil increases the american 
petroleum institute an industry trade group reported wednesday 
that foreign imports rose to 46 percent of total supplies in 1989 
the secondhighest level on record 
as usual the biggest trade deficit in november was with japan 
40 billion even though the total represented a decline from a 
49 billion october deficit 
other large deficits were recorded with canada 12 billiion 
taiwan 1 billion china 800 million and western europe 700 
million

production rates at three chrysler corp assembly 
plants will be cut in march resulting in the indefinite layoffs of 
more than 2000 workers the company said wednesday 
spokesman doug nicoll blamed the moves on slow sales 
the cuts are due at chryslers plants in belvidere ill 
newark del and toledo ohio which make some of the companys 
most profitable cars and jeeps 
the reductions come in addition to previously announced 
temporary and indefinite layoffs that will affect more than 25000 
chrysler workers in february chrysler will close its jefferson 
avenue assembly plant in detroit feb 2 affecting 1700 workers 
and eliminate the second shift at its st louis car plant 
involving 1900 employees beginning feb 12 other layoffs are 
temporary 
the belvidere factory assembles the chrysler new yorker salon 
fifth avenue and imperial and the dodge dynasty cars which carry 
the highest percar profit in the no 3 automakers lineup 
the newark plant makes the plymouth acclaim dodge spirit and 
the chrysler lebaron sedan jeeps which make up a large portion of 
chryslers light truck sales are made at its toledo plant 
nicoll said 750 salaried and hourly employees will be affected 
at belvidere 780 will be laid off at newark and 724 will lose 
their jobs at toledo he did not have a breakdown of salaried and 
hourly employees at the plants 
a survey last year of automotive plant capacity by autofacts 
inc of philadelphia showed hourly workers make up between 84 and 
90 percent of the employees at each of the plants 
production rates at the belvidere and newark plants will be 
trimmed by 12 percent and jeep production at toledo will be cut by 
about 8 percent nicoll said 
each of the three plants will shut down completely for the week 
of march 19 
when they come back up the week of the 26th they will come up 
at lower production rates nicoll said 
nicoll declined to give assembly line speeds but the autofacts 
survey showed that production rates were between 60 and 65 vehicles 
an hour at each plant

despite efforts to improve the governments 
drugapproval process it still takes too long to push new drugs 
through the regulatory maze manufacturers said wednesday 
it takes about 10 years to move a new drug from development 
through testing on patients to approval from the food and drug 
administration the pharmaceutical manufacturers association said 
given the overriding importance of new drug therapy that 
10yearperiod including the 32 months of review time at fda 
is too long and must be shortened said gerald j mossinghoff 
president of the trade association 
we think theres some opportunity to cut down the review 
time as well as the time in clinical trials mossinghoff told 
reporters 
mossinghoff said the fda needs more employees better facilities 
and better pay for its employees 
fda spokesman bill grigg said the review time for totally new 
drugs is longer than for other drugs because they are more 
complicated to process he also said it includes about six months 
during which the agency waits for more information it requests from 
drug sponsors 
mossinghoff also said that while the generic drug scandal has 
been a major distraction at the agency it does not appear to 
have hampered the processing of applications to sell generica 
drugs which are copies of drugs on which patents have expired 
however it did more than halve the number of generic drugs 
approved last year in 1989 265 generic drugs were approved 
compared with 684 in 1988 
jay molishever spokesman for the generic pharmaceutical 
industry association said the result is a clogging of the 
pipeline that is hurting consumers as well as innocent generic 
drug companies 
it should return to normal levels he said how quickly 
that happens we dont have an indication yet but definitely we 
think the low point has been reached 
the scandal has seen convictions of three generic drug company 
executives and bribetaking convictions of three fda employees the 
investigation also uncovered evidence that some drug companies had 
cheated on fda safety tests prompting recalls of dozens of generic 
drugs including clones of some popular drugs 
drug makers won approval to sell 23 new drugs last year 
compared with 20 in 1988 during the past decade the highest 
number of approvals in one year was 30 in 1985 and the lowest was 
14 in 1983 
the drugs in this category are considered new molecular 
entities which means they are not related in chemical structure 
to existing drugs 
overall the fda approved a total of 87 new drugs most of which 
are chemically related to drugs already on the market and 113 
products not counted as drugs such as vaccines called 
biological products by the agency 
in 1988 the agency approved 67 new drugs and 41 biologics

newsletter wednesday to return secret documents about the 
accounting giant which won a court order halting their publication 
at another newsletter last week 
accounting today a twicemonthly newsletter based in new york

in its feb 5 edition mailed to subscribers jan 30 
we got a nice note from them today handdelivered to return 
the documents and not to talk about them said robert crane 
accounting today editor we will not respond we will plan to go 
ahead with what we intended to do anyway 
the documents evidently leaked by someone inside the big six 
accounting company apparently contain sensitive details about 
compensation to the partners of ernst amp whinney and arthur young 
the firms that merged last june 
ernst amp young won a court order jan 8 preventing bowmans 
accounting report of atlanta from printing a frontpage article 
containing the information just as the newsletter was going to 
press a hearing on that order by new york supreme court judge 
beatrice shainswit was scheduled for thursday morning 
ernst amp young officials did not immediately return telephone 
calls seeking comment on accounting todays plans carl d liggio 
an attorney representing the accounting firm in the bowmans case 
was in a meeting and unavailable to comment a secretary said 
judge shainswits order only applies to bowmans the accounting 
firm would have to get another order to stop accounting today from 
publishing the material 
the case has attracted enormous attention from news 
organizations which claim the judges order violated the 
constitutional guarantee of press freedom ernst amp young claims the 
issue concerns privacy rights 
the associated press new york times atlanta 
journalconstitution wall street journal and other media groups 
have joined bowmans in charging that order was an unconstitutional 
the hearing originally was scheduled for next monday but was 
expedited at the newsletters request 
crane did not explain how his newsletter obtained the 
information but said he did not believe the content to be very 
significant outside of the accounting profession crane said he 
believed ernst amp young was reacting more to what the accounting 
firm felt was a violation of its internal affairs 
you have to keep in mind that accountants take confidentiality 
very seriously crane said in this instance one of their own 
leaked proprietary information

the nations general aviation manufacturers 
shipped 1535 planes in 1989 a 27 percent increase over the 1212 
aircraft delivered in 1988 the industrys trade association 
reported on wednesday 
this is far below however the 17050 piston and jet aircraft 
delivered in the peak year of 1979 
d larry moore chairman of the general aviation manufacturers 
association told a news conference that because the industry 
shipped fewer large jets and more singleengine piston aircraft 
last year net billings fell to 18 billion six percent less than 
the 19 billion reported in 1988 
moore noted that a decade ago the industry shipped more than 
16000 piston aircraft more than 14 times the number of such 
planes shipped in 1989 
the primary cause of this decline in unit shipments is the 
product liability crisis which continues to damage the industry 
moore said

aluminum co of america said wednesday its 
earnings dropped 24 percent in the fourth quarter partly due to a 
decline in shipments and an increase in the cost of raw materials 
alcoa the worlds largest producer of aluminum operates in 18 
countries 
for the three months ended dec 31 alcoas net profit fell to 
1647 million or 188 a share from 2187 million or 247 a 
share in the fourth quarter of 1988 
the decline occurred despite a 2 percent increase in 
fourthquarter revenue to 269 billion from 265 billion 
alcoa chairman paul h oneill said the earnings erosion 
reflected the continuing trend of an economic slowdown that began 
in mid1988 
the company also attributed the fourthquarter drop to lower 
prices for ingots the molds in which metals are cast and for most 
fabricated products 
operations in australia and brazil accounted for 42 percent of 
alcoas 1989 earnings compared with 25 percent in the prior year 
mainly due to strong prices for alumina and ingot for most of the 
year oneill said 
alcoa owns 51 percent of alcoa of australia the worlds largest 
producer of alumina or aluminum oxide 
alcoas fourthquarter shipments decreased 6 percent to 635000 
metric tons from 676000 in the same period of 1988 
for all of 1989 the companys net profit rose nearly 10 percent 
to a record 9449 million or 1067 a share from 8614 million 
or 974 a share 
fullyear revenue increased to 1116 billion from 993 billion 
in 1988

phillips petroleum co will take a 
280 million aftertax writedown on its offshore california 
investments that will cause the companys fourthquarter earnings 
to plunge company officials said wednesday 
we regrettably must take this step even though production of 
californias offshore resources could help slow the nations 
growing dependence on imported oil said cj silas phillips 
chairman and chief executive officer 
the investments include the oilrich point arguello field off 
the coast of santa barbara calif which could hold as many as 500 
million barrels of oil phillips holds 40 percent and 50 percent 
interests in the blocks that are part of the field 
silas said the writedown was prompted by delays in getting 
regulatory approval to transport oil from the field by tanker 
those delays are largely the result of opposition by several area 
environmental groups 
he said the writedown applies to phillips interests in point 
arguello and associated production transportation and onshore 
processing facilities suspended exploratory wells in the rocky 
point field and some other offshore california leases in which 
phillips has interests 
suspension of the project can only further increase the us 
trade deficit and have a negative effect on the economy silas 
said in a news release 
silas said the writedown will be charged against fourthquarter 
1989 earnings which will be released jan 25

centrust bank floridas largest savings and loan 
said wednesday that it is calling off a proposed merger with new 
yorkbased ensign bank because the two struggling thrifts were 
uncertain of government approval 
but centrust said it plans to continue its attempt to gain 
regulatory approval of its proposed sale of 63 of its 71 branches 
to great western bank in beverly hills calif 
centrust has said the proposed merger with ensign a thrift with 
eight offices in south florida would have placed the combined 
institutions near but still short of federal capital requirements 
the latest development came a day after miamibased centrust 
reported a net loss of 973 million in the fourth quarter 
centrust said the proposed merger would have resulted in the 
formation of a new restructured holding company and a capital 
infusion from hamilton holding co the parent of ensign bank 
ensign is owned by miami billionaire ted arison the majority 
owner of the miamibased carnival cruise lines and the nbas miami 
heat 
both thrifts decided it would be best to terminate the proposed 
merger because they were uncertain it would be approved by the 
federal office of thrift supervision centrust said in a statement 
wednesday 
centrust and ensign will each file separate capital plans in 
connection with federal capital requirements according to the 
statement centrust said it expected its capital plan to include 
the proposed sale of the 63 branches 
on tuesday centrust chairman david l paul said the large 
fourthquarter loss was partly due to governmentordered 
excessive loss reserves on securities and to overall thrift 
industry problems 
the loss for the quarter ended sept 30 compared with a loss of 
27 million for the same quarter in 1988 
centrust which said it had assets totaling 9 billion sept 30 
also reported a loss of 1195 million for fiscal 1989 that 
compared with a profit of 501 million the previous year 
some analysts predicted more large losses were in centrusts 
future 
i believe these numbers could go even higher said miami 
banking consultant ken thomas as of dec 31 i believe they may 
have to write off another 100 million 
centrust has been ordered by regulators to sell its expensive 
art collection a yacht and limousines all used by paul the ots 
which recently slapped paul with a cease and desist order has 
alleged he squandered centrusts assets on such things as corporate 
aircraft the yacht and hefty salaries

florida citrus growers lost more than 400 
million from the christmas freeze and the lower crop and juice 
yields decimated the industrys control of the us orange juice 
market according to a state economic report released wednesday 
the twoday freeze cut floridas orange crop to its smallest in 
25 years the freeze reduced the crop by 29 percent to 92 million 
boxes and the grapefruit crop by nearly 14 percent to 38 million 
boxes according to the state department of citrus report 
the earlyseason freeze over the christmas weekend crippled the 
industry because more than 80 percent of the crop then estimated 
at 174 million boxes had not been harvested 
as a result of floridas reduced crop prospects in 198990 
florida is expected to supply less than onehalf of the orange 
juice required by the us market in the forthcoming season said 
bob behr the economic and market research director for the state 
agency 
last season florida citrus and its related industries brought 
in an estimated 85 billion in revenue 
the smaller crop and lower juice yield means florida can supply 
about 40 percent of the us orange juice market down from its 71 
percent share a year ago said behr who updated the 198990 citrus 
outlook for the florida citrus commission during the commissions 
meeting here 
floridas share of the market will be offset by brazilian 
imports brazil supplied about 35 percent of the market a year ago 
and will easily supply more than 50 percent this year behr said 
supply should be sufficient to meet the market but supplies 
will be slightly less than what was available last year behr 
said i dont really see a major shortage of orange juice 
while wholesale prices for frozen concentrated orange juice 
supplied by privatelabel companies have risen about 27 percent 
from levels prior to the freeze retail prices are expected to rise 
modestly by about 8 percent the higher prices are not expected to 
deter most consumers and consumption is expected to fall just 12 
percent behr said 
floridas citrus industry has been hit by several freezes this 
decade with the treekilling cold of 1983 and 1985 cutting the 
states citrusproduction by more than 200000 acres 
in lake wales us sen bob graham dfla told state citrus 
leaders he opposed any reduction in the tariff on brazilian citrus 
imports 
florida citrus has suffered enough graham said the 
freeze was bad enough we dont want to drown in imports 
the brazilians have asked for a 50 percent reduction in the 
tariff but graham is urging president bush not to reduce it
