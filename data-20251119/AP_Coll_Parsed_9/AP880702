president reagan on friday signed a major 
expansion of medicare to provide insurance against lingering major 
illnesses but warned future presidents and congresses to keep the 
cost down lest it grow into a program we cant afford 
every administration since the medicare program was passed has 
worried about the seemingly uncontrollable cost increases in our 
government health care programs reagan said at a ceremony in the 
white house rose garden 
whoever the president in office program costs have exceeded 
the best congressional budget estimates he said unless we are 
careful it is possible that aspects of this legislation will do 
the same 
the bill is the first substantial expansion of medicare since it 
was established in 1965 
major portions of the new program will take effect in 1989 with 
some provisions phased in over subsequent years medicare officials 
plan to mail a pamphlet to all beneficiaries explaining details of 
the changes 
reagan noted that the legislation provides new benefits for the 
nations 32 million medicare recipients including prescription 
drugs and care provided to patients in their homes 
we have no real way of knowinghow much these services will 
cost he said so if future administrations and congresses 
arent diligent these new benefits could contribute to a program 
we cant afford 
this could be more than a budget problem it could be a 
tragedy the program after all is to be paid for by the elderly 
themselves so we must control the costs of these new benefits or 
well harm the very people we are trying to help 
medicare enrollees will pay for the additional benefits through 
a flat increase in the premium deducted from monthly social 
security checks and an additional sliding scale premium on the 
approximately 40 percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax 
the flat increase will be 4 a month in 1989 climbing to 1020 
in 1993 the sliding scale premium is projected to rise from a 
maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax liability in 1989 to 
about 28 percent in 1993 
if administered with prudence this program can povide 
countless americans with peace of mind the president said 
reagan has long been a foe of expanded federal welfare and other 
programs however he said the catastrophicillness insurance is 
needed to help remove a terrible threat from the lives of elderly 
and disabled americans the threat of an illness requiring acute 
care one so devastating that it could wipe out the savings of an 
entire lifetime 
the new program provides full hospital coverage after a 
onceayear deductible the deductible is estimated at 564 in 1989 
and is designed to rise with hospital inflation medicare now pays 
full charges for no more than 59 days a year the recipient is 
subject to a deductible for each hospitalization 
medicare now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills after a 
75 deductible this will continue to be the case for the first 
1370 a year but above that the legislation provides that 
medicare will pay the approved bills in full the recipient will 
still have to pay any amount over the fee approved by medicare 
the measure also provides a new benefit in which medicare will 
pay half of outpatient prescription drug costs in 1991 after a 600 
deductible is met the government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 
and 80 percent in 1993 
the deductible is also expected to increase each year to keep 
pace with rising drug costs medicare does not cover outpatient 
drugs now except for a few very expensive ones such antirejection 
medication for organ transplant recipients 
another new benefit is socalled respite care covering up to 80 
hours a year for a nurse or home health aide to relieve a family 
caring for a patient at home it will be available to those who 
exceed the limit on outofpocket expenses for doctors care or the 
prescription drug deductible 
also for the first time medicare will pay for breast 
cancerdetecting mammograms at specified frequencies starting in 
1990 the limit on such payments will be 50 per mammogram at 
first but may be increased later if fees rise 
the legislation is the product of a senatehouse conference 
committee that met from february until may to hammer out a 
compromise version of separate bills approved by the two chambers 
the final measure passed the house 23872 on june 2 and sailed 
through the senate 8611 on june 9

yegor k ligachev the no 2 man in the kremlin 
provided an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the 
soviet leadership with his description of the events that brought 
mikhail s gorbachev to power 
ligachev said friday at the communist party conference that 
gorbachev had crucial support from himself andrei a gromyko and 
kgb chief viktor g chebrikov when he became party general 
secretary in march 1985 gromyko now president was foreign 
minister at the time 
ligachev recounting emotions and experiences in a manner rare 
for a member of the traditionally stoic party politburo disputed 
claims from ousted moscow communist party boss boris n yeltsin 
that he had slowed reform 
he said he had been deeply worried about the fate of the country 
during the final days of leonid i brezhnev who ruled from 1964 to 
1982 in a time of stagnation 
more very disquieting days and hours came when the party 
elite assembled to choose a successor to konstantin u chernenko in 
march 1985 ligachev said 
fate put me in the center of action he said we could 
have made quite different decisions and sometimes i think what 
would have happened to the country after that he told the 
conference delegates 
with the support of chebrikov gromyko politburo member mikhail 
s solomentsev and some regional party leaders the only correct 
decision was taken he added 
gromyko made the nominating speech proposing gorbachev as 
general secretary after chernenkos death but ligachevs account 
was the first to suggest solomentsev had supported gorbachev 
his comments appeared to confirm rumors that circulated at the 
time that former moscow party boss viktor v grishin an ally of 
chernenko and brezhnev had made a lastminute attempt to secure 
the leadership 
ligachevs statements which were televised also could boost 
gromyko and solomentsev a day after they were criticized by name at 
the fourday conference which ended friday 
gromyko 78 was foreign minister for 28 years before accepting 
the largely ceremonial presidency in july 1985 he and solomentsev 
have sat on the policysetting central committee since the early 
1960s 
the country came to a crisis before gorbachev became leader 
ligachev said he spoke of corruption lack of discipline and 
alcoholism 
because of a lack of frankness even the party was in 
danger he said 
all revolutionary parties that died did so because they were 
afraid to talk about their weaknesses he said 
ligachev spoke of his career during the brezhnev years 
in the years of stagnation i worked and lived in siberia 
said ligachev the communist party leader in the siberian city of 
tomsk from 196583 i say with pride that i built socialism and 
there were millions of such people 
referring with a touch of humor to the russian practice of 
sending misfits and disidents to siberia ligachev said perhaps 
we worked like that because we knew that they wouldnt send us 
farther than siberia

the commander of soviet troops in afghanistan said 
they served with honor and were not defeated but two influential 
officials criticized the decision to intervene in the fight against 
usbacked rebels 
we came to afghanistan not to win battles but to defend women 
and children villages and cities and we have performed our duty 
with honor lt gen boris gromov told the national communist 
party conference on friday 
the red army entered in afghanistan in december 1979 and more 
than 100000 troops were helping the marxist government fight the 
moslem guerrillas until a withdrawal agreement was signed in april 
gromov who told reporters this week that the red army is no 
longer taking active part in the fighting rejected claims that the 
soviet force was beaten 
grigory baklanov editor of the literary journal znamya said 
the decision to intervene was made in defiance of the machinery 
of democracy he said some nonvoting members of the ruling 
politburo learned about the decision only by reading the newspapers 
i receive many letters from mothers he said in remarks 
broadcast by soviet television they ask how did this happen 
who supported it 
yevgeny primakov said the decision under late president leonid 
i brezhnev was made without a proper examination of the possible 
alternatives of a political resolution 
the remarks by primakov head of the institute of world 
economics and international relations of the soviet academy of 
sciences were provided by the tass news agency 
the discussion of afghanistan on the fourth and final day of the 
conference lacked the sharp character of debates on the bolder news 
media the economy and other issues 
but coupled with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs own 
critique and some personal criticism during the conference of 
president andrei a gromyko the foreign minister for 28 years 
it indicated serious dissatisfaction with the conduct of foreign 
policy earlier this decade 
soviet military officials have refused to criticize the orders 
to fight in afghanistan which cost them more than 13000 dead and 
35000 wounded 
according to the terms of an april 14 agreement signed in 
geneva a fifth of the 100000 soviet soldiers have left 
afghanistan and the remainder must be gone by feb 15 1989 
in his opening address to the party conference tuesday 
gorbachev praised the soldiers who served in afghanistan but the 
criticism of baklanov and primakov echoed other remarks of 
gorbachev 
it sometimes happened that even decisions of vital importance 
were taken by a narrow circle of people without collective 
comprehensive examination of analysis on occasion without properly 
consulting friends either this led to an inadequate reaction to 
international events and to the policies of other states if not to 
mistaken decisions he said 
the geneva agreement and withdrawal from afghanistan have 
become an international milestone in the political settlement of 
regional conflicts which are fraught with a danger to the world as 
a whole and which hinder the progress of the nations gorbachev 
said 
he said the soviet union too often in the past has emphasized 
military strength rather than political skill he has been 
extremely critical of the rule of brezhnev as a period of 
stagnation and corruption 
in an address thursday a local party official called for a pair 
of officials long influential in foreign affairs to step down 
because they had been part of brezhnevs administration 
prompted by gorbachev to name names vladimir i melnikov of the 
siberian komi region called for gromyko and georgy arbatov head of 
the usacanada institute for the past 21 years to step down 
other soviet officials in recent months have suggested that the 
decision to send soldiers into afghanistan was a mistake but their 
comments were in less influential and lesspublic forums

the communist party conference in moscow 
generally brought praise from eastern europe where the kremlins 
new policies are pressuring leaders to reform their own countries 
in poland in our party we are deeply satisfied with the 
course of the cpsu soviet communist party conference said a 
commentary of the official polish news agency pap with 
satisfaction we receive the changes brought by perestroika and new 
thinking 
poland and hungary have gone the farthest in matching or even 
exceeding soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms in the 
economy and politics 
gorbachev who closed the fourday conference friday will be 
paying a sixday visit to warsaw beginning july 11 
the new thinking at the conference creates fresh 
possibilities of a gradual demilitarization and humanization of 
international relations polish foreign ministry spokesman stefan 
staniszewski told a news conference thursday 
in czechoslovakia where officials privately say they are 
waiting to see whether gorbachev will strengthen his position at 
the conference the communist party daily rude pravo said the event 
will be an inspiration and a source of practical enlightment for 
us 
if the kremlin leader gets a mandate for more radical reforms 
it would increase pressure on czechoslovakias leaders installed 
after moscow crushed gorbachevlike reforms with tanks 20 years ago 
to adopt political change and to reform economic structure more 
quickly 
the ideas are worth thinking about rude pravo said 
in yugoslavia which broke with moscow over ideological issues 
40 years ago the state press carried lengthy reports from the 
conference describing it as historic dramatic and exceptionally 
open 
yugoslav media pointed to gorbachevs words that there will be 
no prosperity for socialism without fundamental and deep 
democratization of the soviet society 
all the communist leaderships in eastern europe many of them 
now more secretive and orthodox than the modern kremlin have 
followed the conference debate over the stalinist past and the need 
to open up communist party life 
one exception was romania whose leader nicolae ceausescu has so 
far rejected any need to reform his rigid economic and political 
system 
the communist party daily scinteia carried a fourparagraph 
report about the conference opening without any comment and did not 
publish any excerpts from gorbachevs speech

negotiations are the only road to 
peace in nicaragua president oscar arias of costa rica told 
secretary of state george p shultz who reportedly is considering 
a new aid program for the rebels 
arias said he told shultz on friday that negotiating between 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and the rebels known as 
contras was still possible despite a breakdown in talks last month 
i am sure that the offer of the sandinista government is not 
their final offer arias told reporters at his home moments after 
shultzs departure for washington 
shultz spent six hours in costa rica the last stop on a 
threeday fournation central american trip 
in guatemala shultz met with contra leaders he was said to 
have discussed a 30 million aid package for the rebels that could 
also hold out the promise of economic aid to the sandinistas 
alfredo cesar a member of the contra directorate said he and 
his colleagues talked with shultz about a package that might 
include the promise of financial help to nicaragua if the 
sandinistas bring about promised democratic reforms 
even a qualified offer of aid to nicaragua would represent a 
sharp turnaround in us policy the reagan administration cut off 
all direct aid to nicaragua seven years ago and has applied an 
economic embargo for the past four years 
adolfo calero another contra leader said 7 million of the aid 
to the rebels might be earmarked for military hardware but would 
be held in escrow and released only if the sandinistas failed to 
negotiate in good faith during peace talks 
calero however described the talks with shultz as only 
informal consultations and the secretary himself declined to 
discuss them the reagan administration has said only that congress 
will be asked to approve an unspecified amount of new assistance to 
the rebels 
at a news conference between two formal meetings with arias 
shultz said the administration is seeking obviously to support 
those who stand up and are ready to struggle against the 
sandinistas 
but as he did throughout his trip shultz devoted most of his 
comments to comparing nicaragua unfavorably with the rest of 
central america only nicaragua he said has suffered economic and 
social decline in the past decade 
the contras have received no military aid since feb 29 
congress approved a 17 million humanitarian aid package in late 
march after the rebels and the sandinista government agreed on a 
60day ceasefire 
nicaraguas president daniel ortega unilaterally extended the 
ceasefire earlier this week until july 31 and arias said that 
gave new hope to the negotiating process which he has been 
championing for more than a year 
the onagain offagain talks have been held under the aegis of 
an ariassponsored peace plan signed by all five central american 
presidents last aug 7 the plan won arias the 1987 nobel peace 
prize 
the five presidents plan to meet again in august to assess 
progress of the peace plan arias said shultz suggested meeting 
personally with the foreign ministers of honduras guatemala el 
salvador and costa rica shortly before that summit 
now that the truce has been extended 30 days more im sure 
that we should take advantage of that extension and keep on with 
the dialoque arias said im sure we can reach a ceasefire 
soon and also to advance to real democracy in nicaragua really 
soon 
there is no better way to resolve the crisis than through 
negotiations dialoque arias said adding that he had conveyed 
the same message to shultz 
arias also said he agreed with shultz proposal that the 
secretary of state meet with the four foreign ministers before the 
summit tentatively set for aug 7 in either guatemala or el 
salvador nicaragua would be excluded from the preliminary meeting 
but not from the summit itself

staterun television interrupted its usual bland 
fare for spicy live interviews after a disgraced leader pleaded 
for forgiveness in a dramatic speech at a national communist party 
conference 
one delegate told a television correspondent that the conference 
discussion about ousted moscow party chief boris n yeltsin was a 
healthy sign that democracy and glasnost leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of openness was taking hold 
we can speak our minds openly and directly without being 
afraid of anything said ivan i maximov a balding metalworker 
from the siberian town of biisk 
during a friday afternoon break in the final session of the 
first party conference in 47 years soviet television broadcast the 
live interviews in the lobby of the kremlins palace of congresses 
with some of the 5000 delegates 
most of the discussion during the broadcast focused on what one 
delegate called the highlight of fridays session of the fourday 
conference the speech by yeltsin a former gorbachev protege 
its the most heated discussion we have heard in a long 
time a grayhaired delegate told the television correspondent 
a studio anchorman began the 30minute broadcast and then 
switched live to the correspondent on the scene 
delegates had just ended floor debate about yeltsins speech in 
which he asked to be cleared of blame for criticizing other soviet 
leaders and saying reform was proceeding too slowly 
the discussion spilled over into the television interviews some 
delegates told viewers they supported yeltsin while others 
condemned his remarks as politically incorrect 
yeltsin was fired as moscow party boss and removed from his post 
as a nonvoting member of the ruling politburo after a bitter 
speech to the partys central committee last october in which he 
complained that economic reforms had stalled and asked to be 
relieved of his duties his speech at that meeting has never been 
published 
maximov the delegate from biisk said it is difficult for 
people to make up their minds about whether yeltsins criticism was 
justified because his central committee speech remains secret 
glasnost must be deep then such questions wouldnt arise he 
told the television interviewer 
during the conference soviet television and radio provided 
periodic newsbriefs with highlights of speeches and live interviews 
with delegates 
the popular evening news program vremya which reportedly 
has a nightly audience of tens of millions of soviets departed 
from its usual fare of dull reports about the latest beet harvest 
or other economic achievement to carry extensive coverage on the 
party conference 
the nightly program normally runs 45 minutes but friday it 
continued for three hours with extensive clips of yeltsins address 
and remarks by his critics 
videotape showed yeltsin appealing for political rehabilitation 
and when there was a roar from the delegates gorbachev waved his 
hands and asked that yeltsin be allowed to continue 
vremya directors apparently felt the yeltsin issue was so 
important that they continued showing the taped reports even after 
gorbachev began his speech closing the conference soviet radio 
carried gorbachevs speech live and vremya later broadcast a 
recording

finally making it big in america after passing up a chance at 
national exposure six years ago 
in 1982 midnight oil turned down an offer to be the opening act 
on the whos farewell tour partly because garrett and his five

people who received unsolicited pornography 
sparked an investigation that authorities said resulted in federal 
charges against companies responsible for much of the countrys 
sexually oriented mailings 
indictments unsealed friday in eight states charged 20 people 
and 14 companies under a section of federal law that makes it a 
crime to use the mails for advertising or distributing obscene 
material 
project postporn the official moniker for the justice 
departmentpostal service probe specifically targeted hardcore 
pornography which depicts actual sexual acts 
mailings usually arrived at homes addressed to adults children 
or simply resident said brent ward us attorney for utah and 
chairman of the attorney generals subcommittee on obscenity 
they arrive unsolicited in innocuouslooking envelopes in the 
homes of unsuspecting people who have never subscribed to 
pornography do not want it in their homes and are never going to 
order any obscene material ward said at a justice department 
news conference friday 
jack swagerty assistant chief postal inspector said such 
mailings had increased in recent years prompting more than 350000 
people to file postal service forms requesting that they not 
receive sexually oriented material though the mail about 100000 
of them were filed in the last year he said 
the investigation began a year ago in response to complaints 
officials said ward said it had targeted only hardcore 
obscenity which the us supreme court has held is not protected by 
the first amendment 
the supreme courts test of obscenity is that the material 
taken as a whole has to appeal to prurient interest portray 
sexual conduct in a patently offensive way in light of contemporary 
community standards and lack serious artistic political or 
scientific value 
a 1986 report by attorney general edwin meeses pornography 
commission linked hardcore pornography to sex crimes ward 
restated that view friday when asked by reporters whether the 
material had actually caused any harm 
i think its an accepted fact that the depiction of explicit 
sex acts has the effect of conditioning individuals to 
committing those acts and conditioning society so that that is 
accepted as the norm he said 
but barry lynn legislative counsel for the american civil 
liberties union denounced that view as hysteria and said it 
conflicted with the first amendment guaranteeing the right of free 
speech 
there isnt any evidence that links adults looking at 
pornography to any real crime he said in an interview later 
it may be grotesque but much of the stuff is just obviously 
consenting adults having sex 
ward said the targeted material depicts sexual acts often in 
a context of violence toward women and children and often 
stressing themes such as rape incest torture bondage child 
sexual abuse and bestiality 
the officials displayed at the news conference samples of the 
advertisements which included one promoting nine fulllength 
movies for 79 featuring 12 hours of the rawest sex ever 
filmed another advertised new bondage videos including 
captive coeds and harem girls in bondage 
undercover agents responding to complaints about the material 
purchased samples and compiled evidence to search 11 companies and 
then developed evidence on others officials said ward said the 
companies represent as much as threefourths of mailings of 
sexually oriented material in this country 
the companies charged operated under a variety of names and had 
a number of other associated companies indictments or criminal 
complaints were returned in sioux city iowa buffalo ny 
harrisburg pa tallahassee fla nashville and memphis tenn 
fort worth texas salt lake city utah and spokane wash the 
criminal charges were filed in the city where the obscene material 
was received not necessarily where the distributors operated

soviet missile specialists arrived in 
california on friday to verify compliance with a treaty to 
eliminate superpower mediumrange missiles as a us inspection 
team made its way to moscow 
in california vyacheslav s lebedev the soviet team chief 
said through an interpreter that his inspectors will follow the 
letter and spirit of a treaty they hope will further world peace 
the 70 soviet inspectors arrived at travis air force base 
located about 50 miles west of san francisco on an il62 aeroflot 
flown by a 10member soviet crew 
the soviet government notified the united states early friday 
that five teams were landing in san francisco said kendall pease 
spokesman for the us onsite inspection agency created last 
january to monitor compliance with the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty 
under the treaty signed last dec 9 at the washington summit 
the soviets need not list the sites they want to visit until they 
have been in the united states 48 hours pease said 
other soviet teams will inspect sites in the eastern united 
states but their arrival time has not been relayed to the united 
states pease said 
the teams have 60 days to carry out the baseline 
inspections designed to verify the exact number of missiles and 
related components to be destroyed under treaty 
in frankfurt west germany two us inspection teams 
consisting of 10 experts each met with reporters before boarding 
an air force jet for the flight to moscow 
we all feel this is a historic mission the head of the 
inspection agency army brig gen roland lajoie told reporters 
one us team was headed from moscow to the soviet city of 
votkinsk the site of a plant that formerly built the ss20 
missiles the most important soviet weapon to be eliminated under 
the treaty 
the united states has the right to keep a team at votkinsk for 
up to 13 years and the soviets may station inspectors for the same 
period at magna utah site of hercules plant no 1 where us 
missiles were produced 
inspection teams will verify destruction of 1800 missiles and 
check on about 3200 related components including storage and 
transport missile containers and special hauling vehicles lajoie 
told reporters 
were going in with the attitude trust everybody but always 
cut the cards lajoie said 
over the next 60 days the us team will inspect 126 sites in 
the soviet union including 33 in eastern siberia he said 
soviet teams will inspect 26 sites in the united states and 
western europe including 11 in the continental united states us 
officials said 
the treaty allows the two sides to visit the others country on 
16 hours notice then permits them to wait 48 hours before giving 
notification of the exact sites to be visited reporters were not 
to be allowed to accompany the teams 
the pact the first to allow such onsite inspection is viewed 
as a trial for the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty which 
would slash arsenals of longrange superpower nuclear weapons by 30 
percent to 50 percent and involve much more complicated 
verification procedures

agriculture secretary richard lyng says the 
government will likely extend a helping hand to 
droughtstricken farmers as soon as theres a solid assessment of 
crop damage 
but lyng said despite stark evidence of the havoc wreaked by the 
dry spell i think it would be premature to start putting dollars 
up there 
after briefing president reagan on the findings of an 
interagency task force on the drought the secretary told reporters 
friday that longrange weather forecasts are discouraging 
we did have some showers in the last few days that helped in 
some places and the weathers cooler so those are good signs he 
said but the weather forecasts indicate that it the drought 
has not broken and is continuing and is still very very serious 
meanwhile it was disclosed by a senior administration official 
that reagan will fly to davenport iowa july 14 to view drought 
damage 
lyng who heads a droughtrelief task force reagan set up last 
month said that sooner or later i suspect that the congress and 
the administration will see that we need to help with money if the 
thing continues as bad as its been just how you do that is very 
complex 
lyng would not speculate on whether aid money might be available 
from the roughly 17 billion in the commodity price support 
payments the administration requested for the new budget year 
starting oct 1 there had been indications that because of the 
drought not all of the 17 billion would be needed for subsidies 
and that the excess money might be used for aid purposes 
to get into writing checks to farmers for relief to help tide 
them over almost needs to await the normal harvest period so that 
they can compare what they are harvesting what happened to them 
he said at that time we should be standing there with a helping 
hand 
it was the fourth briefing that lyng has given reagan who 
established the task force in midjune to recommend steps the 
government can take

a presidential panel trying to resolve a 
dispute between the chicago amp northwestern transportation co and 
one of its unions is offering a compromise that would preserve some 
jobs and prevent a threatened strike 
the white house released a 29page report late friday in which 
an emergency board said both sides should make sacrifices 
the report also recommended arbitration if the nations 
eighthlargest railroad and the united transportation union cannot 
agree on specific personnel cuts 
at issue is a cnw proposal to eliminate the jobs of 1050 utu 
brakemen by cutting the size of its train crews from four to two 
workers an engineer and conductor in most cases 
spokeswoman leslie cleveland said chicago amp northwestern could 
save about 51 million a year by reducing manpower calling it a 
necessary step to remain competitive 
however the union characterized the cuts affecting half its cnw 
members as a contract violation and demanded no change from the 
status quo 
it threatened to strike on april 22 prompting president reagan 
to appoint the emergency board under the railway labor act 
the carrier unlike many of the other railroads in the 
industry has an economic need for relief from its present 
crewconsist rules the board said this is not to say 
that the employees alone should be expected to bear the burden 
although the board said cnw should be allowed to eliminate one 
brakemen per train it recommended that further reductions be 
decided by an arbitration board casebycase 
the panel also said cnw should be able to terminate some workers 
if not enough accept voluntary separation allowances but it also 
recommended raising the railroads proposed 25000 allowance to 
50000 for employees leaving voluntarily and 45000 for those 
forced into separation 
company officials said they had not seen the report and had no 
immediate comment friday 
donald f markgraf the unions general chairman said these 
things work out in strange ways sometimes were still hoping for a 
settlement 
a strike cannot begin before 1201 am aug 4 said roland 
watkins an administrative assistant to the emergency board 
chicago amp northwestern ranks eighth among us railroads in 
revenue and handled nearly 15 million carloads of traffic in 1986 
it also provides the principal daily rail service for about 40000 
commuters in the chicago area

speculation over vice presidential candidates continues to be 
the hottest topic for both parties with little political fireworks 
in store for the start of the holiday weekend 
democrat michael dukakis and republican george bush their 
parties presidential nominations sewn up arent tipping their 
hands over running mates 
dukakis campaigning friday with sen john glenn in ohio said 
he would make a decision when im ready to make a decision 
glenn considered a leading choice for a spot on the democratic 
ticket received an enthusiastic welcome from a homestate crowd at 
an auto workers union hall in dayton 
ive been taking a poll all over america about running 
mates said dukakis what do you think about john glenn 
the crowded cheered and whistled 
sounds unanimous to me said the massachusetts governor 
bush meanwhile was spending a quiet few days at a vacation 
home in kennebunkport maine before heading back to the campaign 
trail for a fourth of july swing through michigan illinois and 
missouri 
what little activity there was on the gop side was provided by 
sen bob dole who fenced with reporters in california over his 
vice presidential chances 
id be happy to discuss it with the bush campaign dole 
said if someone makes that call you talk about it very 
seriously 
the kansas republican met with reporters following a private 
breakfast in sacramento with gov george deukmejian of california 
another possible bush running mate 
dole asked if they discussed the vice presidential nomination 
said we indicated there probably would be one we didnt go into 
details i indicated hed be a good one and he indicated the same 
that id be a good one 
dukakis is back in boston today with plans to cap the holiday 
weekend by hosting jesse jackson at a fourth of july dinner 
with two weeks until the democratic national convention in 
atlanta dukakis is playing it close to the vest on a running mate 
he said he expects to notify those he doesnt choose before 
making any public announcement 
i generally have the practice of notifying people i dont 
pick he said but declined to say whether jackson might get the 
word at dinner on monday 
were going to have dinner and listen to some good music he 
said 
dukakis invited jackson and his wife jacqueline to join him 
and his wife kitty for a holiday dinner at their home in 
brookline mass and then attend a boston pops concert 
in another development with possible political ramifications 
sources said appraisals of land in new braintree mass where 
state officials want to build a 500bed prison list the propertys 
value at between 5 million and 6 million that is well below the 
95 million developers sought when the state became interested in 
the land two years ago 
the appraisals are being reviewed by a third company which is 
scheduled to submit its estimate of the propertys worth next week 
all three will be used by the state to determine how much to offer 
for the 782 acres bought by two developers in december 1985 for 3 
million 
the selection of the new braintree site in 1986 by dukakis for a 
500bed medium security prison has been controversial from the 
outset with local residents claiming a prison would ruin the tiny 
central massachusetts community 
the fbi is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations 
that the dukakis administration leaked word of its interest in the 
land to the developers who bought it from a church the fbi has 
said dukakis is not under investigation

defense contractor martin marietta corp says 
it bought a florida health club once owned in part by a congressman 
who chairs a military appropriations subcommittee because the 
purchase appears to have been a good investment 
martin marietta disclosed friday it bought the club in ocala 
little more than a year after a company executive and other 
partners reportedly rescued rep bill chappell from foreclosure on 
the property 
martin marietta issued a statement saying that a company 
subsidiary bought fun and fitness of ocala inc on may 30 1986 
for 200000 from a group of five private investors who had 
purchased the property for 175000 in a bank foreclosure process 
the company said the corporation was aware at the time that 
chappell dfla had held a prior interest in the racquet club 
one of the five private investors had been george l dalferes 
vice president of government affairs at martin marietta 
headquarters in bethesda md just outside washington 
martin marietta said its purchase appears to have been a good 
investment because the property has a market value in excess of the 
purchase price 
chappell said friday he had kept an arms length away from 
the transaction in which the investors all representatives of 
defense contractors reportedly intervened for him 
chappell chairman of the house appropriations defense 
subcommittee refused to discuss details of the complex 
transaction reported friday by the washington post 
but in a statement issued by his office he said if you are 
going to do something wrong you dont do it on the public record 
this entire transaction is a matter of public record it has been 
since its inception several years ago 
chappell has said he is not a target in the ongoing criminal 
investigation of pentagon weaponsbuying that investigation 
involves allegations that defense contractors and consultants many 
of them former military men bribed pentagon officials for 
contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth 
billions of dollars 
the post reported that the racquet club of ocala inc intervened 
in late 1984 to cancel chappells and his partners personal 
liability for a large part of their indebtedness and also removed 
the two men as defendants in a suit related to the health clubs 
foreclosure 
the principal officers of racquet club of ocala were leonard 
killgore and dalferes killgore a former chappell aide was then 
an official with the washington office of avco corp a rocket 
builder the newspaper said 
a florida court had ruled in november 1984 that chappell and his 
partner william w austin personally had guaranteed some 172000 
of the overall obligation in the failed club the post said 
the december 1984 settlement resulted in killgore and his 
investment partners obtaining the health club and its properties 
for 175000 chappells statement noted 
chappells statement said this property was appraised by the 
bank at 425000 according to public record the purchaser sold 
the property for at least a 20000 profit 13 months later 
there was absolutely no benefit to me either way he said 
the transaction changed no legal responsibilities with reference 
to bill chappell no consideration of any sort passed to bill 
chappell it was an arms length transaction as supported by 
public record

tamil militants in sri lanka are ready 
to surrender but negotiations have stalled because the rebels are 
demanding 384 million from the indian government tamil sources 
said 
sources close to the rebels in colombo speaking on condition of 
anonymity said friday the militants were not willing to allow 
monitoring of how the money was spent 
in the southern indian city of madras sadasivam krishnakumar a 
senior member of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam was quoted 
as saying the group was willing to surrender but awaited final 
orders from its commander 
the tigers the largest rebel group in sri lanka have been at 
the forefront of the fiveyear guerrilla war with the ethnic 
sinhalesedominated government for an independent tamil homeland 
india which has 50000 peacekeeping troops in sri lanka has 
been trying to negotiate an end to the separatist war in the 
neighboring island nation 
the sri lankan government on thursday offered amnesty to the 
rebels and promised to conduct provincial elections by the end of 
july in northern and eastern sri lanka where the rebels want a 
separate homeland 
the united news of india quoted krishnakumar as telling 
reporters in madras that the tigers would participate in the 
provincial electionsbut he said no decision had been made on 
whether the tigers organization would participate in the elections 
itself or would form a new political party the news agency said 
it quoted krishnakumar as saying the tigers would hand over 
their weapons as soon as an agreement was reached on the timing of 
a surrender and the number of arms to be given up 
he also said a final decision would be taken only after 
consultations with the tigers commander velupillai prabhakaran 
prabhakaran is based in sri lanka and has successfully eluded a 
series of manhunts by indian troops 
last july 29 india and sri lanka signed a peace accord aimed at 
ending the ethnic warfare in the island nation off indias southern 
coast the tigers accepted the accord but reneged in october 
the accord was accompanied by a payment of 384600 by the 
indian government to the rebels for rehabilitation of people 
affected by the fighting 
since october more than 400 indian soldiers have been killed in 
ambushes and battles with the tamil rebels according to the indian 
government 
neither the indians nor the tamils have estimated the number of 
rebel deaths 
in the latest reported violence seven indian soldiers were 
killed in two ambushes thursday said sri lankan military officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity they said four were killed 
near trincomalee 150 miles north of colombo and three were killed 
near vavuniya 110 miles north of colombo 
two tamils were killed in vavuniya during search operations 
launched friday by the indians the officials said 
the tamil insurgency grew out of the belief the community was 
being discriminated against by the sinhalese ethnic majority which 
controls the countrys government and armed forces 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
the sinhalese form 75 percent most tamils are hindus like the 
majority of indians while most sinhalese are buddhists 
india became involved in the sri lankan ethnic strife because of 
the sympathies of its own 60 million tamils to the rebel cause

national lawmakers are preparing 
for final voting on the draft of a new constitution that would 
reject sweeping land reform but liberalize work rules and end 
foreign control of mining 
the new charter for south americas largest country would also 
give president jose sarney and his successors a fiveyear term a 
victory for the national leader 
the proposed document was born in five months of heated debate 
in the congress doubling as a constitutional convention it has 
come up 235 articles that will be the basis for the eighth 
constitution in the 166 years of brazils independence from 
portugal 
the final round of voting is expected to start near the end of 
july but the document appears largely to have assumed its final 
form because a hefty 280 votes in the 559member convention would 
be needed to change it 
the convention made up of representatives and senators picked 
in free elections in 1986 began rewriting the current 
constitution dictated during a 19641985 military regime in 
february 1987 
the project started with a computergenerated document touching 
nearly every aspect of life imaginable in this country of about 140 
million people it then progressed to a first draft of more than 
3000 articles which critics derided as an encyclopedia 
the real paring began last february with articlebyarticle 
voting in which a majority of 280 was needed for approval 
lawmakers debated vociferously sometimes violently especially 
about issues like land reform workers rights and the role of 
foreign capital 
other hotly contested matters involved how long sarney the 
civilian who assumed office in 1985 should stay there and whether 
brazil should have a ustype presidential form of government or a 
europeanstyle prime minister system 
as it stands the proposed constitution contains these 
provisions 
sarney and future presidents will serve for five years 
compared to the six years of former military presidents the 
presidential system remains in place 
wideranging land reform in a country where 4 percent of the 
people own 50 percent of the farmable land was rejected 
workers appear headed for a shorter work week and more liberal 
vacation benefits but a liberal maternity leave program might not 
survive the final vote because businesses view it as too expensive 
foreign companies involved in mining will have to leave brazil 
in four years or transfer financial control to residents of the 
country 
risk contracts allowing foreign companies to drill for oil 
probably wont be continued 
the return of legalized casino gambling was rejected 
the biggest fight broke out between sarney and convention 
members over the length of the presidential term 
tancredo neves a moderate who said he wanted only four years as 
president before holding elections died before taking office in 
1985 brazils last presidential election was in 1960 sarney vice 
presidentelect and former chief of the military regimes official 
party moved into the presidency 
he made it clear he believed he had inherited the sixyear term 
of his military predecessor gen joao figueiredo but said he 
would consider stepping down after five years 
however many congressmen wanted sarney out after four years 
with presidential elections in november 1988 
sarney won his five years in the constitutional debating but at 
the cost of splitting his brazilian democratic movement party 
various groups are still seeking changes in the final form of 
the document 
a conservative block known as the big center is trying to 
gain support to strike the antiforeign articles involving mining 
and oil prospecting and a proposition allowing civil servants 
strike under certain circumstances

five firemen killed when a burning roof 
collapsed onto them were like family in this city which had 
never had a firefighter die in the line of duty 
there are only 100 of us in this department and this is just a 
small place fire chief anthony aiellos said friday in a town 
like this these are your friends 
its a sad day in hackensack added mayor fred cerbo 
weve never had anything like this in our city before to have 
five firemen die is just incredible 
the fire which destroyed the building and contents of a car 
dealership started shortly after 3 pm friday in the rear service 
section of the building aiellos said 
the ceiling collapsed as the firefighters who were inside the 
building were cutting a hole in it to get a hose on flames in a 
space between the ceiling and the roof aiellos said the five were 
killed almost instantly 
all of a sudden the entire 60 foot square inside ceiling fell 
on them he said adding that four other firefighters inside at 
the time escaped injury 
the fire apparently started in the space between the ceiling and 
roof above the dealerships service area aiellos said the men 
were spraying the space to try to create a fog to decrease the 
fires heat he said 
they did what they were supposed to do aiellos said 
all of hackensacks 100 firefighters as well as units from 
surrounding towns responded to the blaze which was under control 
by 630 pm 
later fire investigators picked through the debris but the 
roof collapse may make it impossible to find the exact cause 
aiellos said a damage estimate was not immediately available 
hundreds of bystanders watched along the busy intersection in 
this new york suburb of 40000 people while the firefighters 
bodies were placed in ambulances many clutched friends when 
stretchers bearing the bodies came briefly into view 
the victims were capt richard williams 54 lt richard 
reinhogen 48 and firefighters william krejsa 52 leonard 
radumski 38 and stephen ennis 30 all five were from hackensack 
all the employees of hackensack ford were evacuated without 
injuries police said there were no other firefighters injured 
cerbo said a memorial service would be held next week aiellos 
planned to meet with the families today after autopsies are 
performed 
these were good men he said and there are a lot of 
kids 
the fatalities were the first deaths in action in hackensack 
fire department history aiellos said 
hackensack only four square miles in size has many longtime 
residents who will be hit hard by the deaths he said 
at the departments headquarters a wreath and an american flag 
at half staff paid tribute to the victims 
it was like losing a member of your family firefighter tom 
canzanella said

the national institutes of health plans to 
continue a 20 million artificial heart research program that had 
been scheduled to be shelved in the fall according to senate and 
administration officials 
the reversal means that research contracts at centers in six 
states wont be halted at the end of september but rather will 
continue for about 5 years as originally planned the programs 
goal is to develop a totally implantable electric heart 
the national heart lung and blood institute part of nih said 
in may that it was suspending the program at the end of the fiscal 
year and shifting its focus instead to developing a left 
ventricular assist device which would help a diseased heart pump 
blood 
the decision provoked an outcry from senators in the states 
where the research centers are located they called the decision 
an alarming uturn and said the artificial heart program was a 
key component of the nations leadership in biotechnology 
sens orrin hatch rutah and edward m kennedy dmass had 
threatened in a letter to insert an amendment into an 
appropriations bill to compel the heart lung and blood institute 
to continue the contracts prior to undertaking new obligations 
word that the contracts were being revived first came from 
hatch who relayed the news to a utah center with a 55 million 
contract at stake 
we heard and confirmed that the contract had been reinstated 
as of the end of the fiscal year so that there will be no 
funding break roger bliss of the university of utahs 
institute for biomedical engineering said in a telephone interview 
friday 
it was originally announced by senator hatch and confirmed 
through our contacts at nih bliss said 
hatch told the deseret news in utah that he was told by claude 
lenfant director of the nih institute that artificial heart 
funding was being restored hatch called the decision good news 
for the millions who will need artificial hearts or their 
components 
there has been no announcement yet by nih that the program is 
being resumed 
however an nih official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the practicality is that a decision has been made and 
that an announcement was expected as soon as next week 
the official stressed that the decision was not just a quick 
fix and that it was anticipated that the program would continue as 
originally planned 
besides the university of utah the other centers conducting the 
research are the hershey medical center of pennsylvania state 
university abiomed inc of danvers mass which is working with 
the texas heart institute of houston and the nimbus co of rancho 
cordova calif which is working with the cleveland clinic in ohio 
the contracts begin early this year in announcing that the 
pacts were being suspended the nih institute cited budgetary 
constraints and said it was not abandoning the total artificial 
heart concept 
so far all five patients who received the jarvik7 artificial 
heart as a permanent implantation have died within two years the 
jarvik7 runs on compressed air and uses a portable power pack or 
other external machine the program temporarily suspended by nih is 
for development of an electric totally implantable heart

despite rising teacher pay the president 
of the american federation of teachers warns that rough days lie 
ahead for public schools unless there are radical changes in the 
nations education system 
albert shanker said he would deliver that message in his keynote 
address today to 3000 aft delegates at the start of their biennial 
convention 
shankers union released a report friday that indicated us 
teacher salaries are at a record high 28085 on average in 
198788 and starting pay is up to 18557 on average 
but shanker an outspoken critic of traditional school 
structures argues that schools fail to deliver an adequate 
education to 80 percent of all students he recently proposed 
allowing groups of six to 12 teachers experiment with running their 
own schoolswithinschools 
he said in an interview that if teachers dont take the lead in 
persuading the public to restructure schools were going to end 
up being dismantled out of existence 
at a meeting of local aft presidents friday patrick orourke 
president of the unions innovative hammond ind local suggested 
that the union convene a special conference next summer to look at 
its own structure 
maybe we need to take a real hard look at the union from the 
bottom up orourke said even the soviet republic is doing 
that 
two aft vice presidents sandra feldman the head of new yorks 
united federation of teachers and edward mcelroy head of the 
rhode island federation told the 125 local presidents that the 
executive council already is doing some selfexamination 
the delegates will vote sunday on whether to expand the council 
from 36 to 40 members 
shanker 59 president of the nations secondlargest teachers 
union since 1974 is running for reelection monday with no 
announced opposition 
the 665000member aft represents nearly a halfmillion of the 
nations 24 million public school teachers primarily in big 
cities the 19 millionmember national education association 
which opens its convention monday in new orleans is the nations 
largest teachers union with 15 million teachers 
mcelroy distributed a letter he sent to shanker in january 
urging a wideranging review of the union we seem to take for 
granted that the people who have led our unions for the past 20 
years will always be there he wrote 
the aft salary report singled out connecticut as the state with 
the biggest increase in average salaries last year 158 percent to 
33776 fifth in the nation 
the highestpaid teachers are in alaska where they received 
40510 on average the lowestpaid are in arkansas with an 
average of 20340 last year the aft said 
the report said teachers earned 17 percent more on average than 
all american workers in 1987 and 10 percent more than all 
government workers 
on tuesday the delegates will hear from democratic presidential 
candidates michael dukakis and jesse jackson via a satellite 
television hookup 
also on the conventions agenda is the consideration of several 
resolutions including one that would put the union on record as 
opposing standardized tests for kindergarten students

a former kuwait airways sales manager has been 
sentenced to six months in prison for stealing 25 million from 
the airline in what the defendant claimed was a plan with the cia 
to woo moderates in iran 
but the federal prosecutor in the case immediately criticized 
fridays decision by us district judge george revercomb who 
acknowledged the sentence will strike some as extremely lenient 
robert m sensi received a threeyear sentence with all but six 
months suspended for 21 counts of mail fraud theft and interstate 
transportation of stolen securities 
a further order credited sensi with the four months he spent in 
a british jail following his 1986 arrest which means he will only 
serve two months

the white house has announced that president 
reagan intends to nominate charles stalon a holdover member of the 
federal energy regulatory commission to serve additional time on 
the commission 
stalon 58 filled an unexpired term when he came to the 
commission in 1984 that term ran out last october but the law 
permits him to stay on for a year as long as no successor has been 
sworn in 
fridays announcement said stalon who fills one of the two 
mandatory democratic seats would fill the remainder of michael 
naeves term which would have expired in october 1989 had he not 
resigned in march 
the commissions membership remains uncertain because martha o 
hesse has not been confirmed as chairman a year after her 
nomination anthony sousa has resigned effective later this month 
and charles trabandts term expires in october

abelardo barbosa a freewheeling 
comic who liked to say his goal was to confuse everything but who 
worked to forge a distinctly brazilian style of television died of 
a heart attack he was 70 
barbosa known on his amateur hour as chacrinha or barnyard 
in portuguese succumbed at his home in rio de janeiro late 
thursday his family announced friday he had been ill for several 
months 
his body lay in state friday at city hall where hundreds of 
fans and wellwishers mostly poor lined up to pay respects riot 
police took positions outside to prevent any emotional tumult among 
mourners 
the entertainer was born in brazils poor northeast region and 
graduated from medical school there but he never practiced as a 
doctor gravitating in the 1940s to rio de janeiro and radio he 
became a disc jockey and emcee 
the entertainer delighted generations of brazilian radio and 
television fans with his own brand of unpredictable antics 
when television came to brazil in the 1960s barbosa became a 
legend with a amateur show called chacrinhas horn 
his nonsense slogans and silly rhymes caught on throughout the 
country media critics said he represented the essence of 
brazilianness and prevented television here from turning into 
an american clone 
in a rare serious moment in an interview years ago barbosa said 
he felt he had brought a certain brazilian originality to 
television which he viewed as subject to foreign mostly american 
influence 
on chacrinhas horn chacrinha an overweight man with thick 
glasses and curly white hair generally sported an outlandish 
outfit making him look like a clown if he did not appreciate 
performers he would honk a horn in their faces and send them away 
in disgrace prompting thunderous laughter from the audience 
the program also highlighted brazils leading pop music singers 
and rock groups gogo girls gyrated in the background smoke bombs 
exploded on stage and cameras cut crazily from one shot to another 
with no apparent logic 
ive come here to confuse everything he often said in 
nosetight closeups and the phrase caught on nationwide 
he also delighted fans with such gratuitous behavior as 
brandishing a pineapple or a slab of dried codfish and taunting the 
audience who wants this 
me me everyone would shout 
well you cant have it this stuffs expensive he would 
retort and lob the item out of reach

thousands of valuable racing pigeons have failed 
to find their way home from france since they flew off june 25 in a 
crosschannel competition 
pigeon owners believe the pigeons internal navigation systems 
were thrown off course possibly by microwave ovens radar signals 
radio frequencies or a solar flare 
mary hamilton secretary of the sheffield and district homing 
pigeon federation called it a disaster on a vast scale 
more than 5000 birds were released in nevers france for what 
should have been a 14hour sprint home to northern england where 
pigeon racing is a popular betting sport 
but by friday night only 1500 had arrived home 
the really appalling thing from the pigeon fanciers point of 
view is that these are the best birds said ornithologist chris 
mead some of the pigeons are worth more than 54300 
the pigeons use the earths magnetic field to navigate and 
several theories have emerged to explain how they got lost 
derek towers secretary and manager of the up north combine 
thought a solar flare an explosion of gases on the surface of the 
sun upset the birds 
electrically charged particles are sent out through space and 
when they reach us it disorients the pigeons he said this 
happened once before years ago when a magnetic pulse went through 
the atmosphere 
mrs hamilton said the weather which has been temperate was 
probably not to blame it is very puzzling she said 
some owners believe it was due to airplanes breaking down the 
sound barrier which sent the pigeons off course she said 
others blame microwave ovens radar and radio signals 
if aerosols can punch a hole in the atmosphere these ideas 
may not be as silly as they first sound she said 
mrs hamilton said many of the pigeon owners in sheffield which 
entered 600 birds in the race were holding vigils from dawn to 
dusk in the hope of spotting their birds 
the british broadcasting corp reported friday that at least one 
bird had been found among the street pigeons that congregate in 
londons trafalgar square

defense fraud scandal figure melvyn r 
paisley was the subject of an fbi probe while he was assistant navy 
secretary in 1983 that examined allegations of bribery and 
electronic eavesdropping the los angeles times reported today 
however a us attorney declined to prosecute paisley following 
the probe that covered a time when he was an executive for the 
boeing company the newspaper reported in todays editions 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella jr dismissed the 
report as a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been 
examined many times 
according to the times paisleys main accuser was james e 
durst who was an executive with paisley at the boeing co durst 
who left boeing in 1977 said he told the fbi that paisley 
presented an extraordinary risk to the security of the united 
states 
the fbi presented its findings on paisleys activities while at 
boeing to thenus attorney elsie munsell whose alexandria va 
office is heading a nationwide investigation into defense 
procurement fraud 
the newspaper citing an unidentified source familiar with the 
investigation said ms munsell declined to prosecute paisley in 
part because the statute of limitations on the electronic 
eavesdropping which allegedly took place in 1970 had expired 
she also declined to prosecute the source said because boeing 
on whose behalf paisley had allegedly paid bribes had already 
pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least 7 
million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win 
airline orders 
paisley who has worked as a consultant since he left his navy 
post last year is one of the central figures in the ongoing 
defense procurement fraud probe federal investigators contend that 
after leaving the pentagon paisley obtained classified information 
about defense contracts and sold it to his clients 
ms munsell declined to discuss the investigations conducted 
during her fiveyear tenure as us attorney 
henry e hudson who succeeded her in 1986 and who is managing 
the pentagon fraud investigation also declined to comment 
barcella who had worked as a federal prosecutor for 16 years 
minimized the significance of fbi agents presenting their 
investigation of paisley to a us attorney 
that doesnt necessarily indicate the fbi thought there was a 
case he said there were thousands of petty things agents came 
to me with 
barcella also described durst as a disgruntled former employee 
whose record on credibility is pretty thin 
in addition to naming paisley durst also implicated james e 
gaines paisleys aide at boeing in a threepage letter dated oct 
10 1983 that he sent to the fbi 
gaines who also worked for paisley as a deputy at the pentagon 
is accused of supplying classified material to paisley when the 
former navy official left the service to become a defense 
consultant according to sources close to the investigation

defense consultant melvyn paisley has gone to 
court to get the affidavit secretly filed by federal investigators 
to search his office for evidence in the pentagon bribery probe 
paisleys lawyers in their request friday for us district 
judge john h pratt to expedite consideration of their motion said 
they needed the affidavit to help advise their client on how to 
comply with numerous subpoenas issued in the case those 
subpoenas are due on july 19 according to the court papers 
e lawrence barcella and robert plotkin attorneys representing 
paisley and his wife vicki asked pratt to convene a july 8 
hearing to consider their request to obtain the supporting 
affidavit 
additionally the massive and pervasive publicity given this 
matter already may have irreparably tainted the decisionmaking 
process of the grand jury and seal may prevent further taint the 
lawyers said in asking the judge to keep under seal their detailed 
request to see the affidavit 
in a related development the los angeles times reported in 
todays editions that sources have told the newspaper paisley was 
the subject of a 1983 fbi probe that examined allegations of 
bribery and electronic eavesdropping 
the newspaper citing an unidentified source familiar with the 
1983 investigation said thenus attorney elsie munsell declined 
to prosecute paisley following the probe in part because the 
statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping which 
allegedly took place in 1970 had expired 
she also declined to prosecute the source said because the 
boeing company on whose behalf paisley had allegedly paid bribes 
had already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at 
least 7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help 
win airline orders 
both ms munsell and henry e hudson who succeeded her in 1986 
and is now managing the pentagon fraud investigation declined 
comment 
barcella dismissed the report as a regurgitation of unfounded 
allegations that have been examined many times 
the justice department meanwhile took steps to ensure that no 
additional affidavits or search warrants are disclosed in the 
pentagon bribery probe 
most of the affidavits which the fbi is required to submit to 
justify a search remain sealed but two were released thursday by a 
us magistrate in dallas they reveal that courtordered wiretaps 
and office bugging devices captured the relay of confidential 
inside information on nine defense contracts worth more than 522 
million 
the magistrate in dallas released the two affidavits because the 
government had asked that they remain sealed for 14 days until 
june 30 
the government also has opposed a motion by united technologies 
and eugene tallia head of pratt amp whitneys washington offices to 
allow them and their legal counsel to view an affidavit that 
supported a search warrant for the offices the facilities were 
searched june 14 the search focused on the relationship between 
tallia and two consultants paisley and william galvin 
the governments request also filed friday in us district 
court said that to disclose any but small portions of the 
affidavit would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation 
the affidavit pertaining to paisley has been kept under court 
seal since federal investigators obtained the warrant to search 
paisley associates inc in washington on june 14 
his lawyers said that unless they have an opportunity to inspect 
the affidavit they will be substantially hindered and delayed in 
providing effective advice and representation to applicant and in 
determining the appropriate response to the subpoenas and to the 
propriety of the search warrant 
paisley a former assistant navy secretary for research left 
the pentagon in 1987 to become a consultant to several defense 
contractors 
paisleys telephone has been tapped and his consulting office 
bugged during much of the twoyear investigation 
federal authorities this week opposed another request to unseal 
an unrelated searchwarrant affidavit in new york city on the 
grounds that evidence sought in the case had been destroyed before 
it could be examined by investigators 
justice department spokesman patrick korten said that well 
doublecheck and make sure we dont encounter similar problems in 
other courts around the country containing more than 40 sealed 
search warrants and affidavits that are part of the investigation

gunmen pulled a motorcycle beside the 
car of a human rights lawyer and shot him to death on a downtown 
street today 
emmanuel mendoza 57 was the third human rights lawyer killed 
in the philippines in as many weeks a human rights group today 
suggested that the police or military could be involved in the 
unsolved slayings 
police cpl porfirio olais said two unidentified men on a 
motorcycle opened fire on mendoza when he stopped his car at a busy 
intersection a bystander brought the lawyer to a nearby hospital 
where he died minutes later police and hospital officials said 
mendozas wife emilia said in a radio interview that her 
husband had received several death threats from unidentified 
callers 
the independent philippine alliance of human rights advocates 
said mendozas shooting could be related to his work as defense 
lawyer for slum residents whose communities have been raided by 
police in search of communist hitmen 
mendoza was a legal counsel of the leftwing bayan organization 
and chairman of the manila solidarity alliance a federation of 
manila slum residents groups 
his killing came two days after a failed assassination attempt 
on nemesio prudente the leftwing president of the staterun 
polytechnic university of the philippines 
two weeks ago gunmen also shot and killed human rights lawyer 
ramon cura in his home near us clark air base north of manila a 
colleague alfonso surigao was shot and killed in his residence in 
the central philippine island of cebu last week 
this series of killings has victimized personalities who have 
been associated with the legal left a statement released by the 
human rights group said 
that this could go on without the government being able to 
solve any single case raises the strong possibilities that certain 
segments of the police and the military could be involved in 
them the statement added 
investigators have yet to publish findings on an earlier ambush 
on prudente in november 
human rights groups blamed rightist death squads for that 
attack it occurred a week after soldiers and policemen chanted 
kill prudente during a funeral for a police captain and three 
other people killed by communist assassins in the capital 
the military and police had accused prudente an outspoken human 
rights activist of using his school to shelter communist 
guerrillas prudente denied the charge 
also today a governmentrun news agency said military 
authorities have filed a new subversion complaint against two 
europeans and a filipino of german descent accused of aiding 
communist rebels 
swedish national stellan hermansson west german protestant 
minister klaus schmidt and filipino businessman antonio bosch were 
arrested june 8 and later held at a military camp the philippine 
news agency said 
on thursday the supreme court rejected the petition of the 
three men to drop charges of rebellion and kidnapping it agreed 
however to place them under the custody of a church group while 
awaiting trial 
in the new charges the military said the three men were seen 
with communist new peoples army guerrillas in four quezon province 
towns from may 23 to 25 and on june 2 this year and instructed new 
rebel recruits the agency said 
earlier the military had accused them of taking part in a feb 
3 raid in san francisco town in quezon and taking hostage two 
policemen after the attack 
hermansson has said he arrived in the philippines for the first 
time in midmay and the other two said they were in the capital on 
the day of the feb 3 raid

no action is warranted against anyone 
as a result of a collision of two army helicopters in march even 
though pilot error probably caused the accident that killed 17 
soldiers an army report says 
the accident happened march 8 when a uh60 black hawk returning 
from a solo instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in 
a formation of three returning from a night training mission to 
pick up soldiers in the field 
up to the point of impact the missions were formed just as 
briefed said maj randy schoel publicaffairs officer at the 
army base 
the report found that the collision was the result of the two 
air crews being unable to see each other in the final moments of 
flight according to a statement read by schoel at a news 
conference friday 
the approximately 175page report concluded pilot error to 
wit a reasonable mistake in judgment is the most probable 
explanation for the cause of this accident 
but the report compiled by an investigation board of six fort 
campbell officers all aviators said there should be no action 
taken against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be 
established the accident was not due to lack of diligence nor 
unreasonable or unprofessional conduct 
the investigation board found no evidence of a mechanical 
malfunction in the two black hawks involved in the crash nor can 
it be confirmed that there were any procedural errors on the part 
of either crew schoel said 
the report however cited other factors including exterior and 
interior design characteristics of the uh60 black hawks and 
limited pilot training using nightvision goggles the report noted 
a lack of lighting on the helicopters and said the number and the 
size of position lights on the outside of the 46 million black 
hawk were inadequate 
the helicopters were made by sikorsky aircraft division of 
united technologies corp said staff sgt dan moore of the public 
information office at fort campbell 
in stratford conn late friday robert stangrone a sikorsky 
spokesman said all aircraft have some degree of fieldofview 
limitation obviously the ideal cockpit is a glass bubble with an 
unobstructed view its a matter of design tradeoffs that consider 
structural integrity ballistic tolerance survivability and so on 
design and operational tradeoffs also determine the extent and 
intensity of exterior aircraft lighting 
the report said one of the two helicopters may not have had its 
anticollision strobe light turned on as required at the time of 
the accident 
thats the only item in question the strobe light schoel 
said 
the lead helicopter struck broadside carried 13 soldiers the 
other craft carried four all 17 victims belonged to the 101st 
airborne division at fort campbell the other two helicopters 
landed safely

hay from southern farmers hoping to repay a debt from their own 
1986 dry spell arrived in droughtstricken indiana while alabamas 
governor asked federal officials to declare his state a disaster 
area due to crop damage 
also friday an economist estimated the drought could cause 3 
billion in damage to north dakotas economy this year 
at cloverdale ind farmer ed meek accepted 180 bales of hay 
donated by south carolina farmers and trucked in friday by 
volunteer offduty charleston sc police 
our hay yield is down and what were using now is what should 
be used next winter he said 
in 1986 indiana and 40 other states sent about 800000 bales of 
hay to south carolina when the southeast was suffering a severe dry 
spell 
at charlotte court house va which was spared by the drought 
farmers gathered a shipment of hay friday to send to ohio 
two years ago i helped load a lot of hay in ohio that went 
south said ohios director of agriculture steve maurer 
thanking the charlotte county farmers kind of in passing i said 
someday we might need a little help ourselves and little did i 
know it was just two years away 
ohio gov richard celeste issued an executive order friday that 
he said would speed delivery of hay to droughtstricken farmers and 
ban most outdoor burning and he urged mandatory water use 
restrictions statewide 
also friday alabama gov guy hunt asked federal officials to 
declare alabama a disaster area citing widespread damage to 
corn cotton peanuts soybeans grain sorghum hay and pasture 
crops 
in a letter to us agriculture secretary richard lyng hunt 
said it was estimated that 30 percent to 50 percent of the states 
crops were damaged by the drought 
in washington lyng said the federal government likely will 
support financial aid to farmers once losses are more fully known 
after briefing president reagan on the findings of an 
interagency task force on the drought the secretary told reporters 
that longrange weather forecasts are discouraging 
meanwhile administration officials disclosed that reagan will 
fly to davenport iowa july 14 to view drought damage 
despite up to 2 inches of rain this week iowa had its driest 
halfyear on record said harry hillaker acting state 
climatologist 
in the tennessee river valley last month turned out to be the 
driest june since records began in 1890 said carl vines of the 
tennessee valley authority 
of the tvas 220 rain monitoring stations 39 recorded nothing 
during june also a record 
for today showers and thunderstorms were predicted from the 
lower missouri valley through the western parts of the lower 
tennessee valley and central gulf coast into central and southern 
florida 
the drought has cost north dakota farmers 530 million in small 
grain losses this year while livestock producers suffered 225 
million in losses caused by the drought said arlen leholm north 
dakota state university agricultural economist 
north dakota farmers also stand to lose as much as 473 million 
in federal deficiency payments the result of soaring crop prices 
and must recover some of that if the state is to get through the 
drought leholm said 
leholm estimated north dakotas total financial loss as 24 
billion to 3 billion including the impact of lost farm income 
that would have turned over several times in the state 
michigans crops have suffered as much as 600 million in damage 
and that figure will climb higher unless rain soon soothes parched 
fields the states agriculture director said

central news agency said 
it said the attack endangered the safety of north korean

seeking an excuse to suppress antius and antifascist domestic 
movements 
there was no immediate comment from south korea 
the two countries maintain more than 1 million heavily armed 
troops facing each other along the 150mile demarcation line which 
runs across the waist of the korean peninsula it was established

the us defense industry is feeling the first 
shock waves of the military procurement investigation as defense 
secretary frank c carlucci announced suspension of payments on 1 
billion worth of contracts 
carluccis surprise action was based on information in 
searchwarrant affidavits unsealed by a federal magistrate in 
dallas on thursday 
carlucci who earlier had urged caution in reacting to the 
investigation declared at a news conference that wherever we 
have specific evidence we will take action 
pentagon officials said that the impact of the suspension on the 
companies and their workers would depend on each of the scores of 
contracts involved and possibly on the financial health of the 
company 
carlucci also announced that the pentagon was beginning 
suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named 
in the documents and he said the defense department was reviewing 
existing contracts with four implicated companies and freezing new 
contracts on nine weapons systems 
the navy has initiated suspension procedures with respect to 
george stone mark saunders joe bradley and the continental 
electronics division of varian associates inc varian associates 
was the 155th largest defense contractor for 1986 and its parent 
company varian continental received more than 8176 million in 
defense awards in that year according to the unsealed affadavit 
he said the current actions did not gravely impair national 
security 
george simpson a spokesman for varian associates said the 
suspension will affect only one of continental electronics 
military projects developing low frequency transmitters 
simpson says he doesnt know the value of the contract but it 
represents only a very small part of continental electronics 
business so there would be no immediate impact on the firm 
he said the company was surprised and disappointed by the 
suspension because it had been told it was not a target of the 
investigation allegations alone are not the basis for such 
action he said 
the new york times reported today that among the companies whose 
payments have been interrupted are the canadian marconi co litton 
industries bell atlantic corp trw inc and lockheed corp 
carlucci said the pentagon was reviewing existing contracts with 
four companies named in the dallas affidavits litton norden 
systems inc hazeltine and emhart 
norden based in norwalk conn is a division of united 
technologies corp the eighth largest defense contractor in 1987 
with deals totalling 33 billion litton was the 14th biggest 
with contracts worth 2 billion united technologies is based in 
hartford conn litton has offices in van nuys calif 
we do not know what the allegations are if any or the 
governments basis for stopping payments said litton spokesman 
john thom 
emhart spokesman dan barrett said the farmington connbased 
company will comply fully and expeditiously because were 
confident nothing improper will be found 
hazeltine continues to cooperate fully with authorities in the 
investigation said a statement issued on behalf of the long 
island nybased company 
the largest single weapons system on which payments are being 
frozen is called the antisubmarine operating center a 712 
million system of shorebased command and control centers to 
coordinate efforts to locate and destroy submarines 
saunders one of the three individuals named by carlucci is a 
former navy procurement officer convicted of and fired for stock 
trading on insider navy information in 1982 the fbi said saunders 
was receiving inside contract data from stone his navy successor 
and it believes that saunders is paying stone for this 
information 
stone is one of six pentagon officials transferred to other 
duties after their offices were searched 
the third individual named by carlucci bradley has been placed 
on administrative leave from his job as vice president for 
marketing of varian continental of palo alto calif according to 
a company spokesman 
meanwhile friday norden announced it had withdrawn from 
competition on a contract to build a hightech portable shelter 
used near a battlefield to control aircraft in all kinds of weather 
the company cited the need for the public and government to 
have full confidence in the integrity of the procurement 
process 
the other seven weapons systems on which new contract actions 
were suspended are 
the digital communications terminal a 150 million program to 
develop a handheld computerized unit to compose messages for 
transmission by field radios 
the tactical environmental support system a 58 million navy 
program 
a 51 million fiber optical project 
the digital wideband radio set being developed at a cost of 
49 million 
a 38 million antisubmarine warfare electronics display unit 
the 30 million bancroft radio for tanks and marine corps light 
armored vehicles

seventy soviet missile 
specialists arrived here to begin an unprecedented inspection of 
us weapons factories as their american counterparts traveled to 
moscow to check soviet sites 
the landing of the soviets flight here friday marked the first 
day that 26 missile sites in the united states and western europe 
and 126 soviet sites became subject to superpower inspection the 
inspections are provided by the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty signed dec 9 at the washington summit 
the treaty creates a relatively new atmosphere of trust 
between our two nations vyacheslav s lebedev spokesman for the 
soviet technicians said in a brief statement to reporters our 
common task is to guarantee mutual trust 
under the treaty the two countries each must destroy a preset 
number of their mediumrange missiles 
in frankfurt west germany two us inspection teams 
consisting of 10 experts each met with reporters before boarding 
an air force jet for moscow 
we all feel this is a historic mission said the head of the 
inspection agency army brig gen roland lajoie 
one us team was bound for the soviet city of votkinsk the 
site of a plant that formerly built the ss20 missiles the most 
important soviet weapon to be eliminated under the treaty 
the united states has the right to keep a team at votkinsk for 
up to 13 years and the soviets may station inspectors for the same 
period at magna utah site of hercules plant no 1 where us 
missiles were produced 
inspection teams will verify the destruction of 1800 missiles 
and check on about 3200 related components including storage and

law enforcers say luck was with them 
when they made what is believed to be the nations largest drug 
seizure outside florida a 6000pound shipment of pure cocaine 
hidden inside blocks of chocolate 
it was a cold hit said peter baish the agent in charge of 
the us customs service office in new jersey whose inspectors 
working on a hunch found the drugs 
authorities announced the seizure friday which they said has a 
retail value of about 480 million the raid is likely to drive up 
the price of cocaine in the new york area this summer they said 
three colombian nationals believed to be members of a major 
colombian drug cartel were arrested when 50 agents raided the 
toronto imports warehouse said robert stutman agent in charge of 
the drug enforcement administration in new york 
us customs inspectors stumbled upon the cocaine during a 
routine check aboard the ship allison lykes at a port in newark 
nj on june 24 baish said 
agents paid special attention to the shipment 1200 cartons 
marked unsweetened ecuadorean coca chocolate because ecuador 
is a source of cocaine he said 
they drilled into one of the cardboard boxes and hit a metal box 
hidden in the core of the hardened chocolate said baish 
agents opened up the carton and found the cocaine inside the 
metal box he said they resealed the box and kept a surveillance 
on the shipment with the help of electronic monitoring devices 
the contraband was picked up thursday by a trucking company 
hired by the smugglers a team of narcotics agents then followed 
the trucks to the hicksville warehouse said art stiffel of us 
customs in new york 
the investigation determined that the drivers were not part of 
the drug scheme stiffel said 
stutman declined to say whether toronto imports was connected to 
the scheme he said more arrests were expected 
each carton weighed about 66 pounds each package of cocaine 
within weighed about six pounds and was marked with the initials of 
the person who had ordered it said stiffel stutman said at least 
779 of the 1200 cartons contained cocaine 
a few hours after unloading the truck the suspects began moving 
out four or five of the cartons and placing them into cars 
at this point the agents moved in and arrested the unarmed 
defendants oscar nunez 28 of new yorks queens borough absalon 
borrero 42 of miami and jaime caro 48 of anz colombia 
all three were charged with importation and distribution of 
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine they were ordered 
held without bail at their arraignment before us magistrate a 
simon chrein in brooklyn borough 
stutman said the suspects were believed to be members of the 
ochoa family of medellin colombia one of three leaders in cocaine 
trafficking 
officials believe the cocaine was produced in colombia and 
shipped to ecuador where it was concealed in the cocoa powder 
bricks 
this is the largest seizure in the us outside of florida 
said stutman 
the largest haul of cocaine on record was made in may when 
authorities seized 8800 pounds in tarpon springs fla

a wedge of salt water creeping up the 
mississippi river could begin tainting new orleans water supply in 
a week despite federal efforts to build a dike to slow the 
intrusion a university professor says 
the salt water from the gulf of mexico flowing upstream because 
the worst drought in decades has weakened the mississippis flow 
is traveling about two miles per day and was within 17 miles of new 
orleans on friday 
when the salt water first reaches the city on about july 10 
the contamination will be minimal but by july 20 the salinity of 
the citys water could hit 200 parts per million said louisiana 
state university professor emeritus raphael kazmann 
that would make the water drinkable but make the coffee taste 
lousy he said 
in addition the salt water could corrode appliances such as 
water heaters and dishwashers he said 
by the end of the month the salinity probably will reach 300 
ppm which is above federal drinking water standards although it 
can be tolerated by most healthy people he said 
by the end of june the salt water had traveled as far upriver as 
it had on oct 8 1965 a severe drought year kazmann said 
the river is usually at its lowest point in the fall and that 
doesnt bode well for louisiana in 1988 he warned 
the us army corps of engineers began construction thursday on 
a 947000 sand and clay barrier that will stretch 1200 feet along 
the contours of the river bottom about 63 miles from where the 
river meets the gulf of mexico 
construction is expected to take less than a month spokesman 
bruce sossaman said friday 
salt water hugs the river bottom because it is heavier than 
fresh water it is advancing up the river because the 
droughtinduced low flow is not rapid enough to push it back to the 
gulf 
the upper point of the saltwater wedge is about 15 miles past 
the dike the corps is building sossaman said 
the levee is not as good an idea as it was before said 
frederic chatry chief of the corps engineering division but 
were not trying to solve the saltwater intrusion problem were 
just trying to mitigate the part of saltwater intrusion caused 
because we deepened southwest pass 5 feet last fall and 
winter 
southwest pass is a primary navigation channel for entering the 
river from the gulf of mexico 
to compensate for the salt waters movement and to make up for 
lost time the corps might build the sand and clay sill slightly 
higher than originally planned chatry said 
residents of new orleans and the several other communities who 
get their drinking water from the mississippi river shouldnt 
panic sossaman said 
at first the salt water will not perceptibly change the taste 
of the citys water supply he said if the salinity increases it 
should only pose problems for those under saltrestrictive diets 
so far abnormal salinity has not registered at the citys water 
intakes said sewerage and water board spokesman joe puglia the 
board is working with the state and the corps but has no citywide 
plan he said 
saltwater intrusion in the mississippi river is not uncommon 
sossaman noted communities close to the gulf of mexico experience 
the problem every summer with varying degrees of severity 
because of the drought this summer it will probably go up 
higher and stay longer he said adding it could go as far as 75 
miles upstream to baton rouge la 
autumn rains should help force the salt water back to the gulf 
he said

new appraisals of a proposed prison site for which 
gov michael dukakis administration has asked 10 million to buy 
from developers put the value of the land at under 6 million 
according to sources 
the state wants to build a 500bed prison on the hilltop land in 
new braintree developers who one critic of the project alleges 
are friends of the democratic presidential candidate sought 95 
million for the land two years ago 
the fbi is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations 
that the dukakis administration leaked word to the developers of 
state interest in the land they bought it from a church for 3 
million 
dukakis who the fbi says is not under investigation himself 
and the developers deny the allegation or any association with each 
other 
dukakis asked about the controversy in recent weeks has 
reiterated his position that the state will not pay one dime 
more than the fair market value of the property 
three sources all speaking on the condition of anonymity told 
the associated press on friday that two appraisals listed the value 
of the hilltop land in the 5 million to 6 million range the 
sources would not provide exact figures on the appraisals but one 
said they were not far apart 
the appraisals are being reviewed by a third company which is 
scheduled to submit its estimate of the propertys worth next week 
all three will be used by the state to determine how much to offer 
for the 782 acres bought by two developers in december 1985 
selection of the new braintree site in 1986 by dukakis for a 
medium security prison has been controversial from the outset with 
local residents claiming a prison would ruin the tiny central 
massachusetts community 
the land which houses a defunct church academy 20 homes and 
more than 700 acres of farmland is owned by developers danial 
striar and dr gary jacobson 
if they reject the states offer for the land the state can 
take it by eminent domain a move that likely would end up in 
court the developers could not be reached friday for comment 
the chief critic of the prison project dorothea thomasvitrac 
of new braintree has made the allegation that the men are close 
associates of dukakis and were tipped off about the states plans 
in denying the allegations striar and dukakis have said they 
met once at a 1986 groundbreaking ceremony jacobson grew up in 
the same neighborhood as dukakis and has donated to his campaigns 
dukakis has said he knows of jacobson from childhood but has no 
personal or business dealings with him 
in april 1986 nearly two years after the administration began 
eyeing new braintree for a prison but a month before dukakis 
officially announced the siting a springfield company hired by the 
state put the value of the land at 87 million 
the appraiser the rj greely co told the state in a report 
that its review is not to be considered a complete appraisal due 
to time constraints and other limiting conditions we are doing 
this report in broad brush terms without having time to do our 
own research 
as part of a larger prison funding package dukakis in may 1986 
requested 22 million for new braintree 10 million of which was 
to be set aside to purchase the land striar and jacobson offered 
it to the state for 95 million 
critics of the prison led by thomasvitrac complained that 
striar and jacobson stood to make more than 6 million on the deal 
without improving the site 
dukakis and other administration officials said they sought the 
10 million appropriation to avoid waiting another year to have the 
money included in the next state budget

iraqi warplanes fired missiles into two 
tankers leaving an iranian oil terminal and set them on fire 
persian gulf shipping executives said today 
the attacks on the 268081ton greekowned fortuneship l and the 
284299ton iranianowned khark 4 raised fears of a new round of 
shipping raids by iran and iraq in the socalled tanker war 
both ships were still blazing 12 hours after the attacks 
shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
had no word of casualties in the latest raids 
the tankers were at the end of a convoy that had loaded at the 
kharg island terminal in the northern gulf and was sailing south 
for larak another terminal in the strait of hormuz the entrance 
to the gulf 
the last iraqi strike on iranian shipping was june 8 when 
warplanes attacked the 742ton singaporeflagged tugboat salverve 
two seamen were killed 
irans last raid was june 14 when gunboats attacked the 
singaporeflagged neptune subaru setting it on fire 
the main focus of the nearly 8yearold gulf war in recent 
months has been on the battlefield the iraqis have recaptured a 
series of border areas to gain an edge in the conflict with iran 
baghdad radio quoting a military communique reported that 
iraqi warplanes hit two large maritime targets which usually 
means tankers off the iranian coast at 10 pm friday 3 pm edt 
and at 8 minutes after midnight 508 pm edt friday 
the jets scored direct and effective hits and returned 
safely to base the communique said 
the raids were in line with iraqs determination to cut off 
the enemys oil supplies and revenues which it uses to finance the 
war the communique added 
the iraqis have been attacking tankers carrying iranian oil 
since 1984 seeking to choke off tehrans economic lifeline 
the iranians retaliate on a shipforship basis iraqs ports 
have been closed since the early days of the war so the iranians 
attack neutral merchant ships mainly those serving kuwait or saudi 
arabia tehran claims they aid iraq 
more than 500 ships have been attacked in the tanker war and 
more than 300 seamen have been killed 
the iranians gunboats have kept a low profile in recent weeks 
with only three attacks reported since may 27 
but shipping executives said today that an iranian gunboat was 
active in the southern part of the waterway raising fears that it 
was prowling for targets following iraqs nighttime air strikes 
in seoul south korea protested to iraq an attack on an iranian 
construction site and demanded compensation for the deaths of 
korean workers 
the iraqi air force thursday bombed a gas plant being built at 
kangan on irans southern gulf coast and the cyrus oilfield in the 
northern gulf 
the south korean government said 12 korean workers were killed 
along with one iranian in the kangan raid seoul said another 45 
koreans were wounded 
meanwhile a spokesman for iraqs higher education ministry said 
in baghdad that thousands of male students have been sent to 
special camps for a month of military training 
the spokesman who declined to be identified said the students 
were drafted from iraqs five universities and dozens of schools 
the summer camps apparently were set up to boost iraqs military 
reserves an estimated 1 million iraqis are currently under arms 
under compulsory military service iraqi men serve in the 
regular army for 24 months after graduation

the communist party fell in line behind mikhail s 
gorbachev and decreed sweeping political reforms to establish a 
stronger legislature and president and limit elected party 
officials to 10 years in office 
the changes point the way to a new democratic image of 
socialism the soviet leader declared late friday as he closed 
the fourday conference of 5000 party members in the kremlin 
the party also will review the qualifications of each of its 20 
million members this year the communist party newspaper pravda 
said today 
such a review could be used to clean out the conservative 
opposition that gorbachev says is still holding back his reforms 
pravda said the conference considered it necessary to carry 
out this year a reportelection campaign in party organizations 
governed by the decisions of the conference about reform of the 
political system democratization of party life 
the conference the partys first since josef v stalin 
assembled the 18th gathering in 1941 was urged to dismantle a 
system of power and privilege for party bureaucrats that has 
dominated soviet society since the dictators time 
gorbachev told the partys policymaking central committee and 
other organs urgently to settle questions of political reform so 
the plans the conference approved can be implemented beginning with 
a fall session of the supreme soviet parliament 
he said the first elections under the reforms could be held in 
april 1989 
the official tass news agency said the plan approved by the 
conference also calls for a reorganization of the party apparatus 
before the end of the year but gave no details 
alexander lukyanov secretary of the partys central committee 
told a latenight news conference that the gathering backed 
gorbachevs proposals to limit elected party officials to a maximum 
of two fiveyear terms with no exceptions 
he also said the new stronger presidency backed by the party 
meeting gives the president powers gorbachev requested to settle 
matters of foreign policy and chair the defense council the latter 
position traditionally is held by the party general secretary the 
post now held by gorbachev 
it also approved his controversial recommendation that communist 
party leaders become the leader of the corresponding legislature 
all the way up to combining the job of president and party general 
secretary that could set the stage for gorbachev to further 
consolidate his grip on power by taking on the duties of the more 
powerful presidency 
candidate politburo member georgy razumovsky said 209 delegates 
voted against that provision an extremely rare show of dissent in 
the party 
the presidency is now a largely ceremonial post held by andrei 
a gromyko on friday gromyko 78 was honored with the 
chairmanship of a session of the conference 
on thursday vladimir i melnikov party boss in the russian 
republics region of komi told the conference that gromyko and 
other high officials who served under leonid i brezhnev should be 
removed for contributing to the countrys stagnation 
gorbachev on friday referred to his proposals to create a new 
2250member chamber of peoples deputies a smaller and more 
active supreme soviet and the new presidency the conference 
will continue living in the society in the discussions in the 
society but now we know how we must transform the political 
system 
the soviet leader presided over what the tass news agency called 
an unusually stormy and long debate over the resolutions 
further reflecting the extraordinary spirit of open criticism 
permitted during the session 
gorbachev assessing the results of the conference just before 
it closed said through democratization economic reform and 
changes in the political system we will make perestroika 
irreversible we will reach a fundamentally new state of our 
society a new humane and democratic image of socialism 
he also proposed building a monument in moscow to stalins 
victims i think we must agree to this gorbachev said this 
would be an honest step and it will be supported by the entire 
soviet people 
stalin has come under increasingly sharp criticism under 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness but the 
decision to build a memorial to the millions of people executed or 
imprisoned during stalins rule is the most definitive step soviet 
authorities have yet taken to repudiate him

television evangelist pat robertson a 
speaker at todays state republican convention said he plans to 
campaign for vice president george bush in states where robertson 
had a stronger showing 
robertson also said he thinks the best vice presidential running 
mate for bush is sen robert dole rkan 
robertson said in a telephone interview friday that bush asked 
him for help in bringing robertson supporters into the gop fold 
robertson easily carried the states march 8 precinct caucuses and 
controls about 70 percent of the delegates at the washington state 
gop convention 
the vice president wants me to be active in states where he 
didnt do as well as i did robertson said that would include 
washington nevada minnesota and iowa and ill be going into the 
south as a surrogate to bring the rather substantial movement that 
was supporting me to the elections for the vice president 
robertson predicted a close election and said his followers 
could make the difference in a gop victory 
robertson said doles presence on the ticket would help 
i dont presume to tell george bush what to do but i think the 
strongest candidate we have for vice president is bob dole 
robertson said he brings strength in the midwest and mountain 
states to go along with bushs strength in the east and the south 
plus doles legislative experience along with george bushs 
foreign policy experience would make a nice balance and make for a 
very strong ticket he said 
dole who spoke to the convention banquet friday evening said 
he would be willing to discuss the vice presidency 
im not campaigning for it im not seeking it dole said 
but added if bush called him id say very honestly id be happy 
to discuss it 
the robertsondominated convention is expected to adopt an 
ultraconservative platform including support for south africas 
position on apartheid 
the platform reads like a compendium of conservative thought it 
is against gay rights a state income tax abortion the united 
nations and school health clinics and for the deployment 
strategic defense initiative of spacebased weapons contra aid 
everywhere prayer in the schools and more nuclear development 
the state convention is poised to send the nations largest 
robertson delegation apparently 38 delegates to the national gop 
convention in new orleans next month

groups prepare to meet for informal talks this month 
the intensified search for a political settlement appears to 
have been sparked by fears from several sides that the khmer rouge 
could return to power the communist khmer rouge defeated a 
usbacked government in 1975 and according to some estimates 
killed 3 million cambodians before they were toppled by the 
vietnamese invasion of 1978 
special un envoy rafeeuddin ahmed has returned from cambodia 
after presenting a peace plan the details of which have not been 
disclosed and the foreign ministers of the association of 
southeast nations reportedly will unveil another plan when they 
meet in bangkok next week 
china proposed friday that all cambodian factions form a 
coalition government before a total vietnamese pullout the beijing 
plan which includes a call for all cambodian parties to freeze 
their force levels is an apparent effort to keep the khmer rouge 
from becoming dominant 
western analysts say china the main weapons supplier to the 
khmer rouge is a key to the success of any negotiated settlement 
the antivietnamese resistance a coalition of three groups led 
by prince norodom sihanouk on june 25 issued proposals stressing 
international supervision of a cambodian agreement 
the plan is directly tied to the informal talks scheduled for 
july 25 in jakarta indonesia vietnam and the sihanouk coalition 
which includes the khmer rouge have already accepted invitations 
to the talks 
the coalition includes the khmer rouge and the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front 
he official cambodian news agency spk said friday that prime 
minister hun sen received an invitation but did not say whether the 
government would attend 
the resistance has proposed that vietnam withdraw its forces in 
three stages under international supervision it also said the 
coalition and the phnom penh government should be dissolved and a 
fourparty coalition government set up and headed by sihanouk the 
coalition would then hold free elections 
vietnam has promised a total withdrawal of its forces from 
cambodia by 1990 and has begun a partial pullout of 50000 troops 
and withdrawn top military command vietnam said the conduct of the 
antiguerrilla war now will be directed by the cambodians 
according to local newspapers the southeast asian foreign 
ministers will consider a plan worked out by senior officials of 
their bloc it includes a general ceasefire the pullout of all 
hanoi forces in three phases the end of all foreign military 
support for combatants and an international peacekeeping force that 
would remain in cambodia for five years 
a phnom penh broadcast made available today indicated some 
problems with the proposal brought to cambodia by the un envoy 
hun sen was quoted by the official broadcast as describing the 
meeting as an initial one and urged the united nations to 
continue seeking to understand all the points upon which all the 
cambodian parties agree or do not agree with each other 
hun sen stressed that all solutions to the cambodian problem 
must absolutely guarantee the khmer rouge does not return to 
power the radio said

israeli troops shot and killed an arab youth in 
a demonstration today in the occupied west bank ton of jenin 
israeli radio said protests broke out in at least four other west 
bank towns 
arab assailants also hurled a firebomb today at troops in gaza 
city but no injuries were reported the army said 
an army spokeswoman denied soldiers opened fire in jenin where 
the death was reported or in the west bank town of kalandia where 
a youth was said to have suffered a bullet wound 
we have had a report from the hospital that a man died and the 
army is checking if there is a connection the military 
spokeswoman speaking on condition of anonymity the army did not 
see a body the army used gas and rubber bullets only 
israeli radio said the jenin youth was shot in the head and his 
body was taken from the hospital by his family it said the clash 
with soldiers erupted after masked men entered schools and brought 
schoolchildren out to demonstrate 
a hospital official in jenin confirmed the death and an arab 
reporter identified the dead boy as 17yearold nael youssef 
muhamad hamaisi both spoke on condition of anonymity 
a man in his 20s was treated and released for a bullet wound in 
the thigh after a demonstration in kalandia officials at 
jerusalems mokassed hospital said 
the military spokeswoman said the army clamped a curfew on jenin 
and on the west bank refugee camp of jelazoun and town of kalkilya 
where there also were brief protests 
in gaza city an unidentified attacker hurled a firebomb at an 
army vehicle the army spokeswoman said she said the bomb damaged 
the car but no one was injured 
since the antioccupation unrest began in the west bank and gaza 
strip on dec 8 215 palestinians have been killed four israelis 
also have died 
on friday the israeli general in charge of the gaza strip 
promised to release dozens of arab prisoners from areas where 
rioting has ceased and called on aspiring palestinian leaders to 
cooperate with israeli authorities 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai used israels arabic television 
services to appeal to gazas 650000 residents in what appeared to 
be an attempt to reward residents for the relative calm of recent 
weeks 
also friday former un ambassador benyamin netanyahu said 
israel should deport hundreds of arabs who instigate riots and have 
a policy of opening fire at people who throw rocks and firebombs 
israeli analyst ron benyishai military correspondent for the 
yedioth ahronot hebrew newspaper said antiisraeli attacks are now 
being carried out by small numbers of highly trained palestinians 
this is in contrast to the early months of the uprising when 
hundreds of residents took part in frequent mass protests 
mordechais statements indicated israeli authorities are ready 
to use a carrot as well as a stick approach now that the massive 
violent demonstrations that characterized the first months of the 
uprising have waned 
i have intentions to release dozens of prisoners including 
administrative detainees next week and they will mostly be 
released if they are from places where there is quiet and security 
and where there has been a return to routine life mordechai said 
last month maj gen amram mitzna who is in charge of the west 
bank released 89 palestinian prisoners a step military officials 
said was taken to contribute to restoring normal life to the 
area

when alexander flax left the pentagon in 1969 
after six years as the air forces research and development chief 
he asked the militarys top lawyer what consulting work he could 
properly do on the outside and what he could not 
i had a test when i was in the pentagon which was im never 
going to do anything here i dont want to see in writing on the 
front page tomorrow flax says thats a pretty good test 
flax is a defense consultant a member of a large and 
diversified profession thats become as indispensable to the 
marriage of government and industry as programs and spending his 
line of work is technical consulting which he says is far removed 
from the world of bribery and corruption thats currently in the 
headlines 
others who are closer to that world are reluctant to talk about 
it on the record you can make a good living very honestly in 
this business one said thats why i dont understand these 
people 
the fbis view of some of these people was revealed in 
affidavits filed in court on june 14 to support fbi searches of the 
offices of consultants contractors and a few pentagon offices 
the evidence developed in the investigation has shown that 
consultants often are the ones who 
1 obtain information and documents from government officials 
which should not be released to the companies and provide those 
items to the companies 
2 speak to the government officials about doing something to 
benefit particular companies and 
3 provide government officials with bribes and gratuities 
one type of consultant gives advice to companies on government 
relations looking at their strategic plan for the next half dozen 
years and seeing whether that plan matches what the government 
needs 
they advise on simple things 
one time a company wanted to do a briefing for congressmen 
interested in a particular weapon one consultant said they 
wanted to have lunch arranged in a downtown hotel miles from 
capitol hill i told them a congressman isnt going down to 14th 
street he doesnt have time if you are going to do a 
presentation its got to be within a few blocks of the capitol 
for such advice he said a consultant might earn 1000 a day 
whenever he works but he can be called on for far more difficult 
tasks 
ive got a client who specializes in selling things overseas 
he had a question as to policies in a particular area of nato 
about how countries procure different things said one 
consultant who asked not to be named i found a man in the 
pentagon who is responsible for setting policy in that area and 
asked if i could bring that manufacturer in and let him clarify in 
that case it was a liaison function 
in some cases consultant is just another name for lobbyist the 
military producer depends on contacts with the pentagon and with 
congress the consultant gives strategic advice about whom to 
approach and how and when to make that approach 
i never tell my client that i can get a congressman to take a 
stand to support their position one way or another the 
consultant said i say i can get you to present your side of the 
case 
and he added i would never dream of going in to a 
congressman saying support this as a favor to me i say there 
are two sides to every story there is a problem here between 
services this is one possible solution let me give you this 
side and i always tell him what my clients interest is 
flax an aeronautical engineer with a distinguished record 
said no one ever told me look i have just been hired by 
company x to get them this contract its never stated that way 
most former pentagon hands who become consultants on the outside 
start with knowledge of who buys weapons for the government and 
what general programs are under way they can keep up with changes 
just by reading newspapers and trade magazines 
one little online squib that says joe doaks has just been 
replaced by john brown in that office is very meaningful to him 
flax said he knows where brown came from knows what his 
character is knows what the duties of the office are 
you may have noticed he added that the consulting 
business is not limited to people who have left the defense 
department people who have been in aid the agency for 
international development know a lot about foreign countries and 
how to do business with them didnt henry kissinger form a 
consulting firm and charge phenomenal fees 
when he left the pentagon flax said there was an absolute 
prohibition for one year on going back to the department i worked 
in with the air force and having to do with any matter that 
involved contracts because i had held a position where i had some 
influence on virtually all contracts let in research and 
development 
there was a lifetime ban he said on joining forces with anyone 
with whom he had negotiated because some contracts stretch over 
many years as an example flax cited the maverick missile which 
still is in the air force arsenal 
now 20 years later he said conflictofinterest laws are much 
more restrictive 
you have to be your own watchdog flax said im very 
careful about what i do im no longer constrained ive been out 
of government for a long long time still i watch my actions

communist party chief karoly grosz has 
appealed for talks with romania following heightened tensions 
between the two warsaw pact allies a government newspaper reported 
today 
in an interview with the newspaper magyar hirlap grosz was 
quoted as stressing the political necessity and moral 
obligation for direct talks with romania to find an end to the 
dispute 
the newspaper said grosz who also is premier wants to go to 
romania for talks but did not know when 
grosz was quoted as saying there have been no contacts between 
he and romanian leader nicolae ceausescu but considered it 
important that ceausescu had called for a meeting between 
representatives of the two nations to improve relations 
on friday the hungarian parliament passed a resolution accusing 
romania of violating the human rights of ethnic hungarians and 
other minorities in the neighboring eastbloc country 
the action was taken at the end of a week of escalating tensions 
over romanias planned demolition of 7000 villages with the 
residents to be resettled in agroindustrial centers 
budapest newspapers said some hungarians were being prevented 
from entering romania 
the resolution adopted by parliament with only one abstention 
said romania is violating the fundamental human national and 
nationalitiesrelated rights 
it called on romania to reexamine its resettlement plan 
there are about 17 million ethnic hungarians living in romania 
and about 220000 ethnic germans as well as thousands of serbs 
most of the hungarians live in transylvania many in villages to be 
destroyed 
romania claims the resettlement will provide higher living 
standards and gain productive agricultural land where houses now 
stand 
the annihilation of the values of the settlements doomed to 
destruction would mean an irreparable loss not only to the 
hungarian german and other ethnic minorities but also to the 
romanian people themselves the resolution said 
earlier this week romania expelled several hungarian diplomats 
from an area inhabited by many ethnic hungarians closed a 
hungarian consulate in cluj and began turning back hungarian 
tourists 
matyas szueroes the head of the foreign relations committee who 
presented the resolution to parliament said hungarys leadership 
would always be cooperating partners and was prepared to go 
ahead with preparations for a meeting of the two countries 
premiers 
hungarian newspapers quoted officials and travelers as saying 
hungarians wishing to enter romania were being turned back at the 
border 
in some cases only those traveling through romania to other 
destinations were allowed to cross into the country the papers 
said 
romanias decision to close the hungarian consulate in cluj in 
traynsylvania followed a demonstration by some 50000 people who 
marched past the romanian embassy in budapest to protest the 
resettlement plan

maputo and central sofala provinces

place from monday to thursday

mozambique government forces were losing control of the military 
situation

rebels have been waging a hitandrun guerrilla campaign since 1977 
to topple the marxist government 
troops from neighboring zimbabwe tanzania and malawi fight in 
mozambique alongside the army mainly to protect vital transport 
routes and an oil pipeline from rebel attack

fbi agents who broke drug and customs laws 
were reprimanded and suspended but not fired according to court 
documents in a lawsuit filed by an agent who was dismissed 
the previously confidential documents were obtained by an 
attorney for former agent anthony p rezza who was fired three 
years ago after using federal money and a car in a gambling spree 
in atlantic city nj 
the 22year veteran filed suit last year contending that the 
action against him was overly harsh 
court files on the suit contain six disciplinary cases in 
addition government lawyers have conceded without supplying 
files the details of four other cases mentioned in rezzas 
complaint 
allegations include reports of an agent who was suspended for 30 
days after being arrested when he entered the country with 
marijuana and drug paraphernalia 
there is also a report of a supervisor who was demoted 
suspended for 45 days and put on probation for a year for placing 
bets with a bookie while supervising a gambling investigation of 
the same bookie 
fbi officials declined to comment on the documents spokesman 
william carter said the bureau does not comment on pending 
litigation he added that disciplinary cases are confidential an 
employeremployee administrative matter 
in court documents government lawyers have contended that 
rezzas dismissal regardless of his compulsive gambling problem 
or the fbis record of discipline with other agents was an 
acceptable option 
in a motion filed june 14 alice w ballard rezzas attorney 
said the bureaus past practice is inconsistent with the 
categorical rule it now asserts 
the fbi disciplinary files produced in this case are replete 
with examples of agents who remained in service despite the use 
of drugs misuse of credit cards customs violations illegal 
gambling drunken driving sexual misconduct a hit and run 
accident and other illegal behavior 
ballard would not discuss the case tentatively scheduled for 
trial in november 
some lawyers believe disparities in discipline are the result of 
an internal struggle between moderate elements in the fbi and 
conservative followers of the late j edgar hoover 
there is this gap between those elite elements who believe in 
a concept of government service and those elite elements who have 
more military mentality said antonio v silva one of the 
lawyers in a classaction discrimination suit filed last year by 
agent bernardo perez and now joined by 300 hispanic fbi agents

chief justice william h rehnquist as if to 
declare himself the man in charge emerged as the supreme courts 
dominant force in its justcompleted 198788 term 
but to do so the staunch conservative cast some surprising 
votes they included trimming presidential power through an 
independent counsel law making the cia more accountable in its 
employment practices and in a key freespeech dispute ruling for 
sex magazine publisher larry flynt over evangelist jerry falwell 
rehnquist led the court in each case he also wrote for the 
court when it upheld a municipal rentcontrol law and when it 
strengthened the right of prison inmates to see documents used in 
their prosecution 
a year ago rehnquist completed his first term as chief justice 
with the knowledge that his leadership had been blunted by the 
courts leading liberal william j brennan 
in the most significant cases rehnquist often had been among 
the dissenters as brennan led the courts majority 
that trend was reversed and rehnquist cast fewer dissenting 
votes during the 198788 term than any court member except justice 
byron r white a member of the courts floating center 
but is rehnquist long the courts leading champion of the 
political right moderating his views 
he was carrying the flag for conservatives for a long time 
and now hes chief said patrick mcguigan of the conservative 
free congress foundation part of his job now is to count up five 
votes needed for a majority and to anticipate outcomes 
michael greve of the conservative washington legal foundation 
added he may feel an obligation to be statesmanlike 
both men said justice antonin scalia now reigns as the courts 
most conservative member 
there is no doubt however that rehnquist remains a core 
conservative for example he wrote for a 54 majority when the 
court ruled that a law providing federal money to religious groups 
to discourage teenagers from premartial sex does not necessarily 
violate the separation of church and state 
from the first monday in october when justice lewis f powell 
retired to feb 18 the court was one justice short justice 
anthony m kennedy president reagans third choice to fill the 
vacancy arrived only after the thwarted appointment of robert h 
bork and the aborted nomination of douglas h ginsburg 
kennedy participated in 62 of the courts 139 signed decisions 
in a term that saw the court with some notable exceptions 
continue its conservative course 
kennedys voting pattern already has liberal groups grumbling 
in the future his vote may give the court a solid conservative 
majority with those of rehnquist scalia justice sandra day 
oconnor and in most instances white 
brennans most loyal ally remained justice thurgood marshall 
but justices harry a blackmun and john paul stevens joined brennan 
far more often than they did rehnquist or scalia

court during its 198788 term

a government official warned saturday of a 
crisis if the influx of vietnamese boat people to hong kong does 
not stop his statement came after 468 of the refugees arrived in 
one day 
the situation in 10 days if it goes on like this will be 
critical john fortune chief staff officer of the government 
civil aid services told hong kong television 
vietnamese refugees have continued to flood this british colony 
despite a tough new policy designed to keep them out 
the government considers boat people arriving after june 15 to 
be illegal immigrants who will be kept in camps until vietnam 
agrees to take them back only those fleeing religious or political 
persecution will be granted refugee status 
hong kong previously considered all boat people arriving from 
communist vietnam to be refugees eligible for resettlement in other 
countries 
fortune expressed concern that facilities to house the growing 
number of boat people could fill up before new camps are opened 
i would like to emphasize that weve got to get across to 
these people that they are going straight into detention fortune 
said 
its absolutely ridiculous to keep on coming here they 
arrive they go into detention and they will be eventually all sent 
back to vietnam he added 
the new policy was drafted as the number of boat people soared 
to about 7800 this year through midjune or about 12 times the 
number who arrived during the same period last year 
during the first half of june alone 2850 vietnamese boat 
people sailed into hong kong waters arrivals during the second 
half of the month were just under 1200 according to government 
statistics 
on friday 468 boat people arrived another 172 sailed into the 
colony saturday according to the government 
it was not immediately clear whether the most recent arrivals 
left vietnam before the new policy was announced 
lord glenarthur british minister of state in charge of hong 
kong affairs told a news conference friday that it was an 
appalling indictment of the vietnam government that its people 
were willing to stay in crowded camps in hong kong rather than live 
in vietnam 
the government says the overwhelming majority of boat people are 
socalled economic migrants fleeing vietnam in search of a 
better life 
immigration officers wednesday began screening new arrivals to 
determine who was eligible for refugee status

a 12yearold boy playing in a park 
dropped his realistic squirt gun and raised his arms when 
confronted by police who had received a call about a commando armed 
with a machine gun 
a witness called police about noon friday and reported seeing a 
man dressed in military fatigues carrying a gun in wickham park 
police lt john mott said 
eight police cars from manchester and east hartford surrounded 
the park preparing to search for the gunman when mott spotted the 
boy who was wearing camouflage clothing a backpack a military 
belt and a helmet 
as i got out of the car he dropped the gun and put up his 
hands up mott said that was the smart thing for him to do 
when he saw the other cops pull up he looked a little 
bewildered a little nervous mott said 
mott who had not drawn his own handgun said he realized the 
boys gun resembling an uzi submachine gun was a toy as soon as 
he saw it 
after the commotion was over mott said they let the kid go 
play 
the general assembly last session approved legislation 
restricting the sale of realistic toy guns that have been blamed in 
several accidental deaths elsewhere in the country

the drought withering farm crops may be 
nourishing religious faith in rural communities in indiana where 
parched lands threaten farm families spirits as well as their 
livelihood 
while praying for rain members of small town congregations are 
being challenged to look deeper into their faith some religious 
leaders say 
although a selection of churches around indiana reported no 
significant increase in sunday attendance special services to pray 
for rain have drawn well 
people make more of an attempt for a deeper prayer life 
because of this because its a challenge says the rev john 
boeglin of st celestine roman catholic church in dubois county in 
southern indiana 
i dont think this is bringing people back to the church 
said boeglin who is in charge of rural church affairs for 12 
counties in the evansville diocese most people on the land are 
already regular churchgoers because they know theyre dependent on 
god for their success in agriculture they have to have a bountiful 
rain that they cant control 
one effort to exert influence has been the prayer services to 
plead for rain 
a recent service in tipton a town between kokomo and 
indianapolis in tipton county drew about 200 people to a town park 
we dont even get that many people for our good friday service 
or our thanksgiving service said the rev jayna powell the 
minister for youth and family education at west street christian 
church people are seeing a need to express their concern about 
the drought to god 
a recent issue of a diocesan newspaper carried an article by 
boeglin entitled should we pray for rain 
i jokingly wrote in the article maybe god needs a hearing aid 
or were not praying loud enough he said 
the priest answered his own question by organizing a prayer 
meeting for wednesday 
were not trying to wheel and deal with god we cant say 
ok if we pray for rain its going to rain he said 
in the past such prayers were a formal part of the church 
calendar he said during rogation days the three days before 
ascension day congregations used to pray for good weather and 
bountiful crops 
now i see there is something in that tradition that we should 
keep going because we see the serious need he said 
the drought highlights the christian teaching that hope survives 
even in misery and suffering he said 
i think people need to hear the story god has not abandoned us 
because of the drought he said we will make it through we 
will

the arab uprising that has torn the 
israelioccupied territories for seven months is now interfering 
with one of the most sacred rites for palestinian moslems the 
hajj or pilgrimage to mecca 
this month as the worlds moslems travel to islams holiest 
shrine in saudi arabia only about 1300 palestinians from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip will make the pilgrimage less 
than a quarter the number who went last year 
palestinians say the sharp drop is due to the economic and 
psychological impact of the uprising and to tactics the israelis 
are using to try to quell it 
adel abu sneineh owner of an islamic book store said he 
decided not to go to mecca for fear of what might happen while he 
was gone 
i wouldnt even be thinking about the hajj he said id 
be worried about whether my village was under curfew 
families with sons in jail were also reluctant to leave israeli 
officials say 5000 palestinians are imprisoned in connection with 
the uprising more than 200 palestinians and four israelis have 
been killed in the violence 
palestinians are also faced with deep cuts in income this year 
as a result of dozens of antiisraeli protest strikes which have 
shortened their business hours and orders from arab leaders not to 
go to jobs in israel 
the cheapest route to mecca costs 740 this covers a bus ride 
from the jordanian capital of amman to saudia arabia and includes 
hotels but not food and other travel costs its an extra 30 if 
the bus is air conditioned 
a travel agent specializing in hajj trips who gave his name 
only as abed said some pilgrims were also having trouble getting 
israeli exit permits because of unpaid taxes and age restrictions 
on arab travelers 
withholding taxes is a chief weapon used by palestinian 
underground leaders in their campaign of civil disobedience against 
israel one way israel catches tax evaders is by checking records 
of any palestinian who applies to go to jordan 
under the age restrictions palestinian men aged 16 to 35 who go 
to jordan are ordered to stay there for nine months before 
returning the measure was adopted several months ago to try to 
prevent messages from being passed to and from members of the 
palestine liberation organization 
abed alrahman 30 owner of a small cafe in arab east 
jerusalem said this is preventing him and many others from making 
the monthlong hajj i just want to make the pilgrimage i dont 
want to hang around amman almost a year he said 
olivier rafowicz spokesman for israels west bank military 
government said the age and tax measures were aimed at calming the 
violent uprising not at holding back moslems wishing to go to 
mecca 
the point is that everyone who wants to cross the bridge to 
jordan has to be checked about his tax payments rafowicz said 
if there is no problem he can cross the bridge 
it is one of the basic tenets of islamism that all moslems go to 
mecca at least once if they can afford it 
this year 1300 moslems will make the pilgrimage from the west 
bank and gaza according to ahmed bayoud head of the hajj 
department of the jerusalem wakf or moslem welfare society he 
said 5800 moslems made the trip last year 
by the moslem lunar calendar this years hajj is expected to 
begin july 14 buses begin the long trip to saudia arabia this 
month the high point of the pilgrimage marking abrahams 
sacrifice of his son should fall on about july 22 
samir mohammed shuweiki 31 a picture framer feels so strongly 
about making this years hajj that he paid for the trip even though 
he is kept from going by the governments age restrictions 
he said has been going daily to the israeli interior ministry 
but has not been granted an exit visa 
this is harassment before the intefadeh uprising i could 
have gotten the permit in one day he said 
shuweiki a father of five spoke in his small shop in 
eizariyya an east jerusalem suburb on the walls were framed 
verses from the koran islams holy book 
he said he would keep up his daily visits to the interior 
ministry until the last moment 
why are the israelis making these obstacles shuweiki asked 
i want to go for prayer not for politics

the last surviving school set up to 
dodge federal demands for racial integration in plaquemines parish 
has closed officials said 
school principal monica wertz said enrollment at river oaks 
academy was about 300 down from 600 two years ago and the staff 
of 35 was given walking papers thursday 
its kind of traumatic she said i guess were all going 
to go out and look for jobs 
the school was built along with four others as an alternative to 
public education at the height of the civil rights movement in 
1966 the schools were the brainchild of judge leander perez 
legendary political strongman of plaquemines parish which covers 
the delta of the mississippi river 
enraged by federal court orders to desegregate public schools 
perez had the private academies built and closed to blacks 
parish councilman benny rousselle said the academies nearly 
killed the public school system white teachers and students 
abandoned the public schools which were stripped of supplies and 
left to blacks and a handful of others 
the public schools were a skeleton said rousselle 
rousselle said he graduated in 1967 with only four classmates 
from belle chasse high which is now overcrowded the parish has 
expressed interest in buying the river oaks property to ease the 
overcrowding

in recent days michael dukakis campaigned in 
mississipi and indiana states that have backed a democratic 
presidential hopeful only once in 28 years this week republican 
george bush is going to dukakis hometown for a greek orthodox 
church dinner 
no these presidential candidates arent just wasting their 
time looking for votes in all the wrong places 
these events are early feints in the general election campaign 
a strategy called attacking your opponents base it is one piece 
of putting together the electoral college puzzle to win 270 
electoral votes and the white house on nov 8 
if bush is tied down in places like indiana and the south 
hes going to have a hard time doing what he needs to win the 
election said democratic pollster mark mellman 
its a smart strategy for both sides said vince breglio a 
republican campaign tactician its not defending your solid core 
vote its the marginal voters who are part of your base they are 
part of the core but not a dependable part 
of course bush and dukakis are looking for every possible vote 
in the fall 
the theory behind the attacking the base strategy is 
straightforward if a candidate must spend his time making certain 
the people who usually vote for his party will back him he wont 
have time to win the swing voters who have been increasingly 
crucial to victory in this country 
for example dukakis has campaigned across the south and the 
farm belt in the midwest regions that have been very strong for 
the republicans thus if bush must defend his base of support in 
those areas he will have less time to campaign in california new 
york pennsylvania and ohio where the gop needs to do well 
while such a strategy is used in all kinds of races it is 
particularly important in a presidential campaign because of the 
electoral college system 
winning the most votes doesnt mean winning the white house a 
candidate must win enough states to gain a majority of the 538 
electoral votes at stake to succeed ronald reagan in 1989 
of course bush dukakis and their aides proclaim that they will 
battle for every state in the fall taking nothing for granted and 
conceding nothing 
its not designed to make dukakis pay attention to his base 
said bush spokesman mark goodin of the thursday trip to boston 
its an indication that we are not going to take anything for 
granted 
dukakis spokesman leslie dach said the massachusetts governors 
strength and campaigning all across the country makes it tough for 
bush and the gop 
in their grand plan they thought they didnt have to secure 
landing rights in big regions of the country dach said now 
theyre finding they have to lease apartments everywhere 
the reality is that there are limited resources for a 
presidential campaign and limited time for a candidates 
campaigning 
once things have started to solidify im sure the dukakis 
campaign will sit down and make a careful assessment of where to 
concentrate the resources mellman said 
the starting point of any electoral college strategy and the 
attacking the base tactic is history and history is on the 
side of bush and the republicans 
one way to look at electoral history is the percentage of the 
twoparty vote for each candidate from 1952 through 1984 mellman 
points out that democrats have averaged a majority of the vote in 
only six states and the district of columbia over that period 
thats a total of 52 electoral votes from georgia hawaii 
massachusetts minnesota rhode island west virginia and the 
district of columbia 
the republicans have averaged at least 55 percent of the vote in 
27 states through the same elections for 208 electoral votes 
thus democrats would have to win 218 electoral votes among the 
17 remaining states to add to their base to return to power in the 
white house the gop could hold onto its historic base and win the 
white house with only 62 electoral votes from the 278 available in 
those swing states 
but dukakis aides say the appeal to history is a misleading one 
saying the republican spokesmen are trying to erect a historical 
barrier between michael dukakis and the voters 
democrats point to such states as iowa a traditionally 
republican state where dukakis has a substantial lead in the 
polls 
in addition a purely regional strategy is tough to pull off as 
differences between the regions shrink and the influence of 
national television coverage grows 
the best thing to do is cherrypick mellman says taking 
a state here in the south and one there 
with the national polls moving dramatically in recent weeks 
breglio agrees that the fall campaign is going to be 
handtohand statebystate combat as bush and dukakis try for 
the magic majority of 270 electoral votes

indigant letters of support are pouring in 
from around the country for a man who lost a 50foot oak tree when 
a neighbor cut it down to improve reception for his television 
satellite dish 
this despicable act demands redress a seattle man wrote to 
charles marriner 
this was a mean and horrible act wrote a resident of new 
yorks long island to discourage others i urge that you pursue 
steps to apply the most severe penalties against him which the law 
provides 
arthur anderson the neighbor who has admitted felling the 
84yearold tree reportedly told police after the incident now 
i can get the disney channel 
anderson was charged with seconddegree criminal mischief and 
thirddegree criminal trespass and is due back in court july 22 he 
has offered marriner 500 in compensation but marriner said he 
hasnt accepted 
the tree is irreplaceable said marriner who discovered the 
felled tree on june 12 he said he got one estimate of more than 
9000 to remove and replace it along with others that were 
damaged by the falling oak 
a chicago man suggested what he thought would be fair punishment 
i have no television in chicago and am not particularly fond 
of the dishes that have ruined many a backyard the man wrote 
proper retribution i think would be to revoke andersons right 
to have a satellite dish

the capital 
chinese guards were posted outside the embassy compound and a 
metal detector was set up at the main entrance

might be the target of terrorists from another country the third 
country was never identified and the warning was eventually lifted

official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
each year for the past five years mcdonalds in hong kong has

a sudden spate of black bear sightings 
at parks fairgrounds highways back yards and naturally honey 
bee hives has residents of the western part of the state wondering 
if there is a bear boom 
the bear population has indeed gone up say wildlife officials 
but the problem comes more from a people boom in the states 
western hills so the two populations human and ursine see each 
other more often 
it is a case of people going into a bears back yard said 
ellie horwitz spokeswoman for the state division of fisheries and 
wildlife they are farming putting up bee hives and are not 
taking into consideration that the bears are attracted to these 
things the bears are opportunists and will take advantage of 
whatever is easiest and convenient 
authorities havent released any figures on the number of bears 
sighted in residential areas but horwitz said none of the bears 
we have been made aware of are of any danger to the community 
no injuries to either the bears or startled humans have been 
reported while people scurry for cameras and shelter the usually 
docile black bears head back to the woods 
black bears are relatively small and unaggressive said 
horwitz some people will describe them as looking like fat dogs 
but they really dont look like dogs at all a wellfed bear will 
have a round body and a small head with an elongated face 
a black bear that gets up to 400 pounds in massachusetts is 
considered to be a very large bear although in other areas they 
may get up to 600 pounds she said by contrast grizzly bears in 
the west can reach 1500 pounds 
black bears can be aggressive in some circumstances at vail 
colo one chased a 14yearold boy last weekend after the youth 
photographed the animal colorado wildlife officials have set bear 
traps around the posh resort because as many as eight bears have 
been feasting on trash dumps 
in massachusetts an estimated 500 bears roam the 
400squaremile area between the berkshire mountains and 
connecticut river north of the massachusetts turnpike the general 
area where the sightings have been reported in the mid1970s it 
was thought only 100 bears lived in the state 
ronald wilkinson chief of police at look memorial park says he 
can no longer hike on half the trails he frequented as a boy 
because so many vacation and summer homes have been built 
many of the areas are taken up with development you can still 
walk through them but you could be considered a trespasser he 
said there are some very exclusive and secluded developments 
going up 
wayne mccallum assistant director of the state wildlife agency 
said the number of sightings indicates two problems a loss of 
natural habitat for the bears due to increased residential 
development and a possible change in peoples attitudes toward the 
animals 
when people build a house in the middle of the woods 
sometimes up to a quartermile in from the road the bears are not 
going to move out he said 
most people like bears they are fascinated by them 
mccallum said but when so many people move from urban areas to 
rural areas and bring their urban attitudes treating the wild 
animals as pets managing the wildlife population becomes very 
difficult 
at the same time he said farmers who claim to have lost crops 
or livestock to bears tend to view the animals as pests farmers in 
franklin county have asked for an extension on the oneweek bear 
hunting season in september in 1987 21 of the 34 bears shot in 
massachusetts were taken in or around corn fields mccallum said

sounding much like the college professor he 
once was secretary of state george p shultz took a backtobasics 
message to four friendly central american countries last week 
democracy works marxism doesnt 
during visits to guatemala el salvador honduras and costa 
rica shultz repeated that theme time and again urging the 
countries and their peoples to stay on their democratic course and 
to reject nicaraguanstyle marxism 
as shultz saw it the four democracies three of which are 
relative newborns now boast of economic growth declining 
inflation and improved social services 
in contrast shultz said living standards in nicaragua have 
dropped by twothirds over the past four months inflation is 
sure to exceed 2000 per cent this year and tens of thousands of 
workers are paid less than the cost of subsistence 
shultzs optimistic appraisal of the four democracies seemed 
excessive to some analysts shultz himself saw some of the despair 
still plaguing the region particularly on thursday as he raced 
from guatemala to el salvador to honduras and back to guatemala 
in el salvador a country where fully half the labor force is 
unable to find adequate employment armed rebellion continues and 
human rights abuses after a long period of decline are now on the 
increase 
shultz called democracy the way of the future in central 
america but many salvadorans obviously are not convinced 
the atmosphere was far more tranquil in honduras but there 
shultz could see the fruits of an appalling housing shortage 
people by the thousands living in shelters consisting of little 
more than sheets of corrugated metal 
shultzs point though was that central americas democracies 
for all their problems are moving ahead while nicaraguas living 
standards continue to retrogress 
shultz did his best to deflect attention during his trip from 
the pending debate in washington over aid to the nicaraguan contras 
but the contras normally a us ally upset this design after a 
meeting late thursday night with shultz at his hotel in guatemala 
city 
with the stall in efforts to reach peace between the contras and 
the sandinistas the rebels offered tantalizing details of a new 
aid strategy they are developing in cooperation with the 
administration and their supporters on capitol hill 
administration officials said only four minutes of the hourlong 
session was devoted to the possibility of resuming military aid to 
the contras if thats true it may have been an important four 
minutes given the divisiveness of contra aid as an election year 
campaign issue 
the contras now limited to a 17 million package of 
humanitarian aid and deprived of military aid since late february 
have little support among liberals democratic front runner michael 
dukakis has said that lethal aid to the rebels is illegal 
adolfo calero a contra directorate member said the morning 
after the rebels meeting with shultz that the secretary was very 
enthusiastic about a new contra aid proposal that was discussed 
calero said a 30 million aid package being considered by the 
administration of which perhaps 7 million would be spent as 
military aid if nicaragua failed to fulfill promises of democratic 
reform 
the night before alfredo cesar another contra leader had 
talked of a revolutionary new wrinkle in the contra aid debate he 
said that as a sweetener for the sandinistas they would receive 
economic aid if they implemented democratic reform 
shultz apparently hopes that with so many nicaraguan lives at 
risk because of economic deprivation the sandinistas may be ready 
to rethink their strategy on how their society should be 
constructed 
he also believes the more military and diplomatic pressure is 
placed on the sandinistas the more the rethinking process will be 
accelerated

the slayings of three men and a child in 
texas are the latest in a series of deaths and disappearances 
believed linked to a violent sect of polygamists still faithful to 
a vengeful patriarch who died seven years ago 
internal violence has long marked the cult of ervil lebaron a 
selfproclaimed prophet whose quest for power and teaching of blood 
atonement launched a 22year reign of terror among mormon 
fundamentalists 
the killings in texas which police suspect are the work of 
three of lebarons sons bring to 18 the number of lebarons former 
disciples who have died or disappeared over the past two decades 
in utah where lebaron was convicted of masterminding the 1977 
murder of rival polygamist leader rulon allred members of other 
polygamist groups are horrified at the bloodshed a professor said 
theyre disgusted and some of them are a bit frightened 
said john stewart of utah state university who has studied 
polygamist groups most of them are peaceful and mostly 
lawabiding except for the polygamy of course 
lebarons church of the lamb of god is but one of many groups 
who advocate a return to polygamy which was taught by joseph 
smith founder of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
the utahbased church banned polygamy in 1890 and excommunicates 
those who practice it nevertheless an estimated 20000 to 30000 
people are believed to live in polygamist families 
at the heart of the struggle may be the fundamentalist belief 
that god will send one mighty and strong to reform the mormon 
church by violence if necessary 
that has been the thing that has been a deluding scripture for 
all these splinter group leaders for the past 100 years stewart 
said it leads to this egomaniacal approach that leads to 
continual splintering 
this process has been going on for a long time and undoubtedly 
will continue to do so he said 
among others knowledgeable about the clan there is little 
surprise that the young lebarons are suspects in the june 27 
killings of eddie marston 32 in the dallas suburb of irving and 
brothers mark chynoweth 36 duane chynoweth 31 and duanes 
8yearold daughter jennifer in houston 
marston was a stepson of lebaron and mark chynoweth was married 
to lebarons daughter lillian 
texas detectives are seeking lebarons sons andrew 28 heber 
27 and aaron 20 for questioning 
i would think they certainly would be considered prime 
suspects inasmuch as since ervil died there have been these 
threats made to other former members of the lebaron organization 
said murray police lt paul forbes the chief investigator in 
allreds slaying 
lebaron died of a heart attack at utah state prison in 1981 but 
lillian chynoweth has said that he targeted a number of people for 
death for being unfaithful to his teachings 
those who have died or vanished since 1966 have included lebaron 
followers brothers nephews wives critics and rivals 
marston and mark chynoweth were acquitted of charges in the 
allred slaying and marston also was acquitted in the 1975 death of 
robert h simons another polygamist who challenged lebaron 
in october 1987 daniel ben jordan who had split with the 
lebaron group and moved his polygamous family to colorado was 
fatally shot at a deerhunting camp in southeastern utah 
lebaron and jordan both claimed to be the one mighty and 
strong as did leo evoniuk who founded his own church after 
lebarons death and vanished from santa cruz calif in may 1987 
rena chynoweth a widow of ervil lebaron and sister of the slain 
chynoweth brothers who has gone into hiding since her brothers 
deaths considers the lebaron sons to be seriously unbalanced said 
her attorney john oconnell of salt lake city she believes she is 
also on lebarons hit list said oconnell 
the chynoweths and marston all were raised in the church as 
were these boys who are running around now he said 
but they were intelligent rational people they were involved 
in some things but as time went on they could see that it just 
wasnt making sense and they got out oconnell said

a jury today ordered that gary michael 
heidnik die in the electric chair for killing two of six women he 
imprisoned in a basement torture chamber 
jurors who on friday convicted heidnik of firstdegree murder 
in the slayings of sandra lindsay and deborah dudley deliberated 
about 90 minutes before reaching a verdict on a sentence the 
sentence will automatically be reviewed by the pennsylvania supreme 
court 
during a sentencing hearing today a prosecutor had asked the 
jurors to impose the death sentence they could have sentenced 
heidnik to life in prison 
this man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and he 
did it with torture assistant district attorney charles 
gallagher told jurors who could have given heidnik a life sentence 
death is the correct sentence gallagher said 
heidniks lawyer a charles peruto jr appealed to the jurors 
to consider that heidnik suffers from a severe mental disease 
heidnik did not testify at the sentencing hearing 
i just hope you do the right thing peruto said after being 
directed by common pleas judge lynne abraham not to rehash previous 
testimony from the trial which featured survivors tales of 
cannibalism and sadism 
the jury on friday rejected heidniks insanity defense 
convicting him of two counts of firstdegree murder six charges of 
kidnapping five of rape four of aggravated assault and one of 
involuntary deviate sexual intercourse 
peruto said friday his client expects the death penalty and 
wants no appeal 
dont bother peruto quoted heidnik as saying lets get 
it over with 
heidnik 44 was accused of butchering the body of one woman he 
had abducted and then feeding some of her cooked flesh to four 
other abducted women he imprisoned in his north philadelphia 
basement which was labeled a house of horrors during the trial 
prosecutors say he raped the women repeatedly in hopes of 
breeding a superior race between november 1986 and his arrest 
in march 1987 the four survivors testified at his trial 
heidniks attorney conceded that his client committed the 
crimes but said he was mentally ill and was not aware of what he 
was doing 
if the jurors fail to agree on a sentence on the two murder 
counts the judge must automatically impose a life in prison term 
the judge will impose a sentence on the other charges later 
the jurors chosen in pittsburgh because of pretrial publicity 
here over the bizarre case received the case wednesday and over 
three days spent nearly 18 hours before reaching their unanimous 
decision 
there was one verdict of innocent on a charge of involuntary 
deviate sexual intercourse with a prostitute who had escaped 
heidniks house in march 1987 and brought police to the rescue of 
the other three chained women 
thank god it was guilty of firstdegree said teresa lomax 
sister of sandra lindsay whose body was sawed apart in heidniks 
house after she died while chained to a pipe according to police 
some of her remains were fed to other captives 
he deserved guilty guilty guilty now im hoping for the 
death penalty ms lomax said that was a brutal way for my 
sister to die tortured nobody deserves to die like that 
diane dudley said heidnik got what he deserved for 
electrocuting deborah dudley her sister by touching live wires to 
her chains while she stood in a waterfilled basement pit her body 
was found in a wooded area in new jersey 
now i hope he gets the chair and debbie can rest in peace 
ms dudley said 
peruto called the verdict a big letdown because he had 
thought his insanity defense had made an impact on the jurors 
gallagher was elated and called it a just decision 
in closing arguments peruto told jurors heidnik was a 
fruitcake who suffered from schizophrenia a mental illness 
first diagnosed in 1963 and for which he was discharged from the 
army he contended heidnik suffered from delusions and didnt 
realize the quality of his acts 
gallagher insisted that heidnik was faking the illness 
peruto had claimed heidnik was treated with lsd while a hospital 
patient during army service in west germany in 1962 but said he 
was unable to obtain hospital records 
heidnik later founded a church in which he proclaimed himself a 
bishop and allegedly used contributions to the church to play the 
stock market his stock transactions were so successful that he 
amassed more than 500000 
despite his wealth heidnik lived in a poor neighborhood and 
appeared in court in tattered clothes

ten years ago bernard henschel was 
atop the wisconsin farming industry after he and his wife were 
selected one of wisconsins outstanding young farm couples 
but after a decade of price fluctuation market instability and 
this years devastating drought the dairy farmer has second 
thoughts about the career he chose when he was a brash 20yearold 
well i guess it isnt as good as i thought it would be he 
said friday when i started in this i thought by the time i got 
to be 40 im 43 right now i wouldnt have to worry about my 
investments in farming 
i just havent got ahead like i thought i would nowadays 
farmers cant get ahead as easy 
henschel and his wife allis operate a 350acre farm about two 
miles outside this northeastern wisconsin community they own about 
200 head of cattle including 90 milking cows 
just 10 years after he was selected the areas top young farmer 
by the midstates region of the associated milk producers inc 
henschels fortunes have changed 
an eightweek drought has parched his first two hay crops and 
left him without enough feed for his holsteins he recently sold 11 
cows because he could no longer feed them and more could be sold 
later if his third hay crop is not productive 
ive never seen it this dry as long as ive been farming he 
said our second hay crop theres not much there so well be 
cutting soon and looking to get a third crop in 
but without a couple of good rains there wont be much there 
either 
the drought is just one of several factors that have forced 
hundreds of wisconsin farmers into bankruptcy foreclosure selling 
out or retirement in the last decade 
i think the prices and the cost of equipment compared to what 
you get for your products is the main reason henschel said he 
said the price per hundredweight of milk about 12 gallons has 
dropped in the last five years from 13 to 1050 
during the same time equipment and overhead costs have risen 
he said 
had it not been for the drought farmers were expecting a year 
of recovery after three to five years of financial trouble but 
the way things are going i dont see how we can come out of 
it he said 
henschel began farming independently at age 20 after growing up 
on his fathers farm he began by forming a partnership with his 
brother in which the two shared machinery and manpower since 
then henschel has taken over his fathers farm and expanded it 
during his awardwinning year in 1978 he produced about 
1446320 pounds of milk and 52564 pounds of butter from 80 cows 
this year he expects to produce 1710000 pounds of milk and 62100 
pounds butter from 90 cows 
but much more than production has changed over the last 10 
years henschels father died and he was forced to let go of his 
longtime hired hand henschel must now rely on his wife daughter 
soninlaw and two teenage sons for help 
since then farmings gotten tighter and its come to where 
you cant afford to hire a fulltime farmhand any longer he 
explained

a fleet of jetpowered catamarans has opened the 
british capitals last uncrowded thoroughfare the river thames 
to commuter traffic 
theres nothing else like this an intensive river shuttle 
service in the center of london said roger mabbott deputy 
managing director of thames line plc 
since the services debut june 1 the firms three boats have 
cruised past cars on choked streets to ferry about 600 passengers a 
day from central london to the booming docklands area 
the catamarans twinhulled boats that can reach speeds of 
about 28 mph carry up to 62 passengers and are powered by two 
turbocharged volvo jet engines 
one leaves charing cross pier in londons west end every 15 
minutes from 7 am to 10 pm for a fivemile journey to the isle 
of dogs heart of the sprawling docklands redevelopment area where 
decrepit warehouses are being turned into modern residential and 
light industry complexes 
the full trip with two stops takes 20 minutes a similar journey 
on the london underground subway takes up to 30 minutes london 
regional transport spokesmen said 
one big difference is the price the subway trip costs 80 pence 
or 136 each way the catamaran ride costs 4 pounds or 720 
each way 
theres an element to competing with all forms of transport 
mabbott said but what were looking to provide is service to 
places the underground buses and cars dont get to easily 
traditional ferries have not operated with the speed or 
frequency of the thames line catamarans mabbott said 
thames line plc was established with 81 million in 1986 to 
simultaneously develop property in the docklands and create a river 
shuttle for the growing number of people living and working there 
mabbott said thames lines operating costs for june broke even 
at 108600 to 126700 with the boats carrying an average of five 
passengers per trip 
he expects 80 percent of the passengers to be commuters or 
business people with an interest in the docklands and 20 percent 
tourists 
passengers last week gave thames line generally favorable 
reviews but one said some problems still need working out 
hugh mackay 45 a civil engineer from the northern london 
suburb of rickmansworth complained his boat left charing cross 
pier 20 minutes late 
they need to improve their scheduling if business people are 
going to use it he said 
rhonda kufluk 36 a property developer lives in the docklands 
and uses the service daily its wonderful she said i hate 
taxi cabs the tube subway tends to be overcrowded and 
uncomfortable 
thames line plans to put four more boats in operation by october 
and extend its service farther east past charing cross to chelsea 
and farther west to greenland pier in the docklands mabbott said

miss america is not supposed to 
portray the innocent bathing beauty anymore shes a career woman 
who is educated and articulate and she may not even be a virgin 
says the pageants new director 
miss america contestants says leonard horn are human beings 
living in a very liberal 20th century 
they sweat theyre nervous theyve made mistakes they may 
not all be virgins i dont know whether they are or not who 
cares horn says im sure that if we found out 25 or 30 years 
ago that a girl lived with somebody or had intercourse she 
wouldnt make the morals clause 
today come on he says with a laugh 
in an interview last week horn described what could become 
sweeping changes to assure that the public never again views miss 
america as just a beauty queen 
the atlantic city attorney who has volunteered with the pageant 
for the past 25 years replaced albert marks as director of the 
68yearold contest ending marks 35year reign 
the biggest challenge for pageant directors always has been 
attracting television viewers in the same age group as the 
contestants the contest has a loyal following of older women and 
young starryeyed girls but young college and career women often 
spurn the event as oldfashioned horn said 
this years pageant will emphasize the contestants backgrounds 
much more he said 
these women are interesting individuals horn said 
theyre thinking human beings you can get any one of them in an 
intense conversation and for the most part theyre pretty 
courageous kids to put themselves on the line for some specific 
goal whether its for a scholarship or displaying their derriere 
which is probably not the case anymore 
some standards still apply however horn said former miss 
america vanessa williams had to be dethroned after nude photographs 
were published in order to protect the integrity of a pageant that 
still wants young girls to dream about the crown 
the pageant also is not seeking only dropdeadgorgeous 
contestants 
if a young woman considered herself to be the ugliest person 
in the world she could still enter a local pageant horn said 
those who enter these contests enter because they are confident 
enough of their beauty so what is defined as beauty is 
selflimiting by the contestants 
an updated stage production is planned as a way to reshape the 
contests image 
tony and emmy awardwinning broadway producer donald pippin will 
be music director for this years show replacing glen and edna 
osser who have handled the productions for the past 35 years 
they did a great job but there comes a time when youve got 
to change things horn said the music has to be more upbeat 
we dont want to go into hard rock but we are dealing with young 
people so we dont want to turn them off 
another change aimed at luring more viewers will be bringing in 
celebrity judges on the final night of the pageant to pick from the 
top 10 contestants horn said 
this years pageant will be held sept 10 a week earlier than 
usual to accommodate nbctvs coverage of the olympic games horn 
said that next year the pageant might be moved from its traditional 
saturday night television slot aired live from 10 pm to midnight 
some sponsors feel we can do better in prime time like maybe 
sunday or monday evening he said 
horns most controversial change might be in the way he will 
revise seating in atlantic citys convention center 
many of the reserved boxes near the runway have been passed down 
among generations of miss america supporters but now will be given 
to the pageants eight sponsors for their executives some of the 
resorts casinos have been offered a chance to buy boxes at a 
hefty premium for their high rollers 
horn denies that the pageant has become too commercial 
just because someone has been sitting in a box for 30 years 
he said does not mean they should be filling a box that can be 
filled more financially in order to keep the pageant here in 
atlantic city

the bombing was the latest in a recent series of attacks aimed 
at civilian targets there have been more than 90 bombings since 
the government declared a natinwide state of emergency in june 
1986 including some 25 this year 
police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla group the main black 
organization attempting to overthrow the whiteled government 
the group based in lusaka zambia seldom confirms or denies 
involvement in specific attacks however recent statements by 
african national congress leaders have suggested that the 
organization approves of attacks on civilian targets

group areas act in recent years which restricts blacks to certain 
areas the proposed amendment to the act calls for the hiring of 
inspectors to check violations of the law

on a hilltop overlooking this tiny 
town is what gov michael dukakis believes is the perfect site for 
a new prison and what opponents of that plan say is the centerpiece 
of a corrupt land deal 
the 782 acres in rural new braintree home of a defunct 
religious academy and perhaps a future prison is the battlefield 
for a twoyear war over the prison plans that is intensifying as 
the state moves to buy the property and dukakis now the certain 
democratic presidential nominee eyes the white house 
dukakis spent much of 1986 defending his choice of the site and 
was drawn back into the fray last month when the fbi acknowledged 
it was conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by prison 
opponents that developers who bought the property for 32 million 
and quickly offered it to the state for 95 million were given 
inside information about the plans 
dukakis who the fbi said was not a subject of the 
investigation and administration officials have flatly rejected 
allegations there were improper deals and suggested prison 
opponents sharpened their attack to get attention during the 
presidential campaign 
i dont have any interest in that insists dorothea 
thomasvitrac the vocal leader of new braintrees opposition group 
conserve our small town we are going after our sitting 
governor not after a presidential candidate 
dukakis republican opponent in the fall election vice 
president george bush has steered clear of the controversy 
given the fact that it is under some kind of investigation we 
would have no comment said bush spokewoman alix glen 
but it has drawn national attention because it involves a 
central element of the dukakis candidacy a pledge to bring 
integrity and competence to the white house and offers a glimpse 
at his handling of a complex and controversial issue 
dukakis named the site for a prison in 1986 and opponents who 
had organized when the state first considered the land two years 
earlier complained that a facility for 500 inmates and several 
hundred staff members would overwhelm the town of barely 800 people 
thomasvitrac concedes opponents have no hard evidence that the 
developers were tipped off but contends there have to be smoking 
guns among more than 100 documents dukakis refuses to make 
public citing executive privilege 
the governor for reasons known only to him has lied about 
his knowledge of this siting thomasvitrac said last week 
dukakis has repeatedly said he did not know who owned the land 
when he picked it and requested up to 10 million to buy it notes 
of an administration aide appear to show one of the developers 
names came up twice during a meeting with prison opponents in 
dukakis office but the governor has said he does not recall that 
and aides have said the name was mentioned only is passing 
the bottom line is that this is a not in my backyard issue 
and the rest of it is frankly nonsense said james circo a 
former dukakis aide who handled the project youd have to have 
been in an igloo somewhere to not know we were looking for prison 
space across the state and that new braintree was one 
thomasvitrac contends the withheld documents contain some 
reference to developers daniel striar and gary jacobson the town 
had an agreement with the seventh day adventists church that the 
land would not be sold for a project not in the towns interests 
thomasvitrac contends striar and jacobson were dukakis allies used 
to serve as middlemen so the state could get the land without a 
fight and reward the developers would with a triple return on their 
investment 
dukakis denies any deal took place and has said he met striar 
only once massachusetts republicans have been distributing a photo 
of that meeting on a crowded platform during a 1986 
groundbreaking for a community center named for striars parents 
jacobson grew up in the same neighborhood as dukakis and has 
donated to his campaigns but both men said they are nothing more 
than casual acquaintances 
striar and jacobson say they learned of the states interest 
through their broker and that they only considered selling to the 
state after local officials rejected their plans to build a 
psychiatric hospital 
an unlikely dukakis defender republican us attorney frank 
mcnamara said thurday that he confirmed publicly that dukakis was 
not under investigation because i felt it was necessary to 
respond to the gossip innuendo and smear that might sully an 
otherwise unsullied reputation 
two appraisals estimate the sites worth between 5 million and 
6 million according to three dukakis administration aides all of 
whom requested anonymity a third appraisal will be completed this 
week 
negotiations with striar and jacobson then will begin and the 
state plans to offer much less than the 95 million sought by the 
owners two years ago the two sides may end up in court if no 
agreement is reached and the state seeks to take to land by 
emminent domain

the justice department failed to keep up with 
defense procurement fraud because it has a lackadaisical 
careless handsoff management approach two senators said in 
releasing a critical congressional report saturday 
a justice department spokesman responded by saying congressional 
critics should put their money where their mouths are 
spokesman patrick korten said the government accounting office 
report itself was lackadaisical 
the report by the gao the congressional watchdog agency said 
that the justice department doesnt know the status of many of its 
pentagon fraud investigations because it does a poor job of keeping 
track of what its farflung offices are doing 
the gao said that attorney general edwin meese iii should order 
a number of administrative changes to do a better job of overseeing 
investigations of the defense department 
the study did not include any review of the current fraud and 
bribery investigation of pentagon weapons buying that became public 
when search warrants were served june 14 the probe focuses on 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants many of whom 
are former military men bribed pentagon officials for contracting 
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of 
dollars no one has yet been charged 
the gao report was released by sens william proxmire dwis 
and charles grassley riowa 
in a joint statement they said one of the most shocking 
aspects of the defense fraud problem is that the law enforcement 
system is incapable of adequately dealing with it 
the justice departments lackadaisical careless handsoff 
management goes far to explain why the government is losing the war 
against defense fraud they said 
if any major private law firm handled its affairs the way 
justice handles the defense fraud program it would be out of 
business within a year they said 
the gao proposed a number of administrative steps to correct the 
problem including development of some type of recording and 
tracking system and written management plans for effective us of 
staff time 
korten suggested that if grassley and proxmire want the justice 
department to gather statistics they should push for more money 
when its budget comes up for consideration in short put their 
money where their mouths are he said 
it just doesnt add up the fact of the matter is that we are 
anything but lackadaisical in our prosecution of these cases and 
the current big case involving the pentagon is a prime example we 
have had literally dozens of procurement fraud cases in recent 
years we have recovered tens of millions of dollars for the 
taxpayers in these cases and what they gao choose to look at 
instead is how much information we have in our computer in 
washington korten said 
it seems to me to be an awfully just to use a phrase 
lackadaisical way of taking a look at how cases are prosecuted 
he said 
korten said a staff turnover problem cited in the report is part 
of larger pay scale problem in the federal government because of 
low government salaries 
victoria toensing deputy assistant attorney general in the 
criminal division said us attorney offices around the country 
dont have enough staff to both prosecute and gather statistics 
the gao study reviewed 680 fraud allegations involving charges 
of bribery corruption conflict of interests and antitrust 
violations they ranged from october 1983 through may 1987 and were 
all cases that were referred to local us attorneys for action 
as of last september the gao said no action had been taken on 
286 of the referrals 
the majority of the 286 pending referrals had been with the 
justice components for a year or more and justice does not know 
whether these cases have been accepted declined or are still 
pending the gao said 
the justice department didnt even know how many attorneys were 
assigned to pentagon fraud cases around the nation the gao said 
the report said officials in most of the us attorney offices 
agreed that there was a problem and it was attributed to high 
rates of turnover among both the lawyers and the clerical staff 
the problem is the same in the defense procurement fraud unit a 
special justice department office set up to prosecute pentagon 
cases that office has had a high rate of turnovers because its 
lawyers can get higher salaries in private practice the gao noted 
thus the unit has a difficult time keeping experienced attorneys

following is the text of president reagans 
radio address which he delivered saturday from camp david md 
my fellow americans this fourth of july weekend we americans 
will as we do each year at this time raise old glory a little 
higher cheer fireworks and remember the blessing we share as 
citizens of this great and free land and as we celebrate our 
independence and pause to give thanks for our liberty let us also 
remember that the freedoms we cherish are never more than a 
generation away from extinction its up to each of us to preserve 
protect and defend americas precious heritage 
some americans have done just that in the battlefield but all 
of us can do it each and every day we can vote at election time 
we can volunteer to help political campaigns for the candidates of 
our choice as well as volunteer for work thats needed around our 
community and we can simply raise our children well do our jobs 
well and live in gods light 
one man who has contributed more than his share to our country 
left government service this week for a yearandahalf howard 
baker has been my chief of staff here at the white house he served 
with great distinction helping me guide important legislation 
through congress as well as helping me at the summits with mr 
mikhail s gorbachev in washington and moscow serving with 
distinction is nothing new for howard baker he did it for almost 
two decades in the united states senate and the last four years as 
majority leader 
i know ill miss him around the white house so howard good 
luck to you and your lovely wife joy 
in the months ahead ill be helped by a new chief of staff 
kenneth duberstein it wont be a big change for ken hes moving 
from his old office where hes worked as the no 2 man on my staff 
and as howards partner since early last year to the one next 
door and thats good because we wont have time just to settle in 
yes we have a lot of work to do and a big agenda that we got 
down to business on this week 
on friday with members of congress looking on i signed the 
medicare catastrophic coverage act into law at the ceremony i 
noted that almost a yearandahalf ago i had said we should 
remove a financial specter facing our older americans the fear of 
an illness requiring acute care so expensive that it can result in 
having to choose between bankruptcy and death shortly after that 
our administration submitted a bill to congress to help free the 
elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness now a version of 
that bill is law 
as i said friday we still must face challenges if this law as 
congress finally enacted it is to work but we can all be 
grateful that a burden has been lifted from the shoulders and minds 
of the elderly all over america 
by the way as i signed the catastrophic coverage act into law 
i couldnt help thinking how much we americans have done in the 
last few years today our economy is strong and growing our 
belief in peace through strength which we kept despite many 
protests in congress and elsewhere is paying off the first treaty 
ever to eliminate an entire class of us and soviet nuclear 
missiles has been signed and there is all the way around a new 
realism on our relations with the soviet bloc 
but despite these accomplishments i believe our eyes should be 
on the future and the accomplishments we have still to achieve for 
example congressional approval of the free trade agreement that we 
negotiated with canada will help the entire north american economy 
grow and create vast numbers of new jobs well into the next century 
throughout our history whenever trade barriers had been lowered 
in north america weve had a blooming of economic growth we owe 
it to our children to cultivate for another time of flowering and 
approve this agreement 
we also owe it to our children to put the illegal drug trade out 
of business thats why when i visited toronto recently for the 
economic summit of the major industrial nations i was particularly 
pleased by one action the summit nations took its called the 
bush initiative for it thank vice president george bush and 
canadas prime minister brian mulroney not long ago these two 
leaders decided that the best new place to hit the drug trade was 
in its most vulnerable spot moneylaundering now thats what 
all the major industrial nations are going to do 
yes our nations agenda is full whether its keeping our 
defenses strong or cutting unnecessary spending getting congress 
to pass a welfare reform bill that requires work and trade 
legislation that will open not close markets or helping freedom 
fighters around the world but thats what democracy is all about 
a big agenda americas agenda for all of us to work on together 
to build a bright tomorrow for our blessed land here at the white 
house our sleeves are rolled up and were hard at work on our 
agenda for the future 
so happy fourth of july and until next week thanks for 
listening and god bless you

us officials say new zealand may be able to 
restore military cooperation with the united states with a formula 
similar to that which keeps antinuclear denmark in the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
the subject came up after both us and australian leaders 
voiced regret here the past week at the absence of new zealand from 
the third straight annual ministerial meeting of anzus the 
military alliance formed by the three pacific countries after world 
war ii 
usnew zealand military ties deteriorated after prime minister 
david lange in 1985 barred a visiting us warship under his new 
labor party governments decision to close new zealand territory to 
nucleararmed ships the united states later read new zealand out 
of anzus in order to protect its policy of refusing to confirm or 
deny whether any ship carries nuclear weapons 
there must be a formula if new zealand would only look for 
it that would make it possible for them to come back into the 
fold us secretary of state george shultz told reporters last 
wednesday after a twoday meeting with australian leaders 
asked to elaborate on shultzs remark another high us 
official told reporters friday one formula they might look at i 
suppose is the danish formula 
another state department official described the danish formula 
as informing their allies by letter that denmark does not permit 
calls at their ports by ships armed with nuclear weapons and leave 
it at that 
the us officials spoke on condition they not be identified 
denmark and the united states have announced settlement of a 
dispute similar to the usnew zealand controversy that erupted 
when the danish parliament in april adopted a resolution requiring 
the government to notify visiting warships of denmarks 31yearold 
ban on nuclear weapons 
after new but inconclusive elections waged partly on the 
issue denmarks coalition prime minister poul schlueter told the 
parliament on june 7 that allied governments had been informed of 
denmarks general policy banning atomic weapons during peacetime 
and that in cases of specific ship visits foreign governments would 
be told that denmark assumes the visit is in compliance with danish 
rules 
the government considers that this procedure respects both the 
danish nonnuclear policy and the views of our allies schlueter 
said 
state department spokesman charles redman said june 7 the united 
states had noted the prime ministers statement and one by danish 
foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen that the formula respects 
the policy of our allies neither to confirm nor to deny the 
presence of nuclear weapons on their naval vessels 
us officials have said a similar arrangement is used on us 
port visits to norway 
new zealand has not recently suggested using the danish formula 
and it would be up to it to take the initiative on the matter said 
one of the state department officials prime minister lange in the 
past has likened new zealands nuclear ban to those of the 
scandinavian nato allies

the following are excerpts of pope john paul 
iis apostolic letter released saturday as translated from italian 
by the associated press 
with great distress the church has observed the illegitimate 
ordination of bishops performed june 30 by archbishop marcel 
lefebvre who made useless years of efforts to assure that the 
priestly fraternity of st pius x was in full communion with 
the church 
this act of disobedience which signifies the outright 
rejection of the roman primate constitutes a schismatic act in 
carrying out this act despite the formal monitum warning sent 
to them by the cardinal prefect of the congregation for bishops 
last june 17 monsignor lefebvre and the priests bernard fellay 
bernard tissier de mallerais richard williamson and alfonso de 
galarreta have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication as 
foreseen under ecclesiastical discipline 
the results of the movement promoted by monsignor lefebvre 
should and ought to be the motive for all catholics to reflect 
sincerely on their own faithfulness to the tradition of the church 
 
i would also like to call the attention of theologians and other 
experts in ecclesiastical science in order that these also feel 
summoned by the present circumstances in fact the teachings 
of the second vatican council call for a renewed examination of 
the faith which brings to light the councils continuity with the 
tradition of the church especially on those points of doctrine 
which perhaps because of their novelty have not yet been 
understood well by some sectors in the church 
under the present circumstances i would like above all to 
appeal solemnly and from the heart in a fatherly and brotherly 
way to all those who have in some way been linked to the movement 
of archbishop lefebvre so that they understand the serious 
obligation to remain united with the vatican of christ in the unity 
of the catholic church and not continue to aid that movement in in 
any way 
no one should ignore that formal adhesion to the schism 
constitutes a grave offense to god and leads to excommunication 
established by the right of the church 
to all these catholic faithful who feel close to some older 
liturgical forms and disciplines of the latin tradition i would 
like to express my will to facilitate their spiritual unity 
with the church through the means necessary to guarantee respect 
for their just aspirations 
keeping in mind the importance and complexity of the problems 
referred to in this document and in virtue of my apostolic 
authority i establish the following 
a the creation of a commission with the responsibility of 
working with the bishops the departments of the roman curia and 
interested groups to facilitate complete unification with the 
church of the priests seminarians religious communities or 
individuals that have been linked to the fraternity founded by 
monsignor lefebvre and who would like to remain united to the 
successor of peter in the catholic church preserving their 
spiritual and liturgical traditions in line with the protocol 
signed last may 5 by cardinal joseph ratzinger head of the 
congregation for the doctrine of the faith and monsignor lefebvre 
b this commission will have a cardinal as its president and be 
composed of other members of the roman curia 
c moreover the spirit of those who feel tied to the latin 
liturgical tradition must be respected through a broad and 
generous application of the directive allowing use of the roman 
missal such the typical edition of 1962

the democratic justice party said it regretted the outcome of 
saturdays vote and called the oppositions mass absention 
undemocratic government officials said roh would name a new 
nominee soon 
kim daejungs largest opposition grouping the party for peace 
and democracy termed the outcome fortunate and called on roh 
to nominate a chief justice who enjoys public confidence in his 
ability to achieve judicial independence 
kim youngsams reunification democrtic party hailed the vote as 
a great victory of our people 
the korea bar association also welcomed the outcome and said the 
new nominee should be selected from those who had not been 
associated with past authoritarian governments 
the outcome came as a surprise as the government party was 
confident that it could muster enough votes with the help of a 
conservative opposition group 
former premier kim jongpils new democratic republican party 
had publicly endorsed rohs nomination but some of its 35 
lawmakers voted against chung 
the top judiciary post has been vacant since june 17 when kim 
yongchul resigned under pressure from junior judges demanding 
democratic reforms in the judiciary 
under the new constitution adopted last year kim needed 
approval from the national assembly to stay in the post hundreds 
of judges demanded his resignation criticizing him for his alleged 
progovernment role in the past 
the failure of chungs nomination to pass parliament will strain 
relations between the governing and opposition camps and will be 
difficult for roh to handle according to political analysts 
also saturday the assembly approved former lawyer kim youngjun 
as the chief government auditor the nomination was passed by 
15410 with 131 absentions and one invalid vote

as the tawana brawley case becomes ever more 
complicated the focus has shifted from the black teenager to her 
three advisers and their racial politics and the crucial question 
what happened when she disappeared for four days last year has 
been obscured 
although she has maintained an almost complete public silence 
tawana brawley is famous she has made the cover of people magazine 
and was the subject of a donahue program her picture is all 
over the newspapers whether she attends the theater on the arm of 
an adviser or visits the church where her mother has sought 
sanctuary 
but the brawley case has become less and less about miss brawley 
and more and more about the tactics and motives of her publicist 
the rev al sharpton and her lawyers alton maddox and c vernon 
mason 
miss brawley disappeared from her home in wappingers falls 
ny for four days last november she was found in a garbage bag 
her hair cut and her body smeared with excrement and marked with 
racial slurs 
she has said she was abducted and sexually molested by six white 
men one of whom had a badge but questions have been raised about 
her story including suggestions that miss brawley was at a party 
during part of the time she was missing 
her mother glenda brawley has said that the family initially 
cooperated with authorities but they stopped assisting after she 
and the advisers felt that local and state officials were trying to 
protect the guilty 
the advisers say that the tawana brawley case illustrates how 
the states criminal justice system consistently discriminates 
against blacks 
the case has been unorthodox from the start but in recent weeks 
a series of bizarre developments has diverted attention from the 
alleged victim to those around her 
first since the teenager would not talk investigators 
subpoenaed her mother to testify before a grand jury rather than 
cooperate she sought sanctuary in a church in brooklyns black 
bedfordstuyvesant section 
sharpton challenged the special prosecutor state attorney 
general robert abrams to arrest her and show the nation the 
moral beast you are abrams stayed put and so did glenda brawley 
that was when sharpton aide perry mckinnon defected he charged 
that sharpton mason and maddox in fact had no evidence that 
would shed light on what happened to miss brawley and that they 
were using her case to fuel a political movement he quoted 
sharpton as saying the case could make the advisers the biggest 
niggers in new york 
mckinnon characterized the brawley advisers claim to evidence 
of what really happened a pack of lies and said the tawana 
brawley story may be that there is no tawana brawley story 
sharpton counterattacked denouncing mckinnon as a gofer who had 
no access to the brawleys or their advisers deliberations 
sharpton also described mckinnon as a killer he was a soldier in 
vietnam a psychopath mckinnon received psychiatric treatment 
after returning from vietnam and a bigamist mckinnon did not 
complete divorce proceedings to end his first marriage 
a week later an unemployed former navy technician samuel 
mcclease claimed to have been promised 11000 by sharpton to bug 
masons home and office and sharptons home in order to protect 
sharpton if the case began to unravel 
mcclease told wcbstv he had tapes that substantiated his 
allegations which generally supported mckinnons 
polls showed that new yorkers including an overwhelming share 
of whites and a majority of blacks believed that glenda brawley 
and her advisers had not handled the case responsibly and that the 
latter were lying 
but then came another jolt the fbi said the tapes mcclease 
produced were blank and appeared never to have been used and 
charged mcclease with obstruction of justice and perjury 
investigators who thought they had seen everything rolled their 
eyes and shook their heads r scott greathead first assistant 
state attorney general was more restrained than most calling the 
blank tapes another unexpected development in a case that has 
been full of many surprising twists and turns 
sharpton was jubilant we are coming to get our deed papers 
he said referring to what he said would be a 100 million libel 
suit against wcbs we gonna go see what color curtains we want in 
our new building 
but the flamboyant preacher also had reason for concern he 
reportedly was being investigated by the internal revenue service 
for not filing tax returns 
at the end of the week a standoff again seemed to have been 
reached with both sides overwhelmed by the absurdity and 
unexpectedness of developments 
it was left for gov mario cuomo to state the obvious the case 
will be resolved only if tawana brawley or her mother would 
speak just tell us what happened

the wail of conch shells and the 
chanting of monks opened a celebration honoring bhumibol adulyadej 
the hugely popular king who on saturday became the longestreigning 
monarch in thailands 750year history 
the kings 42 years and 23 days on the throne eclipsed the 
tenure of king chulalongkorn a visionary monarch who ruled from 
1868 to 1910 when thailand still was an absolute monarchy 
the king and queen sirikit lit candles and incense sticks before 
the ashes of king chulalongkorn to begin the four days of religious 
and royal celebrations monks chanted and conch shells sounded 
during the ceremony 
the king on friday signed a decree to free or reduce the 
sentences of about 50000 prisoners charged with minor crimes such 
royal amnesties are issued periodically to mark special occasions 
the ceremonies in the grand palace a walled compound of 
glittering spirals and imposing structures opened with the 
presentation of special prayer fans to 44 senior buddhist monks 
prime minister prem tinsulanonda cabinet ministers and senior 
military officers were at the palace for the rites along with 
members of the royal family 
bangkok buildings have been festooned with lights and 
decorations for several days and a display of 29999 fireworks is 
planned king bhumibol is the ninth monarch of the current chakri 
dynasty and nine is generally considered an auspicious number by 
thais 
public festivities including movies concerts and folk dances 
have been scheduled throughout the country 
the royal family is also to visit ayuthaya where they will pay 
respects to the spirits of kingly ancestors of the old capital 
which was sacked by the burmese in 1767 
the royal seat subsequently was moved to bangkok where the 
chakri dynasty was founded in 1782 by rama i 
rama iv popularized in the west in the book and movie the 
king and i began changing traditional concepts of absolute rule 
and introduced western knowhow to the country rama v reorganized 
the state machinery opened thailand to further western influence 
but adroitly kept colonial powers at bay 
bhumibol who turned 60 in december during another nationwide 
celebration was born in boston where his father studied medicine 
the swisseducated prince assumed the throne upon the 
stillmysterious death of his brother in 1946 he gradually 
restored some of the power and prestige the monarchy lost in 1932 
when a bloodless revolution ended its absolute rule 
the king and his wife were a hit during a series of world tours 
in the 1960s the multitalented monarch frequently shed his normal 
seriousness to pick up a saxaphone and join in jazz jam sessions 
in the 1970s and 80s he and members of his family turned their 
attention to the countrys rural poor initiating a network of 
royal projects in irrigation reforestation agriculture and the 
replacement of opium by other cash crops 
the king would spend up to nine months of each year in the 
countryside away from the opulent palaces and elaborate ceremonies 
in bangkok 
the king has stepped in on several occasions of national crisis 
including a 1973 student revolt against a trio of military 
strongmen the bloodshed was stopped and the trio exiled he is 
widely believed to wield considerable behindthescenes power and 
is looked upon by thais as a factor of stability in a modern 
history punctuated by frequent military coups and factionalism

saturday 
good afternoon this is senator robert byrd of west virginia 
this monday is the fourth of july for most americans the 
fourth of july is a day to spend with family and friends we hold 
picnics go to the beach march in parades and look forward to 
fireworks at night we celebrate our freedom it is a good day to 
be an american we share our love of country around the barbecue 
pit and the picnic table 
we take stock of nations prosperity between innings during the 
annual softball game we see the future in the delight of our 
children as they watch the fireworks light up the sky it is a day 
of quite patriotism reaffirmation and thankfulness 
we thank god for our good fortune that we are americans we 
reaffirm our commitment to the legacy given to us by our 
forbearers we pray for those americans upon whom misfortune has 
fallen 
but this fourth is a little different it is different because 
this year we must choose a new path for america this is an 
election year were about to choose a new president 
and on this fourth of july it is a time for reflection as well 
as celebration it is a time to remember what has made america 
great and to use those traditional strengths as we contemplate the 
future our nation has unfinished business 
our foreign competition is still beating us at our own game 
our children are not getting the education they deserve the 
american dream of owning a home seems to be almost out of reach for 
the next generation drug dealers flood the market with dope and 
death the american family the bedrock of our nations foundation 
is changing and needs new policies to preserve it 
what is most disturbing is the erosion of the public trust 
wall street has been rocked by scandal our national security is 
being endangered by greed honesty and integrity seem to be in 
short supply for some americans those may seem to be reasons 
enough to turn away from politics from making a choice about the 
future nothing is ever going to change they say throwing up 
their hands in despair why vote at all 
but if this had been the attitude of thomas jefferson and the 
other great founders of our nation on the first fourth of july 
where would we be today let us reject the cynicism that says that 
things cannot be improved 
you the people have the power to change things and to let 
those in high places know what you expect america has unfinished 
business 
america was not founded on cynicism it was founded on hope by 
strong people who built a new country by making new choices however 
difficult america was built on love of country belief in the 
common man hard and honest work optimism and religious faith it 
is your government and it can reflect your values and it can help 
to solve americas problem but you have to participate 
america can deal with its drug problem american can educate our 
children better american can adapt to the changing needs of the 
family america can meet our security commitments without busting 
the national budget america can meet our energy needs america can 
protect the environment and america can demand a fair deal from 
our trading partners overseas americans want a restoration of 
integrity and common decency those are values that we all share 
and understand 
i come from west virginia the state where patriotism and family 
are cherished traditions i know most other americans are like that 
too i have great faith in this country when we americans put our 
minds to it we can solve our problems and americans are always 
willing to imagine something new and better for their country 
americans are optimists 
this fourth of july then let us remember our strengths our 
heritage and our power to determine our own fate we can give 
america a new beginning celebrate your freedom in the most 
meaningful way this year participate exercise that most 
important uniquely american privilege register and vote get

chinese reformists watched with keen interest as 
members of the soviet communist party openly wrangled over economic 
and political change last week but they were reluctant to draw 
parallels to their own experience 
indirectly the chinese have a stake in soviet reform because it 
reflects their own efforts to modernize their country successful 
soviet reforms could persuade footdragging chinese conservatives 
to emulate their communist neighbor 
but for practical and historical reasons chinese comment on 
last weeks concluded soviet party conference has been impersonal 
we are following the developments and we hope that the 
reform in the soviet union will be a success foreign ministry 
spokesman li zhaoxing said politely when pressed to comment 
the official xinhua news agency which called the conference 
crucial to the soviets domestic situation reported the opening 
and closing of the proceedings as flashes the most urgent kind of 
news bulletin but it did not comment on the possible impact of the 
conference on chinas reforms or on sino soviet relations 
soviet parallels to chinas experience are obvious 
both countries want to revitalize economies grown stagnant under 
central planning and both see the solution in reducing central 
planning and encouraging input from the longforgotten individual 
citizen 
just eight months ago chinas communist party held a landmark 
national congress at which it retired aging conservatives and 
pledged to move ahead full speed in separating party and government 
functions and streamlining the bureaucracy 
chinese newspaper readers this spring were treated to 
unprecedented open debate among legislators on problems such as 
corruption and the need for democracy much as soviet readers were 
last week 
if one substitutes kaifang for glasnost and gaige 
for perestroika soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs appeals for 
openness and restructuring echo speeches made by senior leader deng 
xiaoping over the past decade 
but emphasizing the similarities between their policies could be 
dangerous for deng 
while soviet success would bolster his cause soviet failure 
would give chinese conservatives a powerful argument for halting 
change 
chinese analysts believe failure is a real possibility tang 
xiuzhe a commentator for the xinhua agency emphasized big 
hurdles the soviets face including changing the thought and 
behavior patterns of countless bureaucrats 
western observers say reform could be tougher in the soviet 
union than in china because central planning has been in place a 
generation longer and there are fewer people around with a memory 
of how private markets work 
in addition china does not follow the philosophy that all 
communist countries should follow common domestic policies 
although china started its economic reforms in 1978 and could 
claim to play big brother to the soviets it maintains a 
detached attitude one of the factors in the bitter sinosoviet 
split of the early 1960s was moscows insistence that what was good 
for the soviets was good for the chinese 
deng frequently tells other socialist leaders most recently 
the visiting ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam that 
nations must conduct reform according to their own conditions 
official detachment aside xinhuas detailed coverage of the 
soviet conference showed the keenness of chinese interest 
the news agency carried detailed reports of each days debates 
and interviews with soviet citizens saying they want change 
xinhua also gave lengthy reports of former moscow party chief 
boris yeltsins open challenge of party authority a sensitive area 
in chinese politics 
china has its own case of a high official dismissed for 
offending conservatives hu yaobang was ousted last year after 
failing to speedily crack down on student prodemocracy 
demonstrations hu like yeltsin sinned by being too far ahead of 
his fellow reformers 
but in allowing yeltsin to make his plea before such a large 
open gathering the soviets showed they are far ahead of the 
chinese in the kaifang or glasnost aspect of reform 
china still keeps its party squabbles private

when doug la follette tossed his hat in the 
ring for the us senate some people wondered why the hat was so 
big 
la follette wisconsins secretary of state wears a gray 
australian bush hat almost everywhere he goes the reason is he 
has the same mild form of skin cancer as president reagan 
his widebrimmed hat is a slight political liability but also a 
potential trademark and a tool for educating people about the 
hazards of excessive exposure to the sun la follette said 
i dont wear a hat out of a quirk i wear a hat for very 
realistic health reasons la follette 48 said during a campaign 
visit at a recent farmers market on capitol square ive learned 
that the sun can be harmful 
la follette is one of five democrats and two republicans vying 
to succeed retiring sen william proxmire dwis 
its very sobering realizing being brown is not as beautiful 
as you think it is said la follette who was diagnosed three 
years ago as having basal cell carcinoma the most common and least 
dangerous form of skin cancer 
nationally an estimated 300000 to 400000 people are diagnosed 
each year as having the easily treated form of cancer it is not 
even counted in official cancer statistics but still could be 
fatal if untreated 
la follettes case was diagnosed when what he thought was a 
pimple turned out to be a precancerous spot on his skin since 
then he has gone in for a checkup every six months 
his physician dr stephen snow of the university of wisconsin 
medical school said skin cancer accounts for more than onethird 
of all cancer cases and as many skin cancers are diagnosed 
annually as cancers of the lung breast colon and prostate 
combined 
its all related to sunlight snow said its a totally 
preventable problem but since when has the average person ever 
been rational 
dr derek cripps also of the university of wisconsin 
recommends that everyone wear sun screen with a protection factor 
of 15 or higher la follette wears sun screen rated 32 as well as 
his widebrimmed hat 
wearing a hat puts off some people la follette said 
you cant be a hermit the hat is my solution la follette 
said the big brim is important because it keeps the sun off my 
nose and ears

the communist party will review the qualifications 
of each of its 20 million members before the end of the year a 
move that could help strengthen mikhail s gorbachevs political 
base 
gorbachev directed that the examination of party members be 
conducted in the open and not through discussion behind the 
scenes the official communist party newspaper pravda said 
saturday 
the fourday communist party conference that ended friday 
approved a call for reevaluating party membership as well as 
backing gorbachevs program for a stronger legislature presidency 
and a 10year limit on the terms of party and government officials 
pravda said the conference considered it necessary to carry 
out this year a campaign in party organizations governed by 
the decisions of the conference about reform of the political 
system democratization of party life 
such a reevaluation of party membership could become a 
widespread effort to force opponents of gorbachevs reforms out of 
the party but it is more likely to be targeted against the idle 
and corrupt 
not a single honest man should be left outside perestroika 
gorbachev said in his speech opening the conference tuesday 
but the communist party chief also has said that the criterion 
for judging party members is their attitude toward his reform 
effort a limited housecleaning could be expected to strengthen 
gorbachev by eliminating some of the most intransigent opponents of 
reform and improving the partys effectiveness 
and it could improve the image of the party which the 
policymaking central committee criticized before the conference as 
having a bureaucratic stranglehold on the economy and government 
communists must go through a lengthy selection process and 
ideological training before being granted membership in the party 
a prerequisite for advancement to positions of responsibility in 
soviet society about one of 10 soviet adults is a member of the 
party 
although conference delegates backed the review of the 
membership roll it is unlikely they would have gone along with a 
widespread campaign against conservatives 
many of the speeches to the conference struck a tone 
considerably more conservative than gorbachevs and the official 
press said before the conference that midlevel party officials had 
rammed through slates of delegates despite gorbachevs call for an 
open democratic election procedure 
the resolution calling for the review of party membership also 
called for a a division of power between the party apparatus and 
local governing councils or soviets 
gorbachev proposed at the conference to get the party out of 
daytoday management of affairs and leave that to responsible 
government officials and plant managers 
the resolution was the only one of seven from the party 
conference published by the soviet press saturday and it was 
uncertain when the rest of the resolutions would be released 
the conference of 5000 communists from around the country 
called to review progress on gorbachevs reforms and chart a course 
for the future acted on the party review at the urging of the 
central committee and gorbachev 
gorbachev has told party bureaucrats they must either get behind 
him or get out of the way 
but he said the party still must give its members a chance 
many of these who only recently were regarded inactive and had 
lost contact with the party branch who had been regarded as dead 
wood are now trying to find their place in life gorbachev said 
the very certification process should be a school of educating 
communists gorbachev added

trucks carrying some 2000 bales of 
donated hay for droughtstricken farmers arrived here saturday as 
virginia farmers returned a favor granted by their ohio 
counterparts during a drought two years ago 
four trucks rolled into this mercer county village in western 
ohio shortly before noon and about 50 farmers who were involved in 
the 1986 haylift to virginia lined up for free hay 
each farmer received 40 bales or about enough to feed an 
average mercer county herd of cows for one day virgil dues who 
operates a farm with about 200 head of cattle was the first farmer 
to get his hay 
one bale is good two bales is better dues said were 
going daybyday there is nothing we can do about the drought 
right now 
ralph heyne who operates a nearby cattle farm said he donated 
about 1500 bales to virginia farmers in 1986 when the southeast 
suffered a pasturekilling drought and farmers across the nation 
shipped donated hay by the trainload 
at the time i had a lot of hay in my barn and i thought it 
was the thing to do said heyne who has about 350 head of 
cattle it was an easy thing to do when my barn was full i wish 
we were sending it down this time 
heyne said ohio farmers were becoming more worried as the 
midwest drought continues 
fuses are a little shorter around here than usual he said 
its a little harder to keep a smile on your face 
after the hay arrived lt gov paul leonard spoke by telephone 
to haylift organizer eugene morris a us department of 
agriculture soil specialist from charlotte court house va 
we want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts were 
at the point where every little bit helps this is a good start 
mr morris leonard said 
we expect this to be the beginning of a good thing it shows 
that in any time of crisis we can depend on one another leonard 
said ohioans have never been so selfish that they wouldnt help 
others in their time of need and theyve never been so proud that 
they would not accept help in their own time of need 
morris told leonard and the farmers that he was trying to 
organize another haylift mercer county extension agent nick 
freeman said most local farmers would run out of hay before fall if 
the drought does not end soon 
theyve had to sell a lot of cattle by now freeman said 
at the market its a sad scene to watch farmers bring in cows 
they dont want to sell its having an emotional impact on the 
community 
the trucks donated by the goodyear tire amp rubber co left 
charlotte county va friday goodyear also provided drivers and 
paid transportation costs 
another haylift reached cloverdale ind on friday with bales 
of hay donated by south carolina farmers and trucked in by 
volunteer offduty charleston sc cops our hay yield is down 
and what were using now is what should be used next winter 
farmer ed meek said 
haylifts also are operating elsewhere across the nation 
fifteen railroad cars of hay are being provided by feed the 
children a hunger relief agency in oklahoma to farmers in south 
dakota with the first load arriving at aberdeen in two weeks the 
burlington northern railroad is providing free transportation

banned in wisconsin because the drought has raised the risk of 
fire but nature may provide its own display of colors and lights 
an entomologist says 
fireflies and glowworms might help brighten the holiday 
festivities across wisconsin 
therell be a little bit of natural fireworks this weekend 
said phillip pelliteri jr an entomologist with the university of 
wisconsin extension in madison 
the firefly population has been down the last three years but 
has increased recently with a population growth of glowworms the 
last three weeks he said glowworms are the larval stage of 
fireflies 
the fireflies may also be an asset for holiday celebrations 
because they feed on pesky insects 
pellitteri said wasp and mosquito populations are also down and 
its one of the few blessings of the drought

the lockheed corp is negotiating the sale of 
l100 transport planes to ethiopia and the red cross is worried 
that the hungerplagued nation could use the planes for military 
purposes 
joseph e dabney a lockheed spokesman in nearby marietta where 
the plane is manufactured confirmed the companys negotiations 
with governmentowned ethiopian airlines 
we understand that they plan to open up an african cargo 
operation to airlift perishables such as fruits and vegetables from 
africa to europe then haul consumer goods from europe back to 
africa he was quoted as saying in sundays atlanta journal and 
atlanta constitution 
dabney said ethiopia is trying to buy at least two l100s the 
civilian version of the c130 a fourengine plane widely used by 
the us air force 
two weeks ago us officials said l100s would not be sold to 
angola because that countrys marxist government has used the plane 
for military purposes 
some worry that ethiopias marxist government might do the same 
thing ethiopia has been criticized for blocking relief efforts in 
rebellious areas 
any of these planes are very versatile and could certainly be 
used to transport troops or artillery or other supplies said 
jeanjacques surbeck information officer of the international 
committee of the red cross in new york the red cross was expelled 
from ethiopia in may 
the newspaper said ethiopian officials in washington and new 
york would not confirm the negotiations with lockheed

the first communist party conference in 47 years 
ended with the biggest overhaul of the soviet political system 
since the 1920s but it did not resolve the issues that touched off 
the most heated debate 
fiery oratory came from workers on the problems of food 
shortages pollution and the privileges of the elite party members 
clashed over the new openness of the soviet press 
with each day of the fourday conference discussion became more 
impassioned building to the spectacle friday of a politburo member 
and his ousted rival dueling before the 5000 delegates and an 
audience of millions on national television 
introducing the most radical overhaul of the political system 
since the days of josef stalin soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
on tuesday embarked on a discussion of his reforms in a 3hour 
keynote address 
he proposed to have the communist party officials at every level 
stand for election this will mean gorbachev will be eligible to 
seek a new strengthened presidency to be elected by the 2250 
members of a representative body to be known as the congress of 
peoples deputies the congress would be elected every five years 
and meet once a year 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev a close gorbachev ally 
said communists will lose their party posts if they fail to win 
elections as heads of soviets or governing councils in secret 
ballots of the deputies 
according to ousted moscow party boss boris n yeltsin the 
proposal on the soviets was so unexpected that many delegates 
did not understand it 
even gorbachev admitted there was a certain lack of 
understanding for the proposal when he took the floor for a 
second time on thursday with a passionate appeal for political 
reform 
delegates endorsed the proposal on elections with 209 dissenting 
votes in spite of a party tradition of uniting behind the 
leadership when a vote is taken the resolution was the only one of 
seven adopted by the conference that was published the day after 
the proceedings ended late friday 
resolutions on gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
on ethnic questions legal reform economic restructuring and 
fighting bureaucracy still were unpublished late saturday 
opposition to glasnost became evident during the conference 
debate as delegates shouted down liberal editors ivan laptiev of 
izvestia and grigory baklanov of the literary monthly znamya on 
wednesday russian writer yuri bondarev charged the reformist press 
destroys humiliates and flushes down the toilet our past and our 
sacred national values 
intervening frequently in the debate gorbachev repeatedly 
reminded delegates that we are learning democracy and 
encouraged them to let speakers have their say 
in addition to yeltsin others ventured into territory that for 
years has been off limits to criticism a steelworker from the 
urals a siberian party official and a delegate from a moscow 
aerodynamics institute who demanded that yeltsin address the 
conference 
three years after gorbachev began his reforms steelworker 
veniamin a yarin said workers see no results 
talking about industrial pollution in his city in the urals 
yarin harangued the government for failing to take action and 
demanded measures in the 60 most polluted soviet cities to stop 
this chernobyllike catastrophe 
yeltsin noted that we are all proud of socialism but in 70 
years we have not resolved the most important problems how to feed 
and clothe the people provide services and decide social 
questions 
yeltsin who as a former nonvoting member of the ruling 
politburo has had access to the special stores limousines and food 
deliveries reserved for top party officials called for abolition 
of special privileges 
yeltsin also requested regular reports on communist party 
finances saying that as head of the party in moscow and earlier in 
the urals city of sverdlovsk he knew the party raked in millions 
of rubles in members fees but saw the results only in dachas 
so luxurious that its embarrassing when people visit from other 
foreign parties 
gorbachev told conference delegates in a casual chat televised 
thursday that we should take a look at party privileges because 
there are so many popular complaints about them 
but kremlin no 2 yegor k ligachev criticized yeltsin and polls 
on public attitudes toward party privileges published in the 
reformist weekly moscow news the newspaper said that of 548 
muscovites asked 84 percent disapproved of special food deliveries 
to certain officials 
ligachev said official figures should be published but 
defended such privileges by stressing how hard party leaders work 
he also defended party stalwarts andrei a gromyko and mikhail 
s solomentsev as supporters of gorbachev a delegate said thursday 
that the two officials and others who carried out the 
nowdiscredited policies of former premier leonid i brezhnev cant 
properly serve under gorbachev 
yeltsin too lashed out at unnamed officials who came to power 
in the brezhnev era saying they should be dismissed after giving a 
public explanation of why they supported policies that led the 
country to a crisis 
he also attacked solomentsev by name accusing the head of the 
partys chief disciplinary body of failing to call to account 
people who took bribes in the millions

a congresswoman seeking her fifth term 
could be removed from the ballot because of two minor discrepancies 
on her declaration of candidacy authorities said saturday 
two democratic candidates said they would decide this week 
whether to ask the state board of elections to invalidate 
republican rep claudine c schneiders candidacy because of a 
missing middle initial and an address that said avenue instead 
of street 
stephen robertson a convicted murderer running as an 
independent candidate in the district said saturday that he had 
filed a formal objection with the board based on the two errors 
schneider was the second rhode island republican congressional 
candidate to encounter a filing error last week former state gop 
chairman john a holmes jr had to withdraw from the race in the 
states other district thursday after a campaign aide failed to 
file his declaration of candidacy by the 4 pm deadline 
holmes was automatically disqualified because the law setting 
the filing deadline allows no exceptions but schneider will remain 
on the ballot unless the board of elections upholds an objection 
against her election officials said there was no one in the 
elections board office saturday to confirm that robertson had filed 
his petition 
if schneider is removed from the ballot she would have to wage 
a writein campaign she is unopposed on the republican ticket 
an aide robert rendine said he did not know how the error 
occurred but he believed schneider will remain on the ballot 
the intent of the law is to remove any confusion and make sure 
that a candidate is who he says he is rendine said in the 
case of a fourterm incumbent congresswoman i dont think theres 
any doubt 
the democraticcontrolled board of canvassers in schneiders 
hometown of narragansett voted friday along party lines to 
invalidate her filing form because her signature and address on the 
form did not match those on her voter registration card 
state law requires the form and the registration to match 
exactly in march the board of elections threw a wouldbe jesse 
jackson delegate off the presidential primary ballot because of the 
same middleinitial problem faced by schneider that case is now in 
federal court 
schneider signed her form with her middle initial which does 
not appear on her registration and listed her address as 56 
central ave although her registration gives her address 
correctly as central street 
we thought it was kind of trite ourselves but we thought it 
was our job to determine whether they matched to the letter of the 
law said walter v boyle one of two democrats on the 
threemember board of canvassers 
after the narragansett boards vote secretary of state kathleen 
s connell a democrat whose office is responsible for elections 
said she would issue schneider nomination papers anyway 
we were not elected to knock people off the ballot connell 
said i dont think the electorate wants elections decided by 
initials and periods 
boyle said the narragansett board will not file a formal 
objection but ruth morgenthau and paul o iacono the two 
democrats competing in the sept 14 primary for the right to 
challenge schneider said they might do so 
it doesnt make any difference whether its george bush or 
john holmes or claudine schneider or john doe in the street the 
law is the law iacono said if you start making exceptions 
then all those other people in past years who have not had 
exceptions made will be left out 
morgenthau took a somewhat softer line i expect to win this 
election on my merits and i dont like to see a candidate 
disqualified on technicalities she said

in an interview on radio tunis he said he was speaking only for 
himself and not on behalf of fatah

a federal appeals court ruling could lead 
to the release of two tuscarora indians who have been held without 
bond for six months while awaiting trial on hostagetaking charges 
an attorney said saturday 
attorney william kunstler said the 4th us court of appeals 
ruled thursday that a federal magistrate did not provide a timely 
detention hearing for eddie hatcher and timothy jacobs last 
february 
imagine they have lost a halfyear of their lives kunstler 
said 
kunstler in a telephone interview from new york said he 
received a copy of the opinion on saturday the appeals court in 
richmond va was closed for the holiday weekend and the ruling 
could not be independently confirmed 
the court ruled that the magistrate failed to hold a detention 
hearing within the required five days kunstler said the appeals 
court sent the case back to us district court in raleigh for 
prompt determination of appropriate conditions of pretrial 
release kunstler said 
hatcher 30 and jacobs 19 are set to go on trial july 11 on 
federal charges of hostagetaking and manufacturing illegal 
firearms the two held up to 20 people hostage feb 1 at the 
robesonian newspaper offices in lumberton near the south carolina 
border 
the hostages were freed after the two negotiated a deal that 
included the establishment of a state task force to investigate 
their charges of alleged corruption among robeson county officials 
no one was injured in the incident 
hatcher and jacobs were being held saturday in held in the 
craven county jail in new bern about 120 miles east of lumberton 
the two men had gone before magistrate wallace dixon on feb 2 
but didnt have their detention hearing until feb 17 at that 
time dixon ordered them held without bond 
kunstler said dixon contends the two indians waived their 
detention hearing saying they were afraid to be released but 
kunstler said defendants cannot legally waive their own hearing 
attorneys for hatcher and jacobs appealed in april before us 
district court judge terrence boyle but he upheld the magistrates 
decision 
a lot of the delays here are the judges they just dont 
give a damn about the indians said kunstler who is with the 
center for constitutional rights 
kunstler said attorneys would seek a hearing before boyle next 
week on the release of hatcher and jacobs 
another attorney for the two men bob warren of the christic 
institute south of carrboro nc was trying to reach assistant 
us attorney john stuart bruce on saturday to discuss the matter

from a woman wearing a button showing fallen 
reformer boris yeltsin to a spirited conversation between shoppers 
in a food store the communist party conference encouraged ordinary 
soviets to speak their minds 
it was a lesson in democracy proclaimed alexei medvedev a 
35yearold scientist encountered saturday by a reporter in 
downtown moscow 
excitement over the fourday conference that ended friday was 
evident when a reporter asked one soviet in the street for his 
reaction at least 100 other people gathered to listen or join in 
many carried newspapers with extensive reports on the proceedings 
the hottest sensations of the conference according to about a 
dozen soviets gathered in 86degree heat were speeches friday by 
yeltsin and the no 2 man in the kremlin yegor k ligachev who 
skewered yelstins appeal for rehabilitation 
in his speech yeltsin continued the blunt talk that made him 
popular among muscovites but that led to his ouster as moscow party 
boss in november and from his nonvoting seat on the ruling 
politburo in february 
yeltsin complained the partys reform proposals didnt go far 
enough and said his only mistake in speaking out last october 
before the party central committee was that he spoke too soon 
but ligachev a rival of yeltsin and considered a conservative 
counterweight to gorbachev on the politburo said yeltsin was full 
of destructive energy and hadnt learned his lesson 
at one moscow food store several soviets were overheard 
condemning ligachev the scene was similar on pushkin square 
yeltsins speech was superb a woman shouted to a reporter 
then ligachev spoke and hes a scandal monger the woman then 
stalked off 
former political prisoner and dissident journalist lev timofeyev 
said the conference was the most lively and democratic communist 
party meeting in recent times but that it skirted key issues 
for us practical results will be whether they release 
political prisoners how they treat the independent press and 
whether they end repression against people in independent groups 
timofeyev said by telephone 
a man who would identify himself only as roger called the 
associated press bureau in moscow to read a statement saying the 
conference has been a total collapse of all our hopes 
it marks the start it is the start of a new era of 
repressive regime the man said 
yuri mityunov a spokesman for the democratic union a fledgling 
political group offering itself as an alternative to the communist 
party said by telephone the conference was a victory of 
conservative revolutionists 
it is not the radical reform that people expected mityunov 
said it is only restructuring of the system of bureaucratic 
management of the country and i think it wont help solve the very 
difficult problems 
noting that gorbachevs call for more openness is not a 
guarantee of free speech mityunov said three members of his group 
were detained friday night and fined or jailed for seeking 
signatures on a petition demanding that jailed democratic union 
activists be released 
the crowd on pushkin square which has become a gathering place 
for political activists and those curious enough to want to watch 
demonstrations was grateful for the chance to hear ligachev on 
television 
yesterday we saw who ligachev really is medvedev said 
hes a demagogue medvedev lived in sverdlovsk while yeltsin was 
party boss there before coming to moscow and he remains a yeltsin 
partisan 
irina bogantsyeva a teacher displayed a button she said she 
made after yeltsin got in trouble in october she had typed 
yeltsins name on a newspaper photograph encased it in plastic and 
affixed it to her blouse 
the only reason i havent turned in my party membership 
card bogantsyeva said angrily is that i belong to the same 
party to which boris nikolayevich yeltsin belongs 
another woman proposed forming a yeltsin defense committee 
and a third nina p shumilkina from alma ata capital of the 
kazakhstan republic claimed if we started a petition in defense 
of yeltsin millions would sign it 
ligachev denied in his speech that he opposed perestroika 
gorbachevs program to modernize the political and economic system 
but shumilkina said that if ligachev were at the wheel 
perestroika would come to a standstill medvedev said the 
conference and broadcasts of its activities were landmarks 
yesterday was a historic day he said we finally got real 
political debate and it was shown on television

the former commander of the us pacific 
fleet denied that he is involved in the pentagon bribery and fraud 
scandal being investigated by the justice department and accused a 
very vindictive clique of trying to destroy him and former navy 
secretary john f lehman 
retired adm james a ace lyons jr retired last oct 1 
after serving two years as commander of the pacific fleet 
according to pentagon sources lyons was prodded into retirement by 
lehmans successor as navy secretary james webb lyons has worked 
as a consultant to the mcdonnell douglas corp since at least last 
december 
lyons said in an interview published in saturdays editions of 
the los angeles times that top navy officials approved the 
consulting contract with mcdonnell douglas at a time when they knew 
the fbi was investigating alleged fraud within the defense industry 
the navy confirmed to the newspaper that lyons was cleared to 
work for mcdonnell douglas 
im not associated with this other crap lyons said 
referring to allegations that defense consultants have used 
classified information to help companies win military contracts 
so why in the hell was i even brought into this other than to 
discredit me 
neither lyons nor lehman is a target of the ongoing fraud 
investigation 
however lyons name appeared on a search warrant served at 
mcdonnell douglas st louis headquarters stated that investigators 
were seeking any contracts agreements reports payment records or 
any other documents relating to the work of ace lyons for the 
mcdonnell douglas from december 1987 through 1988 
lyons said his job with mcdonnell douglas was to convince the 
south koreans that they needed an allweather night fighterattack 
plane such as the f18 produced by mcdonnell douglas 
lyons told the times that navy officials gave mcdonnell douglas 
the goahead to hire him so that he and lehman would be embarrassed 
weve got a very vindictive clique who wants to destroy lehman 
and me certainly with lehman being the real target lyons was 
quoted as saying 
both webb and justice department chief spokesman patrick s 
korten denied the retired admirals allegations 
thats an odd combination of ignorance and meglomania 
korten said 
webb told the times that the accusations were absolutely 
ridiculous and that he had nothing to do with any effort to 
discredit lehman 
there are people who dont like lehman people who dont like 
me webb said that is the name of the game when you go into 
government if people are using this against lehman it has nothing 
to do with me

rain fell saturday over some sections of the nations drought 
belt but not enough to break the back of the dry spell and 
virginia farmers who were helped two years ago by donated hay 
returned the favor to an ohio village 
and the drought created a mini religious dispute in illinois 
where gov james r thompson declared sunday a day of prayer for 
rain 
thompsons action angered american atheists based at austin 
texas government must stop telling citizens when to pray what 
to pray how to pray or even if they should pray the group said 
in a statement saturday 
showers and thunderstorms spread during the morning from 
northwestern texas and the texas panhandle into southwestern 
oklahoma and from arkansas across western tennessee northern 
mississippi and alabama 
more than an inch of rain fell on parts of central and northern 
arkansas flooding some streets in north little rock and the 
storms knocked out electricity to thousands of customers 
it certainly has helped out an awful lot meteorologist mike 
thompson in little rock said of the rain but he added that some 
parts of the state havent had a drop in weeks and were still 
anywhere from two to 12 inches below normal in the state 
were going to need a couple of more weeks of weather like 
this to really make a dent in the drought and it doesnt look like 
that will be the case 
in michigans central upper peninsula crews reported about 85 
percent containment saturday of a fire that burned 1200 acres in 
the tinderdry hiawatha national forest a us forest spokeswoman 
said 
the fire forced about 60 families to evacuate their homes 
overnight along lake michigans little bay de noc but they were 
allowed back early saturday said spokeswoman mary mumford two 
outbuildings were destroyed she said 
a section of us 2 east of rapid river and nearby wisconsin 
central railroad tracks were closed for about five hours friday 
night before crews extinguished flames along both routes mumford 
said 
trucks carrying some 2000 bales of donated hay for 
droughtstricken farmers arrived at coldwater ohio on saturday as 
virginia farmers returned a favor the hay was divided among about 
50 farmers who were involved in the 1986 haylift to virginia when 
the southeast suffered its own drought 
at the time 1986 i had a lot of hay in my barn and i 
thought it was the thing to do said farmer ralph heyne who 
donated about 1500 bales to virginia it was an easy thing to do 
when my barn was full i wish we were sending it down this time 
a wisconsin official estimates his states 2monthold drought 
may bankrupt more farmers and slash crop yields and dairy herd 
sizes more than any other aspect of the sluggish farm economy of 
the 1980s 
it has singly done more damage than anything since the 1930s 
theres nothing that compares to what the drought has done so far 
even if we get good weather from here in said richard rodefeld 
an economist with the state department of agriculture trade and 
consumer protection 
fish biologists in wisconsin are urging fishermen to use 
restraint while officials consider the possibility of curtailing 
trout fishing altogether because of the drought trout populations 
were down 40 percent to 60 percent on two rivers in the antigo area 
surveyed recently 
one of the things thats really important out here is tourism 
and the outdoors and when the trout fishermen know the fishing is 
down they dont spend as much money on bait and tackle and hotel 
rooms max johnson wisconsin department of natural resources 
fish manager at antigo said of the eau claire river people come 
from all over to fish this stream 
an estimated 5 million trout swim in about 8900 miles of trout

pope john paul ii on saturday warned 
followers of marcel lefebvre they will be excommunicated if they 
stay with the rebel prelate but he promised the church will meet 
their traditionalist needs if they remain loyal to the papacy 
the vatican announced saturday that monsignor antonio de castro 
mayer a brazilian prelate who assisted lefebvre in consecrating 
four traditionalist bishops had been excommunicated 
lefebvre and the four bishops were excommunicated thursday after 
lefebvre defied the pope and performed the consecrations without 
his approval the consecration led to the first church schism in 
118 years 
no one should ignore that formal adhesion to the schism 
constitutes a grave offense to god and leads to excommunication 
established by the right of the church the pope said in his 
first public statement on the case since the consecrations in 
econe switzerland 
in an apostolic letter to bishops he urged lefebvres followers 
to fulfill the serious obligation to remain united with the vicar 
of christ in the unity of the church and not to continue to sustain 
lefebvres movement in any way 
a spokesman for lefebvre in econe said the prelate and other 
leaders were not available for comment saturday 
to those wishing to remain faithful to the papacy john paul 
promised to guarantee their traditionalist needs giving special 
attention to the 16th century tridentine mass 
to all those catholic faithful who feel close to some older 
liturgical forms and disciplines of the latin tradition i would 
like to express my will to facilitate their spiritual unity 
with the church through the means necessary to guarantee respect 
for their just aspirations the pope said in the letter which 
was released in both latin and italian by the vatican 
john paul said he was setting up a special vatican commission 
headed by a cardinal to facilitate complete unification with 
those lefebvre followers who prefer to remain with the mainstream 
church 
he said the panel would seek to preserve their spiritual and 
liturgical traditions 
lefebvre and his followers reject many reforms of the second 
vatican council 196265 including the replacement of the latin 
mass with a simplified liturgy in the modern local language 
a few years ago the vatican issued a decree saying the 
tridentine mass could be celebrated with special permission 
the pope indicated he would permit wider use of the ancient 
liturgy saying a broad and generous application of the decree 
would be allowed 
lefebvre claims millions of sympathizers around the world 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said recently that lefebvres 
supporters numbered 80000 to 100000 but other vatican officials 
have said about half a million people turn to his priests for 
various church functions 
john paul said the church as a whole reacted with great 
distress to thursdays consecrations which made useless years 
of efforts to reach a settlement with lefebvres piux x 
fraternity 
this despair is felt particularly by the successor of peter 
the pope even if the number of people directly involved in 
these events is small he wrote 
this act of disobedience which signifies the outright 
rejection of the roman primate constitutes a schismatic act 
the pope said noting that the prelates involved have incurred 
the grave penalty of excommunication as foreseen under 
ecclesiastical discipline 
he called lefebvres action contradictory to the church 
traditions lefebvre says he represents 
one cannot remain faithful to tradition by breaking ecclesial 
ties with the man whom christ himself in the person of the apostle 
peter entrusted the ministry of the unity of his church the 
letter said 
the pope said the schism should encourage theologians to make a 
renewed examination of the second vatican council reforms 
especially on those points of doctrine which perhaps because of 
their novelty have not yet been understood well by some sectors in 
the church 
all catholics he said should reflect sincerely on their own 
faithfulness to the tradition of the church 
lefebvre 82 was suspended from his priestly duties in 1976 by 
pope paul vi but in defiance of the vatican he has ordained 220 
priests who are officiating in 28 countries lefebvres movement 
also has an estimated 200 seminarians 
those excommunicated with lefebvre and castro mayer were the 
four new bishops bernard fellay bernard tissier de mallerais 
richard williamson and alfonso de galaretta 
an excommunicated roman catholic is unable to receive the church 
sacraments which include the eucharist and last rites 
the schism provoked by lefebvre was the first since 1870 when 
the old catholics broke with the vatican over the doctrine of papal 
infallibility

a jury that convicted gary heidnik of 
killing two women in his basement torture chamber including one 
who died by electrocution ordered saturday that he die in the 
electric chair 
now my sister can rest in peace i feel happy said denise 
dudley sister of electrocution victim deborah johnson dudley we 
got what we wanted hes going to die 
jurors deliberated nearly two hours before choosing death 
sentences instead of life imprisonment for the two firstdegree 
murder counts on which they convicted heidnik on friday 
the panel chosen in pittsburgh because of pretrial publicity 
here also had convicted him of kidnapping and rape in the 
imprisonment of four other women in his philadelphia row house 
common pleas judge lynne abraham thanked the jurors dismissed 
them and formally imposed one of the death sentences that will 
allow the the 44yearold defendant to be removed from the citys 
overcrowded prison system and placed in a state prison 
i dont feel very good heidniks lawyer a charles peruto 
jr said after the two death verdicts 
peruto who had presented an insanity defense said heidnik 
really didnt express anything over the verdict or over the 
penalty heidnik showed no emotion as the jury forewoman read the 
sentence 
heidnik who has been under treatment for schizophrenia for 25 
years has been receiving a drug that tends to keep him sedated 
peruto said heidnik was insane and was mentally ill when he 
committed the crimes between november 1986 and march 1987 
this man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and he 
did it with torture assistant district attorney charles 
gallagher said in arguing for the death penalty he said later he 
was gratified with the jurys decision 
besides the two murder charges heidnik also was found guilty 
friday of kidnapping rape aggravated assault and involuntary 
deviate sexual intercourse he was acquitted on one count of the 
latter charge 
the judge set oct 5 for sentencing on those charges formal 
sentencing on the second murder conviction and a posttrial 
hearing the judge told peruto to file motions for a new trial 
even though the attorney had indicated earlier that his client 
wasnt interested in an appeal 
im going to file an appeal peruto said saturday i dont 
know if he wants an appeal or not the only discussion weve had on 
this is that he wants to get it over with 
even without an appeal the death sentences will automatically 
be reviewed by the pennsylvania supreme court 
no one has been executed in pennsylvania since 1962 but there 
are more than 80 people on death row in the state a technical 
challenge to the states execution law is currently before the 
states high court 
during the trial the jury heard testimony about how heidnik 
lured six women imprisoned them in his basement repeatedly raped 
and tortured them and eventually killed two of them 
one woman sandra lindsay died while being chained to a rafter 
and heidnik sawed up her body and fed part of the remains to the 
other captives according to testimony ms dudley was electrocuted 
when heidnik touched live wires to her chains while she stood in a 
waterfilled pit according to testimony 
i was hoping for death its what he deserves said teresa 
lomax sister of ms lindsay hes going to die and he should 
die

a military spokesman on saturday denied 
reports syria was planning to buy advanced surfacetosurface 
missiles from china 
news reports last month quoted israeli officials as saying the 
government of president hafez assad was discussing with china the 
possibilty of purchasing the missile that is still in the 
experimental stage 
the real fact which is very well known to the israelis is that 
there is no such deal between syria and china and there is no 
discussion about it said the syrian military spokesman speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
he said syria has the missiles needed for its defense and 
accused israel of spreading the rumor as a ploy to get more 
american aid 
the news reports said syria was intending to buy the m9 
missile which has an estimated range of 375 miles china may have 
tested the missile for the first time in june according to the 
reports 
israeli officials said the missile could be a serious threat to 
israel and could be armed with chemical weapons but they said they 
had no information of an imminent sale

the episcopal churchs 69th general convention 
opened saturday with a church official saying that while marriage 
among homosexuals and the aids epidemic are on the agenda they 
shouldnt dominate the meeting 
presiding bishop edmond l browning asked about 4000 people in 
his opening address to look beyond particular issues to what 
unites us expressing concern that the church could become a 
singleissue church 
i hope that we do not let any one particular issue dominate 
the convention that is not to say that issues are not important 
he said 
the triennial convention will look into the issue of setting a 
policy to recognize singlesex marriages 
we have a ministry to the gay community browning said we 
are struggling to find out what that means we are not going to 
back away from it because there are some voices that question 
whether this is the thing to do 
the way we can be more understanding is to stay in 
communication and avoid a judgmental approach in this ministry 
the rev david b collins deputy president of the conventions 
house of deputies said the church should recognize all 
relationships regardless of sexual preference 
we have been supportive of singlesex marriage and we have 
to get back to that collins said were being unfaithful to 
marriage 
gay rights became an open issue in the church in 1976 when the 
general convention affirmed gays as children of god decried 
violence and prejudice against them and asked a special church 
commission to study whether they should be ordained to the 
priesthood 
in 1979 despite a positive recommendation of the special 
commission the convention narrowly defeated a proposal to open the 
priesthood to gays twentyone bishops including browning 
immediately declared their opposition to the ban 
despite the ban gays continued to be ordained since bishops had 
a wide latitude in interpretation within their dioceses 
also on the conventions agenda are womens roles in the church 
and compassion toward aids victims 
earlier saturday in his address to the opening session of the 
house of deputies collins said the greatest shame of the 
episcopal church is the lack of intensity of faith 
collins cited a survey by the washington postla times news 
service that showed episcopalians are less likely than members of 
other denominations to say religion is very important in their 
lives 
overall 55 percent of americans and 61 percent of 
protestants but only 41 percent of episcopalians said that 
religion was very important collins said 
the episcopal church has 26 million members and 15000 ordained 
clergy in 7500 parishes in the united states church officials

for our party 
clinton who has worked at lengths with dukakis as part of the 
national governors association told a news conference in little 
rock that dukakis is sincere about wanting to spur economic 
development in the south 
dukakis was very forthright in discussing with me how 
profoundly concerned he was that our part of the country was so 
economically depressed and had been so neglected by the national 
administration and he said he just didnt understand how you could 
have a national government that didnt try to help distressed areas 
of the country clinton said 
i think the american people ought to know that clinton 
said he cares about people who arent as well off as he thinks 
they ought to be who dont have the opportunities that they ought 
to have that counts for a lot with me 
tradition at recent conventions is for a brief nominating speech

expect the subject of the no 2 spot on the ticket to come up

highly unlikely that he would be offered the vice presidential 
nomination for his part jackson has said he has decided whether 
he would accept if it was offered to him but has not said what he 
has decided

working through the holiday weekend meeting in their secretive

former navy research chief melvyn paisley 
helped rca corp gain new pentagon business after the companys 
role in another big military project was cut back in what was 
allegedly a quid pro quo arrangement according to a published 
report 
defense news reported in its july 4 edition that paisley who 
has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing investigation of abuses 
in the defense departments weaponsbuying system brought rca 
into the lucrative submarine electronics business through a 
24 billion project then known as the submarine advanced combat 
system of subacs 
several sources told the newspaper that competition for the 
project was cosmetic and that rca had been destined to win but the 
newspaper said it was unclear why paisley who served at the 
pentagon from 1981 through april 1987 helped rca obtain the subacs 
contract in january 1986 
in other developments related to the defense probe 
the los angeles times reported in saturdays editions that 
retired adm james a ace lyons jr denied in an interview that 
he was involved bribery and fraud in the defense contracting 
industry 
lyons who has worked as a consultant to the mcdonnell douglas 
corp since at least last december also accused a very 
vindictive clique of trying to destroy him and former navy 
secretary john f lehman 
im not associated with this other crap lyons said 
referring to allegations that defense consultants have used 
classified information to help companies win military contracts 
lyons is not a target of the ongoing fraud investigation 
although his name appeared on a search warrant served at mcdonnell 
douglas st louis headquarters last month 
the los angeles newspaper also said sources have told the 
newspaper that paisley was the subject of a 1983 fbi probe that 
examined allegations of bribery and electronic eavesdropping 
the newspaper citing an unidentified source familiar with the 
1983 investigation said thenus attorney elsie munsell declined 
to prosecute paisley following the probe in part because the 
statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping which 
allegedly took place in 1970 had expired 
she also declined to prosecute the source said because the 
boeing co on whose behalf paisley had allegedly paid bribes had 
already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least 
7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win 
airline orders 
both ms munsell and henry e hudson who succeeded her in 1986 
and is now managing the pentagon fraud investigation declined 
comment 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella dismissed the report 
as a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been 
examined many times 
in its story defense news said paisleys involvement with rca 
came as the companys role in the aegis shipboard electronics 
program was significantly reduced when the navy awarded sperry 
corp a secondsource contract on the project sperry is now part 
of the detroitbased unisys corp 
rca executives paid a call on paisley and said why are you 
messing aegis up the newspaper quoted one source as saying 
paisleys answer was just shut up and accept it and ill take 
care of you in other ways 
at the time ibm corps federal systems division in manassas 
va was designing the subacs signal processing and targeting 
system for the navys newest attack submarines 
as the company encountered some technical problems and cost 
overruns with the project members of congress began questioning 
the program and navy officials including paisley expressed

jesse jackson said saturday he will go to the 
floor of the democratic national convention to push for including a 
dozen of his policy proposals in the partys platform 
we are determined at this point to take all 12 of our 
minority planks to the floor in atlanta in order to inform 
inspire and open up the process to make our convention one of 
substance jackson said at a news conference on the lawn of his 
home 
the conventions platform committee last week overwhelmingly 
rejected the planks proposed by jackson including a call for 
boosting taxes on the wealthy freezing defense spending pledging 
no first use of nuclear weapons and doubling the money spent on 
education 
we will take to the convention the kind of program agenda 
that will expand our party and make us stronger jackson said 
asked whether he thought his decision might divide the party 
jackson said that was an unfair accusation we can have unity 
without uniformity 
jackson said he looked forward to discussing the convention and 
party platform at his fourth of july meeting in boston with 
dukakis when the candidates and their wives are to have dinner 
together and attend a concert 
jackson made his remarks after meeting at his home with a group 
of key advisers including his campaign chairman willie brown the 
california assembly speaker platform committee chairwoman eleanor 
holmes norton and walter fauntroy the district of columbias 
nonvoting delegate in congress 
dukakis supporters contended that the jackson proposals would 
cost the party support among moderate voters and provide campaign 
ammunition to vice president george bush 
jackson said the pentagon defense contract procurement scandal 
had encouraged him to go to the convention floor with his defense 
spending freeze proposal 
he said no one feels any more insecure after defense 
secretary frank carlucci announced friday his decision to freeze 
11 billion worth of contracts thought to be tainted 
if we in fact cut our military budget without cutting our 
defense and more effectively use our resources for longterm health 
care affordable housing and education we will be a better and 
stronger nation he said 
jackson said there had been good negotiations so far with 
the dukakis camp which would continue prior to the july 18 start 
of the convention but he said he could not imagine a convention 
where there is simply no floor debate

a car bomb exploded saturday 
outside a stadium as thousands of fans left a rugby match killing 
two people injuring 26 and setting nearby buildings ablaze police 
and witnesses said 
the minister of law and order adriaan vlok blamed the outlawed 
african national congress the main organization trying to 
overthrow the whiteled government 
vlok called the attack barbaric and said police will leave 
no stone unturned to find the murderers and to ensure the safety of 
our people 
the blast occurred on a street alongside johannesburgs ellis 
park stadium minutes after crowds began pouring from the complex 
following the match police spokesman pierre louw said the bomb 
went off at 507 pm 
the rugby players and virtually all the spectators at the game 
between transvaal and orange free state were white the stadium is 
the largest sports facility in the johannesburg area and seats 
75000 
no attendance figure was available however rugby is the most 
popular team sport among whites and saturday afternoon matches 
generally attract at least 25000 fans 
police said the two men killed were white and that several of 
the injured were in serious condition the injured included 23 
whites two blacks and one asian police said 
the explosion occurred one day after the government proposed 
tough new measures to enforce racial segregation critics said the 
laws could mean mass eviction of blacks from areas designated for 
whites only 
metal from the car that exploded was found up to 200 yards away 
from the blast witnesses said several nearby cars and buses were 
extensively damaged police said 
surrounding buildings in the downtown area were set ablaze but 
the fires were extinguished within minutes witnesses said 
sportswriters covering the match said they saw flames leaping 
more than 100 feet into the air after the explosion the south 
african press association reported 
police quickly cordoned off the area as several hundred 
bystanders gathered several whites made racial slurs at blacks and 
one minor scuffle broke out sapa reported 
the blast was the latest in a recent series of bombs aimed at 
civilian targets in johannesburg and pretoria the capital 
there have been more than 90 bombings since the government 
declared a nationwide state of emergency in june 1986 about 25 
have occurred this year 
police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the african 
national congress 
the anc based in lusaka zambia seldom confirms or denies 
involvement in specific attacks however recent statements by anc 
leaders suggest the organization now approves of attacks on 
civilians reversing its longstanding policy of striking mostly at 
military and government targets 
on thursday 13 whites and one black were hurt by a bomb that 
exploded outside a fastfood restaurant in a johannesburg shopping 
center at the poyntons building which houses the air force and 
prison service headquarters 
hospital officials said no one was hurt seriously 
the country is run under a system of apartheid a policy of 
segregatin that preserves power and privilege for south africas 5 
million whites and denies rights and a voice in national affairs to 
its 26 million blacks 
on friday the government proposed amendments to the 35yearold 
group areas act which restricts blacks to certain areas the 
change calls for the hiring of inspectors to check violations of 
the law 
it would make it easier for authorities to confiscate property 
and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated 
for their race group 
the amendment is to be debated next month

newspapers published on saturday what television 
had not shown the day before a fired communist party officials 
stinging criticism of some of the most powerful men in the soviet 
union 
boris n yeltsin the former moscow communist party chief who 
was fired in november denounced politburo member mikhail s 
solomentsev and others who served under the late president leonid 
i brezhnev brezhnev now is blamed for leading the country into a 
period of stagnation and corruption during his rule from 19641982 
but yeltsin also demanded that such hidden subjects as communist 
party finances be made public along with detailed biographies of 
the nations leaders and information about their luxurious summer 
homes and guest houses 
yeltsin made he speech friday at the final day of the fourday 
communist party conference 
television showed segments of his address including his appeal 
for political rehabilitation but ignored his critical comments 
yeltsin was fired as moscow party chief and removed as a 
nonvoting member of the ruling politburo because of his remarks at 
a party central committee meeting last october his comments at 
that meeting have never been published but officials said he 
blamed the bureaucracy for slowing the pace of reform planned by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
in his speech friday as carried by the soviet press yeltsin 
said 
today it turns out that the only one guilty in the stagnation 
was brezhnev but where were they who for 10 15 20 years now as 
well as then were on the politburo each time they voted in favor 
of various programs 
he said those politburo members brought the country to the brink 
of crisis by electing a gravely ill konstantin u chernenko party 
leader in 1984 chernenko died a year later and was succeeded by 
gorbachev 
yeltsin accused solomentsev 74yearold head of the partys 
control commission that is responsible for reviewing allegations of 
misconduct by party members of being soft on officials suspected 
of corruption 
i have to say this liberalism from comrade solomentsev toward 
people who took bribes in the millions raises anxiety 
solomentsev was made a nonvoting member of the politburo in 1971 
and a full member in 1983 
yeltsin said several politburo members who he did not identify 
should be made to answer for their part in creating serious 
problems and then removed from the ruling body 
that remark drew applause from some of the 5000 delegates at 
the conference according to the transcripts published by the 
communist party newspaper pravda and government daily izvestia 
while soviet television did not carry yeltsins critical 
comments it did cover in full yegor k ligachevs attack on 
yeltsin the two are political rivals and yeltsin has urged that 
ligachev the kremlins no 2 man quit 
yeltsin told the conference he knew how much money local party 
organizations contribute to the central committee but he didnt 
know where it all went 
i only see that besides rational expenditures they party 
leaders build luxurious guest houses sanatoriums and dachas of 
such a size that its embarrassing when people visit from other 
foreign parties he said 
he called for open publication of biographies incomes and other 
information about ruling party officials 
yeltsin did not directly criticize gorbachev but he said he did 
not understand the general secretarys proposal to make party 
leaders also the head of the corresponding government council the 
plan apparently would ensure continued party dominance of the 
government 
yeltsin also said that despite gorbachevs efforts to open up 
the party to greater debate and criticism members of the central 
committee still were afraid to express their views if they differed 
from the party leader

hundreds of women demonstrated saturday 
in the punjab capital of lahore against their countrys 
implementation of islamic law last month 
many women fear the new code will negate moslem laws enacted in 
1961 giving women the right to file for divorce or to demand the 
right to register marriages and divorces 
the demonstration by about 400 women was the second in as many 
weeks against the change announced in a decree june 15 by

supreme law of pakistan but he said the laws would not affect 
the nations nonmoslems 
witnesses at saturdays protest said many of the women were 
waving the flag of pakistans leading opposition party the 
pakistan peoples party ppp the party is headed by benazir 
bhutto whose father zulfikar ali bhutto was deposed in a 1977 
military coup led by zia 
in the southern port city of karachi meanwhile political 
opposition parties plotted election strategy in anticipation of an 
election call by zia zia who is also army chief of staff 
dissolved parliament may 29 and fired the countrys civilian 
government 
zia charged the government with among other things failing to 
move quickly on imposing islamic law in pakistan 
zia promised to hold elections within the framework of the 
constitution but pakistanis have debated whether the constitution 
demands an election within 90 days or simply requires zia to 
announce a date within 90 days

to free four south africans held in a maximum security prison and 
accused of terrorist attacks security sources said saturday

unspecified number of commandos had planned to intercept a police 
convoy carrying the four detainees from a harare magistrates court 
to the chikurubi maximum security prison 12 miles outside of harare 
on thursday 
they gave no reason why the purported plan failed but said 
weapons and tear gas grenades were found near the route to the 
prison 
the four arrested whites are accused of involvement in five 
attacks on african national congress facilities in zimbabwe the 
predominantly black anc is the main guerrilla organization fighting 
south africas whitedominated government 
the four suspects appeared briefly thursday before harare 
magistrate leonard chitunhu and were remanded in custody to july 
29 they are identified as kevin woods 35 a former zimbabwe 
central intelligence officer michael smith 34 barry bawden 30

the current wave of school reforms is bound 
to fail and teachers will face an angry backlash unless they try 
radically different ways of educating children american federation 
of teachers president albert shanker said saturday 
shanker in an interview and later in a keynote address to 3000 
delegates at the aft convention said you cant stay out of the 
issue of transforming the schools 
we are only educating to a fairly modest level of education a 
shockingly small proportion of the youngsters who go to school 
he said in his 95minute speech 
public schools could face the same slow death on the 
installment plan that beset the american auto industry he said 
it isnt that were not trying hard or that were not good 
enough said shanker the problem is in the way youve 
organized this whole thing just as it wasnt the auto worker who 
was laying down on the job it was a stupid assembly line and a 
rotten design of an automobile 
he called reform a lifeanddeath issue for american public 
education for our profession and for our unionand suggested 
that local unions and school boards try things like experimental 
schools within schools 
nobody else is going to do it he said and if we dont do 
it a lot of the hardwon gains of collective bargaining are going 
to be lost were going to be dismantled by breaking up the 
districts 
the reform movement has raised very high expectations and 
as those expectations are not realized which i do not believe 
they will be there will be anger and backlash 
the threats are there said shanker pointing to new 
jerseys recent move to take over the educationally bankrupt jersey 
city schools as well as efforts to create a separate district in 
milwaukees inner city and continuing calls for vouchers that 
parents could use in public or private schools 
he said the dilemma was acute for the aft most of whose 670000 
members teach in big cities where public schools face the greatest 
difficulties 
whos going to be in bankruptcy its going to be the urban 
areas its not going to be most of the nice nea suburban 
districts said shanker 
the jersey city teachers actually belong to the rival national 
education association but shanker said mostly it will be an aft 
problem 
shanker said the national assessment of educational progress has 
shown 80 percent or more of the 17yearolds still in school cannot 
handle algebra or even write a simple persuasive letter 
aft delegates will get a chance over the holiday weekend to 
debate a resolution endorsing shankers call for widespread 
radical experimentation with new ways of running schools 
shanker said his aim is to get within the next two years more 
than a thousand locations trying these new methods 
shanker said both teachers and students should work in teams 
with computers and technology allowing teachers to get away from 
lecture and talk 
the reform resolution backed by the afts 36member executive 
council says that despite some gains much that has happened as 
a result of education reform is bad 
we are witnessing major efforts to deskill and and 
deprofessionalize teachers it said more and more teachers are 
being told what to do when to do it and how oldfashioned 
teacherproofing in the name of reform 
it adds teacher evaluation systems of the worst sorts have 
proliferated snoopervision checklists that reduce teaching 
to a simple and dubious formula 
the resolution would endorse shankers 
letathousandflowersbloom approach to reform encouraging 
bottomup efforts by teachers in groups of six or more to form 
schools within schools 
they would get a prorated share of public school budgets and 
freedom to try their experiment for at least five years with 
participation voluntary for both teachers and parents 
shanker also said he will seek to expand his unions political 
muscle by recruiting parents and others to sign up as associate aft 
members 
for 25 a year these socalled friends of education would 
attend conferences and receive its publications and other services 
but would not be able to vote on union affairs 
shanker predicted it would push aft membership past 1 million 
politically its very important politicians dont ask you 
which category of members you have or where they work he said 
the biennial aft convention runs until tuesday when delegates 
will hear addresses by satellite television from both michael 
dukakis the certain democratic presidential nominee and his only 
rival jesse jackson 
dukakis will also speak tuesday via satellite from boston to the 
national education association convention which opens monday in 
new orleans 
the neas board of directors gave a delayed primary endorsement 
to dukakis friday but the aft is sticking with the aflcios plan 
of making no endorsement until both parties hold their conventions 
but a dozen top aft leaders including shanker are dukakis 
delegates

americans took to the open road on their way to the beaches 
parks campgrounds concerts race tracks rodeos and parades 
saturday for the fourth of july weekend but the fire hazard 
created by the drought took fireworks off the program for many of 
them 
the weekend of partying under the summer sun opened with a 
shiver for some people around the great lakes and in the east 
temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s overnight and two dozen 
cities hit record lows including 34 degrees at elkins wva 
outdoor concerts were a big part of the weekend festivities 
in maine about 70000 tickets were sold for concerts saturday 
and sunday by the grateful dead at the oxford plains speedway the 
bands followers known as deadheads started arriving friday to 
camp out 
this is the real american dream that sometimes gets lost 
said stephen whitaker of vermont who characterized a grateful dead 
concert as a unity of people the specialness of why people have 
been doing this for 20 years is the sense of caring 
thousands more in maine were expected to converge on old orchard 
beach on sunday to hear bob dylan 
vice president george bush was also in maine at his vacation 
home in kennebunkport but aides said he planned no public 
appearances and was scheduled to leave monday 
if rock wasnt your style an annual festival of american fiddle 
tunes was scheduled at washingtons fort worden state park 
for those who preferred something more rousing the new mexico 
symphony orchestra offered an outdoor pops concert saturday evening 
featuring tchaikovskys 1812 overture accompanied by cannons 
representing napoleons siege of moscow 
and theres always the fourth of july outdoor concert by the 
boston pops with police expecting 200000 people this year along 
the charles river 
the charlie daniels band joined in at freedom weekend aloft a 
fourday hotair balloon festival at greenville sc that event 
opened friday with 125 balloons taking off before an audience of 
about 50000 people going in the opposite direction at the opening 
ceremony were members of the armys parachute team the golden 
knights 
entertainers ranging from glen campbell to chinese acrobats were 
on the program in st louis where organizers expected more than 3 
million visitors for the annual vp fair billed as americas 
largest birthday party the threeday event kicked off saturday 
with a parade that drew 250000 spectators 
big crowds were expected over the weekend at gettysburg pa 
for the final two days of festivities marking the 125th anniversary 
of the civil war battle fought july 13 1863 but only about 
15000 tourists spent at least part of the day at the battlefield 
friday park officials said 
during a ceremony saturday pennsylvania gov robert p casey 
virginia gov gerald baliles and us sen alfonse damato of new 
york exchanged original flags from the period the flags will be 
displayed at the gettysburg battlefields museum 
we remember the remarkable bravery of our soldiers the 
sacrifices of our families and the consequences for succeeding 
generations of americans baliles said but let us only 
remember the past not become prisoners to it 
the weather was playing a large part in the weekend diversions 
in florida rain and damp weather caused swarms of mosquitoes to 
breed and southwest winds unusual for this time of year blew them 
from the everglades into populated areas by the millions 
in many many parts of dade county were experiencing landing 
counts on human beings of 50 mosquitoes per minute said pat 
oconner dade countys assistant director of public works 
but elsewhere the problem was the widespread drought and its 
heightened fire danger counties and communities in iowa nebraska 
north dakota wisconsin kentucky california and elsewhere banned 
or restricted fireworks out of fear of setting grass and forest 
fires 
the potential is there for a disaster this year said les 
parr a riverside county calif fire prevention officer the 
brush is dry and wellcured and the danger and potential for fires 
is a lot greater 
some droughtstricken farmers got a little relief saturday when 
trucks carrying some 2000 bales of virginia hay arrived at 
coldwater ohio the virginia farmers were returning a favor 
granted by their ohio counterparts during a drought two years ago 
concern with fireworks safety wasnt limited to drought areas 
fireworks were blamed for an apartment fire in the seattle suburb 
of burien that left eight families homeless friday that was the 
sixth fire in the puget sound area blamed on fireworks in the past 
two weeks 
on the competitive side of the weekend the 8th annual run of 
the worlds greatest lizard race is set for monday at lovington 
nm a separate race is scheduled for slower horned toads the town

some folks in this northwest atlanta suburb 
arent taking too kindly to being called redneck by national 
geographic 
in a story about atlanta in the magazines july issue erla 
zwingle writes of the citys relative youth no matter where i 
went from redneck smyrna in the northwest to downtowns black 
atlanta university to the oldmoney bastions of ansley park 
atlantans described their town indulgently as adolescent 
former smyrna mayor harold smith president of the smyrna 
historical society is spearheading an effort to get the magazine 
to apologize 
if the lady had said some people refer to smyrna as a redneck 
area that would be one thing smith said saturday but to 
categorize our whole town as redneck just burned me up 
smith has drafted a resolution of complaint pointing out that 
smyrna is a booming business center with corporate headquarters 
major shopping centers and industrial parks and says that 
redneck is as derogatory as racial slurs you 
certainly would not print 
the optimist club of smyrna passed the resolution friday and 
smith plans to present it to the city council at its next meeting 
tuesday 
smith a subscriber to national geographic for more than a 
decade said he was especially disappointed in the source 
you might expect it from the national enquirer but you do 
not expect it from national geographic to let a writer 
characterize a town like that he said 
calls to the maryland home of national geographic society 
spokeswoman mary jeanne jacobsen went unanswered saturday afternoon 
ms zwingle who lives in new york told the marietta daily 
journal on friday that she didnt mean to offend anyone saying she 
had heard many people in smyrna call the town redneck 
i am sorry to think that someone is upset by something i 
wrote she said adding that she was attempting to show the 
variety in atlanta 
the writer added that to her redneck conveys obviously 
something rural the country versus the city and an educational 
level a rather limited view of the world 
i am sure there are some people in very nice homes in nice 
sections of atlanta who share these attributes she said

a us warship fired a warning shot near 
one of three iranian gunboats that attacked a danishflagged 
supertanker in the southern persian gulf on saturday a pentagon 
spokesman said 
it was the first time a us warship has gone to the aid of a 
nonus flagged tanker since secretary of defense frank carlucci 
announced in april that such assistance would be provided when 
requested lt col arnold williams said in washington 
the challenge came hours after iraqi warplanes attacked two 
iranian tankers shattering a nearly threeweek lull in the gulfs 
tanker war 
williams said the uss elmer montgomery patrolling the area 
responded to a distress assistance request from the tanker at 710 
pm 1210 pm edt the tanker was identified by gulf shipping 
sources as the 337733ton karama maersk which they said was 
carrying saudi arabian crude oil 
the tanker reported being under attack from three small 
iranian gunboats williams said by the time the montgomery got 
into range twoof the gunboats had left one was still in the 
vicinity the montgomery fired a warning shot and the boat 
departed 
williams said there were no injuries damage or casualties to 
the tanker or american warship he said the incident occurred about 
13 miles south of abu musa island 
the shipping sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the island 30 miles north of the coast of the united arab emirates 
in the southwest gulf is fortified by iranian gunboats 
the tanker continued on its course south toward the strait of 
hormuz and the elmer montgomery resumed its normal patrol 
according to williams 
shipping sources said the tanker would have cleared the strait 
by midnight 5 pm edt 
radio reports during the incident were monitored by gulf 
shipping companies at one point the us frigate radioed small 
craft in the area you are standing in danger please clear the 
area that apparently was addressed to the gunboats but it was 
not clear 
later the elmer mongomery radioed the karama maersk and asked 
for an assessment of the situation the tankers reply was we 
have no casualties we have not discovered any damage 
then the frigate advised the tanker i will remain with you 
until further directed and received the response roger us 
warship we appreciate your assistance 
us military sources in the gulf who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that in following the navys rules of engagement 
the elmer montgomery confirmed with the captain of the karama 
maersk that his ship was not carrying warrelated materials 
in july last year us warships began escorting 11 kuwaiti oil 
tankers that were reflagged with the american flag 
in the northern gulf salvage tugboats battled flames saturday 
aboard the two iranian supertankers they were hit as they sailed 
south from the kharg island loading terminal according to shipping 
executives 
no casualties were reported 
the tankers were still burning 12 hours after the attacks late 
friday and early saturday said the shipping sources the two 
tankers had been attacked at least seven times in the last 18 
months 
elsewhere in the iraniraq war the official iraqi news agency 
said saturday that its forces had recaptured seven mountain heights 
along the northern border 
the gulf had been quiet since midjune with action in the 
nearly 8yearold war concentrated on battlefields along the 
730mile frontier where iraqs forces have scored a series of 
major victories in the last three months 
baghdad had not claimed a tanker raid since june 10 and irans

a new law restored colorado drivers licenses to 
530 convicted drunken drivers in time for the fourth of july 
weekend 
the law which went into effect friday says that firstoffense 
drunken drivers whose licenses had been revoked for at least four 
months could apply to get their driving privileges back immediately 
for those convicted of drunken driving in the future the 
license revocation period for a first offense will be three months 
the revocation period had been one year 
the chance for an early return to the road before their year 
was up drew hundreds of people to the denver motor vehicle 
division office even before it opened friday 
we processed 214 in less than two hours said richard 
georgeson state driver control section chief the line was 
outside and around the block 
it makes me sick said state rep scott mcinnis a former 
policeman who opposed the amendment making the shorter revocation 
period retroactive putting 500 convicted drunken drivers behind 
the wheel sooner than they should its definitely a step 
backward 
the new law aims to toughen drunkendriving enforcement by 
reducing the legal bloodalcohol threshold defining drunkenness 
from 015 to 010 percent amendments attached to the bill 
shortened the license revocation period and provided for the 
shorter period to apply retroactively 
the bills original sponsor sen jim lee said he didnt like 
the idea of reducing the revocation period for first offenders 
retroactively however he said studies show that very few first 
offenders go on to become multiple offenders

leonard matlovich a vietnam war hero whose 
1975 discharge from the air force for his avowed homosexuality 
became a rallying point for gay rights activists was buried here 
saturday with full military honors 
matlovich 44 died june 22 in los angeles from complications 
associated with aids a fatal virusborne disease whose chief 
victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers 
he was buried in congressional cemetery just 20 blocks from the 
us capitol in a ceremony that mixed the military pomp of a 
horsedrawn caisson and a traditional threevolley salute by seven 
riflemen with eulogies from gay rights activists 
the air force finally did it right and on leonards terms 
today said frank kameny a washington gay rights activist who 
was instrumental in counseling matlovich on testing the militarys 
ban on homosexuality 
its a pity that they didnt do it 13 years ago kameny said 
as an air force color guard departed the cemetery 
matlovich who was awarded a purple heart after stepping on a 
viet cong land mind and the bronze star for killing two viet cong 
soldiers attacking his post first challenged the air forces rules 
on homosexuality in 1975 
at the time he was a technical sergeant working as a drug and 
alcohol abuse counselor at langley air force base outside 
washington with nearly 12 years of service 
after some years of uncertainty i have arrived at the 
conclusion that my sexual preferences are homosexual as opposed to 
heterosexual matlovich said in a memorandum to his commanding 
officer i have also concluded that my sexual preference will in 
no way interfere with my air force duties 
following a hearing matlovich was given a general discharge 
from the service his challenge of the action in court put his face 
on the cover of time magazine and in 1980 the air force was 
ordered to reinstate him with back pay 
months later matlovich and the air force reached an 
outofcourt settlement in which he was paid a total of 160000 in 
back pay and other compensation and given an honorable discharge 
when leonard lived in the neighborhood he would come over 
here and walk lee jenny the administrator of the cemetery where 
many members of the nations first congresses are buried recalled 
saturday he loved the history he was one of the most patriotic 
men i ever met 
ms jenny helped design the tombstone that matlovich wanted for 
his grave as a memorial to gay and lesbian vietnam veterans it is 
located on a plot less than 20 yards from where former fbi director 
j edgar hoover and hoovers longtime associate and friend clyde 
tolson are buried 
matlovichs tombstone includes in the top corners pink triangles 
that were used by nazis during world war ii to identify homosexuals 
in concentration camps and that have since been adopted as a symbol 
in the gay rights struggle 
under the triangles is the inscription 
a gay vietnam veteran 
when i was in the military they gave me a medal for killing 
two men and a discharge for loving one

attacks 
emmanuel mendoza 57 was killed as his car was stopped at an 
intersection about a half a mile from the palace according to 
police 
two men on a motorcycle opened fire on mendoza police cpl 
porfirio olais said the lawyer was taken to a nearby hospital 
where he died an hour later police and hospital authorities said

mendoza was a legal counsel of the leftwing peoples partypnb 
and chairman of the manila solidarity alliance a federation of 
slum residents groups in the capital 
the secretarygeneral of the philippine alliance of human rights 
advocates redempto anda said mendoza may have been killed because 
he represented slum residents whose communities were being raided 
by police in search of communist rebels 
this series of killings has victimized personalities who have 
been associated with the legal left the alliance said in a 
statement 
that this could go on without the government being able to 
solve any single case raises the strong possibilities that certain 
segments of the police and the military could be involved in 
them the statement said 
cura was the lawyer of jailed communist leader rodolfo salas 
while surigao was a chapter president of amnesty international in 
the central philippine island grouping called visayas 
surigao and mendoza were both defeated candidates in last years

a committee including us lawmakers 
from the democratic party urged the reagan administration saturday 
to end sanctions against panama saying the measures are destroying 
that countrys middle class 
patrick j lucey former governor of wisconsin and ambassador to 
mexico during the carter administration called the sanctions an 
unloaded gun pointed at gen manuel antonio noriega noriega is 
the commander of panamas defense forces and controls the civilian 
government 
lucey called on president reagan to appoint a special envoy to 
examine the situation firsthand and to recommend changes in what 
is clearly a policy gone awry 
lucey and four other members of the july 4th emergency 
committee for justice in panama issued a report in san jose 
following a threeday visit to panama that ended friday night 
the report said the sanctions were devastating the private 
business sector and causing suffering among workers who lost their 
jobs because of private business closings 
thus us policy is leading thousands of panamanian workers to 
view private enterprise as less attractive than working for the 
government the report said 
washington imposed economic sanctions on panama earlier this 
year in an attempt to force noriega out of office following his 
indictments by federal grand juries in florida last february that 
accused the general of drug trafficking 
lucey is the founder and one of three cochairmen of the 
committee for justice in panama another cochairman is george 
mcgovern a former democratic senator and presidential candidate 
from south dakota 
lucey is pledged as a delegate to michael dukakis and has worked 
actively in the massachusetts governors presidential campaign for 
the democratic nomination he denied however that his committee 
was tied to either the dukakis campaign or the democratic national 
committee 
he said his group proposed no solutions and its mission was to 
assess the damage caused by the sanctions to the panamanian 
economy to the panamanian social structure to the panamanian 
people and to uspanamanian relations 
the report said the committee strongly supports the objective 
of seeing that gen noriega is brought to justice but 
economic sanctions have left him firmly in power 
it also claimed the sanctions were forcing panamanian importers 
to seek supply channels other than the united states leading to 
closer ties between panama and opportunistic arab countries as 
well as japan 
other committee members include rep robert kastenmeier dwis 
and three democratic state legislators from colorado philip a 
fernandez tony hernandez and robert martinez

jack valenti used to recite shakespeare while 
driving along texas highways with his boss as they visited the 
humble oil co gas stations dotting the road 
valenti now president and chief executive officer of the motion 
picture association of america and humbles garvin allen pop 
mabry would attend the opening ceremonies of new filling stations 
and valenti would gather stories about station operators for 
company publications 
ive seen texas and its fantastic and ive never forgotten 
that said valenti who took the job at humble to put himself 
through night school at the university of houston 
since then valenti has circled the world and met the stars but 
humble now exxon co usa is still the best business hes 
ever known and the texas landscape remains imprinted in his memory 
valenti is another texas success story the son of a county 
courthouse clerk and grandson of italian immigrants he became 
adviser to president lyndon b johnson and the third man to reign 
over the mpaa since its founding in 1922 
the mpaa preserves and protects the rights of copyright owners 
serves as advocate for major producers and distributors of motion 
pictures tv programs and home video before the public the us 
congress various departments of the federal government and state 
and local legislative bodies the mpaa fights censorship and 
restrictive attacks on the first amendment and directs an 
antipiracy program to protect american films in over 50 countries 
it also provides guidance to parents of young children on the 
suitability of movies through a rating system 
valenti does a lot of lobbying on capitol hill and is referred 
to as the leading spokesman for the industry he was named 
president in april 1966 
a plaque on his desk reads it can be done 
valenti has done it with the help he says of serendipity in 
a macabre way 
he has gone from from usher cleanup man and popcorn concession 
operator in a secondrate movie house to the voice of the movie 
industry he went from stumping for local candidates as a child to 
an office in the white house 
in between he flew 51 combat missions as a world war ii bomber 
pilot was awarded the distinguished flying cross six air medals 
and three battle stars and earned a masters degree in business 
administration from harvard university 
hes 66 now trim and fit his hair white and his eyebrows 
bushy his eyes sparkling as he talks of the movie industry and how 
it found him 
youre sitting in the white house and the movie moguls offer 
you a job you never expected to have and then your life takes 
another turn he says 
that was in 1966 three years before life took another sharp 
turn for the houston ad man who had done the democratic partys 
1960 advertising campaign for texas and had come to know johnson 
three years earlier valenti was sitting six or seven cars back 
from president john f kennedys limousine when kennedy was 
assassinated as the motorcade snaked through dallas 
at parkland memorial hospital johnson ordered valenti to 
accompany him to washington aboard air force one johnson was sworn 
in as president on that flight valenti became his chief spokesman 
and has been in washington since 
he was johnsons closest personal friend in the white house and 
valenti once said that he slept better at night knowing johnson was 
president 
although his home is in washington valenti is frequently on the 
road making sure american films move freely and unhobbled around 
the world 
but unlike his humble oil travels to such places as valley mills 
and van horn valenti now calls on rome london and paris rio de 
janeiro singapore new delhi and dakar hes in california three 
times a month new york a little less 
the back yard of the movie business is the world he says 
movies are fascinating the movie business is unlike any 
other enterprise i know with the possible exception of politics 
its tedious sometimes even pedestrian sometimes 
but for the most part its been great fun he said in a 
recent interview theres a continuing roll of problems that 
sort of avalanche on you but all are different and youre 
constantly meeting new and interesting people 
his contract with the association has been renewed several times 
since 1966 and the current one doesnt expire until the end of 
1991 
as long as im having fun here ill stay he said 
as a child valenti tasted politics and power through his 
father he was 10 when he gave his first political speech for a 
sheriff 
very early on i went on the stump everyone thought that was 
cute he said 
he finished high school at 15 and spent the next year working 
seven days a week at the iris theater where tarzan movies and 
cowboy flicks were the main fare after a year he realized he 
wanted an education i really wanted to be a writer i really 
wanted to be a lawyer 
walter beach his boss at humble oil says hes not surprised by 
valentis success 
he was a very bright and energetic and imaginative young man 
really eager and anxious to do right and truly applied himself to 
whatever he was doing said beach who was in charge of 
publications for humble until his retirement in 1970 
i had a feeling he would spread out beach said he had 
both the personality and the education and the ambition to go 
places he had stars in his eyes all along

though a mood of caution and indecision 
prevailed in the stock market for much of the time there were 
still a good many success stories to be told on wall street in the 
first half of 1988 
indeed in the waning days of june 31 issues traded on the new 
york stock exchange had doubled or more from their 1987 closing 
prices 
as any follower of the investment scene might expect the list 
of those winners was dominated by stocks of companies that became 
the targets of takeover or buyout bids 
prominent examples murray ohio manufacturing up 175 percent 
jp stevens 135 percent arkansas best 134 percent york 
international 131 percent varo 130 percent payless cashways 
120 percent federated department stores 119 percent and american 
standard 112 percent 
while the overall averages posted gains for the first half of 
the year there were some notable laggards as the market struggled 
to recover from the beating it took in the crash last fall 
it was a test of patience for the 27 millionplus owners of 
american telephone amp telegraph the nations most widely held 
stock which closed june 30 at 26 down 09 percent from the end 
of 1987 
atampt holders fared much better than did the many fans of 
genentech a highflying leader in the promising field of 
biotechnology 
genentech shares fell some 35 percent to rank among the first 
halfs biggest nyse percentage change losers as investors went 
through a wrenching reappraisal of prospects for a genentech drug 
used to treat heartattack patients 
still harder times befell coleco industries the lossplagued 
toy and game manufacturer whose stock fell more than 40 percent 
coleco shares which traded as high as 65 a share in 1983 when 
the companys cabbage patch kids dolls were becoming a national 
craze reached mid1988 in the neighborhood of 2 
aside from such individual cases the market has had trouble 
establishing any consistent themes so far in 1988 
there was no standout strength for example either in stocks 
that would benefit the most from an increase in inflation or in 
issues that represent a disinflation play 
analysts said that betokened greater than usual confusion among 
investors over the direction in which the economy was headed 
the year began amid widespread recession fears in the wake of 
black monday last oct 19 
as it became clear that economic activity was running stronger 
than almost everybody had forecast the concern shifted to a 
possible revival of inflation 
by midyear that scare seemed to have abated somewhat and sure 
enough talk was stirring again of a business slump in 1989 
in a compilation by standard amp poors corp of the comparative 
performance of industry groups in the stock market through june 29 
many of the winners drew their strength from takeover bids or 
battles that affected one or more of their component stocks for 
example textile products up 65 percent and department stores up 
49 percent 
notable among the worst performers were some healthcare groups 
miscellaneous health care down 30 percent and medical products 
and supplies down 3 percent and hightechnology entries like 
computer software down 11 percent and electronic instruments 
down 4 percent 
for those investors who bet on revived inflation gold mining 
stocks failed to pay off falling nearly 5 percent

college aid officers use a federal formula to 
determine each familys ability to pay and how much aid its 
entitled to but as tuitions rise faster than available aid the 
formula hasnt quelled the growing number of disagreements between 
colleges and families over what each family can really afford 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
each year 65 million families seeking college aid must undergo 
a needs analysis they fill out forms supply tax information 
and generally bare their financial souls to college officials to 
make their case for grants or loans 
but as a jackson wyo mother and her chronically ill 
18yearold son are learning this summer colleges and families may 
often differ sharply on what a family can really afford 
a formula mandated by congress is supposed to produce an 
objective assessment of each familys capacity to pay with the 
college making up the difference with aid either in direct grants 
or lowinterest loans 
financial aid for families above the poverty line is likely to 
be doubleedged mainly loans that help families squeak through the 
college years but can leave a legacy of debt that strains 
middleincome budgets for a decade or more 
many families are stunned by their failure to qualify for 
goodsized grants and by the amount of debt they must take on they 
fail to realize aid is based not on immediate liquidity but on 
the capacity to pay over an extended period of time relative to 
other families said kathleen brouder director of information of 
the college scholarship service a branch of the college board 
which processes financial aid forms 
as tuitions have soared borrowing for college has increased 
fivefold in the last decade since the mid1970s the loan 
proportion of all student aid grew from onefifth to onehalf 
federal statistics show average college debt after four years of 
private college is 8950 at public colleges it is 6685 
the term needs analysis itself may mislead many families 
said brouder because the process doesnt really measure need but 
a familys capacity to pay and carry debt 
thats small comfort to the woman from jackson as she considers 
an aid package from the university of wyoming where her son hopes 
to enroll next fall she must decide this month whether to accept 
the package after that the school has told her it will withdraw 
its offer 
i feel the system has me beat the rules really hurt my class 
of people something has to change said the jackson woman who 
agreed to discuss her finances in detail on condition of anonymity 
im very confused and im very frustrated she said 
a divorced mother of three she earns 19760 as a medical 
typist at st johns hospital well above the federal poverty line 
of 11203 for a family of four 
the familys principal asset is a 1000square foot 
prefabricated home worth about 65000 the family owns three cars 
a 1971 ford 1972 dodge van and a 1974 plymouth and has cash 
savings of 1071 to ease its budget the only meat the family 
eats is moose and elk they hunt themselves 
she gets no child support or alimony from her former husband 
whom she divorced in 1981 after 12 years of marriage 
her son suffers from crohns disease a chronic debilitating 
intestinal inflammation that has meant surgery high medical bills 
and long periods where work or stress become dangerous 
total costs at the university of wyoming next fall including 
tuition fees room and board transportation and other expenses 
will be 5910 close to the national average of 5789 for 
fouryear public institutions 
but even that relatively modest tuition would break her fragile 
budget the mother fears 
has income kept up with tuition by any realistic measure no 
and for most income groups its not even close the american 
association of state colleges and universities said in a recent 
publication 
the university sent the family its first aid offer feb 26 the 
school would provide grants and lowinterest federally subsidized 
loans in the amount of 1910 for the next school year the mother 
would have to contribute 1650 the son 2350 for a total family 
contribution of 4000 an amount equal to more than 20 percent of 
mrs garrisons pretax income 
under the federal formula students getting aid are expected to 
contribute at least 700 toward tuition barring health or other 
problems 
i called the university in april i said i cant be expected 
to come up with this money and neither can my son i asked what it 
would take for them to reconsider would a letter from my sons 
doctor help they said it might she said 
in june the salt lake city specialist who treats her son wrote 
the school that the stress of a previous job at a fastfood 
restaurant may have had an adverse affect on the clinical course 
of his illness in fact if his crohns disease flares up he may 
not be able to work at all 
on june 10 the university improved its offer the mother would 
have to contribute 1457 toward tuition the son would still be 
required to contribute 859 the school would provide 550 in 
grants to make up the balance the school would make available 
2040 in federally guaranteed student loans at 8 percent interest 
and 1000 more in national direct student loans at 5 percent by 
the schools reckoning its second offer of 3590 in aid left an 
unmet need of 4 from the mothers point of view it is far 
higher 
the universitys aid officials for their part say they are 
merely playing by rules set down in washington all college aid 
offices are subject to periodic government audits to ensure they 
are adhering to the federal formula for distributing financial aid 
schools may offer more or less than the formula calls for but they 
must be prepared to justify and document their decisions 
there is congressional methodology in arriving at aid and we 
have no option but to follow it said john nutter interim 
director of the university of wyomings financial aid office 
beyond that he declined to discuss the case 
parents can appeal to a university to reconsider an aid offer 
as this mother did with partial success some parents even get a 
congressman or senator to lobby an aid officer for a better deal 
beyond that a family has little choice but to accept a schools 
aid package or try if possible to find a school more affordable 
despite her dismay over the aid package she expects to accept 
at least part of it perhaps borrowing some from her mother instead 
of the federal government 
its important that somehow my son go to school she said

as millions of americans hit the roads for 
summer vacation burglars and other crooks go into action for one 
of their busiest seasons 
summer is one of the peak times for burglary police statistics 
show thanks to the combination of closed schools and absent 
vacationers 
the insurance industry reports that most burglars turn out to be 
schoolage young people 
that means of course that most burglars are not professionals 
just adolescents taking advantage of unguarded homes during their 
idle time a few simple precautions can discourage most of them 
according to the insurance information institute 
lots of companies are advertising complex and costly alarm 
systems and many of them do a good job they can turn on lights 
set off noisy bells and sirens and even alert a central office or 
the police in the event someone tries to enter your home 
probably not everyone needs or can afford a hightech system 
but there are still things they can do to help protect the home 
to begin with lock doors and windows including the attic 
basement and garage sure this sounds obvious yet police report 
that many burglars get into homes through doors and windows 
carelessly left unlocked 
the insurance institute recommends deadbolt or double cylinder 
locks for doors and notes that a variety of good inexpensive 
window locks are on sale 
in many areas local police will do a free security audit of the 
home and make recommendations 
when away try to make the home look lived in the institute 
says 
for example have someone mow the lawn and ask a neighbor to 
collect the mail and newspapers instead of stopping delivery the 
fewer people who know youre away the better 
do not hide keys outside the home burglars know where to look 
leave a key with a friend or neighbor who can check on the house 
from time to time 
get automatic timers for lights to keep the place looking lived 
in keep ladders out of sight and locked up 
valuable items should be locked in a safe deposit box or other 
secure storage 
and the insurers note many home insurance policies have limits 
on the coverage for items such as jewelry furs silver and other 
valuables if you have such property an additional policy may be 
needed 
if a urglar does break in stereos televisions and such are 
among the most popular items to steal 
permanently mark them in an inconspicuous place with initials 
social security number or some other identifying mark often 
police will lend an electric engraving tool for this purpose with 
this mark if police do recover the stolen items you will be able 
to identify yours and get them back 
when back from vacation look for signs of burglary before 
entering the home surprising a burglar could be a deadly mistake 
and while on the road remember you are not immune from crime 
either be wary of pickpockets and setups such as someone dropping 
a handful of change to distract you while an accomplice steals 
luggage or other property 
never leave luggage unattended travel experts say and always 
be wary of problems in crowded areas especially if bumped or 
jostled 
wrap your wallet in rubber bands that makes it much harder to 
slip out of the pocket suggests the american express company and 
women should carry the purse tucked securely under their arm 
some thieves have adopted the strategy of putting up signs that 
say beware of pickpockets and watching people to see which 
pocket they check on viewing the sign

actors are commonly typecast in certain 
roles but rebeca arthur of abcs perfect strangers seems 
typecast by occupation 
i play an airline stewardess on the show she said i was 
an airline stewardess on newhart when i came to los angeles the 
first thing i did was remington steele i was a flight attendant 
ive played a flight attendant on every show ive been on 
oddly before she became an actress she was a private 
investigator she specialized in finding missing persons and became 
so successful at it she became supervisor of a large office of 
detectives 
arthur plays mary anne no dumb blonde but perhaps too literal 
for her own good she takes everyone and everything at face value 
which makes her appear to be a little dizzy 
mary anne and her roommate jennifer played by melanie wilson 
are two stewardesses who are neighbors of larry mark linnbaker 
and balki bronson pinchot although theyre not paired off balki 
does have a crush on mary anne and larry on jennifer 
in the show balki is a naive sheepherder who has left his 
mediterranean home to live with his cousin in chicago its the 
odd couple with a cultural clash thrown in balki in his own 
way takes things as literally as mary anne 
the producers always want us in uniform and melanie and i are 
always begging not to wear those scratchy things arthur said 
on the last show we did we said we wanted to wear our pretty 
dresses when we walked onto the set for rehearsal there were mark 
and bronson in pretty dresses we near fell down 
the script had said jennifer and mary anne enter and cross 
to the boys they are in their pretty dresses it was ambiguous as 
to who was in the dresses so they did it as a dig at us 
arthurs role on the show began as a guest appearance 
i wasnt supposed to hang around this long she said id 
never been a regular on a show before ive worked on other 
comedies but nothing ever this goofy we have a lot of fun 
at the audition she read for the role of jennifer the two 
characters are very different she said i didnt feel i was 
right for jennifer i wanted to read for rachel which was mary 
annes name in the first script they never did let me read for the 
role im now playing 
the original order for perfect strangers was for six shows 
when i saw the promo for the show i said theres another one 
thatll get canceled arthur said but it did well in the 
ratings and they got a pickup for 13 i was in the first show of 
the 13 then i came back for the fifth show and ive been there 
ever since 
melanie and i did three shows without a contract we thought 
each show would be our last we were just a couple of neurotic 
actresses then they signed us now melanie and i are best friends 
and were still neurotic 
although arthurs been on television only a short time she 
already has an emmy but her emmy is a toy poodle 
i named her emmy in case i never won one she said shes 
a little teacup and when i travel i put her into a bag and take her 
with me shes good about it but after a sixhour flight she wants 
to run around and be silly 
in her travels shes often recognized although most people 
cant put a name to the face 
people will come up to me touch me and say aint you that 
girl she said i dont know it depends on what that girl 
did 
perfect strangers has been out of production since last 
december and with the continuing writers strike its uncertain 
when it will start filming again arthur did have a small role in 
the movie scrooge starring bill murray 
the first day i was on the movie set was the first day of 
the strike she said the script needed some rewrites so we had 
to wing it i was only on the picture for two days but i got to 
dress up like a funky little miss santa claus of 1968 and xerox my 
heinie the joke was i give a copy to the character played by john 
forsythe 
i said i wouldnt do it unless i wore something they offered 
me a gstring but i wore boxer shorts 
arthur grew up in cumberland md and began her career in new 
york but unlike other aspiring actresses she supported herself as 
a private investigator while waiting for her break 
id find missing husbands and wives and runaway high school 
students she said its real hard to disappear i could 
usually find a missing person because they nearly always leave some 
trace i talk a lot so people think im stupid and tell me 
everything the money was good and they kept promoting me until i 
ended up a supervisor with a pink office 
she quit after three years when she began getting better tv 
parts

few indicators of future business activity are 
more closely watched than the amount of money earmarked for capital 
investment and research and development 
but maybe some folks are now saying the attention is a bit 
overdone 
the widespread almost automatic assumption made is that money 
spent on new plants and equipment and in developing new products is 
an investment that returns itself many times over 
economists political leaders academics and others watch these 
items for other reasons as well such spending for example 
supposedly shows the level of confidence in the future and it is 
equated with more efficient production 
now comes an authority on productivity who cautions against 
falling in love with such expenditures not that they are 
unimportant says c jackson grayson jr but he says let us not 
lose our perspective 
grayson probably best remembered as chairman of president 
richard nixons price commission has been studying productivity 
issues for the past decade mainly as chairman of the american 
productivity center in houston 
among other activities he also served on president jimmy 
carters commission on the agenda for the 80s and was a member of 
president reagans national productivity advisory committee 
productivity is his specialty 
from that background he issues what is likely to be considered 
an almost sacrilegious criticism capital investment is not the 
principal cause of productivity growth nor of its slowdown 
with carla odell vice president of the productivity center 
grayson has written american business a twominute warning a 
volume examining the sometimes surprising relationship between 
capital investment and productivity 
such spending hardly correlates with increased productivity for 
example as they point out us productivity growth declined from 
1965 to 1978 while capital investment increased during the same 
period 
in fact they say capital investment may well be the result 
of growth rather than its source better growth prospects attract 
more investment 
the concentration on physical investment on plants and 
equipment also has led to a relative neglect of factors that are 
equally or even more important for productivity and quality 
improvement grayson and odell say 
they observe for example that investments in human capital 
though not as often examined as physical investments are 
especially important in improving quality and production can 
anyone deny that quality education doesnt pay off 
those who place great faith in dollar amounts also might be 
misguided in another respect grayson and odell observe that 
there is a difference between the volume of capital investment 
and the productivity of that investment 
grayson can speak on that subject both as an experienced hand 
and as an academic authority where for example is it more 
evident than in government that throwing money at a situation does 
not necessarily improve it 
in this respect the authors call attention to a concept that 
might not be correct for these times why do we still believe that 
long production runs greater volume big factories and automation 
mean greater productivity 
they observe that the best american and japanese firms have 
shown that it is often more productive to focus on less not more 
small batches small inventories and flexibile simple machines 
they have a special message for politicans and government 
officials 
among the more important things government at all levels could 
do are improve education privatize more government services 
improve the collections and reporting of competitiveness 
statistics improve productivity in government and cut the budget 
deficit 
that not just money is bound to improve productivity they say

if the first half of 1988 is any indication of 
what the rest of the year will be like for bonds and interest 
rates better hang on to your hats now 
anybody who survived the first half of 88 had to have had 
their seatbelt on said irwin kellner chief economist for 
manufacturers hanover trust co the market was extremely 
volatile 
bonds started out the year on a strong note with interest rates 
continuing to decline following last falls stock market crash the 
federal reserve had relaxed its credit policies on the widespread 
belief the crash might affect spending habits and push the economy 
into a recession and declining oil prices also played an important 
role in dampening any inflation concerns 
but as the economy showed surprising resilience interest rates 
started to climb again and bonds lost their luster concern turned 
to the possibility of higher inflation and the interestrate 
outlook overseas along with the dollars instability in foreign 
exchange 
those factors continue to plague the credit markets although 
rates have eased lately on the recent strength of the dollar a 
firm us currency makes dollardenominated bonds and notes more 
attractive to foreigners and lessens the prospects of higher 
inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome securities 
if youre a bond trader and you made money in the first six 
months of the year then you were a superstar said jay 
goldinger who runs the beverly hills calif investment banking 
firm capital insight inc most of us ended up about even 
the interesting thing is that with all the ups and down weve 
had we havent changed all that much noted maury harris chief 
economist for painewebber inc 
bond prices and yields right now are about where they were at 
the start of the year 
for instance the yield on the treasurys 30year bond the most 
widelywatched issue in the credit markets stood at 893 percent 
on jan 4 on the last day of june it was 885 percent down from 
892 percent in the previous session 
and the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer looked at the end of june like it 
had barely budged from early january 
in the intervening months however prices and yields proceeded 
on a veritable rollercoaster ride the 30year bond which peaked 
at 104 percent the day of the market crash last october tumbled 
to a low of 829 percent on feb 5 and jumped to a high of 935 
percent on may 23 
commercial lending rates followed suit major banks lowered 
their prime lending rates used to set rates on most corporate and 
consumer loans a quarter of a percentage point to 85 percent on 
feb 2 then raised them to 9 percent on may 11 
mortgage rates followed a similar pattern for a conventional 
30year fixedrate mortgage rates ranged from a low of 984 
percent in midfebruary to a high of 1058 percent in late may and 
early june according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the confusion in the marketplace scared away some municipal and 
corporate issuers 
for the first six months the volume of municipal issues totaled 
5276 billion compared with 5813 billion a year ago the volume 
of corporate issues fell to 1414 billion from 157 billion in 
1987 
right now sentiment is cautiously bullish based largely on 
the dollars recent strength said kellner of manufacturers hanover 
but he said bond investors are keeping an eye on the midwestern 
drought and what effects that might have on food prices and 
inflation although most economists say the droughts impact 
probably wont be felt until the beginning of next year 
some economists predict a drop in interest rates for the 
remainder of 1988 based in part on the declining oil market the 
firmer dollar and the feeling that the economy eventually will run 
out of steam 
but as painewebbers harris concedes what happened in the first 
half of 1988 goes to show how difficult it is to predict

americas biggest insidertrading case since the 
boesky scandal with money trails stretching from wall street to 
secretive swiss banks to teeming hong kong shows how globalized 
markets can spawn bold schemers who arent necessarily deterred by 
tough us securities laws experts say 
the securities and exchange commission which polices the 
nations stock and bond markets has obtained increased cooperation 
from overseas governments in conducting investigations of 
foreignbased fraud over the past few years 
but many governments remain reluctant to comply with sec 
requests for help and a few express hostility and resentment 
providing a convenient shield for foreign insider traders in us 
securities 
in some countries the use of nonpublic information to profit 
in the financial markets is perfectly acceptable 
the world is not in any kind of agreement that insider trading 
is a heinous crime said john s stoppelman a securities law 
attorney in washington and former chairman of the sec task force on 
investigation rules some of these countries think were crazy to 
enforce these laws 
obtaining cooperation from foreign governments is an important 
part of the secs case against hong kongbased businessman fred c 
lee and morgan stanley amp co junior analyst stephen wang jr 
accused coconspirators in a scheme to profit on inside information 
about impending corporate takeovers 
a complaint filed last monday in us district court demanded 
the pair return 19 million in alleged illicit profits plus triple 
penalties for a total of 76 million that amount is second only to 
the record 100 million in profits and penalties the sec seized 
from insider trader ivan f boesky in november 1986 
although sec investigators gathered much of the evidence against 
wang and lee in the united states the key break came when they 
questioned lee in hong kong for which they needed cooperation from 
the british colonys government 
the fact they were taking testimony in hong kong suggests the 
commission is much further along than a couple of years ago in 
getting active and passive assistance of other law enforcement 
authorities said anne flannery a new yorkbased securities 
lawyer who used to work for the sec 
agencies like the sec which are quasicriminal in nature 
dont conduct inquiries without foreign help she said 
besides the hong kong connection the sec also has disclosed a 
swiss link in the wanglee probe commission chairman david s 
ruder testifying at a senate banking committee hearing this past 
week said the commission was negotiating with switzerlands 
government for information about swiss bank accounts controlled by 
lee and a possible freeze of assets in those accounts 
in addition sec enforcement chief gary lynch disclosed at the 
same hearing that the commission is pursuing about 50 
investigations involving foreign trading with sums ranging from 
40000 to some very large amounts 
sec officials attribute the growth of these investigations 
largely to the increasing relationships between markets which now 
make it possible to easily trade us stocks in cities ranging from 
paris to singapore a foreignbased investor with inside 
information about an american company can make profitable trades 
halfway around the world 
as a result lynch said in a telephone interview theres more 
of an acceptance of the notion that a person who affects 
transactions in the securities market of a particular country 
should comply with the laws of that country regardless of where 
they happen to live 
for example the swiss have become increasingly cooperative 
securities experts say switzerland which once routinely dismissed 
queries about ownership of financial assets now has an independent 
commission that oversees sec requests for help 
moreover a new law took effect friday in switzerland that makes 
insider trading a criminal offense the measure will make it easier 
for the swiss to assist the sec 
other countries historically have rejected the secs requests 
for information and continue to do so partly out of sovereignty 
principles france and liechtenstein for example are considered 
notoriously uncooperative 
sen donald w reigle jr dmich has sponsored a bill aimed 
at making it easier for the sec to investigate foreignbased 
insider trading the bill would allow the commission to investigate 
on behalf of foreign governments which would be expected to 
reciprocate 
nevertheless such legislation would not compel other countries 
to adopt usstyle prohibitions against insider trading which 
remains a fundamental problem as international securities markets 
grow in complexity and scope 
i dont think theyre going to buy all our concepts of 
securities fraud stoppelman said just because it seems 
morally unacceptable that doesnt mean the whole world agrees with 
us

rising demand from the far east has helped push sugar futures 
prices to 6year highs and analysts say the midwestern drought 
has sparked an increase in bullish speculation that could drive 
prices higher still 
on the other hand any hint that the rally is running of steam 
could send the market plunging as nervous traders on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange scurry to take profits or cut 
their losses experts say 
sugar prices have risen steadily since bottoming out at about 
275 cents a pound in mid1985 when world stockpiles stood at 
record highs growing demand and declining production have 
gradually reduced the surplus until it now stands just above the 
critically low level of 30 percent of the anticipated 198889 
demand according to judith weissman ganes an analyst with the 
investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
in contrast to the slow steady gains during much of the past 3 
years sugar prices for nearmonth delivery have skyrocketed in the 
last two months from about 8 cents a pound at the end of april to 
more than 13 cents a pound at the end of june 
moves by china during the past year to increase the availability 
of sugar in that country has had a profound impact on the market 
said erik dunlaevy a trader with new yorkbased commodities and 
brokerage firm balfour maclaine corp 
basically the government of china decided to let the chinese 
fulfill their desires for sugar he said they decentralized 
the purchasing to a certain extent so you have different entities 
buying sugar instead of one central purchasing agency 
he said china ordinarily buys its sugar from thailand 
australia the philippines and other exporters in the eastern 
hemisphere but the increased demand from the chinese has forced 
those producers to raise their prices prompting china and other 
far eastern consumer nations to shop for lowerpriced sugar in the 
west 
caribbean nations supply much of the western hemispheres sugar 
and caribbean sugar is traditionally the type that gets delivered 
on the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange dunlaevy said thus chinas 
increased demand is largely responsible for the sharp rise in sugar 
futures prices 
exacerbating the situation is the drought which threatens to 
substantially reduce yields of sugar beets in the red river valley 
region of minnesota and north dakota analysts said 
thats the largest beet crop in this country so the beet crop 
here could be down 500000 to 700000 tons said thomas oxnard 
vice president of commodities trading for painewebber inc in 
clifton nj 
on a worldwide basis thats not a huge number but its a 
further drawdown in stocks he said 
the drought has also increased bullish speculation in sugar 
futures just as it has in virtually every other market for us 
agricultural products 
i know there are traders who have one eye on soybeans and one 
eye on sugar and when beans go up they buy sugar oxnard said 
to some degree all these markets have just piggybacked on top of 
each other 
one measure of market speculation is open interest the 
number of buy or sell orders that have not been canceled out by an 
offsetting order since late april open interest in sugar futures 
has expanded from less than 130000 to nearly 170000 
a large part of the open interest is speculative in nature 
representing a lot of fund and commissionhouse speculators ms 
ganes said 
although many analysts including ms ganes expect sugar prices 
to climb higher in the near term they acknowledged that prices 
could also fall very rapidly 
if the market does show signs of weakening speculators will 
be fairly quick at taking a profit and that could result in a sharp 
turn in the market ms ganes said the people who got in at 
the higher levels are going to be quicker to get out and that 
could exaggerate the correction

wall streets inflationwatchers are counting on 
cheaper oil to take the sting out of rising food prices in the 
months ahead 
world oil prices have fallen sharply of late amid signs that 
oilexporting countries are producing faster than market demand can 
absorb 
west texas intermediate crude oil widely used as an overall 
gauge of the trend in oil prices dropped below 15 a barrel friday 
to its lowest level since 1986 
that news together with some rainfall at last in the parched 
farm belt has encouraged talk in the financial markets that 
inflation might not be as bad as had been feared in the second half 
of 1988 
one of the most reliable barometers of inflationary 
expectations the yield on 30year treasury bonds has fallen from 
a peak of nearly 95 percent several weeks ago to less than 9 
percent in recent days 
the drought watch continues on wall street of course even as 
it does in the areas of the country that suffer most directly from 
the lack of moisture 
while the current weather charts showed rain in the midwest this 
past week traders in the futures and financial markets switched 
their attention to forecasts suggesting more unusually dry 
conditions in the next few weeks 
for the national economy however many analysts say it is 
necessary to keep the role of agricultural commodities in 
perspective 
although the drought could be the worst in nearly a century 
it should be kept in mind that the importance of raw food 
commodities has changed dramatically over the years and the impact 
of sharp price rises in this area is not particularly great on 
consumer spending or the inflation indices said michael sherman 
analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
david a levy and s jay levy a chappaqua ny economic 
forecasting team say they have no desire the minimize the distress 
the drought is causing for farmers and other businesses in 
agricultural areas 
however they add the drought will indeed increase the prices 
of many foods but have limited impact on inflation food and 
beverages account for less than 18 percent of the consumer price 
index 
furthermore they add rising food prices actually can serve to 
depress prices of many nonfood items 
as food prices accelerate this year nonfood stores 
especially those competing for consumers discretionary income 
will lose some sales pricecutting will be more frequent 
this deflationary effect will substantially reduce the overall 
impact of the drought on the cpi to about half a percent 
despite such assurances the stock markets earlysummer rally 
bogged down in the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials slipped 1138 to 213158 ending a fiveweek winning 
streak 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 88 to 
15368 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 308 to 39470 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 51 at 30900 
volume on the big board averaged 20842 million shares a day 
against 17099 million the week before 
like the drought the decline in the price of oil is cause for 
serious concern in some already beleaguered areas of the country 
but unlike the dry weather cheaper oil can be seen as a 
distinct plus for such broad economic forces as nationwide consumer 
spending 
this recent drop in oil prices reminds us of the drop back in 
early 1986 when the dow jones industrials were rallying and had 
moved above 1700 said jay donnaruma an analyst at first albany 
corp in albany ny 
at that time no one liked the rally and everyone was looking 
for a correction we get the same feeling now 
can the rally in stocks bonds and the dollar all be related 
to the drop in crude oil prices probably not entirely but for 
our money watching the price of oil is better than watching the 
stars

the economy expanded at a healthy pace in june 
as production and new orders at the nations manufacturers surged 
according to a survey of purchasing executives released monday 
the national association of purchasing management which 
conducts a monthly survey of economic trends at more than 250 
industrial companies said its index of economic growth soared to 
593 percent in june from 551 percent in may 
a reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding 
while levels below that point generally indicate the economy is 
contracting 
the june increase was fueled by an improvement in new orders and

survey said their companies had more new orders in june compared 
to 30 percent in may fiftyfour percent unchanged from the may 
results said new orders were the same twelve 12 percent down 
from 16 percent the previous month said the number of new orders 
fell

up 53 percent saying it was the same and 12 percent saying it was 
down in may 27 percent said production had improved 62 percent

another indication of an improvement in the economy came in a 
slowdown in vendor deliveries which signals that the demand for 
materials is outstripping the ability of manufacturers to fill 
orders 
in june 32 percent of the managers said deliveries were slower 
up sharply from mays 19 percent five percent unchanged from may 
said deliveries were faster and 63 percent down from 76 percent

increase in inventories while 60 percent said inventories were the 
same and 22 percent said they were lower in may 25 percent

a drop in inventories indicates healthy sales at a company
