israelis from both major parties reacted coldly 
and sometimes angrily thursday to the us decision to open talks 
with the plo and one official said israel was given no advance 
notice of the move 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir of the 
rightist likud bloc was quoted by israel radio as lamenting the 
us move he said palestine liberation organization chief yasser 
arafat has not changed his position despite his more moderate 
language of recent weeks the radio reported 
they are cheap words and nothing more pazner was quoted as 
saying 
police minister chaim barlev a senior member of the 
leftofcenter labor party said arafat had made a small step 
forward in his recent statements but fell short of renouncing 
terror and recognizing israel as washington had demanded 
he said he doubted a planned usplo meeting in tunisia would 
lead to substantive agreement because of the plos declaration of a 
palestinian state 
if there is a meeting not much will happen because the united 
states is familiar enough with the problem to know that a 
palestinian state is not a solution he said 
alon liel spokesman for the foreign ministry headed by labor 
party leader shimon peres said the ministry was studying the 
situation 
us secretary of state george p shultz who announced the 
decision wednesday in washington said he had discussed it 
beforehand with representatives of israel 
but one israeli official said on condition of anonymity that 
neither shultz nor other us officials had consulted israel in 
advance 
israel has shunned any contacts with the plo regardless of its 
statements on recognizing israel abandoning terrorism and 
accepting un security council resolutions 242 and 338 the 
resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from occupied lands and 
guarantee the rights of all states in the region to have secure 
borders 
israeli officials have contended arafat did not fully renounce 
terrorism because he praised the yearlong palestinian uprising in 
which arabs have engaged in violent riots and attacked israelis with 
firebombs and other makeshift weapons 
politicians from both likud and labor said thursday they believed 
the po had not fulfilled all the us conditions for a dialogue 
likud supporters were clearly angered by the us move 
benny begin a likud parliament member and son of former prime 
minister menachem begin said the plo was known to israelis as a 
bunch of killers and their aim of destroying israel has not 
changed 
from our point of view a snake wearing a jacket and tie is 
nothing but a welldressed snake he said we shall not 
negotiate with these people because no one is expected to choose the 
method of his own execution 
binyamin netanyahu a former un ambassador and close associate 
of shamir said the decision was a terrible mistake 
the united states has breached its policy of not talking to 
the plo and the credibility of the united states has been 
compromised said netanyahu a likud bloc parliament member 
the american government has been either duped or they are 
deceiving themselves the american government will regret what they 
have done once they realize who they are dealing with he said in 
a telephone interview 
the us decision was welcomed however by a leading member of 
the liberal citizens rights movement which was allied with the 
labor party in the nov 1 parliament elections 
its a great victory for american policy said ran cohen a 
parliament member of the small party with this new success we 
are at the beginning of the peace process 
wednesdays announcement in washington could upset sensitive 
negotiations under way between labor and likud over the formation of 
a new coalition government 
peres and shamir have been bitterly divided on the peace issue 
and their reactions to arafats un speech in geneva on tuesday 
showed they were also divided on the plo 
shamir earlier issued an uncompromising rejection of the plo and 
of arafats peace bid labeling the un speech as doubletalk 
peres however complimented arafat for the peace bid by saying 
he has learned to say peace and i welcome this he is learning 
peres also called for a peace dialogue with palestinians 
immediately and without the jordanians if they so decide as long 
as they dont shoot 
the labor leader said however that arafat should do more to end 
terrorism

the chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone co 
the worlds biggest company resigned wednesday under fire for 
alleged involvement in a major business and political scandal 
the minister of posts and telecommunications masaaki nakayama 
told a news conference he accepted the resignation of the companys 
chairman hisashi shinto 
nakayama said shinto denied any personal involvement in unethical 
stock trading but accepted responsibility for actions by his 
personal secretary 
japanese press reports said prosecutors traced about 81000 to 
shintos bank account from proceeds of the sale of shares in 
recruitcosmos co a realestate subsidiary of the recruit 
conglomerate 
shinto on tuesday issued a statement denying involvement in the 
share transaction and said it was carried out by his personal 
secretary kozo murata in 1986 murata has since resigned as 
shintos aide 
the socalled recruit scandal last week brought the resignation 
of kiichi miyazawa as finance minister and deputy prime minister it 
has rocked japans business and political worlds with allegations 
that government figures bought recruit stock at low prices and made 
huge profits when the company went public 
the recruit company allegedly sought favors by distributing 
shares in recruitcosmos with a guarantee of easy taxfree profits 
nippon telegraph and telephone ranked as the largest corporation 
in the world in terms of stock market capitalization had business 
links with recruit which bought two usmade supercomputers from 
the company and leased data communications circuits from it 
as a former telecommunications monopoly the company has been 
partially privatized but shinto and all other officials of the 
utility remain under regulations that it illegal for them to receive 
cash or shares from private firms that it does business with 
shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications 
giant since 1981 when it was still a governmentowned monopoly he 
oversaw the privatization which started in 1985 and then took the 
title of president 
he held that post until june this year when he became chairman 
and chief executive and the title of president went to haruo 
yamaguchi 
shintos resignation would make him the most prominent victim in 
the business world of the recruit scandal it has also brought the 
resignation of news media executives and has broken several 
political careers in addition to that of miyazawa who a year ago 
was a major contender to be prime minister 
prime minister noboru takeshita is on a list of prominent 
politicians whose aides profited from owning recruitcosmos shares 
but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the 
transactions among the others are former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone and shintaro abe secretarygeneral of the governing 
liberal democratic party 
the roots of the scandal go back to 1986 when unlisted 
recruitcosmos shares were offered to the prominent figures or their 
aides often to be paid for with loans from a recruitlinked finance 
company the shares were listed for sale over the counter in october 
1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value yielding taxfree profits 
when they were sold

before he was fitted with his new 
automated arms 12yearold armando gutierrez pulled on his shoes 
and socks with his teeth and wrote with his foot 
now his new batterypowered arms are helping him learn to do 
everyday tasks in a more conventional way 
its easy nothing to it said armando who lives in las 
cruces about 180 miles south of albuquerque and was born with arm 
stubs 
armandos occupational therapist teresa pollpeter said the boy 
started using the mechanical arms correctly minutes after they were 
fitted on him nov 30 at carrie tingley hospital in albuquerque 
we put them on him one day and he immediately started using 
them accurately ms pollpeter said tuesday he already had the 
muscle control mastered 
now all he has to do is work on improving his accuracy she said 
the arms flex up and down and hooks open and close when armando 
moves his shoulders a certain way thin cables attached to a switch 
on each arm make them move 
each arm weighs about 3 pounds and is strapped over armandos 
stubs and onto his shoulders with a small harness on his back 
batteries power the arms during the day and are recharged at night 
said eloy padilla armandos prosthetist 
armando is the second child to be fitted with the 12000 arms at 
the hospital this particular line of prostheses has been available 
for four years 
his last pair was not automated and he had to push the forearms 
against an object to get them to lock in a bent position many 
things were easier by foot than by hand as a result 
he wrote with his left foot holding the pencil between his big 
toe and second toe and he used to pull on his shoes and socks with 
his teeth 
when i was 5 i saw my mom drop a fork and pick it up with her 
toes he said thats how i got the idea for holding the 
pencil i only have four toes so i put the pencil where the space 
is its easy 
ms pollpeter said eating with the new arms has been the priority 
for armando 
its not totally acceptable to have your feet at the table so 
this is really going to help him she said his parents like for 
him to use the prostheses thats why we were eager for him to 
master that skill 
he will work at home on the other tasks such as getting dressed 
and writing ms pollpeter said

american teenagers have the highest rate 
of abortion in the developed world more than double that of 
teenagers in most european countries according to a new un 
report 
the report released tuesday by the world bodys population 
division also found the united states to have the highest teenage 
pregnancy rate contrasting with declining rates in almost every 
other developed country 
about 98 percent of us females ranging in age from 15 to 19 
are becoming pregnant on an annual basis the highest rate among the 
nations studied hungary ranked second at 85 percent 
japan was lowest overall at 1 percent the netherlands was lowest 
in europe at 12 percent and most other european nations averaged 
about 35 percent 
in the united states 44 percent of women in the age group 
studied had abortions on a yearly basis compared with 27 percent 
in hungary 05 percent in the netherlands and 06 percent in japan 
the report entitled adolescent reproductive behavior deals 
only with developed nations the pregnancy and abortion rates it 
cites represent the latest figures available for each country 
liberalization of abortion laws does not always bring about an 
increase in abortion rates the report says in sweden a 
liberalization of the laws in 1975 brought about only a small 
increase in rates 
the one outstanding characteristic of teenagers requesting 
abortion is that the majority of them are unmarried the report 
found 
the option to carry a pregnancy to term is becoming less and 
less popular among pregnant teenagers the report says the 
proportion of pregnancies that end in abortion has increased since 
the early 1970s 
examining other sexual trends the report found that cohabitation 
has gained popularity among european men and women of all ages 
in the past couples frequently lived together for short 
periods before marriage but such unions have become more and more 
common and may or may not result in marriage it says 
the survey covered eastern and western europe the soviet union 
the united states and canada japan australia and new zealand

even while denying yasser arafat a us visa 
the state department tried through public and private diplomacy to 
induce the palestine liberation organization to renounce terrorism 
in all forms and explicitly recognize israels right to exist 
the prize held out to arafat was a substantive dialogue with 
the united states a major step toward us acceptance of the 
palestinian leader who only two weeks ago had been condemned by 
secretary of state george p shultz as an accessory to acts of 
terrorism 
with arafat already accepted by a number of west european 
governments an end to us diplomatic isolation would have 
strengthened his hand in the palestinian conflict with israel and 
assured him a voice in any mideast negotiations 
but us officials declared that the speech arafat delivered to 
the un general assembly in geneva on tuesday failed to meet the 
three us conditions for us acceptance 
diplomatic sources said the state department was so sure that 
arafat would satisfy the demands shultz had notified moshe arad 
the israeli ambassador on monday night that if the plo leader 
followed through the united states was prepared to hold the 
dialogue arafat had long sought 
sweden had acted as an intermediary over the past few weeks 
relaying the us conditions and receiving in return what was taken 
as advance word on what arafat would say 
in the end though charles e redman the state department 
spokesman credited arafat only with some interesting and positive 
developments and said the plo leader had failed to meet the us 
requirements 
these include explicit acceptance of israels right to exist and 
renunciation of terrorism in all forms the third requirement is 
approval of un security council resolutions affirming that all 
middle eastern states are entitled to live within secure borders 
on the third point the state department found some significant 
movement by arafat last month the palestine national council the 
wouldbe parliament of the plo merely said a peace conference could 
be held under the 1967 and 1973 resolutions 
still redman said these issues must be addressed clearly 
squarely and without ambiguity that did not happen 
presidentelect bush said meanwhile that his administration 
will not meet with the plo based on what arafat said in geneva 
weve got to get a much clearer statement of everything he said 
us policy prohibits negotiations with the plo which is 
committed by covenant to dismantling israel as a jewish state as a 
result diplomatic sources said pieces of paper were exchanged 
through sweden a neutralist country which has taken a sympathetic 
stance toward the plo and hosted a meeting of a handful of american 
jews with arafat after shultz barred him from speaking to the 
general assembly in new york 
asked if the state department had suggested language for arafat 
to use in his speech redman replied what we have done is to 
respond to requests from third parties people who said would you 
provide us tell us in specific terms exactly what your position 
is what your conditions are and that of course we are happy to 
do 
referring to the way arafat dealt with the us conditions in the 
speech redman said there were problems with all three 
the spokesman called the overall tone of the speech positive 
and said the united states saw some movement by arafat on the 
two us resolutions but he did not elaborate 
james zogby executive director of the arab american institute 
said arafat had met the three us conditions he called us 
rejection of arafats speech gratuitous and said it was based 
more on shultzs stubborn proisrael reflex than on sound 
diplomacy 
geoffrey kemp a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said arafat is inching along 
but kemp who served on the national security council in the 
first reagan administration said the problem is he is not 
declaring israel has a right to exist

after a quick start presidentelect bush is 
falling behind the pace set by his predecessors in filling the 
cabinet causing consternation among even some of his loyalists 
he once boasted about how swiftly he was naming his team in 
comparison with other recent presidents but bush now has fallen 
behind presidents eisenhower and nixon who had their cabinet 
selections completed by this point in their transitions 
bush transition sources said the presidentelect will announce as 
early as today that he wants trade representative clayton yeutter to 
be his agriculture secretary and that he has chosen samuel skinner 
of illinois to head the transportation department 
even so bush will still fall behind president kennedy if he 
hasnt filled his cabinet by saturday behind president carter if he 
isnt done by next friday 
among the snags 
a long delay in completion of the fbis investigation into the 
background of former sen john tower may have seriously weakened 
towers prospects for senate confirmation even if he is as 
expected ultimately appointed defense secretary 
the inability of bushs transition team to come up with a 
suitable job for former transporation secretary elizabeth dole has 
left the wife of senate republican leader robert dole awkwardly 
hanging 
the contention of bushs vice presidential chiefofstaff craig 
fuller that no current member of congress will be appointed to the 
cabinet so as not to thin gop ranks in the house has infuriated 
more than a few gop lawmakers according to sources 
transition and congressional gop sources said that the edict 
appeared aimed at softening the blow of a nojoboffer to rep lynn 
martin rill a vigorous political supporter of the vice president 
from the early days of his campaign 
if so it may have been a case of overkill taking along a dozen 
or so other gop lawmakers who had figured prominently in recent 
cabinet speculation with a lopsided democratic majority of 259 to 
175 in the house one or two fewer republicans wouldnt have made 
all that much difference 
the move had echoes of an announcement on july 30 1964 by 
president johnson that ended widespread speculation that he would 
name thenattorney general robert f kennedy to be his vice 
presidential running mate in the coming presidential election 
at a hastily arranged television appearance johnson said that 
members of his cabinet were too valuable to him and that it would be 
inadvisable to select any member of my cabinet as his running 
mate 
kennedy who resigned later that summer after winning the new 
york democratic senate nominination accepted johnsons rationale 
philosophically but responded that he was sorry he had to take so 
many good men overboard with him 
in a recent interview new hampshire gov john sununu whom bush 
has picked to be his presidential chief of staff defended the 
delays and blamed them on the necessity of conducting thorough and 
meticulous background checks on each candidate for a cabinet job 
however sununu conceded you always wish things could go faster 
he said delays were inevitable as we get more and more people 
to be reviewed and more and more of a stretching resources thin 
little more than a week after the election bush boasted to 
reporters that he was off to a quick start compared to predecessors 
dating back to eisenhower 
at that time he had already designated four members of his 
cabinet secretaries of state treasury education and an attorney 
general and had picked a chief of staff 
at a similar point in midnovember after their elections to the 
white house former presidents eisenhower kennedy nixon and 
carter and president reagan had not even begun to name cabinet 
choices according to a breakdown provided by the bush transition 
office and cited by bush in his conversation with reporters 
since then bush also has designated a national security adviser 
a press secretary a trade representative a cia chief a un 
ambassador a chief economist and a secretary of commerce 
still he has already dropped behind dwight eisenhower who 
finished his cabinet by dec 1 1952 and richard nixon who 
completed his choices by dec 11 1968 
john f kennedy had his entire cabinet announced by dec 17 
jimmy carter by dec 23 1976 ronald reagan by contrast didnt 
have his cabinet selection completed until jan 1 1980 
congressional sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said bushs delay in naming a defense secretary and his treatment 
of mrs dole and mrs martin had dispirited some of bushs most 
faithful loyalists on capitol hill

researchers who hope to study the secrets of 
nature at the governments planned 44 billion super collider may 
first need protection from a venomous ant with a penchant for 
munching its way through underground cables 
a 10000page environmental impact statement on the project says 
the texas site chosen by the energy department for the research 
center is in an area infested with the fire ant 
the illtempered ant inflicts painful bites is blamed by local 
residents for disabling home and farm equipment and has caused 
power failures by chewing through underground cables the department 
reports 
plans call for the super collider to be built in a 53mile tunnel 
under what is now farmland in ellis county texas subatomic 
particles will be accelerated to astronomical speeds inside the 
tunnel and studied by scientists hoping to learn more about the 
fundamental nature of matter and energy 
scientists however have yet to find a way to eradicate the fire 
ant 
the energy department says special attention will have to be paid 
at the super collider site to the design of electrical facilities 
and other underground components construction practices to protect 
workers from the ants painful sting and development of an 
environmentally sound pesticide policy 
texans who commented on the super collider project to the energy 
department said fire ants routinely tunnel to water table depths 
in search of water chewing their way through underground cables and 
insulation around wiring en route the impact statement said 
fire ants appear to be attracted to electrical equipment and 
can cause shorts by chewing through insulation and by crowding into 
spaces around electrical contacts the study said 
the study said local utility companies and highway departments 
have reported problems with damage caused by the ants 
thirty years of study by federal and state agriculture officials 
still has not yielded an effective method of eradicating the ant 
only control procedures the study said a texas department of 
agriculture representative told the energy department that the 
control programs were only 80 percent effective 
fire ants also pose a health risk since their bite is painful and 
can sometimes lead to serious reactions in humans the study said 
for most people a sting results in swelling pain and itching 
that lasts a week the study said for others immediate medical 
attention may be needed especially for a few victims so sensitive 
to the ants venom they go into shock 
the final environmental impact statement examined all seven sites 
that had been in contention for the super collider incorporating 
6000 pages of comments and letters received after the draft 
statement was released in august the energy department announced in 
november it would locate the project in texas

an attorney for a legal rights group says the 
governments proposals on nicaraguan asylumseekers constitute a 
broad attack on asylum for central americans 
the us immigration and naturalization service proposals could 
sharply reduce nicaraguans chances of obtaining work permits while 
they await decisions on asylum applications 
if implemented fully the draft ins proposals also could result 
in detention for central americans whose asylum applications are 
rejected and who are awaiting final decisions on deportation 
i regard this as a broad attack on asylum arthur c helton 
director of the political asylum project of the lawyers committee 
for human rights in new york said tuesday the first victims are 
the nicaraguans in south texas who are to be deprived of the 
opportunity to subsist but tens of thousands of other asylum 
applicants will face unnecessary hardship on account of these 
measures 
he said that while the immediate inspiration for the 
proposals is a huge increase in nicaraguans seeking asylum who have 
come across the border in texas this is not a measure solely 
attributable to the arrival of nicaraguans 
asylum applications from salvadorans rose from 2700 in fiscal 
1987 to more than 27000 for fiscal 1988 which ended sept 30 
immigration officials acknowledged that the proposals would apply 
to other central american asylum seekers as well as to nicaraguans 
but they denied they are trying to discourage the filing of 
legitimate asylum claims by central americans who have a 
wellfounded fear of persecution in their homeland 
we have to have an orderly immigration system said 
immigration commissioner alan nelson said we want those with 
legitimate claims to immigrate and get them approved but we must 
avoid abuses and were seeing evidence of that in south texas 
nelson said that in harlingen salesmen are offering phony 
packets of asylum documents to nicaraguans and other central 
americans 
nicaraguans are particularly upset over the proposals because 
work permits would be withheld until after immigration officers make 
a determination of whether the asylum claim is legitimate 
under a july 1987 directive from thenattorney general edwin 
meese iii nicaraguans in most instances were automatically granted 
permits allowing them to work here legally while their asylum 
requests were pending 
the backlog of cases has risen steadily since then and nelson 
said the agency is increasing efforts to review some 22000 pending 
asylum claims from nicaraguans starting with the most recent 
applicants 
canceling work permits issued to nicaraguans or not issuing work 
permits to new asylum applicants wont stop the influx of 
nicaraguans into the united states said roberto arguello chairman 
of the public relations committee of the nicaraguan american bankers 
association in miami 
the ins steps are not going to stop people from coming 
agreed maritza herrera executive director of the nicaraguan 
american foundation in miami they come here and theyre going to 
stay in the underground economy underpaid

undercover wildlife agents have found 
flagrant poaching violations and unsporting practices by 
waterfowl hunting businesses along the texas coast that led to 
charges against 210 people in seven states 
the poaching violations come at a time when duck populations are 
already hurt by an eightyear drought in their breeding grounds 
duck numbers already are near record lows because of the 
drought and continued destruction of their natural habitat said 
frank dunkle director of the us fish and wildlife service they 
cannot long withstand additional losses from illegal harvest 
more than 100 wildlife service agents spent three years in an 
undercover investigation of 41 commercial waterfowl hunting 
businesses on the texas coast documenting more than 1300 
violations in one of the agencys biggest operations officials said 
during this investigation service agents reported flagrant 
violations of laws intended to protect waterfowl dunkle said 
tuesday lawabiding waterfowlers are outraged by these unethical 
and unsporting practices that betray total lack of concern for the 
status of waterfowl populations 
agents from around the country went undercover to book hunts with 
guides and owners of hunting businesses charging 65 to 500 a day 
who were suspected of killing waterfowl illegally and encouraging 
and helping customers to do likewise alleged violations occurred on 
92 percent of the hunts the service said 
the agency said 23 hunting guides and owners were being arrested 
22 of them in texas and one in iowa indictments or charges 
contained in a federal document named 50 others and 137 people were 
to receive misdemeanor notices of violation in texas alabama 
georgia maryland michigan and oklahoma 
charges include shooting more than the legal limit rallying 
or stirring up waterfowl to drive them toward hunters use of lead 
shot in steel shot zones failure to retrieve shot fowl wanton 
waste use of electronic calls taking birds after the season has 
closed or outside legal hunting hours and tagging and 
recordkeeping violations such as claiming birds belonged to 
someone who had not hunted that day or falsifying when birds were 
shot 
in several cases the service said raptors herons ibises and 
other nongame migratory birds were allegedly killed and sold to 
undercover agents 
agents documented one case in which a dozen hunters in blinds 
around a pond shot as many geese as they could killing more than 
200 birds 139 over their limit 
wildlife service spokeswoman megan durham said the agents went 
undercover because the violations were occurring behind locked 
gates and in remote areas and its difficult to get information any 
other way 
maximum penalties for the misdemeanors could be six months to one 
year in prison and fines of 5000 to 100000 for individuals and 
10000 to 200000 for organizations depending on the charge 
maximum penalties for felony violations could be two to five 
years in prison and fines of 250000 for individuals and 500000 
for organizations depending on the charge

a director of a new ussoviet effort to help 
american businesses sell everything from cosmetics to caviar in the 
soviet union says he expects moscow to relax its limits on foreign 
ownership of companies early next year 
current soviet law requires that joint business ventures be no 
more than 49 percent foreign owned but randy bregman of 
washingtonbased apco associates said he expects this to be 
liberalized possibly within the first three months of 1989 
apco is an affiliate of the law firm of arnold amp porter which 
held a news conference tuesday to announce that apco had set up a 
joint venture with infeks a sixmonthold soviet consulting 
cooperative affiliated with the ussr ministry of foreign 
economic relations 
new soviet efforts to open and restructure the countrys economy 
offer access to a market of 280 million highly educated soviet 
consumers with an enormous need for goods and technology said 
james jones the firms managing partner 
he said soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policies are 
setting an exciting new course for eastwest business 
relationships 
bregman director of soviet and east european services for apco 
said the new venture will help american businesses set up joint 
operations with soviet cooperatives and other enterprises 
speaking before a soviet and us flag and with a direct 
telephone hookup to moscow officials said the partners in the 
venture would draw up final details and meet with prospective 
clients later this week 
bregman said apco hopes to double the number of ussoviet 
ventures by the end of next year ten joint ussoviet business 
agreements have been concluded to date along with about 100 soviet 
ventures with businesses from other countries he said 
bregman said he looks to the day when a soviet citizen can buy 
borscht made by campbell soup co he said campbell is not one of the 
companies now involved but this is an example of the kind of 
enterprise that might result from the new agreement 
bregman declined to name companies that might deal with the 
soviets through apco but he said they include about a dozen 
companies involved in food processing pollution control medical 
equipment cosmetics tourism and telecommunications one us 
company even wants to get into caviar production he said 
vladimir gusinsky infeks president said from moscow that the 
soviet enterprise is part of the economic perestroika or 
restructuring under way in his country 
we are looking forward to developing economic relations with 
us companies gusinsky said through a translator who also 
translated the washington news conference in russian over the 
telephone hookup 
gusinsky and other infeks officials were to arrive in washington 
later this week 
apco president margery kraus said the company which also has set 
up joint ventures with japanese and israeli businesses would open 
an office in moscow early next year 
she said the company would provide onestop shopping for 
companies wanting to do business in the soviet union charging fees 
for its services she said there were no plans for apco to share in 
profits of the joint ventures it helps set up

the environmental protection agency says ground 
water has been contaminated by pesticides in parts of 38 states but 
it cautions that more study is needed before the full extent of such 
pollution can be determined 
the agency said tuesday a review of 150 ground water studies over 
the past 10 years found 74 different chemicals in 38 states similar 
findings had been announced by advocacy groups using epa documents 
obtained under the freedom of information act 
the epa has added new information farming has put 46 chemicals 
in the ground water of 26 states and 32 chemicals got into ground 
water in 12 states because of point source pollution such as an 
accidental spill 
unknown sources account for 28 chemicals in 12 states not 
necessarily the same 12 involved in pointsource contamination 
there are dangers in trying to draw national conclusions from 
the data which are not appropriate for assessing human 
exposure said victor kimm acting assistant administrator in 
charge of pesticides 
many agricultural areas have not been sampled and are not 
statistically represented he said 
the studies sampled shallow sampling wells and aquifers used for 
irrigation in addition to drinking water 
the agency said concentrations generally were below its health 
advisory levels for drinking water but some were not 
epa is in the process of sampling 1300 drinking water wells 
nationwide to check for 125 different chemicals according to a 
statistically based scheme that should yield national conclusions in 
late 1989 or early 1990 
the studies responsible for tuesdays findings were conducted by 
government agencies universities and holders of pesticide licenses 
and epa said it was still interviewing the authors to check the 
validity of their work 
diane baxter staff scientist of the national coalition against 
the misuse of pesticides said she was not surprised by epas 
findings this is the tip of the iceberg as more samples are 
taken we are going to find more instances of contamination 
john mccarthy vice president for science and regulatory affairs 
at the national agricultural chemicals association a pesticide 
manufacturers trade group agreed that the results were not 
appropriate for assessing human exposure and said epas current 
sampling is the kind of information we will look to as to whether 
theres a health issue 
until 1979 pesticides had been thought not to get into ground 
water but to remain bound to soil since then concern has risen as 
more and more contamination has been found 
when epa announced a proposed pesticidesinground water strategy 
in february it said it knew of 19 pesticides from farming in the 
ground water of 24 states

rising interest rates threaten to end a recent 
letup in losses by savings institutions some economists say 
according to the federal home loan bank board losses for the 
nations 3024 sampls had dropped to 16 billion in the 
julyseptember period down from 39 billion in both the first and 
second quarters 
most of the improvement came in nonoperating losses meaning 
institutions wrote off fewer bad loans they dropped from 36 
billion in the second quarter to 14 billion in the third 
james barth chief economist of the bank board declined to 
predict nonoperating losses in the current octoberdecember 
quarter but he said operating profits which rose in the third 
quarter will be hurt because of rising interest rates this quarter 
rising interest rates narrow the spread between what an 
institution has to pay for its money and what it can earn on loans 
and other investments 
interest rates do not bode well for the future said martin 
regalia chief economist of the national council of savings 
institutions a trade group 
the bank board released the loss figures for the third quarter 
two weeks ago on tuesday in a more detailed report it said the 
number of insolvent savings institutions continued to fall but it 
said even as government rescues soared other institutions were 
slipping 
the bank board said 434 sampls were insolvent at the end of 
september down from 498 three months earlier and substantially 
lower from the peak of 520 at the end of last year 
however regulators had to resolve the cases of 129 insolvent 
institutions either through rescues or closures to whittle down 
the insolvent list by 86 over the first nine months of the year 
that means 43 other institutions slipped into the red 
in the third quarter an additional 150 institutions were on the 
edge of insolvency with capital levels between zero and 15 percent 
losses for the first nine months 94 billion already surpass 
last years postdepression record of 78 billion as in the past 
the losses were heavily concentrated in texas and in just a few 
institutions in the third quarter 
the 244 texas thrifts 114 of them insolvent reported losses 
of 17 billion all thrifts outside of texas managed a modest gain 
of 45 million the worst 20 institutions 14 of them in texas 
lost 13 billion 
it may be misconstruing it to say hey were coming out of 
the woods these numbers say hey youre still losing a lot of 
money its nothing to get euphoric over regalia said 
the hole is still bigger its just not getting bigger as fast 
you can take some solace in that i just wouldnt take too much 
solace he said 
barth said the quarterly loss would have been 2 billion without 
the government actions still a substantial improvement 
but bert ely an analyst in alexandria va said a large 
portion of the industrys operating income is coming from a flow of 
assistance income to restructured institutions 
ely said the bank board made assistance payments of 528 million 
in the third quarter up from 466 million in the second quarter 
payments on government promissory notes were 948 million up from 
101 million he said 
theres a substantial amount of income support coming in 
it is adding to income level it is adding to the bottom line he 
said 
all three economists expressed concern about the effect of rising 
interest rates on thrift earnings in the current quarter which will 
be released by the bank board in march 
also ely and regalia noted that nonoperating losses frequently 
rise sharply in the final quarter of the year because institutions 
often account for loan losses as they prepare their books for the 
end of the year 
the condition of sampls stands in stark contrast to the relative 
health of commercial banking despite more than 200 bank failures so 
far this year banking as a whole posted record profits totaling 
164 billion in the first nine months of the year

jurors in lyndon larouches tax fraud 
trial are being asked to decide whether items ranging from free 
meals to free underwear should be considered taxable income 
for four hours in an overheated federal courtroom tuesday as 
jurors stifled yawns and a us marshal dozed off defense lawyers 
and government prosecutors bickered over the arcane language of the 
federal tax code 
the issue was whether larouche a perennial minorparty 
presidential candidate broke the law by failing to file federal 
income tax returns for any year since 1978 
larouche argues that he had no taxable income because all his 
personal expenses were paid by various corporations he controls 
mr larouche does not have to file income tax returns for 1979 
through 1987 nor pay income taxes for that period declared 
washington accountant thomas e seay who was hired by defense 
lawyers to conduct a yearlong review of larouches financial records 
seay argued that larouche was an employee of all the groups he 
headed and that under the tax code what he received from his 
employers as their business expense including meals lodging 
plane flights bodyguards horseback rides and even the new set of 
underwear during his campaign travels was nontaxable 
compensation 
what if he accepted a free trim of such hair as he has asked 
defense attorney odin anderson prompting a grin from the balding 
larouche 
the courtroom erupted in laughter when seay responded that it 
might be considered a fringe benefit from larouches employers 
under questioning by government prosecutors seay conceded he had 
been denied access to financial records prior to july 1985 which 
were seized when federal agents raided larouches leesburg va 
headquarters in october 1986 
the accountant acknowledged he was relying on court testimony in 
concluding that larouche had never received enough taxable income 
currently a minimum of 1080 to require filing a tax return 
seay testified as defense lawyers pushed to wrap up their case 
before the end of the fourth week of the trial in us district 
court 
besides a charge of conspiring to defraud the internal revenue 
service larouche and six associates are accused of mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans from 
supporters without any intention of repaying them 
if convicted of all 13 counts against him larouche would face a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million 
another key defense witness tuesday was mayer morganroth a tax 
lawyer from new york and southfield mich who said he advised 
larouche in 1979 that he did not have to file any income tax returns 
morganroth said his opinion endorsed at a second conference on 
larouches tax status in late 1984 was that the goods and services 
provided to larouche were not payments but instead were intended to 
yield benefits to his publishers and other larouche entities that 
promoted his causes 
san francisco lawyer richard morris told the trial jury that he 
had numerous contacts with larouche operatives while he was an aide 
to former white house national security adviser william p clark in 
198283 
morris said he considered their positions on such issues as 
soviet intelligence terrorism and third world debt but never 
divulged any information in return 
he said he curbed those contacts when cia and defense 
intelligence officials warned him that larouche was a socialist a 
fascist a communist a member of the kgb and even a democrat

a presidential advisory commission is proposing 
a hefty pay raise for congress but it also is pushing lawmakers 
toward a dilemma whether to abandon income from speaking fees in 
return for higher salaries 
members of congress are caught in a vise between editorial 
writers and reporters who are opposed to honoraria and voters who 
are opposed to pay raises said sen george mitchell dmaine who 
will be the senate majority leader in the next congress 
it is apparent however that there is a serious perception 
problem regarding honoraria which congress will have to consider 
along with the salary issue early next year mitchell said in a 
statement 
the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries 
met on tuesday and approved recommendations for pay increases 
averaging 50 percent next year for the governments top 2500 
officials that would send members of congress from their current 
pay of 89500 to 135000 
but in an unusual move the panel also included strong language 
linking the pay boost to a ban on congressional speaking fees which 
reached a record 98 million in 1987 such a ban would require 
separate action by congress 
house leaders have spoken out in favor of such a ban in the 
senate where members are allowed to take home more in speaking fees 
and are generally in greater demand as speakers the issue is more 
difficult 
it is now up to president reagan to decide whether to accept or 
modify the commissions recommendations he will include his 
decision in the budget he sends congress on jan 9 and any pay 
raise would automatically take effect 30 days later unless both the 
house and senate vote to head it off 
mitchell was noncommittal on the pay raise saying only that he 
looked forward to reviewing the presidents suggestions senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan said he would meet with mitchell 
on the subject next week 
in the house leaders said they planned to support both the 
increase that the president recommends and the ban on outside 
speaking fees any honoraria known to mankind or yet to be 
conceived should be covered by the ban said rep tony coelho 
dcalif the no 3 official in the democratic leadership 
but coelho said leaders are braced for an onslaught of criticism 
from the public and from lawmakers who fear the political backlash 
of accepting such a large raise when their salaries already are far 
higher than the average americans 
it appeared likely that as in 1986 the senate would vote to 
turn down the raise and the house would take the heat for allowing 
the 30day clock to run out without voting on the increase 
chief justice william h rehnquist welcomed the payraise 
proposal saying it is bound to be encouraging to the nations 
federal judges 
the commissions salary recommendations would restore to those 
judges the cuts in real income which have been caused by inflation 
over the last 20 years rehnquist said 
commission chairman lloyd cutler said federal courts have been 
particularly hard hit by the erosion in salaries caused by 
inflation judges are leaving in droves he said because they 
can make far more money in private legal practice 
ralph nader the selfstyled consumer advocate contested the 
commissions argument that it was only seeking to restore purchasing 
power lost by members of congress and other federal officials over 
the past two decades he noted that in 1964 lawmakers were paid 
22500 two years ago they received a 12100 increase to the 
current level of 89500 
it sounds like members of congress and their peers in the other 
branches of government have kept up with inflation quite well he 
said while members of congress have been overly generous to 
themselves they have failed to act to increase wages for the 67 
million workers who are at or below the minimum wage nader said

not only is china a big grain customer of the 
american farmer theres a new laboratory in beijing that may help 
develop trade with the united states in tiny organisms that protect 
crops from destructive insects and weeds 
the new research operation was announced tuesday by the 
agriculture department as a way to help find natural enemies of 
insects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries 
ultimately the exchange of biocontrol organisms and 
scientific information could help boost crop production in both 
china and the united states 
orville g bentley assistant secretary for science and 
education said the new sinoamerican biological control 
collaborative laboratory is located at the chinese academy of 
agricultural sciences 
under a fiveyear agreement with the academy three usda 
scientists will go to the laboratory next may and conduct research 
there for six months each year they will work in the united states 
the remaining six months of the year 
richard s soper biocontrol research leader in the departments 
agricultural research service said the beijing laboratory will be a 
quarantine and research facility for exchanging potential biocontrol 
organisms between the two countries 
the targeted us pests include leafy spurge a noxious 
rangeland weed two water weeds hydrilla and watermilfoil and the 
russian wheat aphid soper said the aphid is the most worrisome 
pest it was first spotted in the united states in 1986 and has 
spread rapidly to wheatgrowing areas 
pests of concern to china are croftonweed a weed so toxic to 
horses that they cant be kept on certain land scale insects and 
apple leaf mites 
next year the chinese academy is expected to send scientists to 
usda laboratories in fort lauderdale fla and buenos aires 
argentina 
soper said scientists at four agency laboratories in france 
italy south korea and argentina are searching overseas to find 
biocontrols for us pests but until now he said scientists have 
not been able to easily explore most of the vast eurasian land area 
the new lab takes care of much of asia that weve missed and 
were hoping we can develop similar arrangements with the soviets 
he said 
meanwhile the usda also announced that private exporters have 
sold china an additional 400000 metric tons of us wheat at

this has been a decade of progress for women 
on television especially for female characters in prime time 
but the industry must be monitored to ensure further gains the 
national commission on working women said 
the accolade and note of caution came tuesday as the commission 
released a report entitled ten years in prime time an analysis of 
the image of women on entertainment television 19791988 which 
examined the portrayal of women and compared the fictional panorama 
with the profile of reallife women during the decade 
the 1980s mark a decade of progress for women on television 
their portrayals have become more diverse and for the most part 
more truetolife the report said 
the networks get a pat on the back said the studys 
author sally streenland 
the study said 60 percent of female characters on the 25 top 
nielsen rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the 
home by 1987 that figure had risen to 75 percent 
by comparison 1987 population statistics from the us census 
bureau show that 56 percent of all women were in the labor force 
streenlands study also showed tv painting an unrealistically 
rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women 
in 1979 more than 40 percent of televisions women were employed 
in clerical or service jobs by 1987 only 23 percent of the women on 
tv had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional 
careers 
the real life situation is that 47 percent of working women have 
clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in 
professional or managerial jobs 
the report also showed that black women have become more visible 
on tv in 1979 there was only one black female character on 
television but by 1987 22 percent of women characters were black

three environmental groups filed suit 
tuesday to force the us department of energy to prepare an 
environmental impact statement before restarting the three reactors 
at the savannah river plant 
restarting the reactors constitutes a major federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
according to the suit filed in us district court in washington and 
announced here 
under terms of the national environmental policy act of 1969 the 
energy department must prepare an environmental impact statement if 
such a condition exists according to the suit 
in another development the new york times reported in 
wednesdays editions that a key advisory panel told the energy 
department that its plan to restart the plant is flawed 
the departments principal scentific advisory committee said the 
reactor at savannah river should not be allowed to return to 
operation until more complete inspections and analyses are made 
about its ability to withstand a severe earthquake such study could 
take months the newspaper said 
srp is the only us plant that produces tritium a radioactive 
isotope of hydrogen used to increase the explosive power of nuclear 
warheads 
none of the three reactors at the 300squaremile facility near 
aiken has produced the critical weapons material since last april 
because of scheduled maintenance and safety concerns 
last month energy secretary john s herrington said continuing 
safety questions would delay the restart of srp until at least next 
spring or summer 
tritium decays at the rate of 55 percent per year and energy and 
defense department officials have said that further idling of srp 
could endanger the nations stockpile 
frances close hart chairwoman of the columbiabased energy 
research foundation said tuesday she did not believe an 
environmental impact statement would push back restart efforts 
whether or not if they started with an eis now it would delay 
their schedule i doubt very much she said at a news conference 
announcing the suit 
the energy research foundation was joined in the suit by 
greenpeace usa and washingtonbased natural resources defense 
council 
named as defendants were herrington ernest e baynard iii 
assistant energy secretary for environment safety and health and 
troy e wade ii acting assistant energy secretary for defense 
programs 
doe spokeswoman christina sankey said the department had met over 
the past few weeks with representatives of the three environmental 
groups regarding an environmental impact statement 
while we did not reach an agreement the department does intend 
to meet all of its obligations under the national environmental 
policy act she said 
ms hart said there were ways to recycle tritium that would 
stretch out the current supply she also said a reduction in us 
nuclear weapons would eliminate the urgent demand for tritium 
anyone who proposes that we face a tritium crisis is either 
irresponsible or dr strangelove she said 
ms hart said an environmental impact statement would aid restart 
efforts 
they can do it as quickly as they want to if they devote the 
energy ms hart said the reason we want to bring this suit and 
have them begin the process is because theyre obviously making 
decisions now 
theyre making decisions every day theyre issuing reports and 
the process of planning is moving along the eis should be part of 
that process we dont feel they should go any further without 
starting this process 
the environmental groups are asking for an injunction that would 
prohibit the energy department from restarting the savannah plant 
unless the agency conducts the environmental impact statement

the pentagon is proposing a 2 percent boost in 
spending next year including a pay raise for military personnel 
with no new cuts in forces 
the spending plan for the 1990 budget year which begins next 
oct 1 calls for a 41 percent pay raise for the 21 million 
military personnel and sufficient money to maintain the level of 
training approved for the current budget year dan howard chief 
spokesman at the defense department said tuesday 
the 1990 budget proposal is to be formally unveiled on jan 9 it 
will disclose that there has been a oneyear slip in production of 
the new b2 stealth bomber as a result of both fiscal and 
technical considerations howard said 
the spokesman declined to elaborate further on the stealth delay 
noting the program is still classified the air force had said 
previously it expected delivery of the first operational b2 in 
fiscal 1991 
howards disclosure of fiscal 1990 budget details was unexpected 
and unusual the defense department normally declines to discuss any 
of the administrations internal budget decisions before the entire 
federal budget is submitted to congress 
the spokesmans willingness to discuss the matter however 
appeared to reflect a desire on the part of defense secretary frank 
c carlucci to pressure congress and for that matter 
presidentelect bush to reverse a fouryear slide in defense 
spending after inflation 
bush will be free after his inauguration on jan 20 to amend the 
budget submissions and he has indicated he might bow to 
congressional calls that military spending be held at current levels 
after accounting for inflation 
bush said tuesday he would not make any decisions until he 
assumes the presidency 
carlucci in several recent speeches has argued that zero growth 
is unacceptable howard echoed that stand tuesday 
there are those who talk about zerogrowth budgets he said 
we just want to make sure that everybody understands what that 
means if you move in the direction of zero growth it means that 
over the next five years you have to take out at least an 
additional 100 billion because of projected inflation 
president reagans last pentagon request will total 3056 
billion in multiyear budget authority up about 153 billion from 
fiscal 1989 howard said that does not include militaryrelated 
nuclear programs under the energy department 
the pentagon increase will include about 11 billion for the 
military pay raise about 7 billion to cover inflation and 72 
billion to provide a real growth increase of 2 percent the 
spokesman said 
this means that we can sustain the military force that we now 
have said howard 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said last week i expect the pentagon to ask for a 2 
percent increase but i think theyll have a hard time getting it 
their best prospect is for a freeze theres not much sentiment up 
here capitol hill to increase defense spending 
to maintain readiness and avoid further personnel or program 
cuts carlucci will propose a greatly expanded reliance on 
multiyear purchase contracts during the next five years howard 
said 
congress will be asked to commit itself to buy most of the 
nations biggest weapons under longterm contracts instead of 
debating production levels every year 
howard said there are proposals for multiyear budgeting on 32 
programs if all of this is adopted it could result in savings of 
about 85 billion over the terms of these procurements

a federal judge has ruled that a law compelling 
the district of columbia to permit religious organizations to 
discriminate against homosexuals is unconstitutional 
us district judge royce c lamberth said tuesday the law 
violated the free speech rights of dc council members 
we are thrilled and we feel vindicated said michael 
greenberger a private attorney who represented the council members 
the law known as the armstrong amendment for its sponsor sen 
william armstrong rcolo imposed on city council members 
compelled speech that violated their first amendment rights 
under the constitution the judge declared 
under the provision a majority of plaintiffs would be forced 
to vote in favor of adopting the amendment which presumably 
requires a vote of yea or nay the court finds that this vote is 
of sufficient communicative value as to be protected by the first 
amendment lamberth said 
legislators do not generally leave their constitutional rights 
at the statehouse gate and the court does not see why first 
amendment rights should be an exception lamberth wrote 
the case appears to be the first time congress has attempted to 
balance gay rights and religious freedom 
the amendment which would have forced the city to amend its 
human rights code was tacked onto the citys 1989 budget along 
with several other measures which were opposed by the district 
government congress had threatened to freeze the citys 32 
billion budget on jan 1 if the council failed to change the law 
armstrong had argued that the local law including gay rights 
under the human rights code forced schools such as georgetown 
university to go against its roman catholic tenets 
the council members acting individually claimed their oaths of 
office required them to uphold the laws of the city and protections 
guaranteed by the constitution they argued that the congressional 
order to weaken the code was unconstitutional 
the council had been scheduled to modify the human rights code at 
its tuesday night meeting 
council chairman david clarke said at the tuesday night meeting 
we hope the congress will recognize the dignity of the council as 
a legislative body we want to respect and work with the congress 
but theres a point beyond which we wont go 
during a friday hearing assistant us attorney curtis hall said 
congress ultimate authority over the district government allowed it 
to force changes in city law 
the judge however rejected that argument 
that authority is not limitless lamberth said congress 
may at any time exercise its authority as the legislature but that 
exercise of authority must be constitutional 
armstrong proposed the amendment after a dispute between gay 
student groups and georgetown university the dc court of appeals 
ruled that georgetown need not officially recognize the groups but 
must grant them the tangible benefits of recognition including 
student activity funds 
the university complied saying it was satisfied with the ruling 
officials have said the university intends to follow the local law 
despite armstrongs efforts

an article accusing chinese of being lazy is 
causing a furor in the staterun press sparking one paper to launch 
its own attack on the work habits of onequarter of mankind 
our offices have turned into free tea houses for tea tasting 
newspaper reading and gossip went the editorial in the workers 
daily on tuesday our workshops have become clubs for poker 
chess reading and sweater knitting 
another paper economic information has twice in the last week 
printed batches of readers letters about the article 
our system needs radical surgery if we are going to eradicate 
this old disorder and dispose of this chronic disease wrote one 
reader 
we must sweep away the old system that encourages this laziness 
and push reform to its limits wrote another 
the article that started the ruckus was first published in 
september in a singapore newspaper and has since appeared in several 
chinese publications 
it tells the story that in some japanese companies bosses warn 
workers exhibiting slothful tendenices do not study the chinese 
we have no choice but to admit the article says that 
chinese are the lazy bones of east asia 
chinese store attendants ignore customers its workers read kung 
fu novels on the job and its public officials spend the whole day 
blowing the ox a chinese expression for chatting the article 
says 
to cure laziness it says we must push reform 
china is in the midst of reforms that aim to enliven its 
oncestagnant staterun economy and make it more responsive to the 
market 
one of the biggest problems the country faces in raising 
productivity is that its workers have become accustomed to the 
iron rice bowl the decadesold system of lifetime employment 
under that system workers are paid the same no matter how hard 
they labor and individual enterprise is looked upon as rocking the 
boat in addition most college graduates are assigned jobs sapping 
their enthusiasm for work 
today many chinese complain that the countrys biggest problem 
is not its population of more than 1 billion but the fact that 
talent and hard work are not rewarded by society or the state 
it happens in almost every work unit said the workers daily 
editorial the young worker starts working actively but bit by bit 
he learns to work like everybody else 
the government says it wants to solve this problem and has taken 
halting steps to smash the iron rice bowl and allow more chinese 
to choose their own jobs workers also are regularly urged to 
increase their productivity 
but it remains to be seen how much government efforts will change 
the state of labor if they are not accompanied by a fundamental 
change in the way society views hard work 
in its editorial the workers daily hinted at the necessity for 
such a change although it did not say how such a change could be 
effected 
our fundamental problem is that this society lacks a mechanism 
to encourage people to succeed it said chinese are not 
inherently lazy but the environment has made them lazy 
chinese people have for years thought of themselves as diligent 
and brave the paper said but those adjectives no longer apply 
only when we build a mechanism that will encourage the 
people to reach for their goals the editorial said will we 
again be worthy of calling ourselves diligent and brave 
and then maybe it said japanese bosses might even tell their 
lazy workers you should study the chinese

up to that point it was the largest audience that had ever 
listened to a human voice lovell who served as command module

country lovell 60 recalled at the museum of science and 
industry the spacecrafts command module is on loan there from the 
national air and space museum in washington 
bobby kennedy was assassinated martin luther king the 
vietnam war was going on the democratic convention in chicago

project or an achievement that everybody could look up to 
borman 60 agreed saying the flight that preceded the apollo 11

businesses are increasingly setting up shop 
in funeral parlors in an undertaking that gives new life to the 
structures 
attorney don harmening who has an office on the first floor of a 
19thcentury home that for 54 years was the boland mortuary said 
its more relaxing for me and my clients 
he and others are moving into majestic peoria homes that were 
funeral parlors in the early 1900s in former residential 
neighborhoods that have since been swallowed by the expanding 
downtown business district 
the large 1870era structure that includes harmenings office 
easily accommodates several businesses including an insurance 
company and a secretarial service 
harmening has 14foot ceilings a marbletopped fireplace and 
carved mahogany around him he said its much easier to relax there 
than in the space he rented in a modern office tower 
i got a lot more room for the money the attorney said 
the spaciousness and graciousness of this environment is just 
right for inspiring the kind of work we do said marjorie klise 
president of a video business that operates out of another onetime 
funeral parlor 
a couple blocks away is the former wright amp salmon mortuary 
which now houses the peoria community correctional center including

i am both proud and happy to meet with you today here in geneva 
after an arbitrary american decision barred me from going to you 
there 
i extend deep gratitude to all nations forces and international 
organizations and personalities who backed our people and supported 
its national rights i also thank the western european nations 
and japan for their latest stands toward our people and i invite 
them to take further steps to positively evolve their resolutions in 
order to open the way for peace and a just settlement in our region 
the middle east 
we set out in the palestine liberation organization to look for 
realistic and attainable formulas that would settle the issue on the 
basis of possible rather than absolute justice while securing the 
rights of our people to freedom sovereignty and independence 
ensuring for everyone peace security and stability and sparing 
palestine and the middle east wars and battles that have been going 
on for 40 years 
israels response to all this has been the escalation of its 
settlement and annexation schemes the fanning of the flames of 
conflict with more destruction devastation and bloodshed and the 
expansion of the confrontation fronts to include brotherly lebanon 
which was invaded by the ocupation troops in 1982 an invasion 
punctuated with slaughters and massacres perpetrated against the 
lebanese and palestinian peoples including the sabra and chatilla 
massacres 
it is painful and regrettable that the american government alone 
should continue to back these aggressive and expansionist schemes as 
well as israels continued occupation of palestinian and arab 
territories its crimes and its ironfist policy against our 
children and women 
it is painful and regrettable too that the american government 
should continue refusing to recognize the right of 6 million 
palestinians to selfdetermination a right which is sacred to the 
american people and other peoples on this planet 
our people does not want a right which is not its own or which 
has not been vested in it by international legitimacy and 
international law it does not seek its freedom at the expense of 
anyone elses freedom nor does it want a destiny which negates the 
destiny of another people our people refuses to be better or worse 
than any other people our people wants to be the equal of all other 
peoples with the same rights and obligations 
while we greatly appreciate the free american voices that have 
explained and supported our position and resolutions we note that 
the us administration remains uncommitted to evenhandedness in 
its dealings with the parties to the conflict it continues to 
demand from us alone the acceptance of position which cannot be 
determined prior to negotiations and dialogue within the framework 
of the international conference 
it the palestine national council has also reaffirmed its 
rejection of terrorism in all its forms including state terrorism 
emphasizing its commitment to its past resolutions in this regard 
and to the resolution of the arab summit in algiers in 1988 and to 
un resolutions 42159 of 1987 and 6140 of 1985 and to what was 
stated on this subject in the cairo declaration of 7 november 1985 
this position mr president is clear and free of all ambiguity 
and yet i as chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
hereby once more declare that i condemn terrorism in all its forms 
and at the same time salute those sitting before me in this hall 
who in the days when they fought to free their countries from the 
yoke of colonialism were accused of terrorism by their oppressors 
and who today are the faithful leaders of their peoples stalwart 
champions of the values of justice and freedom 
the united nations bears a historic extraordinary responsibility 
toward our people and their rights more than 40 years ago the 
united nations in its resolution 181 decided on the establishment 
of two states in palestine one palestinian arab and the other 
jewish despite the historic wrong that was done to our people it 
is our view today that the said resolution continues to meet the 
requirements of international legitimacy which guarantee the 
palestinian arab peoples right to sovereignty and national 
independence 
in my capacity as chairman of the plo executive committee 
presently assuming the functions of the provisional government of 
the state of palestine i therefore present the following 
palestinian peace initiative 
first that a serious effort be made to convene under the 
supervision of the secretarygeneral of the united nations the 
preparatory committee of the international conference for peace in 
the middle east in accordance with the initiative of president 
gorbachev and president mitterrand which president mitterrand 
presented to your assembly toward the end of last september and 
which was supported by many states to pave the way for the 
convening of the international conference which commands universal 
support except from the government of israel 
second in view of our belief in international legitimacy and the 
vital role of the united nations that actions be undertaken to 
place our occupied palestinian land under temporary united nations 
supervision and that international forces be deployed there to 
protect our people and at the same time to supervise the 
withdrawal of the israeli forces from our country 
third the plo will seek a comprehensive settlement among the 
parties concerned in the arabisraeli conflict including the state 
of palestine israel and other neighbors within the framework of 
the international conference for peace in the middle east on the 
basis of resolutions 242 and 338 and so as to guarantee equality and 
the balance of interests especially our peoples rights in freedom 
national independence and respect the right to exist in peace and 
security for all 
if these principles are endorsed at the international conference 
we will have come a long way toward a just settlement and this will 
enable us to reach agreement on all security and peace arrangements 
i come to you in the name of my people offering my hand so that 
we can make true peace peace based on justice 
i ask the leaders of israel to come here under the sponsorship of 
the united nations so that together we can forge that peace 
and here i would address myself specifically to the israeli 
people in all their parties and forces and especially to the 
advocates of democracy and peace among them i say to them come let 
us make peace cast away fear and intimidation leave behind the 
specter of the wars that have raged continuously for the past 40 
years

from his wheelchair john moran is 
reaching around the globe to help victims of the armenian earthquake 
moran a disabled vietnam veteran is one of few dozen ham radio 
operators across the united states who are relaying information 
between survivors in the soviet union and worried american relatives 
with telephone lines either down or jammed with calls ham radio 
has become the fastest and most reliable way to reach people in the 
cities of leninakan spitak and kirovakan where a dec 7 earthquake 
killed at least 55000 people and injured 13000 
right now ham radio is the only way to actually make contact 
with the stricken areas and have someone find out for you whether 
your relatives are ok said dikran m kaligian executive director 
of the armenian national committee based in the boston suburb of 
watertown 
fueled by strong coffee and unfiltered cigarettes the 
53yearold moran is spending 20hour days in his wheelchair at a 
desk piled 3 feet high with electronic equipment 
though a paraplegic he has full use of his arms and seems to be 
in constant motion twirling dials pecking at a computer keyboard 
answering the telephone and speaking into his prized vintage1953 
microphone with the calm authoritative voice of a former air force 
officer 
since friday moran has left his post for only three to four 
hours of sleep a night 
ive got about two more days before i crash he said tuesday 
afternoon then somebody else will have to take over 
from a 70foot antenna atop his house in this workingclass 
community north of boston moran beams a highfrequency 1000watt 
signal to the soviet union and completes a chain of technology and 
sympathy that stretches a third of the way around the globe 
at one end of the chain are armenianamerican families who have 
given the names and addresses of hundreds of relatives to the 
armenian relief society of north america a 78yearold organization 
also based in watertown 
the society has passed the names on to the ham operators who are 
contacting colleagues throughout the soviet union in search of 
information 
for most of the past week for example moran has been in nearly 
constant contact with viktor goncharsky a ham operator in the 
ukrainian city of lvov who speaks english well and has a powerful 
transmitter 
goncharsky in turn has been in touch with ham operators in 
armenia and they have been gathering information in person by 
telephone or with handheld radios used by rescue workers 
so far the news received here has mostly been good 
it was a great relief said john gulbankian 21 of 
southboro who learned sunday via the ham network that his 
23yearold sister carolyn was unharmed she sent us a telegram 
to say she was ok but we didnt get it for two days and we were 
really worried 
while no deaths have yet been reported through the network it 
probably will not be long before we come to that said john 
megerdichian of the relief society 
its going to be a sad situation but i think were going to 
have to tell the relatives either way good news or bad 
moran is no stranger to disaster relief efforts in more than 30 
years as a ham operator he said he has participated in several 
similar efforts including last summers jamaican hurricane and the 
1985 mexico city earthquake 
since a spinal injury from mortar fire in vietnam gradually 
worsened and left him in a wheelchair in 1977 he said he has spent 
most of his time either fighting for the rights of the handicapped 
or talking on the radio frequencies set aside by the federal 
communications commission for amateur or ham operators 
i personally never realized it until i got on the boat myself 
but there are a lot of people out there who are isolated at home 
and ham radio gives them a way to reach out to people around the 
world he said a disaster like this is sad but it gives you 
the chance to show that americans care

maines largest city beat its namesake in 
oregon in a fundraising contest and snagged the prize of 100 pounds 
of salmon 
the united way of greater portland and the oregan united way 
sought to see which agency could increase its fundraising this year 
over 1987 at stake were 100 pounds of maine lobsters and 100 pounds 
of salmon 
the oregon agency raised 193 million or 75 percent more than 
last year but that fell short of the maine agencys total which 
at 54 million was 12 percent more than in 1987 
the victory gave mayor cheryl a leeman bragging rights the 
contest she said proved once and for all that portland maine 
was established first has the best weather the best scenery the 
best fishing the best economy the best businesses and the best 
united way volunteers 
a suggestion that the losing portland would have to give up its 
name prompted a denial from robert e martin of the oregon united 
way 
that was just something that some reporters out here thought 
up said martin who moved from portland maine to oregon three 
years ago and extended the challenge last summer

residents are tying white ribbons 
around town to solemnly remember a tornado that killed six people a 
year ago today and caused 35 million in damage but strengthened the 
communitys ties to each other 
i think the greatest thing that has arisen from the tornado is 
something that cant be measured said mayor keith m ingram 
the attitude and spirit of this community now is one that believes 
in itself it believes it can overcome anything that is put in its 
path 
barbara smiths twobedroom frame house was lifted from its 
foundation just before the tornado touched down around 10 pm the 
tornado destroyed 146 homes and 30 businesses and damaged or 
destroyed 200 apartments along a threemile path more than 200 
people were injured 
i heard the lords voice that night and he told me we would be 
ok said mrs smith and sure enough we have come back we made 
it through 
the estimated 35 million in damage was exacerbated two weeks 
later by heavy rains that flooded parts of west memphis which is 
across the mississippi river about 10 miles west of memphis tenn 
and just after new years the town was covered with a foot of snow 
residents in the city of 28000 are recalling the death and 
destruction this week by adorning trees and mailboxes with white 
ribbon some of it provided by the mayors office 
mrs smith 26 said the storm has left a deeper mark 
we pulled together she said monday we all helped each 
other we found love for our neighbors 
one of her neighbors diane johnson relaxed this week with her 
two young children in a remodeled living room before the storm it 
was a bedroom 
that night i grabbed my childs mattress and put it over us in 
the hall i still know right where that mattress is a big tree fell 
right on the bed where we had been sleeping mrs johnson said 
thank god we moved quickly 
the year of rebuilding has kept a 10member city design and 
review commission busy ingram said the panel was established a few 
months before the storm to devise longterm plans for uniformity of 
new buildings 
the idea was that it would be a very slow evolutionary pace 
he said needless to say when the tornado came through it 
accelerated that evolution

authorities say they are investigating 
reports a fire in a state prison that killed 20 inmates in an 
overcrowded dormitory was sparked by paint thinner thrown during a 
fight 
six prisoners were injured three seriously in the blaze tuesday 
at the nuevo leon state penitentiary in monterrey the state capital 
and a northeastern industrial city of nearly 2 million residents 
raul garza state communications director said a preliminary 
investigation indicated the fire was an accident 
garza said it appeared a lighted candle ignited a curtain around 
an altar to the virgin of guadalupe patron saint of this 
predominantly roman catholic nation the blaze spread he said 
but authorities were looking into reports a prisoner threw paint 
thinner during a fight inside the ward and another inmate ignited 
the thinner to start the fire garza said 
there were an extraordinary amount of candles in the ward 
because we just celebrated the virgin of guadalupe festival he 
said 
prisoners were allowed to set up small altars near their beds on 
the annual holiday celebrated monday he said 
garza said 116 prisoners were housed in the ward designed for 70 
inmates when the fire broke out at 300 am tuesday 
the mattresses also caught fire and there was a lot of smoke 
the mattresses were made of a material that doesnt burn easily but 
unfortunately it creates a lot of toxic smoke garza said 
some of the prisoners lost consciousness and were consumed by 
flames he said 
alma payton prison personnel director said in an interview that 
it was unavoidable that prisoners smuggled paint thinner and 
glue into the wards to use as inhalants

the cast of the struggling broadway play 
checkmates got some dramatic news the comedy was bankrolled in 
part by an accused drug trafficker serving 28 years to life for 
attempted murder 
michael harris a producer of the play at new yorks 46th street 
theater is an inmate at californias san quentin prison his 
lawyer roger rosen confirmed 
the plays manager roy somlyo said tuesday he was shocked at 
the news and had removed harris name from the marquee 
its quite unnerving to us all somlyo said in a telephone 
interview before going to break the news to the cast 
harris 26 who with a partner put up half the 770000 it cost 
to take the show to broadway was indicted dec 6 in a federal case 
said to have cracked a multimilliondollar international cocaine 
ring 
he is charged with conspiracy and possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute for being part of an organization that 
stretched from colombia to detroit and los angeles the us 
attorneys office here said 
harris and his partner hayward collins helped finance the play 
first in los angeles and then on broadway through their los 
angelesbased y not productions somlyo said 
harris shared the financiers role with one of the biggest names 
in theater james nederlander whose organization owns more live 
theaters than any other in the country was a 5050 partner with y 
not when checkmates opened 
nederlander bowed out in september under a contract provision 
that allowed him to abandon his investment if returns didnt justify 
further participation somlyo said 
until los angeles television station kcbs reported on harris 
background monday night those involved with the play thought of him 
as just what the playbill says a louisiana native who has business 
interests in los angeles 
james lester the target of the murder attempt for which harris 
was convicted said harris accused him of stealing money from his 
drug operation 
he threw me out of the car and asked me did i do it lester 
said i said no he pushed me out and told me to run i said 
for what im a guy so why run he pointed a gun at me told me 
he was sorry i said for what if you gotta do it you gotta do 
it and he shot me twice and the gun jammed 
lester said harris left him for dead but he recovered and 
testified at the trial harris began serving his sentence in the 
spring 
y nots lawyer whose name coincidentally is michael p harris 
says there was no sign the money to finance the play came from 
illegitimate sources 
he said he was in real estate and limousines and i know he was 
buying some hair salons recounted the attorney who met the other 
harris before he was incarcerated he seemed like a legitimate 
business guy 
the money always was in the form of a check he said if 
drug money deals in greenbacks i didnt see any of them 
rosen producer harris lawyer declined to discuss his clients 
role in the play or possible sources of income 
there was no telephone listing for collins 
the show meanwhile goes on despite mostly negative reviews and 
a somewhat disappointing turnout 
the comedy which opened aug 4 contrasts the lives of an 
affluent young black couple marsha jackson and denzel washington 
who starred in the movies soldiers story and cry freedom 
with an older more traditional black couple played by veterans ruby 
dee and paul winfield 
ticket sales bring in enough to cover expenses said somlyo who 
predicted wordofmouth endorsements would broaden the audience to 
include more of the white mainstream theater crowd 
harris was indicted along with 12 others in the drug trafficking 
case 
the man investigators described as tall mike who allegedly 
received 100kilo quantities of cocaine and caused their 
distribution and storage had seemed the perfect backer to the 
manager of checkmates 
here i was sending him memos and letters somlyo said i 
sort of feel like ive been cheated by not being informed

her home destroyed by the armenian 
earthquake unara alexanyan has been living in a beatup jacket 
sleeping on rubblestrewn streets and keeping warming around 
bonfires 
i dont have anything no furniture nothing she said above 
the bustle of families unloading bundles of their sole belongings at 
the leninakan airport 
mrs alexanyan was en route to an unknown destination as part of 
the governments relocation efforts for the estimated 500000 people 
left homeless by the dec 7 quake 
she said a sister and three grandchildren were missing and among 
the dead 
as the last survivors are being pulled from the wreckage of 
apartment buildings schools and factories the focus is turning to 
rebuilding the lives of people who like mrs alexanyan lost 
everything 
leninakans streets were jammed last weekend with rescue 
vehicles trucks and buses and private cars filled with people 
fleeing for other parts of the republic 
the dislocation aggravates an already serious refugee problem in 
armenia more than 180000 people fled to armenia from adjoining 
azerbaijan in the three weeks before the tremor after at least 31 
people were killed in ethnic violence 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov said monday that too many cars 
were impeding the rescue effort and that the army had been ordered 
to keep nonessential vehicles off tge roads into leninakan and 
nearby spitak which was nearly totally destroyed 
the tass news agency reported tuesday that 7300 people mostly 
women and children were sent to sanitariums vacation camps and 
other places in armenia and elsewhere in the southern soviet union 
soviet officials say 50000 people can be accommodated in such 
places and that evacuees will be cared for free of charge 
ryzhkov told a news conference the effort to move the homeless 
out of damaged cities started slowly because no one wanted to leave 
without knowing what happened to missing relatives 
in the first three days we couldnt do anything to evacuate 
people we tried to tell people you have to take the children out 
you have to take the women and old people out he said the 
first three days no one would listen they still were in a state of 
shock every family lost somebody 
now he said people have started asking to be evacuated or for 
tents at least throughout there has been enough food for the 
homeless and even those camped around bonfires in leninakan all had 
food with them he reported 
many huddled and waited around bonfires made of cardboard and 
debris anna asatyan sat at a fire outside her home the 
130yearold singlestory structure still stood but she was afraid 
to go back inside 
asked what she was going to do she said we are waiting 
whatever the authorities say 
ryzhkov has pledged the devastated cities will be rebuilt in two 
years despite the countrys economic difficulties

bombs set by suspected antigovernment 
militants ripped open a wall of a suburban prison enabling more 
than 200 convicts to escape authorities said today two prisoners 
were killed by guards 
tuesday nights prison break was the second in as many weeks and 
the largest ever at welikade prison which houses about 1500 
convicts 
on dec 4 suspected sinhalese extremists dressed in army 
uniforms overpowered guards at a prison in central sri lanka and 
freed six colleagues 
a military spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules said tuesday nights escape apparently was engineered by the 
peoples liberation front an extremist sinhalese group trying to 
topple the government and disrupt next mondays presidential 
elections 
heavily armed troops searched passenger buses and vehicles 
entering the capital today police imposed an indefinite curfew in 
northern neighborhoods near the prison and went house to house 
searching for the escapees 
the military spokesman said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threw 
small bombs at the south wall of the prison the explosions also 
distracted guards in other sections of the facility allowing other 
inmates to scale the walls and escape they said 
it was a wellorganized operation preplanned and possibly 
done with inside connivance the official said 
guards opened fire killing at least two inmates the spokesman 
said 
he said at least 220 prisoners escaped in six vehicles later 
they raided a laundry about a halfmile from the prison and switched 
their prison uniforms for civilian clothes the official said 
at least 15 escapees were caught early today about seven miles 
from the prison he said 
the spokesman said authorities believed other convicts reached 
the town of kelaniya five miles north of colombo and escaped by 
boats down the kelani river 
the front which staged an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1971 
opposes the governments efforts to end the 5year insurgency by 
tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in the north and 
east of this indian ocean nation 
the sinhalese who are predominantly buddhist make up 75 percent 
of the islands 16 million people and control the government and the 
military 
the tamils who are hindu and account for 18 percent of the 
population claim they are denied jobs and education by the 
sinhalese

a jewish businessman interested in ptls 
real estate agreed to pay 65 million for the assets of the 
scandalplagued ministry but refused to say if he would allow its 
evangelical operations to continue 
the head of heritage ministries ptls religious successor 
however said the deal means merely a change in landlords and 
purchaser stephen mernick told him he was sensitive to the 
religious operation 
mernick a nonpracticing orthodox rabbi from toronto bought the 
assets tuesday for 10 million less than the value placed on it by 
us banktruptcy judge rufus reynolds and only a little more than 
half of what he offered a month ago 
reynolds approved the cash sale after polling major creditors at 
a hearing most said it was the best deal they would get for what 
once had been a 160 million empire 
as far as im concerned the jig is over im approving the 
sale the judge said 
mernick a 34yearold real estate magnate on monday bid 3625 
million at heritage usa headquarters near fort mill one week after 
ptl founder jim bakker and three former associates were indicted on 
fraud and conspiracy charges by a federal grand jury in north 
carolina 
mernick increased his bid to 65 million after meeting tuesday 
with attorneys for the ministry and creditors 
were excited mernick told reporters outside the courthouse 
after reynolds decision were very excited and happy we won we 
look forward to being here 
the heritage usa theme park and accompanying satellite television 
operation were left behind by bakker in march 1987 after he admitted 
he had a sexual liaison with church secretary jessica hahn and had 
her paid to keep quiet about it 
mernick said he would consider keeping heritage usa operating as 
a christian park however he would not answer questions about 
whether heritage ministries would be able to continue leasing the 
television ministry and church at fort mill 
we are in the middle of ongoing discussions with heritage 
ministries mernick said adding that he would outline plans within 
two weeks the assets purchased include the satellite network 
carried on more than 800 cable systems 1700 undeveloped acres in 
northern york county two 500room hotels one unfinished and a 
water park 
mernick said in october that he was interested in ptl purely as 
a real estate deal 
sources close to mernick said he intends to hold onto the 
undeveloped land for up to 10 years as its value rises and to come 
up with a plan for the hotels and tv network the charlotte nc 
observer reported today 
the sources told the newspaper mernick is prepared to absorb 12 
million in operating losses on ptl in the first year alone 
sam johnson president of the nonprofit heritage ministries and 
pastor of the church said mernick told him he was sensitive to 
the religious operation johnson said heritage ministries still 
wants to buy heritage usa or at least the church hotel television 
network and studios 
what weve done is switch landlords our future depends on 
negotiations with the new landlord he said 
the ministry filed for reorganization under bankruptcy laws in 
june 1987 and attempts to sell it had included two auctions before 
tuesday 
had no acceptable bid been submitted ptl would have been broken 
up and sold trustee mc red benton said 
after the fiasco we had yesterday in getting people to bid 
this is a relief benton said 
in an aug 18 appraisal arthur little amp co of atlanta said 
ptls assets would be worth 76 million to 85 million if sold 
piecemeal reynolds said the property is worth 75 million 
a month ago mernick offered 115 million 50 million in cash 
but reynolds rejected the bid saying there were inadequate 
assurances that mernick would pay the remaining 65 million 
the purchase price would pay in full the 40 million in claims of 
secured creditors those whose claims are secured by collateral such 
as land or buildings it would also pay 5 million in administrative 
costs 
the rest would be divided among three groups of creditors the 
internal revenue service which is claiming about 60 million in 
taxes the lifetime partners or major ptl contributors who are 
seeking at least 20 million and unsecured creditors whose claims 
total 10 million to 13 million 
bidders this week included johnson michael karas president of 
first canadian development co of toronto and cy bahakel a former 
north carolina state senator who owns 15 television and radio 
stations 
bakker who previously submitted a bid had no comment on the 
sale

the first fiveminute test for aids has been 
approved by the us government and authorities said it is 996 
percent accurate and offers the fastest results of any tests for the 
deadly disease 
the test was cleared tuesday by the us food and drug 
administration its maker worcesterbased cambridge bioscience 
said it should be on the market in a few weeks 
this technical advance should help make testing available to 
all who want to be tested fda commissioner frank e young said in 
washington it will also be particularly useful in remote areas of 
the world that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests 
the results of those earlier tests now the mainstay of aids 
screening frequently are not available for weeks 
gary buck chairman of cambridge bioscience said the new test 
called the recombigen hiv1 latex agglutination test should be 
useful anywhere that quick results are important 
the big boon is that its fast and it will be useful in third 
world countries and places where lab facilities might be less than 
ideal in order to screen large populations in a rapid simple way 
said dr paul skolnik a virologist at new england medical center 
the test is 996 percent accurate buck said but the company 
recommends that as with the current screening test called the 
enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or elisa blood samples that are 
positive for the aids virus be confirmed by a timeconsuming backup 
test called the western blot 
the speed of the recombigen means those who are free of the virus 
are likely to be given the good news immediately buck said but 
those who are probably infected will be told further testing is 
necessary 
like other aids tests this one checks for aids infection by 
spotting antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
which causes aids 
all of the present elisa tests require under the best of 
circumstances three to five hours buck said this test 
requires three to five minutes 
unlike the elisa which requires labs and technicians the new 
test can be given under crude conditions where even refrigeration is 
lacking experts believe this should make the test useful in places 
like africa where acquired immune deficiency syndrome is widespread 
and where blood is frequently not screened before transfusions 
teena lerner an analyst at shearson lehman hutton in new york 
said the test also may be given in many settings in the united 
states such as venereal disease clinics 
in a lot of the voluntary testing centers there is a huge 
proportion of people who dont come back to find the answer she 
said the ones who are most likely to be positive are the ones who 
are most likely to chicken out 
other potential uses include testing trauma patients in emergency 
rooms and checking organ donors before transplants 
buck predicted the test will account for 10 percent to 15 percent 
of all aids testing during its second year on the market it will be 
sold to health care professionals for 10 per test he said 
although other companies are working on quick aids tests lerner 
said she believes it will be at least a year before cambridge 
biosciences nearest competitor wins approval 
the new test is based on a portion of the protein that makes up 
the outer jacket of the aids virus this protein which is made 
through genetic engineering is coated onto tiny white latex beads 
aids antibodies in blood are attracted to the protein and when they 
come together the latex beads form clumps 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

the captain of an indian merchant ship struck by 
a navy missile said he was told by the us navy his vessel was out 
of a restricted training area before it was accidentally hit 
killing a crewman 
i was being guided by the missile facility said capt pm 
mirchandani who spoke with reporters tuesday after bringing the 
550foot jag vivek into port here for repairs 
i heard a noise and saw splinters flying out onto the deck 
the 34yearold captain said of mondays incident which occurred 
when his ship was about 80 miles northnorthwest of the island of 
kauai 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr gary shrout said mirchandanis 
contention that his ship was being guided by navy controllers at the 
pacific missile range was under investigation 
everybody has a little tiny piece of the puzzle and its going 
to take a while to put all these pieces together and figure out just 
what happened shrout said at news conference at pearl harbor 
attorney leondard alcantara representing the jag viveks owners 
said controllers at the missile range radioed the ship at about 8 
am monday that it was entering a restricted area 
the navy gave them a course to steer around it they steered on 
that course for approximately two to three hours and were then told 
they were clear of the missile range and 40 minutes later they were 
struck by a missile said alcantara 
the 12footlong 1000pound unarmed harpoon missile hit the 
ship from the stern at about noon tearing through the upper level 
of the pilot house and emerging with sufficient force to put a large 
dent in one of the ships cranes before falling into the sea 
the radio officer kt joseph a 36yearold indian citizen was 
wounded by shrapnel and died after being carried to the bridge 
alcantara said 
an fa18 attack fighter from the aircraft carrier uss 
constellation fired the missile at a derelict ship being used for 
target practice but its infrared guidance system later locked onto 
the jag vivek and it veered in that direction shrout said 
at the time the jet was 45 miles from the merchant ship well 
out of visual range he said 
although the navy has not accepted responsibility for the 
accident pending its investigation the commander of the pearl 
harbor naval base rear adm stephen chadwick went aboard the jag 
vivek as it approached honolulu to express condolences to the 
captain for the loss of his crewman shrout said 
the navy also has offered any assistance it can provide to the 
merchant ship and its crew he said 
the jag vivek was expected to remain in honolulu for a few days 
to repair the demolished radio room before resuming its voyage to 
bombay with 25600 tons of wheat it picked up at vancouver british 
columbia officials said 
the indian government declined comment on the accident

film critics 10best lists said garth drabinsky chairman of the

when it opened in august it was denounced by some conservative 
christians as being blasphemous several theaters showing the film 
were vandalized and some us theater chains refused to show it

but weve never chosen to back down in matters that we believe 
firmly are exemplary in the spirit of an enlightened democratic

a federal agency says a property once owned by 
beatrice foods co is highly contaminated and lawyers for families 
seeking redress for six cancer deaths say the report could help them 
reopen a lawsuit against the food giant 
the environmental protection agency report released tuesday 
says the former beatrice property contains the most contaminated 
soil of any site near two wells in suburban woburn eight families 
claim polluted water from the wells caused the deaths 
jan schlichtmann a lawyer representing the families said he 
would attempt to introduce the report as evidence in hearings that 
begin today in us district court in boston 
the hearings in the controversial 6yearold case are to 
determine whether beatrice intentionally concealed evidence during a 
1986 trial in which it was cleared of liability for the pollution 
schlichtmann claimed the report marked the first time the epa 
said the beatrice property polluted the two wells 
epa officials however said the report merely summarized 
existing information and didnt blame any particular sites for 
causing the well pollution the report was based on surveys done in 
the past six months 
the material is not designed to bolster allegations of what 
conditions were like 20 years ago when the well contamination 
first occurred epa deputy regional administrator paul keough said 
all weve done is to do an investigation of soil and 
groundwater sampling as we begin to finalize a cleanup program for 
the area of the wells 
jerome facher a lawyer for beatrice reiterated the companys 
contention that pollution at its former site didnt contaminate the 
wells 
beatrice owned a tannery on a 15acre parcel of land from 1978 to 
1983 when it sold the tannery and property to the john j riley co 
the property contains the most extensive area of contaminated 
soil and the highest concentrations of contaminants anywhere within 
the wells site the report by the epas regional office in 
boston said 
among contaminants the epa has identified in the area are 
polychlorinated biphenyls arsenic mercury and cadmium 
the two wells were shut down in 1979 after several toxic 
contaminants were found they had supplied water since 1964 to a 
neighborhood in this city of 36000 about 12 miles north of boston 
the report said the beatrice property and five other nearby sites 
have contributed and are continuing to contribute to the 
groundwater contamination in the aquifer supplying water to the 
two wells 
it does not conclude which sites were responsible for 
contaminating the wells and said the sites currently pose no health 
risk 
a federal district court jury in july 1986 cleared beatrice of 
liability 
us district judge walter jay skinner last january denied the 
families a new trial after their attorney learned of a 1983 report 
that said dumping on the tannery property may have contributed to 
groundwater pollution near the wells 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals in boston last week 
ordered skinner to hold new hearings to determine whether defense 
lawyers knowingly and intentionally withheld the report from the 
families 
the original suit contended that four parties were responsible 
for the pollution beatrice riley wr grace co and unifirst a 
uniform supply company unifirst settled before the trial and wr 
grace settled for a reported 8 million halfway through the trial

an awardwinning convict journalist who 
gave authorities information about louisianas pardonselling 
scandal received a favorable clemency recommendation from the state 
pardon board 
the board recommended tuesday that billy wayne sinclairs life 
sentence for a 1965 murder be reduced to 75 years in prison with 
parole eligibility after 25 years sinclair who has served 23 
years could win his freedom in about two years if gov buddy roemer 
goes along with the boards recommendation 
sinclair 43 a former editor of the inmate news magazine the 
angolite at the louisiana state penitentiary originally was 
sentenced to die for the slaying of james c bodden a baton rouge 
convenience store clerk shot after a bungled robbery 
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1972 after the 
us supreme court struck down the states capital punishment law 
two years ago sinclair aided an investigation that led to the 
conviction and imprisonment of former pardon board chairman howard 
marsellus jr 
after being approached by a corrections official who sought 
15000 in return for a pardon sinclair went to federal authorities 
the clemency request was opposed by the east baton rouge parish 
prosecutor and members of boddens family 
i dont think hes rehabilitated enough to be out on the 
street said sadie bodden delee boddens widow 
sinclair is the second editor of the prison magazine to come up 
for clemency this month last week the governor rejected a pardon 
board recommendation for wilbert rideau another killer who is still 
editor at the angola prison 
sinclairs wife jodie said the pardon boards decision 
righted a great wrong since other convicts who gave information 
to authorities about the pardonselling scandal had been freed 
i am so deeply grateful to the board for the forgiveness and 
mercy they have shown she said 
sinclair has been before the pardon board five times and received 
four favorable clemency recommendations but has been unable to 
receive approval from the governors office

the israeli army is giving top priority to 
training its troops to withstand nerve and mustard gas attacks 
fearing arab enemies could unleash such weaponry at any time senior 
military commanders say 
the commanders briefed reporters tuesday at this base in southern 
israel during combat drills in which soldiers staged gun and tank 
battles using live ammunition while wearing their new heavy 
chemicalrepellent gear 
all soldiers have in the past year been issued the charcoallined 
uniforms gas masks poison detection tape rubber gloves and boots 
they take it with them in their kitbags whether they are assigned 
to combat duty in lebanon or to police the occupied territories 
said lt col s an organizer of the antichemical warfare 
campaign under israeli press regulations commanding officers may 
only be identified by the first letter of their first or last names 
we are taking the threat of chemical war very seriously 
especially after the iraniraq war in which such weapons were 
widely used lt col s said 
drills such as one in which two dozen troops stormed a mock 
village of cement shacks nicknamed chicago are taking up at least a 
quarter of the average soldiers training time this year some 
soldiers are ordered to wear the gear in almost every exercise the 
army conducts the officers said 
the aim is to train the soldiers to protect themselves and fight 
despite a rain of poisonous gas they said 
the gear is so uncomfortable that some of it such as the gloves 
are not worn during drills to avoid shooting accidents some 
officers said they said that in some cases commanders have to 
prompt soldiers to put on their masks by hurling tear gas cannisters 
near them 
israels is concerned that syria iran and iraq have the 
capabilities of carrying out chemical attacks said lt col y 
another senior commander at the base 
we know that arab countries are investing a great deal in 
creating chemical weapons lt col y said we dont ask 
questions we just prepare 
he said the army plans to distribute gas masks to civilians in 
two israeli towns later this month as part of a civil defense drill 
the officers also showed reporters an array of equipment to 
handle a chemical attack including us and israelimade portable 
gas detection machines that look like automobile batteries and a 
pocket calculator programmed to detect poisonous fumes 
also displayed were antidotes to chemical contamination such as 
white pills that look like aspirin which are taken when there is 
advance warning of an attack and atropine injections used after 
contamination

a dutch woman who was shot in the arm during a 
bloody protest in the tibetan capital of lhasa and had her passport 
confiscated is being allowed to leave the volatile region a dutch 
diplomat said today 
chinese authorities returned christa meindersmas passport today 
two days after confiscating it said willem de bruin adminstrative 
and consular attache at the dutch embassy 
he said he did not know when ms meindersma would leave lhasa 
but her original intention had been to fly to hong kong on thursday 
dutch officials had been trying without success to get 
information on ms meindersmas condition since she was shot during 
a nationalist demonstration in lhasas central square on saturday 
de bruin said the chinese foreign ministry finally responded to 
his queries today the chinese move came after the dutch foreign 
ministry in the hague urged china to return ms meindersmas 
passport 
de bruin said he did not know whether the chinese had returned 
passports to other foreigners who also had their travel documents 
seized at least four other western travelers had their passports 
confiscated said ron schwartz a sociology professor from the

the vatican has hosted russian orthodox 
clergymen and offered them assistance in hopes of capitalizing on 
glasnost to improve the lot of roman catholics in the soviet 
union a vatican official says 
in the past month three russian orthodox officials have visited 
the vatican and met with pope john paul ii two roman catholic 
church leaders from poland also visited the soviet union recently 
and the vatican newspaper devoted two full pages to an effusive 
report by one of them on a changed attitude to religion by the 
soviet leadership 
the greater freedom the russian church receives could help the 
roman catholic minority profit from perestroika and glasnost 
said the vatican official using soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs terms for reforming society and greater openness 
therefore i have realistic hope not a fantasy that the 
situation of the roman catholic church will be substantially 
improved in the not distant future said the official who has 
firsthand knowledge of the recent contacts he spoke on condition 
his name not be used 
in june the vatican sent a top delegation to the soviet union to 
help the orthodox church celebrate the 1000 anniversary of the 
christianitys arrival in russia 
if the vatican gives its support to the celebrations it is 
worldwide support the official said in an interview monday 
starting in midnovember three russian orthodox prelates paid 
separate visits to the vatican archbishop pitirim of the moscow 
patriarchate saw the pope on dec 1 accompanied by an official of 
the soviet news agency tass 
according to the vatican official pitirim asked the vaticans 
help in supplying bibles while another churchman archbishop 
alexander of the zagorsk theological academy wanted to know how the 
vatican organizes its universities and academies 
another vatican official said such assistance in the past had 
been sporadic but that it has now been increased and put on a 
more formal basis 
the vaticans endorsement of the changed attitude was signaled by 
an article carried by losservatore romano the vatican daily 
newspaper by cardinal jozef glemp the roman catholic primate of 
poland 
glemp wrote that he found it comforting that soviet 
authorities were abandoning the stalinist policy of persecuting 
the church 
glemps trip was followed by a visit in early december by the 
secretary of the polish bishops conference bishop jerzy dabrowski 
the baltic states are the roman catholic strongholds in the 
soviet union at least 2 million of lithuanias 35 million people 
are roman catholics 
the senior vatican official made a distinction between roman 
catholics and ukrainian catholics of the eastern rite the ukrainian 
church was brutally suppressed by soviet dictator jozef stalin who 
ordered it absorbed into the russian orthodox church 
ukrainian clerics say an estimated 4 million ukrainian catholics 
operate an underground church that remains loyal to the pope 
the vatican official acknowledged the situation was more 
difficult for them because of historic antagonism between the 
orthodox and ukrainians 
the polish pontiff has often said he would like to visit the 
soviet union but only if he could visit his flock throughout the 
country 
last week italian premier ciriaco de mita said gorbachev will 
visit italy next year that could set the stage for a historic 
meeting between the pope and communist party leader and discussions 
about a possible papal visit 
the soviet ambassador to italy paid a rare call on the pope in 
july and last saturday john paul offered condolences to gorbachev 
for the deadly earthquake in armenia he also sent 100000 to the 
orthodox patriarch of armenia vasken i

hedda nussbaum testified she did not directly 
observe her former livein lover joel steinberg bruise their 
6yearold illegally adopted daughter but she assumed he had and 
lied to police to protect him 
during her seventh and final day of testimony in steinbergs 
murder trial nussbaum 46 testified tuesday that on the morning 
lisa steinberg was taken unconscious from their greenwich village 
apartment she told detectives a playmate had hit the child in the 
head a few days earlier 
she said she also told them lisa fell a lot while roller 
skating 
ms nussbaum admitted under crossexamination by steinbergs 
lawyer ira london that these statements were either wholly or 
partly lies she said she really believed the injuries were 
inflicted by steinberg although she had not seen him hit lisa the 
night the prosecution says the fatal blow was struck 
i was trying to create a cover story at the time for what joel 
had done to lisa she said 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is charged with 
beating lisa the night of nov 1 1987 causing her death three days 
later the death occurring in an affluent welleducated household 
shocked many and has become a nationwide symbol of abuse as a 
problem that cuts across social strata 
no testimony was scheduled today judge harold rothwax told 
defense lawyers he wants them to file papers by friday if they plan 
to request permission to submit an insanity defense london said 
they would 
as tuesday wound down assistant district attorney peter casolaro 
proceeded with redirect examination in what appeared to be an 
attempt to win back some of the sympathy ms nussbaum lost under 
londons quiet but painstaking questioning 
during his fifth and final day of crossexamining ms nussbaum 
london asked about what she told police were those statements 
true when you made them 
no ms nussbaum replied she lisa said that a kid had 
hit her a few days before and i she didnt fall a lot roller 
skating she was a good roller skater 
so that was a lie you told london asked 
that was a lie yes 
as for the blow from the playmate ms nussbaum said she told 
police the child had hit lisa hard although lisa had merely said 
the other child hit her 
london suggested that ms nussbaum was really trying to protect 
herself rather than steinberg 
well had you seen joel hit lisa on the head the defense 
lawyer asked 
no i had not seen that 
so who were you covering up for joel or you 
well any of the bruises that were on her body i was assuming 
came from joel 
and yet you admit now that you dont know if those bruises were 
a result of anything that joel did isnt that right 
i didnt directly observe him do it no 
london has suggested that ms nussbaum was perhaps as guilty as 
steinberg for failing to act for many hours as lisa lay comatose on 
the cold tiled floor of their bathroom

yasser arafats appeal to israel to join 
unsponsored talks fell far short of what is needed from the 
palestine liberation organization chairman to achieve peace us 
jewish leaders say 
its sad that after all the years of bloodshed all the hype 
and theatrics and yes even the recent hope of change arafat still 
could not bring himself to explicitly recognize israel and reject 
terrorism abraham h foxman national director of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith said tuesday 
arafat urged israel to join in talks under the aegis of the 
united nations to produce a settlement based on security for all 
nations of the region including israel and a palestinian state 
yasser arafats speech in geneva can only be described as 
bitterly disappointing said rabbi alexander m schindler 
president of the union of american hebrew congregations 
he failed to clarify the ambiguities of the algiers declaration 
and the hints he dropped in stockholm said schindler if 
anything his speech today was a retreat from his previous 
statements 
ira silverman executive vice president of the american jewish 
committee said there were some positive words in arafats 
address but he also called it disappointing 
we still wait for clearcut acceptance of israels right to 
exist and for unconditional rejection of terrorism silverman 
said let him match words with deeds 
yasser arafat had an opportunity to break with the past and 
launch a new initiative he blew it said morris abram chairman 
of the conference of presidents of major american jewish 
organizations

refused entry at five italian ports 89 
migrant vendors from north africa have sailed back to tunisia where 
they started their voyage a week ago 
the group of algerians senegalese and moroccans had sailed the 
mediterranean for more than a week aboard the ferry petrarca while 
italian port authorities refused them permission to disembark 
we cant let them disembark because they arent in compliance 
with italian immigration laws giuseppe torricelli director of 
border police in the sardinian port of cagliari was quoted as 
saying by the turin daily la stampa 
after a second rejection tuesday by authorities in cagliari the 
north africans boarded another ferry the carducci bound for this 
northwestern port city where they had also been refused entry last 
week 
frontier police here rejected the north africans a second time 
saying they didnt have work permits travel documents or means of 
supporting themselves 
the group which departed tunisia on dec 7 had also been 
rejected in genoa and at olbia and arbatax in sardinia its odyssey 
ended tuesday when the carducci left trapani for tunisia 
communist party senator francesco macis boarded the petrarca in 
cagliari to check on the condition of the passengers many of whom 
had received medical treatment during the week 
certainly the problem is delicate la stampa quoted macis as 
saying italy is not in a position to accept the growing number of 
immigrants 
in a recent study alberto sobrero of the institute for 
political economic and social studies estimated that between 70000 
and 100000 illegal immigrants enter italy each year

the discovery of thousands of artifacts 
dating to the gold rush represents the birthplace of chinatown 
said an archaeologist 
the find is the most significant discovery of chinese 
material in california since the wreck of a 16th century spanish 
galleon carrying ming dynastyera pottery was found at point reyes 
north of san francisco a few years ago clarence shangraw the chief 
currator of the citys asian art museum said tuesday 
the artifacts were found during the past two weeks during 
excavations of a site for a 20story bank and will be displayed at 
the asian art museum city law requires all construction sites to be 
evaluated for their archaeological value 
i am hoping that these things will really be able to add a 
tangible dimension to early chinese history in california said 
urban archaeologist allen pastron they will help tell us how they 
lived what they did and their relationship to other parts of the 
community 
pastron said the discovery of bottles pottery coins and even an 
opium pipe bowl indicate the site was a store operated by chinese 
merchants in 1850 and 1851 
the building is assumed to have burned or exploded in one of a 
halfdozen fires that devastated san francisco between 1849 and 
1851 collapsing onto itself 
what we have down here is a moment in time pastron said the 
store represents literally the birthplace of chinatown he said 
after the discovery of gold in california chinese came to san 
francisco then a tent city they called gum san or big city of 
the golden hill

federal authorities have told a management 
company to stop fining tenants of a lowincome housing project 25 
for sitting on their front porches 
the loitering ban imposed several months ago at the winter green 
apartments was aimed at reducing drug trafficking according to the 
property manager 
under the policy tenants who were fined three times for lounging 
on a porch could face eviction the fines were included in rent 
bills 
robert donovan housing management director of the us 
department of housing and urban development in hartford said 
tuesday that greater hartford realty management inc was advised 
last week that the charges were improper and that the company would 
have to reimburse tenants for any fines that were collected 
the porch is part of the unit they are renting and there should 
not be an additional fee for the use of it said donovan he said 
he believes the policy violates federal housing rules 
ricard weaverbey general manager of greater hartford realty 
management inc on tuesday said his company had no comment 
eric b allen who manages the 32building 160unit complex for 
greater hartford realty management claimed the policy worked 
we dont have the problems we used to have he said the 
dope dealers are standing by waiting for us to move out 
an employee of a community group working with winter green 
tenants said a few people were fined under the policy but he didnt 
know how many 
the worker who spoke on condition of anonymity said he didnt 
think the property manager was still fining tenants but that some 
had outstanding rent bills because their rents werent accepted 
without payments for the fines 
a meeting between tenants and property managers last month over 
the loitering ban and other matters dissolved into an shouting match 
its not right for them theyre violating the bill of 
rights tenant albert j farmer 73 said tuesday 
the area is plagued by drug traffic said police sgt robert 
cagianello but while he wasnt familiar with the noloitering 
policy he said it doesnt make any sense the dealers would 
pay it they can afford it

a tv special on the green river serial murder case 
generated only a fraction of the number of tips reported by the 
shows organizers police said 
organizers confused the number of telephone calls attempted with 
the number of calls actually received said lt dan nolan spokesman 
for the task force investigating the deaths of up to 48 young women 
from 1982 to 1984 
during the nationwide broadcast last week of manhunt a chance 
to end the nightmare viewers were urged to phone in tips on the 
slayings or any other crimes 
earlier reports by the shows organizers and police said as many 
as 60000 calls were made to a special phone bank staffed by 
investigators but as of midnight monday nolan said investigators 
had answered no more than 7660 calls 
u s west communications which handled the calls said about 
86200 calls had been attempted on the tollfree number 
most callers however got busy signals did not get through 
because of technical problems or else apparently changed their minds 
and ended their calls prematurely nolan said 
nolan said the 7660 calls answered by police had yielded about 
3000 credible tips on the green river murders and other crimes 
the green river killer is blamed for the deaths of up to 48 
women many of them prostitutes forty are known dead and eight 
others disappeared 
despite the discrepancies reported in the number of calls police 
still have their hands full seattle detective myrle carner said 27 
investigators would work full time through the holidays sorting out 
the calls 
obviously we kind of stepped into uncharted waters on this 
but quite frankly its been overwhelmingly successful he said

a judge agreed that the decal on glenn 
beasleys pickup was dirty but said it simply didnt violate 
floridas obscene bumper sticker law 
collier county judge eugene turner on tuesday dismissed the case 
one of the first of its kind because the stickers language is not 
addressed in the law 
the measure which went into effect oct 1 says a sticker is 
obscene if it depicts explicit sexual conduct referring to the 
fourletter word on beasleys sticker turner said the law makes no 
reference to excretory functions 
turner said his ruling in no way declares the bumper sticker to 
be in good taste socially acceptable or unoffensive to parents who 
attempt to educate their children beyond fourletter words 
the judge ruled correctly because the law simply does not cover 
this bumper sticker in the definition of what is obscene said 
american civil liberties union lawyer francis sams who never argued 
the constitutional issues of the case 
beasley 25 a mechanic from east naples was arrested oct 12 on 
the bumper sticker violation and numerous other traffic charges 
under the bumper sticker law a first offense carries up to two 
months in jail and a 500 fine 
ironically it was bumper stickers with the same language as the 
decal in question that state rep tom banjanin said he had in mind 
when he sponsored the law 
i think it would be good if it were appealed so that we can get 
a florida supreme court ruling on how far the law does reach he 
said

a group fighting afghanistans 
sovietbacked government offered to exchange three soviet prisoners 
held in a northern province for 25 rebel prisoners a guerrillarun 
news agency said today 
ghulam ghous amir of the afghan news agency said the three 
soviet soldiers were captured about a month ago in baghlan province 
by the hezbeislami guerrillas 
amir a member of the guerrilla group said moscow agreed to the 
exchange but he could not say when it would take place there was no 
immediate reaction from soviet officials in moscow or in the soviet 
media 
soviet officials have said 312 red army soldiers are missing in 
action but moslem guerrillas dispute the figure 
a member of hezbeislami who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said his group holds most of the soviet pows and has less than 50 
the hezbeislami group belongs to a loose usbacked guerrilla 
alliance which is based in peshawar pakistan 
guerrilla officials met with officials from the soviet embassy in 
pakistan at the end of november reportedly to complete a 
prisonerexchange deal 
in early december soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
and guerrilla leaders met in saudi arabia 
a guerrilla spokesman abdul hadi says about 15000 rebel 
fighters or their sympathizers are being held in prisons in the 
afghan capital 
there has been no independent confirmation of that figure 
the soviet union sent troops and tanks into afghanistan in 1979 
to support afghanistans marxist government 
in april the soviet union signed documents in geneva agreeing to 
withdraw its troops by feb 15 1988 soviet officials suspended the 
withdrawal last month after complaining that pakistan and us 
officials continue to arm the guerrillas nevertheless the soviets 
who have withdrawn about half their 100000 soldiers said they 
would complete the withdrawal on schedule

police today detained a swede with a 
history of psychiatric illness and a previous manslaugher conviction 
on suspicion of assassinating prime minister olof palme officials 
and news reports said 
the stockholm district court named a defense lawyer for the 
41yearold suspect a court clerk said an indication he faced 
almost certain arrest after questioning in the feb 28 1986 slaying 
palme a fourterm prime minister was shot to death by a man who 
fled down a darkened street and escaped palme was walking home 
unguarded after seeing a latenight movie with his wife lisbet who 
was grazed by a second bullet 
prosecutor anders helin was quoted by the tt news agency as 
saying the suspect denied killing the swedish leader 
the man has been informed he is under suspicion for murder 
something which he denies helin told the news agency 
he said the unidentified suspect has not been charged hes 
just been brought in for a routine interrogation about the palme 
murder 
the detention of a suspect was the first movement in the 
investigation after a twoyear standstill and despite an 8 million 
reward offered by the government 
attorney arne liljeros went to the courthouse immediately after 
he was named defense counsel and was not available for comment his 
office said 
the suspect was questioned early in the case and admitted he was 
close to the scene of the slaying on the night palme was shot news 
reports said he was released for lack of evidence 
he came under scrutiny again during a police review and 
reorganization of the probe that included 17000 tips or leads the 
reports said 
tt quoted police sources as saying the man had been under 
surveillance as a prime suspect for several months the reports said 
palmes widow would be brought in to try and identify the suspect 
the reports by tt and two major tabloids aftonbladet and 
expressen said the suspect was from stockholm and had a criminal 
record and a history of psychiatric problems 
swedish radio said the suspect had a previous conviction for 
stabbing a drug addict to death in 1970 only a few blocks away from 
where palme was killed 16 years later the aftonbladet newspaper 
said he was a known underground figure who had been treated in a 
psychiatric ward for dangerous criminals 
only one other person has been arrested in the case since the 
assassination and he was released without being charged police have 
investigated dozens of theories but have failed to provide a motive 
according to one theory that dominated the investigation for more 
than a year the slaying was carried out by kurdish terrorists 
possibly under contract from the iranian regime in revenge for the 
cutoff of illegally supplied swedish weapons 
several government commissions have condemned the police handling 
of the case beginning with the failure to seal off the area 
immediately after the assassination and close the nations borders 
the slaying has had political aftershocks 
former justice minister annagreta leijon a key figure in the 
governing social democratic party was forced to resign in june for 
supporting an informal investigation that bypassed official 
prosecutors and police 
palme 59 was a controversial international figure and a leader 
of the world disarmament movement sweden and the united states 
clashed over his outspoken criticism of the us involvement in 
vietnam

a cuban exile charged with attempting to hijack a 
twa jetliner to havana was having a hard time making ends meet here 
as a cook and wanted to run away to his native land a coworker 
says 
an airpiracy warrant was issued tuesday for felix sanchez 
rodriguez who is being held in the turks and caicos islands the 
fbi said 
sanchez 26 was accused of passing a flight attendant a note 
threatening to blow up the plane sunday during a flight from san 
juan puerto rico to miami 
the plane carrying 128 people landed safely at grand turk island 
where police convinced sanchez he was in cuba and arrested him said 
fbi spokesman paul miller 
sanchez was in puerto rico to see his estranged wife and two baby 
daughters whom he was trying to support coworker pedro garcia 
told the miami news 
felix could not make ends meet with the money he earned as a 
luncheon cook and he was beginning to feel that he was being choked 
by a very short rope said garcia the only thing felix wanted 
was to run away and be with his father and his twin brother he 
thought that was the solution 
the fbi said sanchez should be extradited because the flight was 
within us jurisdiction during the attempted hijacking 
if convicted sanchez could receive up to 20 years in prison 
garcia said sanchez who came to the us in the 1980 mariel 
boatlift went to puerto rico to patch things up with his wife

several months of negotiations between the producer and a coalition

present in a court to be sentenced 
judges mike mccormick ol pete johnson and jack montgomery 
said they simply requested that aidsinfected defendants in at least 
three cases waive their right to appear in court and all did so 
the defendants feel they dont have a choice however fearing 
they might anger the judge by refusing gespass said the three 
defendants pleaded guilty 
mccormick and johnson said their bailiffs dont want to handle 
the prisoners for fear of contracting the aids virus montgomery 
said he doesnt want himself or the people in his courtroom exposed 
to defendants with the virus 
the bailiffs and the judges were concerned about a violent 
defendant who could bite or bleed in a fight mccormick said 
dr michael saag an aids specialist at university hospital said 
it is very unlikely that a person could become infected with the 
aids virus through a bite or during a fight 
on april 29 mccormick used a telephone hookup to listen to the 
guilty plea of john louis oneal on a burglary charge said harry j 
blalock the lawyer who represented oneal at the time mccormick 
put him on probation 
mccormick told me he didnt want him in there because he had 
aids blalock said what can i say he oneal was out on bond 
there wasnt any reason he couldnt be there 
oneal 30 said he wanted to go to court like anyone else my 
lawyer told me to do it over the phone because he didnt want to 
make him the judge mad said oneal in an interview with the 
birmingham postherald 
mccormick said the main reason he asked that oneal not be 
brought to court was that my bailiffs didnt want to handle him 
gespass oneals current attorney has filed a petition to 
overturn oneals convictions because his client was not in court to 
give his plea or to be sentenced 
charles collins a board member of the birmingham aids outreach 
a nonprofit group that assists aids victims said the judges 
actions make it difficult to educate people on the facts of the 
disease 
if a person in authority disregards our national health 
officials it makes it more difficult to convince the general public 
not to discriminate against aids patients he said

shepherd accused of killing two israelis in the occupied west bank 
jewish settlement leaders called on israeli citizens to be 
quicker to use firearms in clashes with palestinians 
the army said the shepherd bludgeoned a settler to death with a 
rock tuesday then stole the dead mans rifle and killed a soldier 
before being shot to death by israeli troops 
the violence occurred as plo leader yasser arafat offered a new 
palestine liberation organization peace initiative to the un 
general assembly in geneva israeli leaders including prime 
minister yitzhak shamir rejected the offer as insufficient and 
dated 
the settlers widow leah pereg called today for more jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
we will continue to build to bring new homes and industry here 
and develop the place that was his dream mrs pereg said on 
israel radio 
mrs pereg who has three children and is pregnant with a fourth 
said my children and i will continue to live here and build the 
place even if they the arabs want blood 
the army clamped a curfew on the shepherds village of burin near 
the religious jewish settlement of berakha and the city of nablus 
israel routinely demolishes the homes of suspected guerrillas 
also today soldiers shot and wounded an 18yearold palestinian 
in the bureij refugee camp in the gaza strip arab reports and 
hospital officials said the army said it was checking the report 
the incident occurred shortly after the army lifted a curfew that 
had confined 650000 gazans to their homes during arafats address 
gazans defied army orders setting off fireworks and shouting 
from balconies during and after the plo leaders speech 
in nablus masked youths filled the streets after the address 
chanting proplo slogans as they danced and waved pictures of arafat

palestinians as hamdan najjar 25 crushed the skull of settler 
yaakov pereg with a rock najjar then stole the dead settlers 
machine gun and shot at a passing military patrol killing 
41yearold reserve soldier arthur herstog the army said 
the shepherds family had been involved in a longrunning land 
dispute with the settlement of berakha and the clash took place on 
a piece of land expropriated by the jewish settlement israeli radio 
said 
villagers from burin had been fighting the expropriation in 
court the jerusalem post newspaper reported pereg was in charge of 
supervising the disputed area and was patrolling it when the attack 
took place 
however army commanders said it was unclear if the land dispute 
was the motive for the slaying 
dozens of settlers demonstrated outside prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs home late tuesday shouting jewish blood is not cheap 
uri ariel general secretary of the judea and samaria council for 
jewish settlement called on israelis living and traveling in the 
area to be quicker to draw weapons judea and samaria are the 
biblical names for the west bank 
i am telling all citizens who live in judea and samaria as 
well as those traveling in the area that it is preferable to sit in 
jail than in beit levinstein a rehabilitation center for wounded 
soldiers ariel said 
he called on the heads of the military and defense establishment 
to resign if they could not restore order in the occupied 
territories where palestinians have been revolting against israeli 
rule for over a year

the uprising at least 323 palestinians also have died

payments to his estranged wife nancy prosecutors charge miss 
myerson gave a 19000ayear city job to the judges daughter

officer was fatally wounded 
vines said other officers were in the area as backup for the

the operating rate at us factories mines and 
utilities in november rose to the highest level in nine years the 
government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about 
inflation 
the federal reserve board said the use of industrial capacity 
rose 02 percentage points to 842 percent last month the highest 
since 843 percent in november 1979 it was the seventh increase in 
eight months 
as capacity use edges toward 85 percent economists fear 
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand 
leading to shortages and price increases 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the figures were 
good for steady growth in the economy 
in an accompanying report the federal reserve said industrial 
production climbed a brisk 05 percent in november following an 
identical 05 percent rise in october 
the feds industrial production index now stands at 1399 percent 
of its 1977 base reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and 
production of equipment for businesses 
the jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line 
with economists expectations most government statistics have 
portrayed a robust economy in october and november particularly in 
the manufacturing sector which has been bolstered by strong export 
sales caused by the lower value of the dollar which makes us 
goods more affordable on overseas markets 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at manufacturing plants the operating rate climbed to 845 
percent last month up from 843 percent in october producers of 
both durable goods big ticket items ranging from bicycles to 
battleships and nondurable goods reported higher rates 
the rate at durable goods plants was 831 percent in november up 
from 829 percent nondurable goods producers recorded a 01 
percentage point gain to 865 percent 
the fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries 
jumped to 924 percent the highest since december 1978 most of the 
increase was attributed to increases at steel mills 
use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for 
the fourth consecutive month to 854 percent reflecting gains in 
light truck production automobile plants a subcategory slipped to 
767 percent down from 770 percent 
the operating rate at utilities was 810 percent in november up 
from 808 percent it had hit a peak for the year in august of 839 
percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate increased to 822 percent last month it was 816 
percent in october 
the federal reserves production index has not declined since 
september 1987 a reflection of the exportdriven manufacturing 
boom a related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand 
and modernize factories has accompanied the boom 
production in the manufacturing sector rose 05 percent in 
november following an even stronger 06 percent gain in october 
the fed said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 76 
million units down slightly from october 
but production of business equipment rose 04 percent following a 
flat month in october and stood 88 percent higher than a year ago 
output at mines which includes oil and gas drilling rose 06 
percent in november after three consecutive declines production at 
utilities increased 04 percent on top of a 06 percent jump in 
october 
total output at factories mines and utilities was 51 percent 
higher than a year ago

a judge today set bail at 20000 cash 
for a man accused of raping a woman at knifepoint in an area where 
the bodies of six victims of an apparent serial killer have been 
discovered 
neil anderson 35 was arrested tuesday at his home and charged 
with aggravated rape kidnapping assault and battery in a 1987 
attack along interstate 195 in dartmouth 
defense and prosecution attorneys stressed at a hearing before 
district judge john a markey today that anderson should not be 
connected with the deaths of six women whose bodies have been found 
since july along highways near here 
this is a case that involves aggravated rape kidnapping and 
assault and battery and thats all it involved assistant 
district attorney raymond e veary said 
public defender james m quinn said heres a man thats 
presumed innocent he has been charged with only one crime i think 
that to try to link that to any other events is very unfair 
hes been charged with one crime hes pleaded not guilty and he 
should be presumed innocent 
raymond veary an assistant district attorney in bristol county 
declined to comment on a report by wbztv in boston that the man was 
a suspect in the highway killings 
the boston herald today also quoted unidentified sources who said 
anderson was considered a suspect he would go from a list of 
loose suspects to the top of the list said a source the newspaper 
described as close to the investigation 
were not narrowing down our scope at all a police source 
told the standardtimes of new bedford 
anybody who is charged with something like that of course 
theyre suspects the newspaper quoted another source as saying 
to say hes the one we dont know that 
the partially clad skeletons of the six women have been found 
since july in a six to eightmile radius along i195 and route 140 
in dartmouth and freetown 
district attorney ronald a pina has said he believed the six 
killings were likely the victims of the same killer or killers and 
that the victims all had ties to new bedfords weld square 
neighborhood known for prostitution and drugs 
anderson lived with his mother and grandmother about 10 blocks 
from the weld square area the boston herald reported 
the television station reported that andersons alleged rape 
victim is a former prostitute but veary declined to confirm or deny 
the report 
state police dogs and a specially trained dog from connecticut 
have been searching for more victims in woods outside of new 
bedford where the bodies have been found

cbs today won exclusive network rights to 
televise major league baseball with a 1 billion offer that shocked 
nbc which has prided itself on its baseball coverage since 1947 
the fouryear contract allows cbs to televise the world series 
the allstar game the playoffs in both leagues and a 12game 
regularseason package beginning in 1990 industry sources said 
the network has not televised big league baseball since the 
mid1960s while nbc and abc shared tv rights since 1975 
cbs was stunned by nbc last month when it lost the us tv rights 
to the 1992 barcelona olympics nbc won with a bid of 401 million 
topping cbss offer by 40 million 
baseball is expected to award a cable package next month for 
between 75 million and 100 million per year turner broadcasting 
systems tnt network espn and sportschannel america are competing 
for the package cable is expected to show four or five games a week 
nbc had been expected to retain the major part of baseballs 
network package abc had complained of heavy losses on its monday 
night package and will move its games to thursday in 1989 
thep in 
imports which declined to 3802 billion on a seasonally adjusted 
basis 
this decline offset a smaller 11 percent drop in us exports 
which edged down to 2767 billion 
even with the small setback in exports us overseas sales 
remained near record high levels for the first 10 months of this 
year export sales are running 283 percent above the same period in 
1987 
this remarkable surge in export sales has been responsible for 
almost half of americas overall economic growth this year as 
american manufacturers have hired workers and stepped up output to 
meet demand 
through october the overall merchendise trade deficit has been 
running at an annual rate of 1361 billion 20 percent below the 
alltime high imbalance of 1703 billion recorded last year 
presidentelect bush cited this improvement during the 
presidential campaign as proof that the reagan administrations 
policies of solving the countrys trade woes were working 
the administration launched an effort in september 1985 to drive 
the value of the dollar lower to make american goods more 
competitive on overseas markets while driving up the price of 
imports 
the effort took far longer to bear fruit than many had expected 
and has to this day failed to halt the steady increase in imports 
which are running 83 percent higher so far this year over 1987 
the 1035 billion october deficit was the lowest since a 947 
billion july imbalance that had been the smallest deficit since 
december 1984 
the trade report us trade representative clayton yeutter said 
was good news on which to close out 1988 he added that the 
deficit was now falling at a satisfactory pace 
todays good news on trade followed a report tuesday showing that 
the deficit in the broadest measure of trade the current account 
fell to 3089 billion in the julyseptember quarter the lowest 
level in three years 
the current account method adds the value of investments and 
services to the value of goods reflected in todays report 
many economists are worried that despite the dramatic declines in 
the trade deficit this year the improvement is in danger of 
stalling next year a development that could push the country into a 
recession 
some economists contend that the dollar must fall further to make 
us goods even more competitive and dampen americans appetite for 
imports other analysts are urging the bush administrative to waste 
no time in launching an aggressive effort to open more foreign 
markets to american products 
the october report is likely to provide ammunition to these 
critics because of a 341 percent jump in the trade deficit with 
japan the trade imbalance with japan the largest with any country 
surged to 55 billion in october the highest it has been in a year 
the deficit with taiwan was unchanged at 14 billion while the 
deficit with western europe rose to 11 billion 200 million 
higher than in october 
the deficits with individual countries are not adjusted to take 
into account normal monthly variations in trade flows before the 
seasonal adjustment the overall deficit would have been 1175 
billion reflecting the fact that october is a big import month as 
retailers stock up for the christmas season

a woman faces 20 years in prison for 
forcefeeding her 4yearold daughter a fatal dose of salt as 
punishment for stealing sugar 
charges against the womans husband who also was accused of 
murder were dismissed by the judge tuesday 
jack riggs is going to have to live with his conscience 
commonwealths attorney skip burkart said after beth michelle riggs 
was convicted of murder in the may 17 death of heather riggs who 
suffered heart failure caused by the salt 
burkart said he probably will seek the maximum prison term at 
sentencing in february 
mrs riggs 36 hoped to give her daughter a bad taste to stop 
her from eating sugar and gave the 26pound child more than enough 
salt to kill a 170pound adult according to testimony 
witnesses described how a threeinch lump of salt in her adoptive 
daughters stomach was observed through xrays to be shrinking as 
the salt dissolved into her comatose body and her heart failed 
theres no indication she intended to hurt that child said 
defense attorney james swanson were dealing with table salt 
were dealing with a substance available on every table in the 
country she had no idea of the lethal effect 
mrs riggs entered a plea agreement that called for her to be 
convicted of either seconddegree murder or involuntary 
manslaughter after hearing the evidence judge kenneth trabue 
convicted mrs riggs of the more serious offense 
thomas blaylock the fathers lawyer successfully argued that 
riggs had nothing to do with the crime and that he immediately took 
his daughter to the hospital after telephoning a poison hotline 
burkart said heather riggs was routinely locked in her room so 
she could not get out and eat large quantities of sweets

ever wonder what happens to teddy bears 
after they stop getting hugs 
some get stuffed in attic trunks others simply sit in playrooms 
and sulk and a goodly number get thrown away 
now thousand of teddy bears are getting back into the snuggle 
business thanks to a local program that may be expanded nationwide 
within a year 
a cleaning company has volunteered to rescue the teddy bears and 
other stuffed animals donated to the san francisco firefighters toy 
program that were once considered too stained tattered or tired to 
pass along to needy children for christmas 
the workers at coit drapery carpet amp upholstery cleaners who 
last year volunteered to clean blankets and sleeping bags for the 
homeless this year offered to clean and repair stuffed animals for 
needy kids 
the bears and their buddies are given a stitch or two if needed 
then they get scrubbed by hand finally theyre dried and their fur 
is fluffed 
the result is stunning the program which gave away 9500 toys 
last christmas will give away about 13000 this year 
weve always accepted the stuffed animals but this is the 
first year weve been able to give them all out said dorothy 
teupal an assistant chairperson of the campaign she said the coit 
employees efforts at least trip day although study after study has 
pointed out 
pentagon flaws little progress has been made in correcting the 
situation 
presidentelect bush says the job of improving military 
purchasing policies is one of his top goals 
lets hope so the pentagon would hardly notice tighter budgets 
if wasteful spending were reduced substantially

the journal new ulm minn on gen manuel noriega and the bush 
administration 
the incoming administration will soon learn that some of the 
major problems facing this country before the presidential election 
such as gen manuel noriega of panama did not go away and still 
must be dealt with in a decisive manner 
the reagan administration never did come to grips with gen 
noriega who had been indicted by the united states for taking 
bribes to convert his country into a safe haven for the notorious 
colombian drug cartel 
the senate foreign relations subcommittee had produced massive 
evidence of gen noriegas corruption and dealings with foes of the 
united states 
gen noriega continues to demand that the us pull out its 
military forces in the area 
the new administration should make it clear from the very start 
that the us is there to stay because the security situation 
demands it and at no cost should we allow the panama canal to 
fall into the control of foreign forces

the rapid city sd journal on the b1 bomber crashes 
flying involves some risk that is particularly true with 
military aircraft 
last month western south dakota was stunned when one of the 
nations newest warplanes a b1 bomber from ellsworth air force 
base crashed short of the runway and was destroyed the crash 
closely followed another in texas 
because of the controversial nature of the b1 the two incidents 
together raised questions about whether the airplane was inherently 
flawed 
the b1 has shortcomings but it would be unfair at this point to 
say the airplane is not flightworthy 
perhaps it was just that the local accident caused us to pay more 
attenton but since then it has been clear that military aircraft of 
all types crash at a rate that would close down commercial aviation

un speech 
things have certainly changed since the last time a soviet leader 
addressed the united nations 30 years ago 
instead of shaking fists and shouted abuse listeners were 
treated to a low voice an occassional smile some sweet reason 
and conciliatory language 
mikhail gorbachev is showing once again what we already know 
that in the modern craft of public diplomacy he is very nearly an 
artist 
like president reagan he knows the way things are said the 
tone the emphasis the subtle message or two is usually as

how much can we trust mikhail gorbachevs promise made before 
the united nations to reduce the red armys troop strength in 
eastern europe 
perhaps only an iota more than we could trust stalin to keep the 
1945 yalta agreement which guaranteed free democratic elections in 
those countries 
nato seems to have the right idea the red army troop reductions 
assuming they come off at all are but a small start in what must be 
major cutbacks 
as always we should remain utterly skeptical of soviet words 
unless theyre followed quickly by equivalent actions

todays sunbeam salem nj on irs collection efforts 
the general accounting office the research arm of congress says 
the internal revenue service has some serious deficiencies such as 
its employees in some parts of the country are paid less than 
workers at local hamburger and pizza emporiums 
its taxcollection process badly needs modernizing 
its computer capacity must be beefed up 
you would think that by now uncle sams tax collectors would have 
been given whatever they needed to flush out deadbeats and tighten 
loopholes in the system 
both the legislative and executive branches have a responsibility 
to see that the agencys needs are met and that it does its job 
the irs wont be able to collect all of the billions owed the 
treasury but with the proper resources it could make a substantial 
dent in the amount of tax money that remains unpaid each year

seattle postintelligencer on the budget deficit 
politically moderate economists and political leaders in both 
parties generally agree that additional federal revenues will be 
needed if presidentelect george bush is to reduce the federal 
deficit 
they are right 
the question is how to accomplish the job candidate bush said 
read my lips no new taxes well the election is over and many 
believe a way must be found for him to experience a change of heart 
or lips 
rep dan rostenkowski dill wants to help he proposes a 10or 
15cent per gallon federal gasoline tax on top of the nine cents 
now charged at the pump this is a sensible proposal but not the 
only one that should be considered a 1 a barrel oil import fee 
also deserves review 
since we must have some tax boost why not put it on gasoline or 
imported oil such a tax or fee would encourage conservation as well 
as production of more fuelefficient automobiles and that in turn 
would reduce americas growing consumption of petroleum

the honolulu starbulletin on the response to the armenian 
earthquake 
the generous response to the disaster stems from humanitarian 
impulses but it may also have been influenced by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs attempts to reduce world tensions 
americans and other westerners now perceive the soviet union as 
less threatening that makes it easier to sympathize with and help 
the earthquake victims 
in turn the relief effort may help convince the soviet 
leadership and people that the west doesnt seek their conquest or 
destruction if that happens this natural disaster may help prevent 
the ultimate political disaster of nuclear war

the sun herald biloxigulfport miss on gorbachevs un 
speech 
mikhail gorbachev is either a master manipulator of world opinion 
or the most pragmatic soviet leader in history or both 
his us visit demonstrated one thing he is for the time 
being the dominant personality on the world scene 
gorbachevs announcement before the united nations of a 
reduction in soviet troops and tanks was a blockbuster 
presidentelect bush must follow through by testing the 
willingness of the soviets to take further concrete steps in 
reversing this massive military buildup 
the us interest in encouraging fundamental change in the soviet 
union is first and foremost in enhancing the longterm prospects 
for peace 
but there is also an economic advantage to be gained the less we 
have to pay to counter the soviet military threat the more the us 
resources can be diverted from military use to research and 
development that will make our own economy stronger and more 
competitive

statesmanjournal salem ore on alcohol abuse by young people 
alcohol abuse is rampant among adults but it also is a growing 
problem among young people 
in fact the drinking problem of young americans has become so 
bad that the national commission against drunk driving has called on 
parents to assume greater responsibility for keeping alcohol away 
from their children 
that is wise advice unfortunately its not much heeded by the 
youngsters who see their parents and other adults using the same 
drug often to excess 
furthermore drinking is depicted in our advertising and in our 
entertainment media as the normal way of life the terribly 
expensive downside to the consumption of alcohol seldom is portrayed 
realistically 
one in six persons who start to drink alcohol develops a drinking 
problem those are deadly odds to contemplate 
the commission urges legislation to regulate such advertising 
that would be in the best interests not only of the young people but 
also the entire nation

longest time before asking may i touch your skin another 
recalled how a white student after standing next to her for a 
while remarked with some surprise hey you dont smell 
are those the actions of hardcore racists or young men and 
women who grew up with little or no personal contact with 
blacks hispanics and other nonwhite people we hope and expect 
its the latter 
the best time to teach young people about cultural diversity is 
not when they show up as college freshmen but when theyre in

a fowl feud over the number of 
muscovy ducks waddling about has turned violent with duck haters 
being accused of running the birds down 
theyre using 20000 cars to kill threepound ducks said 
marilyn pryor a member of the citys special advisory committee on 
ducks 
it is beyond my comprehension that any one could so hate ducks 
or any animal that they would intentionally and maliciously run them 
down she said 
she said some residents have been seen driving onto lawns after 
the ducks which are characterized by a large crest red wattles 
and a wheezy sound 
muscovy ducks are common in many florida towns and cities and 
have their friends and foes throughout the state 
antiduck forces say the ducks are too aggressive multiply too 
quickly tend to get into gardens leave droppings underfoot and in 
general tend to be a pain in the neck 
jan cheney manager of the st augustine humane society which 
has joined police in investigating the rundowns said that 
purposely running ducks over is cruelty to animals and could be a 
violation of state law 
according to three reported eyewitness accounts the drivers of 
various vehicles have purposely swerved their automobiles at an 
accelerated speed to aim their cars at ducks which would not have 
actually been in their path she said in a recent letter to city 
commissioner pat dodson who heads the duck committee 
assistant police chief ray blackaby said a flock of ducks was hit 
early monday morning according to a report filed by a resident 
someone driving a blue car intentionally rammed into the ducks 
killing one and injuring another 
last year after the duck population in the woodland neighborhood 
had swelled to 180 some neighbors chipped in and hired a company to 
catch most of the ducks and relocate them to georgia 
the duck catcher was confronted by produck forces who tried to 
halt the project he had to be escorted out of the area by police 
the city commission formed the duck committee from people in the 
neighborhood after the issue began to dominate commission meetings 
it includes pro and antiduck forces in april police were called 
to ensure that one verbal exchange didnt lead to fisticuffs

the wine harvest of 220 million bottles 
from the champagne area promises to produce wine and champagne of 
exceptional quality next spring industry officials said 
wednesday 
viticulturalists says this years harvest is average in size 
compared with the 2644 millionbottle yield in 1987 in line with a 
production pattern where two good years are generally followed by a 
poor or moderate season 
on the eve of the harvest stocks stood at 712 million bottles 
or more than three years worth of sales including a spillover of 
123 million bottles from 1986 and 1987 the interprofessional 
committee of wines from champagne said 
the top quality of this years returns had proved the merits of a 
newly implemented system of multiple harvesting officials added 
the wines will be excellent because the champagne region in 
northern france had a week of full sun at the start of september at 
a crucial period in the grapes ripening process the committee said

calls come in from across the country 
asking about the postcard campaign for the spring hill boy with 
cancer 
the problem is he doesnt really exist and those who know the 
details of the misguided effort are pleading for an end to the 
postcard frenzy 
bags and bags of postcards keep coming and the holiday season 
has stirred even more interest 
people hear that a boy named david would like to make the 
guinness book of world records for receiving the most postcards or 
christmas cards depending on the story 
a spring hill post office box or sometimes a west palm beach 
number is given as a mailing address 
the real story is that mario morby of steely england has 
cancer but it is in remission and his name already is listed in the 
1989 guinness book for having the worlds largest collection of 
postcards 
frances keefe founder of florida childs wish come true 
organization in spring hill decided this summer to help with his 
effort 
aline morin a member of the ladies auxiliary of the veterans of 
foreign wars post 3588 in lake worth latched onto the idea in august 
as a special project and offered her west palm beach address as 
another possibility 
she says the morbys asked that the name david be used to protect 
their son a report the morbys deny 
we never asked anybody to use that name marios father 
whose name is david said from his home this week we dont even 
know how that got started 
but the result has been thousands of pieces of mail addressed to 
david each day 
joseph cerbone mail supervisor in spring hill said wednesday 
that about 50000 pieces of mail arrive each day for david in the 
gulf coast community about 50 miles north of tampa 
ms morin across the state in west palm beach says she has 
received about 165000 postcards and almost 5000 are arriving 
daily 
ms keefe who runs her nonprofit organization out of her 
hernando county home is running out of space 
i have a sunken living room that has 37 boxes of mail in it 
she said tuesday i have a florida room that has 48 letter trays 
from the post office in it i have a dining room table thats piled 
high so the only thing i have left is my kitchen bathroom and 
bedrooms 
in july the morbys directed the postal service to deliver the 
postcards to an auction house in nottingham england where the mail 
is sold every two months stamp collectors and others buy the 
postcards 
money from those sales is being donated to the birmingham 
childrens hospital in england where mario received his 
chemotherapy treatment his case is in remission the auctions have 
raised about 4000

the statecontrolled media on wednesday 
harshly criticized a series of disturbances marking the seventh 
anniversary of martial law but newspapers praised some solidarity 
leaders for moderation 
thousands of antigovernment protesters rallied in warsaw 
krakow wroclaw and at least three other cities to protest the 
military crackdown ordered dec 13 1981 by polish leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski 
television showed scenes of masked students hurling stones and 
radio carried the chants of protesters saying down with 
jaruzelski 
they hide behind the gate of the university the traditional 
bastion of rationality in thought where there should be no 
place for brutality and violence the government newspaper 
rzeczpospolita said referring to student demonstrators who tuesday 
hurled stones at police in warsaw 
the program of confrontation street confrontation is a lost 
cause the newspaper said adventurous excesses are a proof 
of lack of political imagination 
most papers drew unfavorable comparisons between recent 
conciliatory statements by solidarity leader lech walesa and other 
union leaders and the antagonistic actions and the chants of the 
demonstrators 
recent events and especially lech walesas remarks in paris 
indicate that a meeting of authorities with the constructive 
opposition and other social forces is a real possibility said 
warsaws zycie warszawy 
in such a situation several thousand young people in a few 
polish cities went out into the streets with stones in their hands 
and chants and banners saying down with the commune 
in a separate editorial the paper said do they realize that 
by street brawls they support antireform forces and to they really 
want to 
the newspapers drew attention to remarks made by walesa in paris 
over the weekend making the first foreign trip he has been allowed 
since martial law in which walesa said there were signs of positive 
developments in poland but that reform must be quickened 
the official pap news agency also noted approvingly that 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz had condemned 
stonethrowing by demonstrators in gdansk on sunday and that the 
rev henryk jankowski a walesa adviser had asked parishioners not 
to behave aggressively 
onyszkiewicz and jankowski normally are targets of government 
criticism

spains first general strike in 54 years 
shut down major industries public transportation and state offices 
today police reported sporadic violence and made at least 30 
arrests 
the strike succeeded beyond our greatest expectations said 
jose manuel de la parra spokesman for the socialist general 
workers union the countrys largest which called the strike to 
protest government austerity measures 
socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez told a news conference 
the strike was no reason to call elections before they are scheduled 
in 1990 but a government communique acknowledged the strike 
succeeded in much of the country 
parra estimated that 78 million of the 118 million employed 
spaniards stayed off the job 
general motors spokesman rafael casas said only 250 
administrative workers showed up at their opel plant which employs 
9100 people in zaragoza 
spains three major business associations accused unions of using 
strongarmed tactics to force small businesses and offices to 
close 
there were reports of sporadic violence and at least 30 arrests 
throughout spain especially at outlets of the leading el corte 
ingles department store where angry picketers tried to prevent 
employees and shoppers entering 
a store spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 90 
percent of the chains 31000 employees showed up for work 
at its main store in downtown madrid police charged 
photographers covering a melee beating them over the head with 
clubs 
socialist leader jose maria benegas said people joined the strike 
out of fear and intimidation but madrids socialist mayor juan 
barranco said the government had to concede that the strike 
succeeded in keeping most of the citys 4 million residents at home 
in small towns and large cities local radio stations reported 
people stayed indoors bars and restaurants remained shuttered and 
cinemas and theaters were closed in this nation of 38 million people 
in an unusual joint action the general workers union and the 
communistdominated workers commissions called the strike to protest 
economic policies of gonzalezs 6yearold government and its 
failure to satisfy demands for wage increases unemployment benefits 
and pensions 
the disputed policies have reduced inflation nine points to 51 
percent and led to a 5 percent annual growth rate but they have 
been unable to make a dent in western europes highest unemployment 
rate of 187 percent 
gonzalez told reporters he was not considering calling early 
elections polls indicate the socialists would win another majority 
if elections were held now and gonzalez said the situation between 
government and unions would be exactly the same but he repeated 
an offer to discuss with the unions ways to improve the economic and 
social situation 
union branches in barcelona called for a protest tonight in the 
countrys second largest city and both unions planned to march on 
madrid on friday 
an october 1934 general strike was put down violently by troops 
led by gen francisco franco acting on orders of the illfated 
second republic

foreign minister shimon peres praised plo 
chairman yasser arafat on wednesday for having learned to say 
peace but asked why he wore an army uniform if he really meant it 
peres who heads the leftleaning labor party deviated from the 
governments official response by failing to rule out the plo as a 
possible future negotiating partner 
he made the remarks in a speech to the parliament in response to 
arafats address a day earlier to the un general assembly in 
geneva 
on tuesday prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud 
bloc issued an uncompromising rejection of the plo and of arafats 
peace bid labeling the un speech as doubletalk 
peres however complimented arafat for the peace bid by saying 
he has learned to say peace and i welcome this he is learning 
peres also called for a peace dialogue with palestinians 
immediately and without the jordanians if they so decide as long 
as they dont shoot the labor party had called for peace talks 
with a joint palestinianjordanian delegation but jordans king 
hussein in july ruled out such a move 
peres criticized arafat for not doing enough to end terrorism and 
for wearing a military uniform at the united nations 
i have seen arafat hold out the olive branch while holding a 
pistol peres said yesterday he also wore a uniform he says 
hes effectively the head of a government so what is he wearing a 
uniform for 
peres added he said he condemns terrorism in all its forms but 
then leaves himself two openings the struggle against occupation 
and the intefadeh 
intefadeh arabic for uprising is used to describe the 
palestinians revolt against israeli rule in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip more than 320 palestinians and 13 israelis have died 
in the violence 
peres also rejected arafats suggestion of placing un troops in 
the occupied territories saying such a move would preempt israels 
right to peace talks 
i would say that arafats speech was at most a rhetorical 
success and at its least a political disappointment peres said 
what is needed are political decisions 
peres also reiterated the labor partys proposal of a partial 
withdrawal from the disputed lands in exchange for peace 
i am ready for a territorial compromise for palestinians to 
live in honor and freedom under their own administration as long as 
they dont endanger israeli security he said 
peres remarks were interrupted at times by members of the rival 
likud bloc 
likud legislator michael eitan shouted in whose name are you 
speaking eitan shouted at peres

the soviet government has decided to devalue the 
ruble by 50 percent on some foreign trade deals in 1990 and to 
allow western capitalist companies to operate almost independently 
on soviet soil a newspaper said 
the ruble appears to be set for a slide from 160 to 80 cents 
dramatically cutting the price of soviet goods to foreign buyers 
it is the first step toward reducing the rubles extreme 
overvaluation under sovietset exchange rates the black market 
rate for the ruble is 20 cents to 25 cents 
a lot of people have become very excited said a western 
diplomat who declined to be identified but he said the communist 
nation reputedly has 3000 different exchange rates depending on the 
product and the partner and the soviets have not said which will 
experience the full 50 percent drop 
the devaluation will affect only foreign trade not tourists and 
soviet citizens he said 
the changes are designed to encourage foreign firms to build 
factories that will ease the soviet unions extreme shortage of 
consumer goods and medical supplies according to a policy statement 
from the council of ministers published in several economic journals 
in recent days 
a spokesman for the council of ministers declined to clarify the 
statement but promised a news conference with deputy premier 
vladimir kamentsev at a later date 
the devaluation is set for jan 1 1990 according to the 
newspaper socialist industry western economists said they were 
baffled by the delay noting that it throws current trade 
negotiations into chaos as foreigners would gain by waiting for the 
more favorable exchange rates 
the newspaper termed the devaluation an interim step toward a new 
set of exchange rates to be installed on jan 1 1991 
the western economists who declined to be identified said the 
timetable fits with soviet plans to revamp wholesale prices which 
are set by bureaucrats and have no relation to costs retail price 
reform is expected at a later date as is a convertible ruble 
the policy statement promised that foreign firms now limited to 
49 percent ownership of joint ventures will be allowed to negotiate 
their stakes and even send in their own managers to run the 
companies 
its a lot closer to major western companies desire for real 
control and at least 90 percent ownership before they invest in 
soviet operations said one american businessman in moscow who asked 
not to be identified 
one of the reasons theyve been cool toward the joint venture 
law is theyd like to operate their own wholly owned subsidiaries in 
the soviet union he said 
its a psychological barrier said a western diplomat 
because you can have what you want and the managing director can 
be foreign in addition the joint venture will be allowed to pay 
for housing and other services for its foreign employees out of its 
ruble earnings rather than be forced to spend additional hard 
currency he said 
the policy statement also promised that firms manufacturing 
consumer goods and medical products in the soviet union would be 
allowed to take part of their profits home companies building 
operations in the sparsely populated soviet far east would get three 
years of taxfree operations 
however several businessmen said the changes dont eliminate the 
greatest obstacles to western firms youve got to be able to 
repatriate profits and guarantee a supply of materials locally 
said john burgess of midland bank plc 
the american businessman said western interest in the soviet 
market is being driven more by the hype of perestroika and the 
gorbachev persona than by government policy

american industry is using more of its capacity 
than at any time in nine years the government said wednesday 
heightening concerns that the economy will overheat and inflation 
accelerate 
the federal reserve said the operating rate at factories mines 
and utilities was 842 percent last month up from 840 percent in 
october it was the seventh increase in eight months and the highest 
rate since november 1979 
in a related report the fed said its industrial production index 
in november increased by 05 percent for the second month in a row 
it now stands at 1399 percent of its 1977 base reflecting gains in 
most sectors particularly light truck manufacturing and production 
of business equipment 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the figures 
were good for steady growth in the economy 
but david berson an economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said were starting to approach levels of capacity 
utilization in some industries that will mean higher prices if 
growth continues at this rate well soon find most industries 
passing on higher prices and well see monthly increases in the 
inflation numbers 
as capacity use edges toward 85 percent economists fear 
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand 
leading to shortages and price increases 
a separate release by the commerce department supports the view 
that economic growth after moderating in the julyseptember 
quarter is rebounding 
business inventories rose a modest 02 percent in october as 
sales shot up 12 percent economists said the combination likely 
will spur an increase in orders to factories placing greater strain 
on capacity 
the balance between inventories was so good and so lean that it 
signals strong production in the months ahead said allen sinai 
an economist with the boston co an investment house thats good 
for economic growth but it is too strong for comfort on 
inflation and interest rates 
a third report on the merchandise trade deficit for october ran 
counter to the trend of the other statistics the trade gap narrowed 
by 31 percent to 103 billion as exports fell by 317 million and 
imports dropped an even bigger 643 million 
however david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co 
a government securities trader in new york said improvement in the 
trade deficit will slow in the months ahead he said capacity 
strains will make it difficult to manufacture more exports and 
strong domestic demand will suck in more imports 
jones said a monthly improvement in the trade deficit normally 
would trigger a rally in financial markets but bond and stock 
prices fell in early trading because the other reports heightened 
the fear that the federal reserve will nudge interest rates higher 
to curb inflation 
that decision could have been made wednesday when a fed committee 
finished a twoday private meeting to set monetary policy he said 
the committee does not disclose its decisions publicly 
in the capacity report the federal reserve said the 
manufacturing operating rate climbed to 845 percent last month up 
from 843 percent in october 
producers of both durable goods big ticket items ranging 
from bicycles to battleships and nondurable goods reported higher 
rates the rate at durable goods plants was 831 percent in 
november up from 829 percent nondurable goods producers recorded 
a 01 percentage point gain to 865 percent 
the fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries 
jumped to 924 percent the highest since december 1978 most of the 
increase came at steel mills 
use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for 
the fourth consecutive month to 854 percent reflecting gains in 
light truck production but automobile plants a subcategory 
slipped to 767 percent down from 770 percent 
the operating rate at utilities was 810 percent in november up 
from 808 percent it had hit a peak for the year in august of 839 
percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate increased to 822 percent last month it was 816 
percent in october 
the feds production index has not declined since september 1987 
production in the manufacturing sector rose 05 percent in november 
following an even stronger 06 percent gain in october 
automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 76 million 
units down slightly from october but production of business 
equipment rose 04 percent following a flat month in october and 
stood 88 percent higher than a year ago 
output at mines and oil wells rose 06 percent in november after 
three consecutive declines production at utilities increased 04 
percent on top of a 06 percent jump in october 
total output at factories mines and utilities was 51 percent 
higher than a year ago

scrooges in chautauqua county are about to 
be visited by a modern day recreation of charles dickens spirit of 
christmas 
charles ferraro county commissioner of social services has 
compiled the names of 1000 people who owe a total of 57 million 
in overdue payments for child and family support 
ferraros scrooge list support children remember 
obligations or get embarrassed will appear dec 20 in full page 
advertisements in the countys two daily newspapers 
it just made so much sense when you think about the story of 
scrooge and how in the end he realized what he was doing and turned 
out to be the good guy ferraro said we are hoping that will 
happen to a lot of these people the pennypinching ebenezer 
scrooge finally got the christmas spirit in a christmas carol 
and helped tiny tim and his family 
reaction from some of the delinquent parents who have been 
warned in a series of letters ranged from anger to threats of 
lawsuits ferraro said 
its rather amazing to me that a man who cant pay his child 
support can afford to hire a lawyer to sue me he said 
the pay or publicity tactic has social service commissioners in 
other counties waiting expectantly he said weve had many 
inquires from other commissioners and some of them have already 
committed themselves to doing the same thing next year 
judy lamb head of the western new york coalition of women for 
child support said the idea was terrific 
it can take years to get a noncustodial parent to make support 
payments and if a woman decides to resort to a request for 
incarceration for the delinquent father it can take two to three 
years before a hearing officer will even make a recommendation for 
incarceration ms lamb said 
ferraro said the plan was conceived a year ago after he noticed 
that overdue payments were increasing each year 
the idea to print the names was an offshoot of the countys 
practice of publishing names of delinquent property taxpayers and 
the idea of scrooge popped up with a christmas target date he said

business inventories in october climbed at the 
slowest rate in five months while sales surged a strong 12 
percent the government said wednesday in a report suggesting robust 
economic growth 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots rose 02 percent to a seasonally adjusted 7514 billion 
while sales jumped to 5015 billion 
economists said the combination of a modest increase in 
inventories and brisk sales is a sign of economic strength and 
possibly inflation 
with fewer goods in reserve relative to sales retailers feel 
compelled to place more orders possibly overburdening factories 
leading to shortages and higher prices they said 
it looks as though were getting a tendency for sales to get so 
strong that theyre pulling down inventories said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
trader in new york that will lead to an even stronger pickup in 
orders to manufacturers it reinforces the acceleration of the 
economy in the months ahead 
the modest october inventory increase followed increases of 09 
percent in september and 11 percent in august those jumps had led 
some economists to believe the pace of economic growth was slowing 
it looks like full speed ahead jones said there had been 
some concern that the economy was weakening in the third quarter 
but recent numbers suggest it is accelerating in the fourth quarter 
growth prospects are strong for at least the first half of next 
year 
inventory accumulation in october was led by a 06 percent 
increase at the manufacturing level where sales were the weakest 
wholesale inventories edged up 03 percent 
retail inventories which had been rising in earlier months fell 
by 07 percent if not for a big 22 percent drop in auto dealers 
inventories retail backlogs would have been down only 01 percent 
in sales retailers posted a strong gain of 16 percent while 
wholesalers showed a 19 percent increase sales from factories were 
up a moderate 05 percent but they have been generally strong all 
year because of an exportdriven manufacturing boom 
an advance estimate of retail sales for november released 
earlier this week showed a 11 percent gain evidence that retail 
inventories will continue to decline as goods are sold during the 
holiday shopping season 
the combination of a small increase in inventories and a big jump 
in sales held the inventorytosales ratio to 150 in october down 
from 151 a month earlier that means it would take 150 months to 
exhaust inventories at the october sales rate the ratio was also 
150 from june through august

staterun radio wednesday 
hailed the brazzaville peace agreement as one of the most 
impressive feats of african diplomacy in many years but 
newspapers expressed mixed feelings about it 
cuban and angolan officials also praised the agreement signed 
tuesday by their countries and south africa in the congo capital of 
brazzaville president kenneth kaunda of zambia and angolan 
guerrillas also said they welcomed it 
the accord provides for the phased withdrawal of 50000 cuban 
soldiers from angola by mid1991 and independence for namibia also 
known as southwest africa in about one year the three countries 
will sign a final treaty in new york on dec 22 concluding years of 
us mediation in the region 
the accords also supported by the soviet union call for an end 
to 73 years of south african control over southwest africa 
africas last colony 
they also will end 22 years of bush warfare in southwest africa 
and will bar cuban and south african forces from participating in 
the 13yearold civil war between angolas prosoviet government and 
usbacked rebels 
south african foreign minister rf botha said the peace moves 
also included a separate understanding between south africa and 
angola he said the details would become known as the regional 
accords became effective 
in brazzaville cubas deputy foreign minister said south africa 
has committed itself to ending aid to guerrillas battling 
angolas marxist government 
ricardo alarcon quesada provided no details of his claim at a 
news conference tuesday night and bothas office did not confirm it 
angolas chief of staff antonio dos santos franca said the 
historic brazzaville protocol will inaugurate a new era of peace 
in southwestern africa 
in lisbon portugal a statement by angolan guerrillas called the 
agreement historic but said angolans will not have peace until 
the angolan government negotiates with the guerrillas 
the national union for the total independence of angola said 
without direct negotiations with the government our people will 
not benefit from the present historic brazzaville accords 
the south african broadcasting corp called the agreement a 
diplomatic feat and said the accord justifies south africas 
insistence that a regional settlement depended on linking the 
independence of southwest africa to a cuban withdrawal from 
neighboring angola 
business day an independent daily said the settlement offered 
south africa the prospect of a reduced military and financial 
burden and reduced international pressure 
however south africas progovernment daily the citizen said 
southwest africa was virtually an integral part of south africa 
now this connection is to be severed 
in windhoek the territorial capital the democratic turnhalle 
alliance welcomed the agreement chief secretary johan de waal said 
he hoped nothing would bar a peaceful and meaningful 
independence 
the 10party alliance of economic and political moderates appears 
the main opponent in southwest african elections to the southwest 
african peoples organization nationalist movement the nationalist 
movement is favored to win

a 17yearold traffic offender sent to jail 
for earning poor grades was released early by the sentencing judge 
who said he was moved partially by the harshness of the county jail 
hammond city court judge peter katic has been criticized by a 
juvenile court watchdog group for sending teenage traffic offenders 
to jail with adult criminals rather than to a youth center he 
started his practice of ordering teenage traffic offenders to make 
decent grades c or better or go to jail more than a year ago 
under the terms of the youths sentence he was to serve 60 days 
katic on tuesday ordered him released immediately after 20 days 
partly because of harsh conditions at the jail including a lack of 
bedding 
the judge said the teenager had served an adequate length of 
time and cited a precedent of two days of good time for each day 
served 
the now freed hammond high school student had been convicted of 
driving without a license with expired plates and false 
registration papers police had stopped him driving his fathers 
unregistered uninsured vehicle 
he previously served one week his spring vacation in jail but 
was ordered back to jail when he did poorly in a recent grading 
period he spent the days in a cell with no windows bedding or 
books 
an attorney generals opinion states that even 18yearold 
traffic offenders can be sent to juvenile centers if there is room 
however lake county juvenile court judge darlene wanda mears has 
refused to house katics studentoffenders because she says state 
law forbids housing people convicted in adult court with offenders 
convicted in juvenile court 
katic defends his practice of good grades or jail saying 86 of 
the 111 students whove appeared before him have gotten sufficient 
grades since

developers of a biological product that would 
enable corn to grow its own pesticide say they will seek permission 
from federal authorities to test the product in four states 
the bioinsecticide was developed by crop genetics international 
corp of hanover md and is aimed at controlling the european corn 
borer a pest estimated to cause more than 400 million damage to 
the nations corn crop said john henry the companys president and 
chief executive officer 
a first round of tests was conducted in maryland this year and 
crop genetics plans to ask the federal environmental protection 
agency next week for approval to conduct tests in 1989 he said 
testing will be done on 12 acres of land henry said 
epa approval which could take up to three months is necessary 
each time a test is planned said albert heier an epa spokesman in 
washington 
in addition to fighting the european corn borer the 
bioinsecticide also works against the southwestern corn borer henry 
said 
dekalbpfizer genetics a division of dekalb genetics corp in 
dekalb ill has signed a contract with the maryland firm to help 
test develop and market the product said robert pritchard a 
spokesman for dekalbpfizer 
if this product works as well as the folks at crop genetics 
think it will it will be a major breakthrough in crop protection 
against corn bores pritchard said 
corn borers are the no 1 pest in the countrys no 1 crop 
henry said 
they have a laboratory technique to impregnate the seed with 
this vaccine and theyve done it on a laboratory scale pritchard 
said were working to try to develop the technology to do this on 
a commercial basis 
dekalbpfizer plans to test the bioinsecticide on land it owns in 
illiopolis in central illinois pritchard said 
in addition crop genetics also plans to test the bioinsecticide 
in stanton minn in hooper and hastings neb and in ingleside 
and beltsville md said james davis the companys general counsel 
to make the bioinsecticide crop genetics scientists took a gene 
from a singlecell soil bacterium that produces a protein and 
spliced it into endophytes microorganisms that live in plants 
henry said when the borer eats the plant the protein becomes toxic 
and destroys the insects stomach 
it gives the insects permanent ulcers he said 
the maryland tests showed the microorganism could not live 
outside the corn plant did not remain in the crop residue or soil 
and posed no risk to humans henry said

presidentelect bush today named trade 
representative clayton yeutter to be his agriculture secretary the 
latest in a long line of reagan administration officials appointed 
to highlevel jobs in the incoming cabinet 
bush said yeutter 58 knows farm policy domestically he knows 
it internationally 
at a personnel announcement that turned into a freewheeling news 
conference the presidentelect also hailed anew soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs plans to demobilize 500000 troops but said 
neither he nor aides had yet had time to study the implications of 
the move 
bush said there was no way the new administration would have 
a detailed pointbypoint program on arms talks by midfebruary 
when the reagan administration has proposed a resumption in arms 
talks with the soviet union 
we are going to start working vigorously and i will send 
whatever signal it takes to convey that message the 
presidentelect said i am interested in progress but i want it to 
be prudent i want whatever steps we take to be lasting 
bush also said there was some movement there toward 
moderation in palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafats speech this week but not enough to warrant direct 
dealings with the plo by the united states he said he wants 
clear unmistakeable unambiguous declarations that the plo 
renounces terrorism recognizes israel and will work within key 
united nations resolutions 
on other issues bush 
spoke highly of former texas sen john tower long rumored to be 
his top choice for defense secretary towers appointment has been 
hanging for several days pending completion of an fbi background 
check and the presidentelect said he had no doubt the former 
lawmaker could do an excellent job if i decide to go that route 
sidestepped questions about funding for cleaning up troubles 
us nuclear weapons productions plants saying he didnt know where 
the money would come from 
said he hadnt yet addressed the problem of homelessness with 
budget advisers 
said he would submit ethics legislation to congress very very 
early in his administration 
said vice presidentelect dan quayle would be a key player 
in national security affairs if he wants to be and said there may 
be specific assignments in other areas he seemed to rule out naming 
quayle as the new drug czar in view of legislation that requires a 
fulltime appointee to that post 
the presidentelect said he would not propose any substantial 
cuts in existing farm programs although he didnt say what he meant 
by substantial he added i do not believe we will balance the 
budget eventually on the backs of the farmers 
yeutters appointment was solo even though transition sources 
have said bush is expected to appoint illinois transit official sam 
skinner as the secretary of transportation 
yeutters appointment marked a turnabout from eight years ago 
then president reagan passed over him in choosing his original 
cabinet this time yeutter wanted to leave government at the end of 
the reagan administration but said bush was one of the few people 
who could persuade him to change his mind 
yeutter is bushs latest holdover from the reagan white house 
other veterans include james a baker iii former treasury 
secretary named secretary of state nicholas brady picked to stay 
as treasury secretary dick thornburgh to stay as attorney general 
lauro cavazos to stay as education secretary william webster will 
stay as head of the central intelligence agency and marlin fitzwater 
will remain as white house spokesman 
officials say bush hopes to round out his cabinet by christmas 
yeutter 58 a former nebraska farmer was chief executive 
officer of the chicago mercantile exchange and served in the 
agriculture department and as deputy trade representative in the 
administration of president ford 
yeutter has represented the united states at international trade 
negotiations since july 1985 and has been point man for the reagan 
administrations sofar unsuccessful effort to abolish all farm 
subsidies by foreign governments 
bush pledged to continue that effort and called for a thorough 
reform of international agriculture provisions by 1990 
earlier today transition codirector craig fuller said the fbi 
investigation into towers background should be finished by the end 
of the week 
tower the leading contender for the post met today with c 
boyden gray the transitions legal counsel to go over some of the 
findings of the background check fuller said 
several members of congress have suggested the long process of 
checking out tower would weaken him politically if and when he is 
chosen but fuller said he thought tower would be strengthened by 
the process because fbi agents have left no stone unturned 
in another development sources said wyoming oil and gas 
executive warren morton was in washington and had met with top 
transition officials concerning the search for an interior secretary 
morton is a former speaker of the wyoming house of 
representatives and while his background as an oil industry 
executive would almost certainly spark controversy from 
environmental groups he is among a handful of candidates with the 
backing of western state republican senators who met last week to 
discuss the subject 
sources said others acceptable to the group include richard 
richards of utah a former national gop chairman retired house 
republican leader john rhodes of arizona and rep barbara vucanovich 
of nevada she appears out of the running following bushs decision 
not to name any incumbent member of congress to his cabinet 
skinner could not be reached for comment tuesday although his 
wife sue said i assume he probably will be given the 
transportation job but i dont think its been totally confirmed 
with him yet she said 
skinner 50 has served since 1984 as chairman of the regional 
transportation authority of northeastern illinois the nations 
secondlargest mass transportation system a former us attorney in 
chicago skinner was bushs illinois campaign director a post he 
also held in bushs failed 1980 presidential bid 
for energy secretary fuller said tuesday that the bush team was 
looking for somebody who has got the technical scientific and 
management background to deal with problems of nuclear safety and 
waste storage peter johnson former head of the bonneville power 
administration based in portland ore and louisiana rep henson 
moore are still strong contenders he said 
a black educator dr louis sullivan president of morehouse 
school of medicine in atlanta is a strong candidate for secretary 
of health and human services said fuller 
other people fuller said are still in contention for various 
positions are rep jack kemp of new york a former presidential 
candidate who did not seek reelection this fall and former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole 
kemp is considered a contender for secretary of housing and urban 
development but fuller raised the possibility he might also be in 
the running for noncabinet jobs 
constance horner head of the office of personnel management is 
on a short list for labor secretary among other posts fuller 
said

six kidney dialysis machines were flown 
wednesday to victims of the armenian earthquake part of the 
emergency airlift that is encountering little of the usual soviet 
bureaucratic delays 
an aeroflot cargo plane was packed ceilingtofloor and 
walltowall with the blood purification devices donated by an 
armenian emigre group and two belgian universities 
flying with the machines were four doctors specializing in kidney 
ailments 
the international air bridge of life has brought tons of 
blankets tents and medical supplies for victims of the dec 7 
quake wednesdays flight organized by the belgian chapter of the 
humanitarian group doctors without borders also carried other 
supplies making a total weight of 33 tons 
doctors aboard the flight said hospitals in yerevan the armenian 
capital were still short of the dialysis machines needed to save 
victims with what doctors call crush syndrome 
dr gert a verpooten of antwerp sat aboard the cargo jet en 
route to yerevan reading a research paper on treating crush syndrome 
when muscles are crushed such as by crumbled buildlings in an 
earthquake they release toxic substances into the bloodstream that 
can slowly kill the victim if not removed by dialysis verpooten 
said 
crush syndrome could take many lives of armenian earthquake 
victims he said 
dialysis machines like most modern medical equipment and drugs 
are in short supply in the soviet union and the country had little 
choice but to look abroad for help 
in arranging the aid the normally securityconscious soviet 
government cut through mounds of red tape 
when a disaster relief team already in yerevan requested more 
kidney dialysis machines monday the organizations brussels office 
contacted the soviet embassy and aeroflot notorious for delayed 
flights and poor service arrangements were completed in one day 
with visas issued in hours 
i think its the enormity of the catastrophe said stephan 
van praet the teams leader noting that the soviets have been very 
cooperative 
but van praet said he was concerned the kidney dialysis machines 
might be damaged because they sat aboard the parked plane for hours 
in moscow in freezing weather while awaiting clearance to take off 
for yerevan 
foggy weather closed the yerevan airport for hours on wednesday 
but it was reopened later in the day

eighteen citizen groups urged the department of 
energy on wednesday to develop and make public a comprehensive 
assessment of environmental safety at the governments beleaguered 
nuclear weapons production and research facilities 
the groups led by the natural resources defense council 
released a letter to energy secretary john s herrington urging 
preparation of a programmatic environmental impact statement on 
the entire complex which involves 17 facilities employing some 
100000 people in 12 states 
it is time to take the wraps off what has been in effect the 
department of energys stealth program and to compel meaningful 
public scrutiny of its plans for the complex said dan w reicher 
an attorney for the council 
another attorney for the washingtonbased group jacob scherr 
told a news conference that we have seen a pattern of 
mismanagement excessive secrecy deceit illegality and neglect 
he asserted that at the heart of this crisis lies a growing 
lack of public trust in our nations nuclear weapons builders 
fundamental questions are being raised and rightly so about the 
capabilities and credibility of the department of energy to manage 
oversee and ensure the safety of this vast enterprise 
a doe spokeswoman christina sankey said the department had no 
immediate comment because officials had not yet seen the letter 
the move came one day after the nrdc and two other groups filed 
suit to compel the energy department to prepare an environmental 
impact statement on its sprawling savannah river plant in south 
carolina before any of the three weapons reactors there can be 
restarted 
savannah river is the only doe facility capable of producing 
tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the 
explosive yield of nuclear warheads because tritium decays at a 
rate of 55 percent a year it needs to be replenished regularly 
the head of an energy department advisory committee said 
wednesday that the panel is not supporting does plan to restart one 
of the reactors called the k reactor at savannah river because 
of continuing safety concerns the restart is tentatively scheduled 
for next summer 
john f ahearne chairman of the advisory committee on nuclear 
facilities safety said the panels position is stated in a letter 
expected to be sent to herrington later this week 
the overall gist of the letter is that were essentially 
declining to endorse the restart strategy we think it is 
insufficient to be used as the basis to go ahead and restart 
ahearne said in an interview 
problems identified by the advisory panel he said include the 
doe plans failure to include ultrasonic testing for potentially 
dangerous reactor piping cracks and insufficient attention to 
bolstering the savannah river reactors so they can better withstand 
earthquakes 
in both instances the citizen groups demanding action by doe 
invoked the 1969 national environmental policy act which requires 
environmental impact statements for any major federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
several members of congress in a separate letter to herrington 
endorsed the call for a programmatic environmental study of the 
weapons complex they included sens edward m kennedy dmass and 
timothy e wirth dcolo along with reps les aucoin dore 
albert bustamante dtexas mike synar dokla ron wyden dore 
bill green rny and claudine schneider rri 
the citizen groups in their letter to herrington noted that 
the nuclear warhead production complex is at a major crossroads in 
its 40year history 
activities planned by doe include construction of a variety of 
new production facilities major renovations across the complex 
decommissioning and decontamination of scores of facilities and 
cleanup of hundreds of waste sites the letter said 
it cited press reports that a classified doe study expected to be 
sent shortly to congress will propose spending 50 billion over the 
next 20 years for various renovation and upgrade programs 
in addition to the natural resources defense council other 
groups joining in the letter were 
citizen alert citizens against rocky flats contamination energy 
research foundation environmental action environmental policy 
institute government accountability project greenpeace hanford 
education action league national taxpayers union northwest 
environmental advocates northwest nuclear safety campaign

here is the text of the statement by ambassador 
vernon walters the chief us delegate to the united nations at 
the un general assemblys special session on palestine on 
wednesday 
the search for peace in the middle east has been a constant 
feature of united states policy american efforts helped bring about 
the disengagement of forces agreement between israel and egypt and 
between israel and syria american efforts helped bring about the 
camp david accords and the egyptianisraeli peace treaty the united 
states remains an active committed partner in the search for a 
comprehensive settlement achieved through negotiations 
in helping willing parties negotiate their differences the 
united states has always kept in mind a simple but abiding reality 
namely that no outside party can want peace more than the parties 
themselves want and need peace as such the united states has 
always opposed efforts to impose solutions from the outside 
concentrating instead on eliciting movement from the parties on the 
critical issues involved in the negotiations it is for these 
reasons that the united states will vote against the resolutions 
submitted during this debate 
in seeking to advance the prospects for negotiations leading to a 
comprehensive settlement this year the united states advanced a set 
of proposals that represent the core requirements of a successful 
process of accommodation 
the objective is a comprehensive settlement of the arabisraeli 
conflict through negotiations 
there is no substitute for direct negotiations between the 
parties concerned the parties to negotiations must accept to 
negotiate with each other 
an international conference may be useful insofar as it helps 
launch and support direct negotiations but a conference must not 
preempt or substitute for the direct negotiations 
the united nations security council established the basis of the 
negotiating process in resolutions 242 and 338 each party may have 
other positions and preferences that it wishes to bring to 
negotiations consistent with 242 and 338 but none can limit or 
avoid accepting 242 and 338 as the basis of negotiations 
negotiations must proceed in an atmosphere free of terrorism 
violence and intimidation 
these are valuable and enduring principles that need to be at the 
core of efforts to resolve the dispute additionally there should be 
a period of transition between the status quo and a final 
settlement this transitional period will help build confidence 
among the parties that negotiations work it will give the parties 
time to adjust to a new situation it will allow the parties to deal 
with each other differently gradually in light of an agreement 
freely negotiated 
movement toward peace starts with movement by the parties each 
side needs to adopt constructive policies aimed at realistic and 
pragmatic progress toward peace 
for israel the choice is clear albeit difficult in order to 
achieve the security it deserves and requires israel must face up 
to the need for withdrawal from occupied territories and to the need 
to accommodate legitimate palestinian political rights the extent 
shape and form of these issues need to be hammered out through 
negotiations but they must be addressed squarely 
for palestinians the choice is equally clear and equally 
difficult in order to achieve the legitimate political rights they 
deserve and require palestinian demands will have to accommodate 
the reality of israels existence and security needs and they will 
have to commit themselves to negotiations with israel 
for the other arabs the choices are equally important jordan 
syria and lebanon have a conflict with israel to resolve through 
negotiations their conflict will not be solved otherwise other 
arab states can help by sending signals of acceptance and 
reconciliation to israel they must talk to israel the absence of 
dialogue means continued stalemate 
for outside parties support and encouragement are the necessary 
elements a role for outside parties in peace making is not a right 
it must be earned it is time for the soviet union to restore full 
diplomatic relations with israel it is time for the peoples 
republic of china to recognize israel the parties need support to 
bring them together and the international community can provide 
that support 
these fundamental elements of a successful peace process can be 
encouraged through accommodations and reconciliation between 
israelis and palestinians this is not an easy task to accomplish 
it is very difficult for the parties to overcome prejudices and 
blind spots about each other it is sometimes equally difficult for 
the international community to lay aside political differences and 
expediencies and to adopt a realistic course toward a comprehensive 
settlement but the international community must speak with a 
realistic pragmatic voice 
we must tell the parties that their dispute is resolvable we 
must tell them that we are tired of this conflict and tired of their 
unwillingness to make fair compromises we must tell them the time 
has come to agree that a negotiated settlement is required 
so let us channel the energy that has gone into this debate in a 
positive realistic direction unbalanced resolutions are not the 
answer onesided statements are not the answer 
the answer is commitment to comprehensive peace the answer is 
negotiations based on security council resolutions 242 and 338 the 
answer is renunciation of violence and terrorism my government 
stands ready as always to assist in moving ahead in the search for 
peace

a faked car accident nearly covered up a 
strangulation say police who now have the victims husband in jail 
on firstdegree murder charges 
a county medical examiner originally ruled dawn mancini 27 died 
of injuries from a nov 15 car accident but the doctor said he knew 
a police investigation was continuing and did not authorize the 
hospital to release the body 
paul mancini 28 of merrimack is being held pending a 
preliminary hearing friday 
police would not say tuesday what aroused their suspicions 
following the latenight accident in amherst but according to a 
police affidavit released earlier tire marks contradicted mancinis 
story that he crashed after swerving to avoid a deer 
i think that without some good work by the amherst police and 
by dr roger fossum really its quite possible this would not 
have come to light assistant attorney general steven winer said 
tuesday 
dr jonathan shaw the hillsborough county medical examiner who 
examined the body agreed in a telephone interview tuesday that the 
error would have gone undetected had it not been for a call from the 
amherst police reporting their suspicions 
if the police hadnt called then i think an error would have 
been committed shaw said on the other hand the police did 
their job 
the police call led to an autopsy by fossum the states medical 
examiner and a forensic pathologist 
shaw said he signed the certificate with the investigation in 
progress because he wanted the body to be released promptly if the 
probe yielded nothing suspicious 
these are family tragedies ordinarily and there is often the 
impulse to try not to hold things up for the families said shaw 
he noted that while fossum is a forensic pathologist the county 
medical examiners generally are not serving parttime while they 
practice in their own specialties 
the rest of us are volunteers so to speak he said 
fossum agreed 
to me every death is a murder until proved otherwise he 
said the other examiners are generally surgeons and are not 
trained that way 
fossum said he spotted pinpoint hemorrhages on the womans face 
and in the whites of the eyes a sign of asphyxiation 
i believe he noted them but he wasnt quite sure what they 
meant fossum said of shaw within his context they were part 
of the accident its my job to think dirty 
fossums report said he also found bruises and what appeared to 
be fingernail marks on her neck

hes been charged with and the investigation is ongoing said 
thomas gibney a spokesman for bristol county district attorney 
ronald a pina the search is still on and investigators are 
still running down leads 
gibney said investigators have interviewed a list of suspects in 
connection with the deaths of six women whose partially clad remains 
have been found in a six to eightmile radius along interstate 195 
and route 140 in dartmouth and freetown he declined wednesday to 
say whether anderson who officials also said has worked as a 
truckdriver had been among those questioned 
pina has said he believed the six killings the oldest of which 
dates to the spring were likely the victims of the same killer or 
killers and that the victims all had ties to new bedfords weld 
square neighborhood known for prostitution and drugs 
he has been charged with only one crime i think that to try to 
link that to any other events is very unfair said james m quinn 
the public defender representing anderson 
judge john a markey scheduled a pretrial hearing dec 21 in new 
bedford district court anderson will also appear at that time on 
charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an 
unrelated fight quinn said 
records show that anderson a divorced father of two who lives 
with his mother and grandmother was convicted in 1974 of assault 
and battery and in 1981 of attempted breaking and entering 
authorities arrested anderson 10 days after the standardtimes of 
new bedford published an interview with a woman who accused him of 
driving her against her will to a secluded area of dartmouth and 
raping her at knifepoint along interstate 195 
anderson allegedly sought the victim out after the interview 
appeared and followed her in a van glaring in her direction 
markey said in a written statement released after the arraignment 
she was able to get the license number he was also identified by 
a witness to the above event 
the woman reportedly a former prostitute identified andersons 
photograph in a lineup on dec 8 she said she had not initially 
gone to police out of fear no one would believe her 
state police dogs and a trained dog from connecticut continued 
their search wednesday for more victims in woods outside of new 
bedford where the bodies have been found

federal revenue agents said wednesday they 
are giving 4400 pounds of sugar from a moonshine raid to an 
orphanage just in time for the chef to make extra holiday sweets 
for the children 
it couldnt be timed better said bobby cobbs a spokesman at 
virginia baptist childrens home and family services in salem 
normally families do a lot of baking at christmas time that they 
wouldnt do at any other time of the year well go through this 
sugar rather quickly weve been doing a lot of dreaming figuring 
out what we can do with it 
us district judge james c turk filed an order on wednesday 
that will allow the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to 
dispose of the dixie crystal sugar along with 100 pounds of wheat 
bran two pounds of yeast and 576 onegallon jugs seized this fall 
in a moonshine investigation 
defendants william gray stanley ricky lee dent and michael keith 
crook are to be tried jan 18 on charges of illegally running a 
still and possessing mash and untaxed liquor lawyers reached an 
agreement that will let the government use its sugar as evidence 
even though it will have been given to the orphans 
the federal agent in charge of the roanoke bureau jim silvey 
said federal authorities wanted to put the sugar to use instead of 
letting it go to waste in a storage bin 
what weve done in the past is dispose of it in the federal 
penitentiaries but the closest one is in west virginia silvey 
said we figured if the moonshine was in virginia we could use it 
here we just wanted to do something with it other than let it get 
hard it wouldnt be fit for human consumption if it gets critters 
in it 
the sugar will be turned over to orphanage workers thursday 
cobbs said the orphanage has 72 children with 10 to 20 expected 
to stay there over the holidays as the others visit relatives as a 
general rule the children have been taken from parents because of 
such problems as sexual abuse 
we call them orphans of the living or emotional orphans 
cobbs said for all intents and purposes they are orphans 
although they have living parents 
the sugar valued at about 1500 will be quite a windfall for 
the orphanage which has an annual food budget of 106000 cobbs 
said

a federal judge refused wednesday to stop the 
city from selling a house rebuilt on property where police attacked 
and killed 11 members of the radical group move 
us district judge louis pollak dismissed a lawsuit by louise 
james who claimed the property still belonged to her 
the row house is one of 61 rebuilt at a cost of more than 8 
million after the city destroyed them with a bomb in a 1985 attempt 
to evict move members from their barricaded headquarters in ms 
james house 
ms james whose brother move founder john africa and her son 
frank died with nine others in the house went to federal court 
seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the city from selling 
the building which has been unoccupied since it was rebuilt in 
mid1986 
pollak noting ms james had accepted 2000 plus 280 interest 
13 months ago for the land her house stood on said she waited too 
long to file her lawsuit he said the statute of limitations ran out 
in june 1987 
i am satisfied that the failure of a legal federal claim 
requires me to dismiss the entire case the judge said the 
request for a temporary restraining order falls by the wayside 
because there is no controversy before me 
we can now proceed to sell the house which we intend to do 
said city solicitor seymour kurland 
he said the case has nothing to do with whether ms james is 
entitled to compensation only whether she is entitled to the house 
kurland acknowledged that ms james claim for compensation for 
the burned down building is still alive and that she is seeking 30 
million 
the amount she wants is ridiculous but it will eventually be 
settled in court he said contending the value of the original 
property was around 25000 even though the cost to rebuild the 
homes escalated to more than 125000 
kurland said the judges dismissal of ms james claim will calm 
fears of neighborhood residents who oppose return of move which 
kept the area in turmoil for years before the fire 
the neighbors who had been living in mortal fear that shed 
come back can now live in peace kurland said 
ms james contended that selling the house would cause her 
irreparable harm and deprive her of her constitutional right to her 
property 
move was a selfstyled religious organization that declined to 
abide by city laws including those involving sanitation and used 
threats and sometimes violence to harass neighbors 
federal and city grand juries declined to indict anyone 
including mayor w wilson goode who ordered the bomb dropped in the 
deaths of the 11 move members five of them children 
goode took responsibility but insisted his action wasnt criminal 
ms james has branded the mayor a murderer and continues to 
demand that he and the former police and fire commissioners also 
involved in the decision be prosecuted

the soviet union has notified the united states 
it is destroying radar facilities at gomel that president reagan 
told congress violated a superpower arms control treaty the state 
department said wednesday 
however the installation at krasnoyarsk remains in dispute 
department spokesman charles e redman again called for its 
destruction 
redman said the united states would not reciprocate for the 
soviet decision on gomel a violation is a violation he said 
reagan claimed in his report to congress last week that portable 
equipment had been moved to the byelorussian city in violation of 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty the treaty limits us and 
soviet radar on the theory a nuclear attack is less likely to be 
launched if devastating retaliation would follow 
redman said destruction of the gomel radar when fully carried 
out and verified will satisfy our concerns regarding the illegal 
deployment of these radars 
the soviets informed the united states that destruction of the 
gomel installation began last friday according to a us official 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
redman said the soviet decision underscored the importance of 
continuing the reagan administrations policy of firmness with 
regard to soviet treaty violations 
however redman said the more crucial issue of the soviet 
violation at krasnoyarsk remains unresolved the krasnoyarsk radar 
is a significant violation of a central element of the abm treaty 
which will continue to make it impossible for the us to conclude any 
future strategic arms agreements 
the two sides had agreed in geneva last month to resume work on a 
treaty o sharply reduce longrange nuclear bombers missiles and 
submarines 
redman rejected again a soviet proposal to turn the krasnoyarsk 
installation in siberia into an international space research 
facility it would not remove the treatyprohibited radar 
capability he said nor would it restore the lead time the 
reagan administration contends krasnoyarsk would provide for 
mounting a defense against us ballistic missiles 
what the soviets propose would allow them to move forward with 
work on the illegal radar with no guarantees that the 
international scientists could not be expelled at a moments 
notice redman said

yasser arafat the plo chairman today said he 
renounces terrorism and insisted that his past statements mean he 
recognizes the right of israel to live in peace and security 
his comments came at a news conference one day after us 
officials said his speech tuesday before the un general assembly 
did not meet us conditions for accepting the plo in peace 
negotiations 
those conditions are explicit recognition of israel renunciation 
of terrorism and agreement with un resolutions 242 and 338 
i repeat for the second time that we totally and absolutely 
renounce all forms of terrorism including individual terrorism 
group and the state terrorism he said of the palestine liberation 
organization 
he said he made clear tuesday the plo accepts the right of all 
parties concerned in the middle east complex to exist in peace and 
security and as i have mentioned including the state of palestine 
israel and other neighbors 
he said the plo accepts un resolutions 242 and 338 which call 
for israeli withdrawl from occupied lands and acceptance of the 
right of all states in the middle east to safe and secure borders 
but arafat showed impatience over a question asking him to say 
yes or no on whether the accepts israel 
didnt you read my statement he asked its entirely 
clear what do you want do you want me to do a strip tease it 
would be unseemly 
earlier today the us ambassador to the united nations vernon 
walters urged israel to recognize the need to withdraw from the 
territories it occupies and to accommodate legitimate palestinian 
political rights 
the comment came in a speech by walters that never explicitly 
mentioned the plo or arafat the speech reiterated longstanding us 
policy calling for israels withdrawal from occupied lands for peace 
with its arab neighbors 
earlier today the israeli delegate said the plo remains 
committed to the elimination of the jewish state and can never be a 
negotiating partner for it 
walters said there is no substitute for direct negotiations 
between the parties in the middle east conflict and did not rule out 
the plo as participant palestinians he said will have to commit 
themselves to negotiations with israel 
apparently responding to arafats call for an international 
middle east peace conference walters said such a meeting may be 
useful insofar as it helps launch and support direct negotiations 
but cannot not substitute for them we must tell them the parties 
involved that we are tired of this conflict and tired of their 
unwillingness to make fair compromises he said 
before walters spoke israels un ambassador johanan bein 
said vague phraseology of the plos declaration of statehood 
cannot hide the plos commitment to the common denominator that 
unites all its factions the path of rejection violence and 
terror 
therefore bein said the plo can never be a negotiating 
partner with israel several members of the plo delegation walked 
out during beins speech 
bein also made no reference to arafats speech in which the plo 
leader appealed for direct unsupervised talks with israel and 
presented a threestage peace initiative 
arafat asked israel and other nations to come here under the 
sponsorship of the united nations so that together we can forge 
that peace 
arafats peace initiative called for starting with a serious 
effort under un guidance to set up an international middle east 
peace conference 
he proposed that occupied palestinian land be placed under 
un supervision with an international force deployed to protect 
the palestinians and oversee withdrawal of israeli troops he did 
not specify whether he was referring only to the west bank and gaza 
occupied by israel in 1967 
but arafat upset some when he paid tribute to the yearlong 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip at least 323 palestinians and 13 israelis have died in the 
revolt 
the us state department said arafat failed to recognize 
explicitly israels right to exist a washington precondition for 
recognizing the plo 
the state department tried through public and private diplomacy 
to persuade the plo to renounce terrorism in all forms and expand on 
its declaration of independence last month by explicitly recognizing 
israels right to exist 
on the issue of terrorism arafat said i as chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization hereby once more declare that i 
condemn terrorism in all its forms but he immediately added he 
also was saluting those sitting before me who in the days when 
they fought to free their countries from the yoke of colonialism 
were accused of terrorism by their oppressors and who today are the 
faithful leaders of their peoples

a nationwide strike called by communist and 
socialist unions paralyzed spain on wednesday halting work at major 
industries closing state offices and choking public transportation 
to a trickle 
union leaders called spains first general strike in 54 years a 
complete success police reported sporadic violence and made at 
least 30 arrests 
the government has to bow to the evidence and accept with 
elegance the fact that this strike has been a total success said 
anton saracibar second in command of the socialist general workers 
union 
jose manuel de la parra spokesman for the communistdominated 
workers commissions said the strike succeeded beyond our greatest 
expectations 
parra and saracibar estimated 78 million of 118 million 
employed spaniards stayed away from work to protest government 
austerity measures 
government spokesman miguel gil said the strike call had been 
heeded by a large sector of the population and has caused a 
significant impact on labor activity although in varying degrees in 
different sectors 
the three major business associations accused union picketers of 
strongarmed tactics to force small businesses and offices to 
close after they opened wednesday 
socialist leader jose maria benegas said people stayed away out 
of fear and intimidation madrids socialist mayor juan barranco 
said people had to admit the strike succeeded in keeping most of the 
citys 4 million people at home 
general motors spokesman rafael casas said only 250 
administrative employees showed up at their opel plant which 
employs 9100 in zaragoza 
spanish national railways spokeswoman alicia acebes said 7 
percent of the companys 54000 employees showed up in accordance 
with minimum service agreements 
in an unusual action binding them for the first time since spain 
returned to democracy 11 years ago the general workers union and 
the workers commissions called the strike to force prime minister 
felipe gonzalez 6yearold government to change its economic 
policies and meet demands for wage increases unemployment benefits 
and pensions 
the unions claim large groups among spains 38 million people 
have not benefited from an economic boom that reversed once stagnant 
growth rate to 5 percent a year and dropped inflation nine points to 
51 percent 
but this has not dented spains 187 percent unemployment rate 
the highest in europe 
in barcelona the countrys second largest city police said some 
55000 strikes marched in festive mood wednesday evening 
thousands of demonstrators also marched peacefully in vigo 
gijon bilbao oviedo vitoria and valencia 
unions called a similar march for friday in madrid 
gonzalez told a news conference wednesday that he would not call 
early elections because of the strike general elections are due in 
1990 
recent polls indicate if elections were held now the socialists 
would win another majority polls also indicate 45 percent of 
spaniards felt the call for a general strike was justified

the health minister on wednesday defended the 
soviet response to the armenian earthquake but said specially 
trained emergency relief teams still must be set up to respond to 
future such disasters 
the soviet union needs to establish a special system of 
helicopters planes mobile hospitals and personnel said health 
minister yevgeny chazov 
asked at a news conference about a report carried on official 
radio moscow chazov denied he had said the response to the 
earthquake showed the complete bankruptcy of soviet civil 
defense 
the official moscow news weekly also sharply criticized the lack 
of an emergency force for dealing with disasters in the wake of the 
dec 7 armenian earthquake that has killed at least 55000 people 
it said the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion and several 
major railroad accidents had proven the need for such a force 
we are thankful to all who flew in from abroad to save those 
who were suffering in armenia moscow news said but we cannot 
reconcile ourselves to the fact that our professionals did not 
arrive on the scene of the disaster before them 
chazov has been a serious critic of the quality of soviet health 
care but he said medical services responded well to the emergency 
the centralized soviet system was able to quickly move doctors 
and nurses into place even though there was no specially trained 
and ready force he added 
however he said i think we have to have a better effort of 
channeling our efforts in specific directions 
doctors conducted complicated operations in field conditions or 
even in the open air during the first hours after the earthquake he 
said 
more than 9150 people were hospitalized including almost 4500 
who are in yerevan hospitals now and 275 of the most severely 
injured people who have been sent to moscow 
chazov said 242 people had died in yerevan hospitals and eight 
others had died in moscow

britain on wednesday urged the 
irish government to review its extradition laws during a chilly 
meeting following irelands refusal to extradite a priest suspected 
of terrorism 
in london british officials said they were considering an irish 
request for evidence to prosecute the roman catholic priest patrick 
ryan at a nonjury trial 
in the house of commons british attorney general sir patrick 
mayhew said the irish decision not to extradite ryan on grounds he 
would not get a fair trial in britain was regrettably offensive 
the clash over ryan and british anger at what some officials see 
as irish government reluctance to extradite irish republican army 
suspects overshadowed a regularly scheduled meeting between 
officials in belfast 
northern ireland secretary tom king the top british official in 
the province said after the sixhour meeting that the irish 
government gave the undertaking that they would review the 
operation of the extradition act and we shall now be requesting 
them to do that 
the meeting was called as part of a review of the operations of 
the 1985 angloirish agreement which gave dublin a consultative say 
in the british administration of protestantdominated northern 
ireland 
king dismissed speculation that britain might scrap the accord 
because of the present crisis saying it was especially important as 
a forum for the sort of blunt speaking that we did have today 
king met at stormont castle his administrative headquarters 
with irish foreign minister brian lenihan 
protestant politicians long opposed to the agreement said the 
ryan affair showed the accord wasnt working and demanded that it be 
scrapped 
ryan 58 was arrested in brussels in june with a forged passport 
and manuals on bombmaking belgium sent him back to ireland nov 25 
after he began a hunger strike to protest being extradited to 
britain 
the belgian government said the british extradition warrants were 
too vague they alleged conspiracy to murder and cause explosions 
and illegal possessing explosives unlawfully and with intent to 
endanger life 
ryan has denied he was a member and fundraiser for the outlawed 
ira which is fighting to unite northern ireland with the 
overwhelmingly catholic irish republic 
irish attorney general john murray said tuesday that ryan would 
not be extradited because british politicians and newspapers had 
prejudiced the court case by attacking the priest in intemperate 
language and extravagantly worded headlines 
prime minister margaret thatcher on tuesday called the irish 
announcement a great insult to all of the people of this country 
britain has complained that the irish republic has unilaterally 
stiffened extradition reqiuirements by stipulating approval by the 
attorney general not by the courts 
ryan could be prosecuted in the republic under a 1976 law which 
allows suspects to be tried in either country for some crimes 
committed in the other but he could not be tried on two of the 
charges conspiracy to murder and unlawful possession of explosives 
ryan who is at an undisclosed place in the irish republic with a 
religious order has said if he were arraigned under this act he 
would start another fast 
irish prime minister charles haugheys handling of the ryan 
affair has helped boost his popularity to a record 62 percent in an 
irish times poll published monday

a teenager convicted wednesday of killing 
a state lawmaker after the legislator left a latenight poker game 
was described as a frightened young boy 
the testimony came as a jury was meeting to decide whether 
18yearold bernard williams should receive the death penalty or 
life imprisonment after it found him guilty in the slaying and 
robbery of rep william telek whose body was dumped on a suburban 
street early on may 17 williams was arrested later that day driving 
teleks car 
the jury reached the verdict after six hours of deliberations 
over two days 
telek was last seen alive in the capitol garage by a friend who 
dropped him off at his car following the poker game at a fellow 
lawmakers apartment prosecutors said the case prompted a review 
of security at the capitol 
prosecutors said williams beat telek in the head with a hammer 
dumped his body in the middle of a suburban harrisburg street and 
stole about 100 and the lawmakers car police found the hammer in 
williams bedroom 
williams testified he took the car from an acquaintance and found 
the hammer in the car 
as jurors weighed whether to impose the death sentence 
psychologist stanley schneider of harrisburg said williams presents 
a false front of bravado but behind that is a frightened young 
boy 
he said williams was isolated and rejected during his life which 
included 13 or 14 stops in foster homes or detention centers 
schneider said williams was put in a fostercare program when he was 
9 after a sibling was killed by one of his parents 
after the verdict was announced williams mother christine 
left the courtroom sobbing 
in my heart i know he is innocent she said if that man 
wasnt a state representative you all wouldnt be here i 
sympathize with mrs telek but my son was not the killer 
teleks wife leona lee left the courtroom surrounded by friends 
and relatives and did not comment to reporters 
senate president pro tem robert jubelirer said its certainly 
not a happy day it simply highlights the tragedy of the situation 
when a very decent man was brutally murdered im looking forward to 
putting this behind us

the united states on wednesday vetoed a 
security council resolution deploring israels raid last week on a 
palestinian base camp in lebanon in which an israeli officer and 
nine guerrillas died 
israel launched the raid friday on the camp in the coastal town 
of naameh nine miles south of beirut then mounted a massive air 
land and sea barrage to rescue four israeli soldiers trapped by the 
guerrillas 
the draft resolution vetoed by the united states deplored the 
attack called on israel to withdraw from all occupied lebanese 
territory and to refrain from other attacks 
israel controls a six to ninemilewide strip of lebanese 
territory along the border the israelis say they need to police the 
zone to prevent palestinian guerrillas from launching attacks into 
israel 
us ambassador patricia m byrne the thirdranking diplomat at 
the us mission said the united states opposed the draft 
resolution because it criticizes the actions of one party while 
ignoring the attacks and reprisals that have originated on the other 
side of the border 
this resolution would deny to israel its inherent right to 
defend itself she said 
so long as extremist elements continue to use the area for 
launching hostile attacks against israel southern lebanon will not 
enjoy stability miss byrne added 
lebanese ambassador rachid fakhoury told the council that 
mindboggling details about the israeli attack have been 
revealed 
he said israeli forces used dogs strapped with explosives and 
tear gas canisters in last weeks attack on guerrillas of the 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command an 
extremist faction that opposes yasser arafats mainstream palestine 
liberation organization 
he said that since israel attaches no importance to nonisraelis 
how then could it be expected to give any importance or show any 
mercy to animals 
popular front commander ahmed jibril said friday the israelis 
used the dogs to flush the guerrillas out of their underground 
tunnel network 
the israeli government had no comment on the palestinian and 
lebanese reports of the methods used in the raid on naameh 
israeli ambassador david matnai said his countrys only 
motivation was to protect its population from repeated attacks 
emanating from lebanese territory 
the israeli ambassador alleged popular front guerrillas had sent 
him a letter containing a bomb but he did not say when 
the resolution sponsored by the nonaligned nations drew 14 
affirmative security council votes and no abstentions but the 
negative vote by the united states a permanent member was 
sufficient to defeat it under council rules 
the other permanent members of the security council are the 
soviet union france britain and china the nonpermanent council 
members are algeria argentina brazil italy japan nepal 
senegal west germany yugoslavia and zambia

it may be clouds of steel but it looks 
like something that fell over no it looks like one of those 
contraptions in a gravel quarry no its an industrial pier no 
its art no its 
whatever it is the design that won a competition for a proposed 
multimilliondollar west coast gateway monument leaves few observers 
undecided about whether it would be a majestic answer to the statue 
of liberty or a monstrous mishmash 
the gateway would be a scattering of structures shaped as 
squares cones and rectangles containing museums theaters gardens 
and aquariums built over a downtown stretch of the hollywood 
freeway to honor the city as the nations center of modern 
immigration 
the design by hani rashid of new york and associate lise ann 
couture may be the latest rage in architecture deconstructivism 
or maybe not but people know what they like and what they dont no 
matter what its called 
los angeles answer to the statue of liberty belongs right 
where much of its construction material will come from the scrap 
heap said an editorial in the suburban daily breeze evening 
outlook and news pilot 
brace yourself radio station knx editorialized its 
creators call it the west coast gateway las answer to the statue 
of liberty a monument to immigration knx just calls it ugly real 
ugly 
it is unbelievably hideous grotesque and monstrous wrote 
herald examiner columnist gordon dillow and it must be stopped 
the los angeles times liked the design but didnt think it should 
be built in the miserable fourblock stretch atop the freeway 
the designers have offered innovative concepts celebrating the 
ethnic diversity of the nation the cultural roots of the community 
that has been enriched by that diversity and the need to bring into 
the civic center an exciting focal point that bears witness to this 
heritage as well as the vitality of contemporary life the times 
said 
clouds of steel was selected by a jury from 150 entries in a 
competition initiated by mayor tom bradley the mayor has not made 
any comment on the choice since it was announced dec 6 
nick patsaouras chairman of the gateway project on wednesday 
agreed that the mayor should leave such matters to his cultural 
affairs commissioners and he criticized two city council members who 
had negative reactions 
how can you express an opinion on such a fundamental vision 
from a copy of a picture without seeing the model without talking 
with the artist to see his vision patsaouras said 
but the furor shows that people are taking it seriously and as a 
debate over the future of los angeles he said its a project 
that entails passion every place i go people are discussing 
it 
the structure would cost 33 million but that does not include 
other costs such as leasing airspace over the freeway from the state 
department of transportation patsaouras had no estimates for any of 
the other costs 
the committee will begin seeking funding from private donors at 
the beginning of the new year he said he hopes to have plans 
permits and construction on the first of four phases under way in 1 
to two years 
critics have pointedly noted that the designers are from new york 
the suburban papers called it a meaningless pile of scrap and 
suggested that funding for the praying mantislike monstrosity 
designed by two new yorkers could be better spent on housing and 
food for the homeless 
this atrocity was designed by new yorkers approved by an 
elitist panel and will be financed by private donations knx said 
the gateway would contain an immigration museum museums of the 
pacific and atlantic oceans the park of peace and unity a 
performance theater called the sphinx a restaurant in a 
construction called the big dipper a time museum sculpture garden 
a musical forest liquid crystal display screens called voices of 
the people a painting gallery and a food of the world section in 
an area called the little dipper 
peter frank art critic for la weekly had a positive initial 
reaction but cautioned that the freeway site could hamper inevitable 
design changes 
i predict the whole thing will wind up less exciting than 
its proposed to be he said 
i think that its a pretty exciting thing visually i just hope 
its set up at a place where traffic tends to be slow so that it 
doesnt cause any fender benders

vietnam intends to return on thursday what 
could be the largest single group of remains of american servicemen 
missing from the vietnam war the pentagon said wednesday 
the defense department in a statement said the repatriation had 
been scheduled in hanoi and would include what the vietnamese 
believe were the remains of 38 individuals 
the largest previous repatriation which occurred in april 
totaled 27 individuals 
the vietnamese government also claims it will have other 
unspecified information to share with the united states about 
the status of 12 additional cases of missing americans said lt 
col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman 
arrangements have been made to receive the remains in hanoi and 
fly them to the us army central identification laboratory in 
hawaii for subsequent evaluation in an effort to achieve individual 
identification the pentagon said in its statement 
the us government appreciates the initiative taken by vietnam 
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing 
cooperation to resolve this longstanding issue 
the pentagon said it had not received any information from 
vietnam on precisely where the various remains had been recovered or 
the circumstances surrounding their discovery 
schneider added however that we understand the remains as 
well as the information are related to incidents that occurred 
during the war in the northern provinces 
thats all we know at this point the spokesman said 
currently 2383 americans continue to be listed as missing in 
indochina as a result of the vietnam war of whom 1747 are listed 
as missing in either north or south vietnam 
all told the remains of 172 americans have been repatriated to 
the united states from vietnam and subsequently identified by the 
army lab since the end of the war 
the pentagon in its statement wednesday noted the upcoming 
repatriation would be the seventh since a special presidential 
mission was undertaken by retired army gen john vessey the former 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff went to vietnam at president 
reagans request in august 1987 with orders to seek greater 
cooperation with the vietnamese in resolving the cases of missing 
americans 
in the past remains repatriated by vietnam occasionally have 
included those of vietnamese individuals as a result the pentagon 
routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be 
individually identified by the army laboratory in honolulu

a 17yearold boy was arrested after a predawn 
bank heist wednesday and police said he was part of a gang that has 
been stealing coins from as many as 40 banks since july 
timothy spurill of brooklyn was charged with several counts of 
burglary after officers found him in the vicinity of a smashed 
window at a manufacturers hanover bank in the borough of queens 
said officer peter phieffer 
spurill who was suspected of acting as a lookout had 30 in 
coins in his pocket at the time of his arrest phieffer said 
police said two other suspects escaped it was not known how much 
money in coins were taken from the bank police said 
the three are believed to belong to a gang responsible for at 
least 25 and as many as 40 similar heists at banks in queens said 
sgt thomas delaney head of the policefbi joint bank robbery task 
force 
investigators estimate the gang averaged 1000 in coins per 
heist 
sometimes the burden of crime was too much for the gang to carry 
at times they had problems getting it the wrapped coins out and 
they would leave it on the streets delaney said 
investigators said the robbery spree began in july when the gang 
staged three predawn bank heists in a week 
they used a brick or a rock to smash the banks plate glass 
window delaney said a very sophisticated means of entry 
once the window was smashed theyre in and out in 60 seconds 
the sergeant said they know in advance where theyre going 
the gang specialized in stealing coins because thats all 
thats in the bank at the time since paper currency is usually 
locked in vaults overnight delaney said the coins were in tellers 
drawers that had to be jimmied open 
the burglars would also take portable computers off bank 
employees desks if there werent enough coins to carry the 
sergeant added

the state department took a cautious stance 
wednesday on the possibility of a multimilliondollar landmark home 
being turned over as a gift for future secretaries of state to use 
as their residence 
if any such proposal were made to the department we would need 
to review it in the light of applicable law and policy spokesman 
charles e redman said 
gwendolyn cafritz a washington philanthropist and socialite who 
died nov 29 had a provision in her will that her home could become 
the official residence of the secretary of state but an 
appropriation bill sponsored by sen jesse helms rnc might be a 
barrier said william p rogers an executor of the estate 
mrs cafritz who was 78 left the house on fashionable foxhall 
road to the morris and gwendolyn d cafritz foundation rogers said 
the will was broad enough for the home to go to the secretary of 
state or to be used as an adjunct to blair house the official 
residence of prominent foreign visitors or by scholars holding 
seminars 
referring to the helms bill rogers said by telephone from his 
new york law office it could be a problem he said disposition 
of the house was in a preliminary stage 
the former secretary of state said nobody from the state 
department had anything to do with this its just what she wanted 
that was one of the possibilities that she had in mind 
helms and his aides were out of town and could not be reached for 
comment 
mrs cafritzs husband morris died in 1964 he was a prominent 
builder in the period when washington was in the process of changing 
from a small town to a highpowered city that is now one of the 
worlds most expensive cities to live in 
the cafritz house a 1938 art moderne residence is on a 
sevenacre estate that is assessed for tax purposes at 3567650 by 
the district of columbia and could be worth considerably more 
the appropriations bill passed by the senate last december at the 
urging of helms contains a ban on honoraria for secretaries of state

police arrested a suspect on wednesday 
in the assassination nearly three years ago of prime minister olof 
palme and news reports described him as a convicted killer with a 
long criminal record 
the arrest could be the first break in an investigation that has 
been marred by internal squabbles and prompted accusations of 
incompetence by parlimentary and independent commissions no motive 
or solid leads emerged despite the biggest manhunt in swedish 
history and an 8 million reward 
chief prosecutor axel morath decided to have the suspect formally 
arrested after he was detained earlier wednesday he can be held for 
two days and then either released or formally charged 
during lengthy interrogation the suspect denied he was the 
person who shot palme on feb 28 1986 while the swedish leader and 
his wife were walking home from a movie without bodyguards the 
prosecutor said in a statement he read on on television 
he said the man under arrest is reasonably suspected of having 
committed the deed prosecutors and police refused to say why the 
man is suspected or answer other questions on the case wednesday 
under swedish regulations a suspect cannot be identified by name 
even after charges are filed 
newspapers described the suspect as a man of 41 with a history of 
violent crime including a manslaughter conviction for stabbing a 
drug addict to death with a bayonet in 1970 a few blocks from where 
palme was killed state radio said he had been treated in a 
psychiatric ward for dangerous criminals 
the national news agency tt reported 63 offenses on the mans 
record it said witnesses were expected to be summoned to confront 
the suspect including palmes widow lisbet who was grazed by a 
bullet in the attack 
according to the media reports the man was questioned and 
released earlier in the investigation and came under renewed 
suspicion when a new chief investigator hans olvebro took over the 
inquiry 13 months ago and reopened old files for review 
national radio said witnesses cast doubt on the mans assertion 
he was in a nearby restaurant at the time of the shooting and it 
quoted the witnesses as saying he left earlier 
he also has a limp which fits accounts from witnesses that the 
killer walked in a jerky way while following the palmes for 
several blocks after they left the theater the radio reported it 
said he was detained at his home in the sollentuna suburb and his 
house was searched 
wednesdays arrest was the first movement reported in the case 
since the former chief investigator hans holmer rounded up kurdish 
exiles two years ago and accused them of being part of an 
international conspiracy they were released without charges 
the stalled case indirectly led to a political scandal this year 
when ranking government officials approved an unofficial 
investigation by publisher ebbe carlsson justice minister 
annagreta leijon was forced to resign 
palme who served 11 years as prime minister in four terms was a 
controversial figure deeply involved in world disarmament issues and 
served as a unappointed mediator in the iraniraq war he was the 
first swedish leader to die violently in two centuries 
his murder was a severe jolt to a nation with a tendency to see 
itself as immune to the terrorism crime and assassination common in 
other parts of the world

employers whose workers are killed or injured 
on the job can be prosecuted for murder manslaughter or assault 
under state laws and cannot seek refuge under federal workplace 
safety laws the justice department said in an opinion made public 
wednesday 
the department responding to a request from the house government 
operations committee said criminal penalties in the 1970 
occupational safety and health act do not preempt state and local 
criminal laws 
we see nothing in the act or its legislative history which 
indicates that congress intended for the relatively limited criminal 
penalities provided by the act to deprive employees of the 
protection provided by state criminal laws of general 
applicability the department said 
the opinion dated last friday and released wednesday by the 
house panels subcommittee on employment and housing flies in the 
face of several recent state court rulings throwing out criminal 
convictions against employers whose workers were injured through 
violations of federal job safety standards 
rep tom lantos dcalif the subcommittees chairman said he 
welcomed what he called the long overdue statement dealing with 
the issue 
i am pleased that justice agrees with us and squarely rejects 
the position that the federal osha law shields employers who show 
willful disregard for worker safety from state criminal 
prosecution lantos said 
in a hearing before the subcommittee last february prosecutors 
from several states testified about indictments being dismissed and 
convictions overturned because judges had ruled that the osha law 
preempts state prosecution 
judges in colorado new york illinois texas and michigan have 
ruled that federal enforcement of safety standards preempts state 
criminal prosecutions of employers however judges in wisconsin 
have ruled just the opposite 
the issue is expected to reach the us supreme court eventually 
possibly through a case now before the illinois supreme court 
in that case cook county prosecutors won indictments on criminal 
charges of aggravated battery reckless conduct and assault against 
chicago magnet wire corp and five of its officials for allegedly 
exposing workers to phosgene and other toxic gases 
however before the case went to trial the illinois appellate 
court dismissed the indictments as being a preemption of the 
federal osha law

here is the text of a statement in english by 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization at 
the opening of a press conference wednesday 
let me highlight my views before you our desire for peace is a 
strategy and not an interim tactic we are bent to peace come what 
may our statehood provides salvation to the palestinians and peace 
to both palestinians and israelis selfdetermination means survival 
for the palestinians and our survival does not destroy the survival 
of the israelis as their rulers claim yesterday in my speech i made 
a reference to the united nations resolution 181 on the partition 
of palestine as the basis for palestinian independence i also made 
a reference to our acceptance of resolutions 242 and 338 as the 
basis for negotiations with israel within the framework of an 
international conference these three resolutions were endorsed at 
our palestinian national council session in algiers 
in my speech also yesterday it was clear that we mean our 
peoples right to freedom and national independence according to 
resolution 181 and the right of all parties concerned in the middle 
east conflict to exist in peace and security and as i have mentioned 
including the state of palestine and israel and other neighbors 
according to the resolution 242 and 338 
as for terrorism i renounced it yesterday in no uncertain terms 
and yet i repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely 
renounce all forms of terrorism including individual group and 
state terrorism between geneva and algiers we have made our 
position crystal clear 
any more talk such as the palestinians should give more you 
remember this slogan the palestinians should give it more or it 
is not enough or the palestinians are engaging in propaganda games 
and public relations exercise will be damaging and counterproductive 
enough is enough enough is enough enough is enough all 
remaining matters should be discussed around the table and within 
the international conference let it be absolutely clear that 
neither arafat nor any one else for that matter can stop the 
intifadeh the uprising the intifadeh will come to an end only and 
only when practical and tangible steps have been taken towards the 
achievement of our national aims and the establishment of our 
independent palestinian state 
in this context i expect the eec european economic community to 
play a more effective role in promoting peace in our region they 
have political responsibility they have moral responsibility and 
they can deal with it 
finally i declare before you and i ask you to kindly quote me on 
that we want peace we want peace we are committed to peace we 
want to live in our palestinian state and let live

grieving relatives of an inmate who was 
listed among the dead in a prison blaze were told he was alive in a 
hospital as they gathered at a funeral home a newspaper reported 
wednesday 
the family was told jesus morales sustaita was in serious 
condition at the university hospital 
the charred body in the casket mistakenly had been identified as 
morales by his brother who saw part of a tattoo on the mans chest 
the daily monterrey newspaper el norte reported 
relatives took the body to a funeral home and were mourning when 
police informed them the 23yearold inmate had been located at the 
hospital el norte said 
the family cheered up and forgot the other body which was 
returned to the morgue by the funeral home the newspaper said 
three other prisoners also remain hospitalized in serious 
condition from tuesdays fire which killed 19 inmates at the nuevo 
leon state penitentiary authorities believe the blaze started when 
a candle near an altar in a prison cell set a curtain on fire 
hospital spokesman roberto garza said morales and the others were 
in serious condition 
prisoners were allowed to set up shrines to the virgin of 
guadalupe on monday a holiday honoring the patron saint of this 
mostly roman catholic country 
the university hospital morgue wednesday confirmed the death toll 
stood at 19 although prison officials had earlier set it at 20 
including morales 
in another tragic twist newspapers reported that gilberto valle 
coronado had been jailed on a firstoffense charge of illegally 
carrying a weapon a threeinch knife less than 24 hours before he 
died in the fire valle had failed to come up with the 650 he 
needed for bail the report said 
officials said 116 prisoners were in the prison dormitory when 
the fire broke out about 3 am tuesday the ward was built for 70

former sen john tower talked wednesday with 
presidentelect bushs legal adviser about the results of an 
extensive fbi investigation into his background as transition aides 
said the suspense over the pentagon post could end this week 
bush told reporters he hasnt decided whether tower will be the 
new defense secretary but he was confident the former texas senator 
would do an excellent job if i decide to go that route bush 
said he has not seen the fbi report 
for weeks tower has been the rumored frontrunner for the 
pentagon job but the post has remained vacant while the fbi 
completed its investigation which includes probing allegations of 
womanizing and drinking that arose during towers 1987 divorce 
other areas of interest to the fbi were towers relationship with 
defense contractors he represents as a private consultant and his 
use of campaign funds after he retired from the senate in 1984 
craig fuller the transitions codirector said the fbi has 
just about concluded its probe i would expect by the end of 
this week we will reach a final conclusion about whether we can go 
forward with a final recommendation he said 
tower met with c boyden gray bushs legal counsel to discuss 
the fbis report gray said the probe hasnt been concluded but 
refused to say anthing further 
fuller said he and transition codirector robert teeter will 
review the fbis findings this week and then provide bush with a 
report so far there is nothing in the fbi investigation to 
disqualify tower he said 
some members of congress have said towers effectiveness if he 
is chosen may be crippled by the lengthy selection process 
but fuller disputed that view calling the fbi check prudent 
you have to admire sen towers willingness to go through 
this fuller said 
tower a former chairman of the senate armed services committee 
and a onetime arms control negotiator in geneva switzerland is 
known to want the pentagon job though he has not spoken out 
publicly since speculation about his appointment began last month 
fuller also dispelled any notion that tower would be denied a 
hand in picking his top aides some reports indicated that bush 
intended to unveil an entire team of defense department officials at 
the time he named the new secretary 
ive heard the talk about the slate but it didnt come from me 
because there was never any determination made that we would present 
to either sen tower should he be selected or any other cabinet 
member a complete slate of officeholders for the other positions 
in the department he said 
several people from industry are known to have rejected overtures 
to serve in the no 2 job at defense typically a post filled by a 
manager among them are paul oneill the chief executive officer of 
alcoa and norman f augustine the president of martinmarietta

british egg producers whose sales have been hurt 
by a salmonella poisoning scare said wednesday they will send up to 
1 million surplus eggs to victims of the armenian earthquake 
one lawmaker called the gesture a poison chalice but the egg 
producers association said the eggs were safe to eat 
we feel we are helping in some small measure people who are 
suffering a great deal at the moment said dennis warren 
president of the association we are satisfied from our own tests 
that these eggs contain no salmonella 
warren said demand for eggs in britain has dropped 30 percent to 
60 percent since health minister edwina currie said earlier this 
month that most of the nations eggs were tainted with salmonella 
for us its like the wall street crash warren said we 
would rather give these eggs away than dump them 
we asked the russian embassy what they thought of the idea and 
they said they would welcome the eggs he said they are 
arranging for the first load to go today 
warren said he has donated 10000 eggs from his farm and said 
other producers would be donating a similar number 
we are aiming to step this up and expect to send a million eggs 
to armenia within days he said 
george foulkes a foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition 
labor party said this is the poison chalice it is something 
of an insult to send to armenia eggs which some people consider too 
dangerous for home consumption 
harry greenway a lawmaker in the governing conservative party 
called the donations a wretched irony 
it has the appearance of dumping on others what we are not 
prepared to eat ourselves he said

four years after contractors began 
dismantling the nations first commercial nuclear power plant the 
reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site wednesday for a 
7800mile journey to a federal dump 
the raising of the 1000ton reactor pressure vessel and 
neutronshield tank packed with concrete is the most dramatic 
although not necessarily the most critical aspect of the fiveyear 
decommissioning 
the shippingport atomic power station dedicated by president 
eisenhower in 1957 was retired in 1982 after generating about 65 
billion kilowatts of electricity 
wednesdays big move was also the federal governments attempt to 
prove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably 
providing a model procedure for utilities when their reactors have 
outlived their usefulness 
this really has been a demonstration for all of us said 
karen wheeless spokeswoman for the department of energy which owns 
the shippingport plant youve got to take reactors from the 
cradle to the grave if you cant handle the burial theres some 
question of whether you should be handling a reactor at all 
the plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactor 
in the world to be dismantled to date several nuclear plants have 
been mothballed or entombed including peachbottom i in 
pennsylvania dresden i in illinois and indian point i in new york 
even perfect success for the shippingport operation wont solve 
what is one of the biggest problems facing the commercial nuclear 
power industry what to do with highly radioactive waste 
while waste from the federally owned shippingport plant is going 
to military dumps in idaho and at hanford wash there is no place 
to dispose of commercial highlevel waste a national repository for 
spent fuel which was to open in 1998 probably wont be available 
until the next century said wheeless 
this is a demonstration in terms of technology she said 
where the fuel or the reactor pressure vessel go is not being 
demonstrated that has to be solved by the commercial nuclear 
industry and i think thats going to be one of the biggest issues 
facing the united states 
almost all of the 12000 metric tons of spent uranium fuel from 
private reactors is being stored in waterfilled utility holding 
ponds 
the energy department estimates that 15 us nuclear plants will 
reach the end of their 30 to 40year useful lives by the year 2000 
the spent uranium fuel from the shippingport reactor was removed 
in 1984 and taken to a military dump in idaho only lowlevel 
radiation is left in the reactor which poses no health risk 
spokesmen said 
the radiation is trapped in the steel itself the highly 
radioactive stuff is gone said wheeless unless you attach it 
to your body and wear it as an undergarment there is no danger 
you get more radiation flying from pittsburgh to denver than 
you would get standing next to the reactor said dan butler 
another department spokesman 
federal officials say they intend to remove all radioactive 
material so the shippingport site 30 miles northwest of pittsburgh 
can be returned to unrestricted use the decommissioning is expected 
to be completed on schedule by 1990 at a cost of approximately 98 
million 
officials estimate that at a rate of 25 feet per hour it would 
take about 10 hours to lift the reactor from the containment 
building to a specially constructed flatbed transporter with 320 
rubber tires a special stationary crane was constructed to lift the 
mammoth load 
the reactor is composed of a pressure vessel with 8inch thick 
steel walls and an encompassing neutron shield with steel walls 1 
inches thick spaces within the assembly were filled with concrete 
to stabilize it and further reduce radioactivity 
the cylindrical reactor 41 feet long 30 feet high and 18 feet 
in diameter was lifted vertically 77 feet and was to be moved 
horizontally then lowered 47 feet onto the transporter 
it will be rolled to the bank of the ohio river and placed on a 
200footlong barge in the spring and shipped via the ohio 
mississippi river gulf of mexico panama canal pacific ocean and 
columbia river to the hanford reservation

suspected antigovernment militants 
opened fire and threw bombs at a suburban prison freeing 221 
inmates the government said wednesday 
guards killed two prisoners during tuesday nights jail raid at 
the welikade prison which prompted authorities to impose curfews in 
parts of colombo and to appoint an army officer to oversee the 
countrys prisons the government said 
the attack on the mediumsecurity prison housing about 1500 
inmates was the second in as many weeks in sri lanka on dec 4 
suspected sinhalese extremists dressed in army uniforms overpowered 
guards at a prison in central sri lanka and freed six inmates 
a military spokesman who requested anonymity said tuesdays 
escape apparently was organized by the peoples liberation front an 
extremist sinhalese group trying to topple the government and 
disrupt the dec 19 presidential elections 
the military official said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threw 
small bombs at the south wall of the prison the explosions 
distracted guards in other sections of the facility and allowed 
inmates to scale the walls and escape they said guards opened 
fire killing at least two inmates the official said 
it was a wellorganized operation preplanned and possibly 
done with inside connivance he added 
the 221 prisoners escaped in six vehicles raided a laundry about 
a half mile from the prison and changed their prison uniforms for 
civilian clothes the official said 
at least 15 escapees were caught early wednesday about seven 
miles from the prison he said 
the official said authorities believe other convicts reached the 
town of kelaniya about five miles north of colombo and escaped by 
boat down the kelani river 
the justice ministry said army lt col vipul boteju was 
appointed to oversee all prisons in sri lanka 
on wednesday troops searched passenger buses and vehicles 
entering the capital police imposed an indefinite curfew in the 
northern neighborhoods and searched homes for escapees 
the peoples liberation front which staged a coup attempt in 
1971 opposes the governments efforts to end the 5yearold 
insurgency by tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in 
the north and east provinces 
the sinhalese who are predominantly buddhist make up 75 percent 
of the islands 16 million people and control the government and the 
military the tamils who are hindu and make up 18 percent of the 
population claim they are denied jobs and education by the 
sinhalese 
the front contends the government has offered too many 
concessions to the tamils in a peace accord signed in july 1987 
since then the sinhalese militants have been blamed for the murders 
of more than 900 people most of them government supporters

gen saw maung on wednesday met the first 
senior visiting foreign dignitary since he seized power and he told 
journalists finally allowed into burma that it is not ready for 
general elections 
we will definitely hold this multiparty democratic election 
theres no question about it the general said in repeating 
earlier promises 
he spoke with reporters accompanying thailands army chief gen 
chavalit yongchaiyudh on the first visit by a senior foreign 
official since saw maung seized power in a sept 18 coup his troops 
killed hundreds of demonstrators supporting democracy 
the visit broke an informal international understanding to 
refrain from moves that might imply recognition of the saw maung 
government japan the united states and other countries have frozen 
aid to burma 
saw maung said that before elections could be held authorities 
must ensure law and order restore transportation and 
communications and provide food clothing and shelter for the 
people 
theres been progress in these three main objectives but weve 
got to wait for a while he said when asked the polling date 
the political parties are in the process of registration at the 
moment they are not ready yet he added 
on the day he toppled civilian president maung maung saw maung 
said he would ensure elections are held he has allowed opposition 
political parties to form but suppressed all other public 
expressions of dissent 
after returning to bangkok today chavalit told a news conference 
that his talks with saw maung focused on the burmese governments 
offensive against rebel groups students who have joined the rebels 
and narcotics 
after the coup thousands of students joined ethnicbased 
guerrilla groups on the border the government has said the students 
can come back without facing punishment 
at a luncheon for chavalit saw maung said more than 1500 
students have returned home and authorities have arranged with 
bangkok the return of those staying in temporary thai camps saw 
maung told reporters about 2000 students remain at the border area 
but thai officials put the figure at 7000 
on foreign relations saw maung said there are a few countries 
which look forward to consolidate friendship with us and on the 
other hand some countries show less interest in cooperating with us 
our policy is to establish friendship with every country 
the nation newspaper of thailand criticized chavalits visit in 
an editorial it said he can privately try to persuade gen saw 
maung to hold the promised free and fair general elections as soon 
as possible only his success in this effort which is so far most 
unlikely could justify making a trip to rangoon now 
the newspaper said that while thai authorities try to portray the 
trip as technical and militaryrelated the visit could send the 
wrong signal both to saw maung and the rest of the world that 
thailand endorsed the massacres by burmese troops

a federal court ruling allowing the city to be 
sued for damages blamed on noise from ohare international airport 
was hailed wednesday as a breakthrough in the fight to cut the din 
in suburban communities 
its one of the biggest victories weve had to date said 
john geils village president for west suburban bensenville near one 
of the worlds busiest airports 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruling tuesday reversed an 
earlier decision that barred lawsuits against the city over its 
airport operations 
the ruling could prompt a flood of litigation in county courts 
over airport noise or other nuisances said joseph karaganis the 
attorney who filed the lawsuit 
karaganis who called the decision a landmark in the decadesold 
fight over ohares impact estimated 210000 residents in 20 city 
and suburban neighborhoods could sue chicago under the ruling 
the old ruling was used by the city of chicago to beat the 
suburbs karaganis said now the door to the court is open 
the lawsuit was filed for lawrence c bieneman of bensenville 
who seeks damages exceeding tens of thousands of dollars for 
property damage and personal injury from ohare noise and air 
pollution karaganis said the case now goes to dupage county 
circuit court and may be consolidated with similar lawsuits 
perhaps it will give us an opportunity to negotiate outside the 
courts and get chicago to mitigate some of these concerns 
said geils who serves on the ohare advisory board 
city corporation counsel judson miner had not read the decision 
but said i dont view it as a loss 
studying the ramifications will take some time so i dont know 
if it opens any doors or not he said 
since 1975 the 7th circuit had barred lawsuits seeking to 
collect damages from the city which owns ohare for complaints 
resulting from airport operations it said management of an airport 
was a federally regulated activity which preempted state law 
other federal courts disagreed 
we must decide whether to maintain a goitalone position 
appellate judge frank easterbrook wrote in tuesdays ruling 
he said the court was convinced that its 1975 ruling was wrong 
and that we should fess up to the error 
geils said the impact of the jettraffic racket on schoolchildren 
has been very significant there is constant distraction 
constant interruption of the learning process 
past noiseabatement efforts have been financed by the federal 
airport improvement program trust fund overseen by the federal 
aviation administration he said and more funds are being sought 
for the 12 remaining schools of 27 targeted for soundproofing in 
several suburban communities 
bieneman said wednesday his oharerelated problems began in 1970 
he cited windows and walls cracked by vibrational stress from the 
jet noise landing lights that shine into one southfacing bedroom 
and turn night into day and other problems 
why should i move ive been here since 1949 its where my 
kids were raised said bieneman

defense lawyers rested their case 
wednesday in the tax and mail fraud conspiracy trial of political 
maverick lyndon larouche without summoning him to testify and then 
described the governments case as garbage and a rotting 
carcass 
in their closing arguments government prosecutors said larouche 
and six associates deliberately deceived supporters who lent his 
controversial political movement more than 30 million but were 
never repaid 
they also said larouche 66 a perennial minorparty political 
candidate conspired to defraud the internal revenue service by 
having his personal expenses paid by various corporations he 
controls and pretending he had no taxable income 
but defense attorneys told the trial jury of seven women and five 
men that larouche and his aides were innocent of all charges and 
hinted that they were victims of a vengeful government 
these people are not crazy and they are not foolish said 
william moffitt attorney for defendant dennis small a larouche 
fundraiser 
larouches lawyer odin anderson of boston said the government 
was charging some sort of voodoo conspiracy and told the jurors 
they dont want you to decide straightforward facts they want 
you to decide garbage 
he added the bad smell in the courtroom didnt come from 
outside but from the rotting carcass of the governments case 
defense lawyer james clark said the trial was not about money but 
about a political movement with dedicated followers who want to 
succeed and powerful enemies who want it to fail 
chief us district judge albert v bryan jr said he would send 
the case to the jury thursday morning after a 14day trial larouche 
told a reporter he was not called to the witness stand because his 
testimony would only gild the lily of the defense case 
bryan said the jurors would deliberate through saturday if 
necessary to reach a verdict 
larouche and the six associates are charged with raising millions 
of dollars in loans from supporters without any intention of 
repaying them in addition larouche is accused of conspiring to 
cheat federal tax collectors by allegedly concealing his true 
income he has not filed income tax returns for any year since 1978 
if convicted on all 13 counts against him larouche faces a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million 
prosecutor john markham told the jurors the charges contained in 
a federal grand jury indictment returned on oct 14 had nothing to 
do with larouches political ideas 
but he said they were based on the way the larouche 
organization raised its money the ends however noble they may be 
is not the point and does not justify lying to people to get 
their money markham said 
at the same time one larouche fundraiser was telling an elderly 
woman he couldnt pay a dime on her overdue loan of more than 
100000 markham said massive improvements costing much more were 
being made at a 199acre larouche farm outside leesburg va 
including a swimming pool a pond a guest house and a riding ring 
assistant us attorney kent robinson said larouche conspired to 
hide his income from the irs by having his associates pay all his 
personal expenses he did a good job robinson said we cant 
figure out even today just what his income was 
robinson dismissed defense attorneys claims that larouche was an 
employee of the various entities he controlled and that the goods 
and services he received free represented nontaxable compensation 
hes not an employee robinson said and if hes not his 
meals and lodging are taxable 
defense lawyer moffitt said the larouche people were not foolish 
enough to believe their moneyraising efforts were certain to be a 
failure and denied that they had set out to deceive their lenders 
to convict them of a criminal conspiracy he said the government 
would have to prove that when they solicited the loans they never 
intended to be successful and if they never intended to be 
successful then they intended to end up here because they were 
being watched 
moffitt claimed that part of the reason we are here is an 
antidrug book published by one larouche organization which makes 
accusations against moneylaundering banks and people in high places 
henly webster attorney for defendant ed spannaus said this 
political movement is not a polite one but he urged the jurors to 
protect it against an overreaching government which is offended 
by the larouche organizations political attacks 
webster said the larouche organization lacked a staff of 
professional administrators accountants and lawyers if theyd 
had a good office manager this might not have happened he said 
why would you intentionally cut off your life blood by 
defrauding these people webster said

three additional us government earthquake 
relief flights will arrive in soviet armenia before the weekend 
carrying plastic sheeting tents and other supplies the state 
department said wednesday 
two air force c141s were leaving wednesday and thursday and a 
civilian plane will depart friday department spokesman charles 
redman said the last flight in addition to relief supplies will 
be carrying replacements for us government personnel who are now 
on site 
the additional three flights will bring to eight the total since 
the government relief effort began 
officials say the dec 7 quake killed at least 55000 people 
injured 13000 and left 500000 homeless 
the private assistance effort has included more than a dozen 
flights carrying over 3 million worth of relief assistance 
including dialysis machines medical supplies and orthopedic 
equipment redman said 
in addition three soviet cargo flights will arrive in the united 
states over the next several days to airlift privately donated 
supplies to the disaster zone 
redman said seven of the nine american citizens known or believed 
to be in the affected area have been reported to be safe and well 
continuing efforts are being made to learn of the remaining two 
meanwhile eight firefighters from the united states and canada 
left wednesday for armenia to aid in the relief efforts 
the team organized through the international association of fire 
chiefs and the spokane washbased people to people program is 
expected to spend about two weeks helping in excavation and aiding 
survivors 
douglas pollington of cambridge ontario a member of the people 
to people citizen ambassador program team and former president of 
the iafc said he hopes some people buried in the rubble are still 
alive as in the 1985 mexico city earthquake where some survivors 
were pulled out after 12 days 
to aid in the search team members are carrying a hightech 
device called a thermal imager that uses infrared light to 
detect heat sources until now rescue workers primarily have used 
dogs to search for survivors 
also on wednesday us architects offered to help architects in 
the soviet union to rebuild cities devastated by the earthquake 
we want to ensure that it doesnt happen as seriously again 
here or there said don geis a consultant on natural disasters 
for the american institute of architects 
we dont know quite frankly much about soviet antiearthquake 
construction geis said noting reports that poor construction may 
have contributed to the high death toll 
geis said us architects also could learn from the quake as 
they did in a visit to mexico after the 1985 quake he said rumors 
that much of the destruction in mexico city was caused by shoddy 
construction proved to be exaggerated

congress will be forced to make painful cuts in 
farm programs to meet deficitreduction targets even if there is a 
tax increase the house agriculture committee chairman said 
wednesday 
its not going to be easy rep e kika de la garza 
dtexas told reporters its going to be very painful theres 
going to be blood shed or i guess marrow because its down to the 
bone were going to have to chop into bone 
the reagan administration reportedly has been weighing a 3 
billion reduction in farm spending in the fiscal year that starts 
next oct 1 the agriculture committee is reckoning that cuts 
totaling 15 billion would meet targets under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
de la garza said the administration has not told him how much it 
calculates will be needed to meet deficitreduction targets 
he said some farm cuts were inevitable even with a tax 
increase he said an increase would help to preserve some 
agricultural programs but stopped short of advocating one its 
not easy to vote for a tax increase its very difficult the 
chairman said 
spending on farm programs operated by the governments commodity 
credit corp peaked at 26 billion in 1986 but since has steadily 
dwindled to an estimated 12 billion in the current fiscal year 
much of the decrease is attributable to builtin reductions under 
broad farm legislation approved by congress in 1985 
de la garza complained however that the builtin reductions are 
not counted against the amount of savings that lawmakers must find 
to shoulder their share of the deficitreduction burden 
one method of cutting spending being mentioned is a further 
reduction in target prices set by congress and used to determine 
the size of socalled deficiency payments to wheat and feed grains 
producers the levels have gradually come down under the 1985 
legislation 
deficiency payments should total about 74 billion in fiscal 
1990 and about 3 billion of that will be payable in advance by 
agriculture committee reckoning a cut in that amount also remains a 
possibility

a mistake by organizers of a television special on 
the green river serial killings led authorities to grossly 
exaggerate the number of telephone calls they received with crime 
tips authorities said 
initial reports said as many as 60000 calls were made to a 
special phone bank that was staffed by investigators during the 
nationwide broadcast last week viewers were urged to phone in tips 
on the green river killings or any other crimes 
but in the first days after the broadcast investigators had 
answered no more than 7660 calls lt dan nolan spokesman for the 
king county polices green river task force said tuesday 
blame for the inflated figures was put mostly on a mistake in 
which the shows organizers confused the number of calls attempted 
with the number of calls received 
us west communications which handled the incoming calls said 
about 86200 calls had been attempted on the tollfree number 
broadcast during the show manhunt a chance to end the nightmare 
most callers however either got busy signals did not get 
through because of technical problems or else apparently changed 
their minds and ended their calls prematurely nolan said 
in addition there are other people who are talking to 
different people in the media and its all getting screwed up he 
said 
nolan said the 7660 calls answered by police had yielded about 
3000 credible tips on the green river killings and other crimes 
one led kent police to arrest two men ages 27 and 17 in the 
slaying of alice cecilia worthing whose body was found oct 26 in 
the green river police said however they dont think her 
asphyxiation was related to the serial slayings 
the green river serial killer is officially blamed for the deaths 
of as many as 48 young women many of them prostitutes between the 
summer of 1982 and early 1984 forty are known dead and the green 
river task force has held the killer responsible for the 
disappearances of eight other women 
despite the discrepancies reported in the number of calls police 
still have their hands full seattle police detective myrle carner 
said 27 investigators would work full time through the holidays 
sorting out the calls 
obviously we kind of stepped into uncharted waters on this 
but quite frankly its been overwhelmingly successful he said

drivers license in the transaction for identification even though

in numerous telephone conversations with senators congressional 
aides and journalists this year 
ive been making the calls ali told a news conference on the 
east steps of the capitol 
ali specifically denied that his attorney richard m hirschfeld 
had impersonated him in any calls though he acknowledged in a 
handwritten statement that the lawyer had arranged several 
telephone conversations between himself and several members of 
congress thenattorney general edwin meese iii and others 
a threepart story published sunday through tuesday by the 
atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution questioned the 
authenticity of the calls and quoted associates of both ali and 
hirschfeld as saying the attorney is able to imitate the former 
champions voice 
theres no truth in it ali said of the idea that someone 
else had spoken for him i did this because i had things i wanted 
to say

a washington environmental group on wednesday 
charged that the pentagon is considering the use of longrange 
cruise missiles to deliver chemical warheads and demanded a full 
accounting of the programs possible impact on arms control 
the group the foundation on economic trends said the deep 
fire program represents a unique threat to international peace 
citing a little known provision of federal law the foundation 
filed a petition with defense secretary frank c carlucci 
requesting the preparation of a full complete detailed and 
public arms control impact statement for the chemical warfare 
program called deep fire 
this program is designed to examine deepstrike delivery of 
chemical weapons including cruisemissile delivery of chemical 
warfare agents the program represents a dangerous escalation of the 
chemical warfare arms race 
the petition was filed by jeremy rifkin the foundations 
president who added if the incoming administration truly wishes 
to stop the proliferation of chemical weapons as was pledged during 
the campaign it should immediately eliminate this program 
according to rifkin recently declassified house appropriations 
committee transcripts of a march 11 1987 hearing contain the 
following from the pentagon 
alternative longrange standoff chemical weapons being 
considered are the army tactical missile system powered gbu15 
glide weapon airlaunched cruise missile groundlaunched cruise 
missile sealaunched cruise missile tomahawk harpoon and advanced 
interdiction weapon system 
according to the group the federal arms control and disarmament 
act requires the pentagon to prepare an impact statement whenever it 
begins work on a program involving technology with potential 
military application or weapons systems which may have 
significant impact on arms control and disarmament policy or 
negotiations 
the foundation asserted no such impact statement had been 
prepared for the deep fire program 
clearly research into deepstrike delivery systems for 
chemical warfare agents could dramatically alter strategic options 
for chemical warfare use deep fires impacts on disarmament 
policy and negotiations must be fully assessed 
the pentagon said wednesday it did not know of any program 
codenamed deep fire but acknowledged it had been conducting 
lowlevel studies of standoff chemical weapons since being 
directed by congress to do so in 1985 
there is no program to put chemical weapons on cruise 
missiles said lt col rick oborn a pentagon spokesman and 
were not sure where this deep fire name comes from 
we have been told by congress to continue lowlevel studies of 
what chemical weapons might follow the current generation and 
thats what were doing 
given the nature of the work oborn said it was not clear the law 
requiring an impact analysis should apply in this situation 
the united states citing production by the soviet union 
recently began making a new generation of toxic chemical weapons 
the weapons being made under that program however are either 
shortrange artillery rounds or a bomb for delivery by an airplane 
putting a chemical warhead on a cruise missile would make it 
possible to deliver such a weapon more than 1000 miles into enemy 
territory and to launch it either from the air sea or ground 
the foundation on economic trends is an environmental group that 
long has focused its attention on the dangers of biological research 
and genetic engineering 
the group has enjoyed legal success against the pentagon in the 
past succeeding in recent years in blocking construction of a new 
aerosol biological warfare laboratory in utah and forcing 
preparation of an environmental impact study covering various 
biological research programs

because his secretary made a 163000 profit on shares of 
recruitcosmos co a real estate firm at the center of a the 
scandal that began last summer 
aides to shinto miyazawa and other prominent people in politics 
and business were given the opportunity to buy unlisted shares in 
recruitcosmos a subsidiary of recruit co at bargain prices some 
with loans provided by recruit they made profits by selling after 
the shares were offered to the public in october 1986 and the price 
more than doubled 
such insider transactions are legal in japan but the close ties 
between politics and big business have come under increased criticis 
since this one was exposed 
a statement released by shinto said i have decided to resign 
to take responsibility for causing trouble concerning ntt and the 
recruit affair and causing people to lose trust in ntt 
he also resigned as chairman of 16 subsidiaries of the 
telecommunications giant company officials said 
ntt has the largest market value of any company in the world 
about 260 billion or almost twice the combined worth of 
international business machines corp general motors corp and 
american telephone amp telegraph co market value is the price of the 
companys shares multiplied by the number of shares 
shinto who has preached clean business and politics was linked 
to the scandal in october when it was revealed that the aide kozo 
murata bought 10000 unlisted recruitcosmos shares 
media reports tuesday said about 73000 was transferred from 
muratas bank account to the account of his boss shinto said murata 
controlled the account in question however and denied personal 
involvement 
haruo yamaguchi president of the giant company told a news 
conference mr shinto said the transaction may have taken place 
but he has no way of confirming it because mr muratas whereabouts 
are unknown 
the company is the worlds largest in terms of capitalization in 
1987 it earned the most corporate profits in japan 41 billion 
miyazawa and shinto were among those considered least 
contaminated by traditional methods of using money for political 
influence in japan 
an editorial thursday in the newspaper asahi indicated how 
seriously the affair has shaken public confidence 
it said in part hisashi shinto has resigned our 
disillusionment is great shinto was always a wellrespected 
business leader who combined wisdom with a broadness and clarity of 
vision what has become of japans leaders 
masaya ito a prominent political commentator said many such 
clean politicians and company officials were unfamiliar with how 
bigmoney politics is managed 
they often leave this business entirely to their aides and as 
a result it leads to problems when something is revealed and they 
cant give persuasive explanations he said 
seizaburo sato a political commentator and tokyo university 
professor said finance minister miyazawa resigned not because of 
his involvement in the scandal but because of poor management by his 
aide he is not the only one in the cabinet involved but he 
is the only one who either lied to the public or was lied to by his 
aide 
hiromasa ezoe chairman of recruit co resigned in september 
after reports that he had sold 2 million unlisted shares in the 
subsidiary to influential politicians and business leaders 
his secretary hiroshi matsubara director of recruitcosmos 
also resigned in september and has been charged with trying to bribe 
an opposition member of parliament to slow the investigation 
two legislators from opposition parties gave up positions in 
october when their names were linked to the scandal 
after those resignations the socialist and komeito clean 
government parties demanded that members of the govering liberal 
democratic party who were involved also take responsibility that 
led to miyazawas resignation 
two top newspaper executives also were among those who gave up 
their jobs because of connections with the insider trading 
most prominent politicians tied to the deal have stayed in office 
prime minister noboru takeshita his predecessor yasuhiro 
nakasone and governing party secretarygeneral shintaro abe a 
former foreign minister acknowledged some aides were in on it but 
denied personal involvement

the united states will continue to support 
guerrilla leader jonas savimbi as long as outside countries supply 
the angolan communist government the white house said wednesday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked by reporters 
whether us support for savimbi would continue after finalization 
of the usmediated agreement providing for the phased withdrawal 
of 50000 cuban soldiers from angola by mid1991 and the 
independence of southwest africa in about one year 
we continue to support savimbi in his struggle against the 
angolan government fitzwater said he has been supportive of this 
recent agreement and we are hopeful that the issue between 
savimbis unita forces and the government of angola can be 
resolved internally 
the agreement reached in brazzaville congo will be signed 
formally in new york on dec 22 by cuba angola and south africa 
which has ruled namibia a former german colony rich in mineral 
resources since the end of world war i 
fitzwater said the united states favors negotiations between 
unita savimbis national union for the total independence of 
angola and the government in luanda but he did not know the status 
of possible talks 
in any case as long as the angolan government is supplied by 
outside countries we continue to provide support for savimbi 
fitzwater said 
savimbi himself has said presidentelect bush promised him both 
before and after the november presidential election that us 
support to unita would continue until the soviet union stops 
supplying the angolan government and until after the cuban troops 
leave 
us aid to savimbi last year has been estimated at 15 million 
secretary of state george p shultz planned to attend the session 
in new york department spokesman charles redman said even though 
the united states would not sign anything 
we look forward to supporting the agreement in this concrete 
fashion and to discussing and assisting the parties in resolving any 
questions that may arise redman said

john rowland borrowed to buy his young family a 
home in connecticut borrowed to help pay for his first 
congressional race and borrowed again to buy a house on capitol hill 
after he won 
im trying to live in the two most expensive places in the 
united states connecticut and washington said the 31yearold 
republican congressman who sold the home here last year because he 
said he couldnt afford it not with his mortgage back home and the 
hefty financial burden of raising three young children 
he now rents a small apartment and sees his family on weekends 
and when congress is not in session thats hard he said 
wednesday but the hardest part is trying to convince people its 
rough to live on 89500 
thats the annual salary of rankandfile members of congress a 
wage that would increase 50 percent to 135000 if president reagan 
endorses the recommendations of a study panel that concluded its 
work tuesday 
just talking about wanting more money can buy trouble 
my appearance here kicks off my opponents next campaign 
whoever he or she is rep vic fazio dcalif joked last month 
when he urged the presidential commission to recommend higher pay 
for congress and federal judges 
rowland now entering his third term avoided taking a stand on 
the salary recommendation but endorsed a related provision that 
would ban lawmakers from accepting honoraria i can live on 
whatever the pay is he said 
the 135000 figure suggested by the panel is more than nine 
times the average personal income in 1987 
proponents of the raises say such comparisons are unfair they 
quickly point to the cost of living in washington where many 
typical familysized houses sell for 200000 or more 
the average person back home just doesnt understand that if a 
man brings his family with him down here unless he has some 
personal wealth its difficult for him to take on that kind of a 
mortgage said former michigan rep elford cederberg now 
president of the association of former congressmen especially in 
politics which is a rather unstable business 
the debate is not a new one when the first congress convened in 
1789 its members were paid 6 for each day of the session 
twentyseven years later lawmakers raised their pay to 1500 a year 
but then quickly repealed the raises because of the public uproar 
the opposition today is led by highly organized consumer groups 
and advocates such as ralph nader who called the latest 
recommendations a salary grab 
but cederberg and others say winning in washington takes a toll 
on the wallet 
republicans belong to the capitol hill club and democrats 
belong to the democratic club cederberg said and there are 
other people and things you have to be seen around if youre going 
to be influential and they cost money 
others say opposition to the raises from constitutents often is 
fueled by unfair images of washington lifestyle 
there are a lot of misconceptions about how we live in 
washington said ellen proxmire wife of retiring wisconsin sen 
william proxmire were ordinary people whose husbands have 
extraordinary jobs we go to the grocery and we budget and we cook 
our own meals most of the time and do just the same things that 
everyone elese does 
members of congress do have to entertain and attend formal 
functions but also worry about the mortgage and day care and 
college tuition she said 
there are many wealthy members of the congress but for the 
great majority of us who live on the salary its not that easy 
mrs proxmire said when we came here 30 years ago i didnt know 
of a congressmans wife who worked a lot of the wives work now 
she said the 135000 recommended by the commission is fair 
but said there are ways to get by on 89500 
my husband still has the same tuxedo he came here with 30 years 
ago she said and i dont even own a ball gown

even if depleted soil moisture is replenished 
the effects of the 1988 drought will continue to be very much in 
evidence next year the agriculture department said wednesday 
net cash income the difference between cash expenses and cash 
gross receipts is expected to be down somewhat from this years 
nearrecord 57 billion to between 48 billion and 52 billion 
but the departments economic research service said that would 
still put 1989 net cash income at the fourthhighest level on record 
economists say net cash income was high in 1988 despite the 
drought because so many farmers sold off commodities harvested in 
earlier years and because of large federal payments 
total crop and livestock receipts in 1989 are expected to rise 
slightly from this years record level the report said 
as a result of the drought and the draining of stored 
inventories farmers may boost crop plantings by as much as 30 
million acres but that will increase production costs government 
payments are expected to decline 20 percent to 25 percent

eight jewish organizations and a new york 
congressman said wednesday they are alarmed about slow us 
processing of soviet jews who want to come to the united states and 
suggested several steps including a blanket grant of refugee 
status for dealing with the backlog 
rep charles schumer dny said increases in soviet emigration 
have strained the resources of us agencies but he said he and the 
jewish groups are concerned that the immigration and 
naturalization service has started recently to apply a new and 
stricter definition of refugee in the case of soviet emigres 
schumer a member of the judiciary immigration subcommittee said 
in a statement that at least 177 soviet jews in rome the main 
processing point for soviet emigres have been denied refugee status 
in recent months that development constitutes a departure from 
longstanding us policy he said 
for years we have fought tirelessly together for the right of 
soviet citizens to emigrate said schumer now when our efforts 
have begun to bear fruit and the soviet union has finally begun to 
open its gates it is an unfortunate irony that the actions of our 
own government and not the soviet are creating new barriers to 
these refugees freedom 
schumer and 34 other house members expressed similar concerns in 
letters to attorney general richard thornburgh and secretary of 
state george shultz 
the statement suggested that all soviet jews applying for refugee 
status be granted it if necessary raising the us quota for 
refugees which is set at 24500 for the soviet union and eastern 
europe in the year that ends sept 30 requests from the soviet 
union alone have been running 2000 a month 
schumer and the groups also proposed that the state department 
dip into its 30 million emergency refugee fund to meet the costs of 
processing and resettling jewish emigres and that congress work to 
replace the money later jewish refugee aid agencies are prepared 
to meet their total financial responsibilities in partnership with 
the government the statement said 
the backlog of visa applications in the rome ins office has 
reached more than 5000 schumer said the ins should increase its 
staff in rome to expedite visas the statement suggested 
and the reagan administration should restore its policy of 
considering all soviet jews as refugees schumer said to be 
considered a refugee us policy states that indidividuals must be 
at risk of religious or political persecution in their homelands 
despite reforms initiated by soviet leader mikahil gorbachev 
soviet jews still suffer discrimination antisemitism and limited 
opportunities the jewish groups said 
last week thornburgh said he was expanding the governments 
parole authority to admit an additional 2000 soviet emigres per 
month the move came after shultz requested it and it was 
characterized as an interim step 
but many refugee applicants do not want the parole status 
because they lose the entitlement they otherwise would have to 
federal aid for transportation and resettlement and are barred from 
later seeking citizenship or permanent resident status 
the groups joining schumer in the statement were the council of 
jewish federations the hebrew immigrant aid society the national 
conference on soviet jewry the union of councils for soviet jews 
the american jewish committee the american jewish congress the 
antidefamation league and the coalition to free soviet jews 
the number of jews permitted to leave the soviet union has grown 
from 681 in 1986 to 15640 in the first 11 months of 1988

a soviet official said in an interview 
released wednesday that saudi arabia has softened its stance on 
afghanistan and agrees with moscow that moslem guerrillas have no 
exclusive right to form a future government there 
the chief of the soviet foreign ministrys department for the 
persian gulf alexander ivanov galitsyn was interviewed by the 
londonbased newsletter mideast mirror 
it quoted galitsyn as saying saudi arabias role in acting as 
host at the first peace negotiations between the soviets and the 
afghan guerrillas was possible because the saudis amended their 
demand for an unconditional soviet pullout 
the talks in taif confirmed that saudi arabia one of the most 
influential islamic states had renounced the principle of 
confrontation and is helping facilitate the afghan settlement on 
the basis of balance of interests and reasonable compromise 
galitsyn was quoted as saying 
the remarks quoted by the newsletter were telexed to the 
associated press in bahrain 
galitsyn was quoted as saying that the past saudi stand at all 
international forums was based on no compromise with the kabul 
regime and complete and unconditional withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan 
it looks however as if the general global changes following an 
improvement in sovietamerican relations and the assertion of the 
new political thinking have had a certain impact on riyadhs 
outlook the newletter quoted him as saying 
the unbrokered geneva accords in april where agreement was 
reached on the pullout of an estimated 100000 soviet troops from 
afghanistan coincided with the sovietus summit and the 
intermediate nuclear forces treaty 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or holy warriors were not 
represented but their backers the united states and pakistan 
concluded the agreement with the soviets the pullout was scheduled 
to be completed by feb 15 although the soviets have delayed 
because the rebels continued their military operations 
galitsyn disclosed that saudi arabia helped ensure that the 
geneva accord would be accepted by the mujahedeen the newsletter 
said he did not elaborate 
referring to a visit by soviet foreign ministry officials to 
riyadh in early 1988 galitsyn said the two sides noted that an 
afghan settlement would improve the political atmosphere in the 
region and chart ways of eliminating other hotbeds of tension 
according to mideast mirror 
as the talks continued saudi arabia gave to understand that 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan and the settlement 
of this problem in general would remove the chief element 
undermining understanding between the ussr and the islamic 
world he was quoted as saying in apparent reference to saudis 
linking diplomatic ties with the withdrawal from afghanistan

approximately 8600 employees of the department 
of health and human services will be subject to random drug testing 
under a plan announced wednesday by hhs secretary otis r bowen 
that works out to roughly 7 percent of the 118000member 
workforce of the sprawling department that includes such agencies as 
the food and drug administration the national institutes of health 
and the social security administration 
this department as the nations leader in drug abuse 
prevention education research and treatment should take the 
initiative to deter illegal drug use and to assist in the 
rehabilitation of drugusing employees bowen said in a memo to 
all employees 
the hhs plan adopted in response to an executive order by 
president reagan in 1986 requiring drug testing at all federal 
agencies identifies 80 job categories subject to random testing 
most of the categories involve employees in health care and 
medical research including those who provide direct patient care or 
who handle hazardous or sensitive materials 
security personnel and those operating potentially hazardous 
equipment also are included 
the national treasury employees union called the drug testing 
plan a cruel holiday gift to thousands of innocent federal 
employees and ronald reagans parting shot at the constitutional 
rights of those who labor for the government 
robert m tobias nteu president said the union was examining 
the hhs program and would sue at the first drop if any members of 
our hhs bargaining unit are included in the plan he said the 
union had succeeded in stopping similar drug testing in the 
department of agricultures food and nutrition division and is 
confident it will win its case against the us customs service 
the plan also makes the department secretary and undersecretary 
and other senior officials subject to testing 
the decision to go forward with random testing was made only 
after months of careful review and consideration of the privacy 
concerns of our employees bowen said in his memo 
the hhs plan calls for at least 10 percent of the 8600 employees 
subject to testing to be screened for marijuana and cocaine use 
annually 
the testing technically could begin as quickly as 60 days after 
publication of wednesdays memo but department officials said it 
probably will take longer 
each of the employees subject to testing will be notified in 
writing that they are in that category at least 30 days before any 
testing is carried out the memo said 
in addition to random testing for current employees the plan 
calls for drug tests to be administered to applicants for jobs in 
the covered positions

a roman catholic priests suit to regain his 
theology chair at catholic university went to trial wednesday 
pitting claims of academic freedom against the churchs right to 
discipline its clergy 
the rev charles e curran claims the university breached his 
contract by removing him from a tenured theology professorship 
because of his dissent from church teaching 
the university contends that it was merely enforcing the highest 
authority of the vatican which had revoked currans right to teach 
roman catholic theology 
as an ordained priest the university contends curran has an 
obligation to obey the revocation of his canonical mission to 
teach catholic theology 
the nonjury trial in superior court provides an unusual look at 
the internal functioning of the roman catholic hierarchy 
particularly the steps taken to discipline a priest for holding 
theological views at odds with those of the church 
it will feature the testimony of two of the churchs highest 
officials in this country 
the first witness to take the stand in judge frederick h 
weisbergs courtroom was cardinal james a hickey the archbishop of 
washington and chancellor of catholic university 
cardinal joseph bernardin archbishop of chicago and a former 
chairman of the universitys trustees also is scheduled to testify 
currans attorney paul saunders argued that his client was 
illegally denied the rights of academic freedom that were 
specifically adopted following a strike in 1967 
if the notion of academic freedom in the specific context of 
the present case means anything it means the university guaranteed 
a freedom in the face of public dissent from certain church 
teachings saunders said in pretrial arguments 
currans disagreement with church teachings on homosexuality and 
birth control and other positions he took in his book faithful 
dissent prompted vatican authorities to declare him unqualified 
to teach catholic theology 
father curran thinks he hasnt an obligation to his church to 
abide by this declaration said kevin baine an attorney 
representing the university curran wants to transform catholic 
university into something that he wants it to be baine argued 
curran was in effect asking the university to join him in 
defying orders from the vatican baine said 
the judge agreed with baines contention that he has no power to 
decide whether currans dismissal was consistent with church law 
but weisberg ruled that the issue in dispute was whether both sides 
understood canon law governed currans contract to teach at the 
university when it was signed and renewed 
curran who rejected an offer to teach ethics outside the 
universitys religious faculty contends he never was explicitly 
conferred a canonical mission to teach theology 
but in his testimony hickey rejected this claim saying such a 
mission was implicitly granted to curran when he was hired in 1965 
hickey testified that revoking currans status on the theology 
faculty was justified because the case of father curran had become 
a widely known matter 
it has caused in my opinion a great deal of harm to the 
church the archbishop testified 
it was particularly important that curran be disciplined because 
of the universitys unique relationship both with the holy see and 
the catholic church in this country 
it seems inconceivable to the board of trustees of the 
university that we could simply join in defiance on the part of 
father curran hickey testified 
since his suspension from catholic university in 1987 curran 
54 has been a visiting professor at cornell university he 
currently has a oneyear appointment at the university of southern 
california

three judges say they asked defendents 
infected with the aids virus to telephone in their pleas to protect 
the court staff but advocates for aids victims called the judges 
paranoid and their action unconstitutional 
jefferson county district judges mike mccormick ol johnson and 
jack montgomery said they simply asked that the defendants waive 
their right to appear in court and all did so mccormick and 
johnson said their bailiffs dont want to handle the prisoners for 
fear of getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
i dont think we can ban them but if i suggest to their 
lawyers that maybe they dont want to be here they waive their 
rights said johnson 
im not going to bring someone in here erupted with herpes or 
tuberculosis its not just aids montgomery said im not going 
to have someone come down here and infect the general public and 
me 
one of the inmates john louis oneal said he wanted to appear 
in court but was afraid he would anger the judge and receive a 
harsher sentence if he did 
my lawyer told me to do it over the phone because he didnt 
want to make him the judge mad oneal said in a birmingham 
postherald interview published tuesday 
steve haeberle a member of the state board of the civil 
liberties union of alabama said the judges were disregarding their 
obligation to provide defendants with speedy public trials but 
the judges denied any constitutional rights were violated 
mccormick said no guidelines on courtroom handling of aids 
defendants were available from the state bar association i guess 
well have to decide on a casebycase basis he said 
the bailiffs and the judges were concerned about a violent 
defendant who could bite or bleed in a fight mccormick said 
but dr michael saag an aids specialist at university hospital 
in birmingham said it was unlikely that a person could get infected 
with the aids virus through a human bite or during a fight 
to my knowledge it has never happened he said 
a report by the us surgeon general on aids transmission says 
that although the aids virus has been found in saliva no instance 
of transmission from saliva has been reported 
mccormick used a telephone hookup to listen to the guilty plea 
entered april 29 by oneal on a burglary charge the judge gave him 
probation but oneal 30 was back behind bars when interviewed 
recently 
now locked up on thirddegree theft and stolen property charges 
along with probation violation oneal is being kept in medical 
isolation with two other inmates who tested positive for the aids 
virus 
david gespass an attorney who now represents oneal has filed a 
petition to overturn oneals convictions because his client was not 
in court to give his plea or to be sentenced 
everyone has a right to face their accusers and the right to be 
present in a court to be sentenced gespass said 
theyre so paranoid they dont want anyone in whos even 
thought to have aids said harry j blalock who previously 
represented oneal i think its a misunderstanding of how it can 
be transmitted

president reagan said wednesday he had 
authorized the state department to enter into a substantive 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization his 
announcement came after plo chairman yasser ara bush was insisting on a 
clear unequivocal statement to clear the way for discussions 
bushs office said later that bush would have no statement on 
reagans decision 
shultz said he had discussed the decision with representatives of 
israel and he added our commitment to the security of israel 
remains unflinching 
arafats statement included this language on the equally 
difficult question of plo involvement in terrorist activities i 
repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all 
forms of terrorism including individual terrorism group and the 
state terrorism 
in response to a question he said i do expect and hope that 
the united states will drop its veto so that the middle east can be 
discussed 
shultz asked if bush was aware of reagans decision said the 
president and the vice president both have followed these 
developments closely and they have reviewed each of them this most 
recent development and they both agree that under these 
circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue that we have 
had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we 
are ready to undertake that dialogue 
at his news conference bush vowed to maintain a tough stand on 
the plo and insisted that arafat make a definitive statement about 
israels right to exist and a clear renunciation of terrorism 
that means that the palestine national council the legislative 
arm of the plo must subscribe to the statement as well as arafat 
he said 
bush also called on israel to relinquish territory captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 sixday war but while saying that 
israel ought to be pulling back in compliance with two un 
security council resolutions the presidentelect placed much 
greater emphasis on the plo 
i want a clear statement on renunciation of terror bush 
said i want a very clear unambiguous statement on the right of 
israel to exist as a state and i want a clear endorsement of 
security council resolution 242 
bush cited the resolutions assurance that all states by 
implication israel as well as the arabs have a right to live 
within secure boundaries 
if mr arafat takes a step that brings us a little closer to 
that fine were glad that happens bush said but he went on 
before we have a dialogue with the plo the signals have to be 
clear unmistakable unambiguous 
bush and arafat spoke almost simultaneously and it was not clear 
whether he was aware of the plo chairmans statements during the 
news conference 
before arafats speech tuesday to the un general assembly in 
geneva swedish diplomats passed the word that he was about to 
satisfy us demands secretary of state george p shultz notified 
israeli ambassador moshe arad but then in shultzs judgment the 
speech fell short 
bush in his statement subscribed to the threepoint test set by 
president reagan and shultz for a us dialogue with the plo 
the three requirements are explicit recognition of israel 
renunciation of terrorism in all forms and acceptance of the two 
security council resolutions 
meanwhile egyptian president hosni mubarak urged shultz by 
telephone from cairo to have a more positive reaction to 
arafats latest moves said a us official who demanded anonymity

case since the lebanese man was arrested at frankfurt airport jan 
13 1987 
hamadis brother abbas hamadi is serving a 13year prison term 
in west germany for his part in kidnapping two german businessmen in 
beirut to try and gain his brothers release the two germans have 
since been freed 
heusele was asked by the court if there was any connection 
between mohammed hamadi and another shiite moslem hussein hariri

accomplice aboard the plane identified as hassan ezzeddine 
demanded the release of all shiite moslem prisoners being held in 
israel israel later released 700 of the prisoners 
hariri was among those released by the israelis heusele told 
the court 
but heusele said investigators were unable to connect hamadi or 
ezzeddine to other hijackings although hamadi has told the court in 
previous testimony that his accomplice was involved in an earlier 
hijacking ezzeddine remains a fugitive 
since hamadis trial began in frankfurt on july 5 numerous 
witnesses have said the hijackers on twa flight 847 savagely beat 
passengers and forced the plane to land three times in beirut and 
twice in algiers

labor party leader shimon peres announced 
wednesday he is willing to become finance minister removing a major 
roadblock to forming a national coalition government with the 
rightwing likud tv reports said 
peres now foreign minister said he would accept the finance 
post on condition he have full freedom to deal with economic 
matters israel television said 
peres aides were not available at offices or residences to 
comment on the report 
negotiators from the likud bloc and labor have been holding 
renewed talks since monday in an effort to form a broadbased 
government the two leading parties have been jockeying for support 
from smaller religious parties to form a government after 
parliamentary elections on nov 1 when likud won 40 seats to 
labors 39 in the 120seat parliament 
wednesdays announcement represents a major concession by the 
leftofcenter labor party leader who wanted to be foreign minister 
in a new government because it would allow him to pursue a middle 
east peace initiative 
the move also could hurt peres popularity because israels 
recession and high inflation could bring about unpopular economic 
measures 
in making his announcement peres said labor should head a 
parliamentary committee responsible for making key economic 
decisions the likud bloc has said one of its own members should 
head the committee 
the television said likud ministers ended a meeting late 
wednesday and reported that differences remained between likud and 
labor particularly over policy on jewish settlements in occupied 
territory 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who leads likud has pressed talks 
with labor in an apparent effort to avoid some farreaching 
concessions to the religious parties on sensitive issues including 
a law defining who is a jew us jewish groups have strongly 
opposed the law 
labor has demanded two of the four key government posts o join a 
broadbased government labors defense minister yitzhak rabin is 
expected to keep his post shamir is expected to remain prime 
minister 
labor and likud have governed jointly since inconclusive 
elections in 1984

the justice department said wednesday it had no 
plans to delay the repatriation of some convicted mariel cuban 
detainees to their homeland 
gary copeland a deputy associate attorney general said no 
change in the plans to repatriate cubans was contemplated and that 
the next load of detainees would be flown to cuba shortly 
the us immigration and naturalization service released a 
statement wednesday night saying four mariel cubans would be 
deported thursday morning the detainees were scheduled to board a 
plane at the birmingham ala airport for the flight back to their 
homeland 
however an aide to auxiliary bishop agustin a roman of miami 
who discussed the cuban issue with top justice department officials 
wednesday said roman would pursue the matter further with state 
department officials 
rafael penalver a lawyer representing roman told reporters that 
a 1984 agreement with cuba under which the repatriation of some 
detainees was resumed earlier this month involves very very 
serious foreign policy implications he would not elaborate 
roman met with attorney general dick thornburgh and associate 
attorney general francis keating 
copeland said the basic argument of the miami delegation was 
that a justice department process of examining whether the detainees 
should be repatriated was a paper review rather than a 
fullfledged hearing with witnesses and presentation of evidence 
the justice department review program has survived legal 
challenges and we expect to continue in this manner copeland 
said although department officials agreed to consider specific 
written complaints which the roman delegation will submit 
some 400 mariel cubans are on a justice department list of people 
who might face repatriation and another 400 to 500 will be placed 
on the list once they finish serving prison and jail terms 
the justice department repatriation review process was 
established in the aftermath of riots by cuban detainees in atlanta 
and oakdale la a year ago the riots were triggered by plans to 
resume repatriation of the prisoners to cuba 
the program finally resumed dec 2 with the return of five 
detainees to cuba the five were among 125000 people who had fled 
cuba in the socalled mariel flotilla in 1980

santa claus exists a judge ruled on 
wednesday after an appearance on the witness chair from a 
rosynosed old gent in a red suit and white beard who rumbled a 
familiar ho ho ho 
i am going to make a determination that there is a santa 
claus decided municipal court judge george t choppelas he was 
presiding at san franciscos mock court of historical review and 
appeals a justforfun san francisco tradition with a real judge 
and lawyers 
as long as there is love and generosity and giftgiving 
choppelas went on this court is going to find that there really 
really is a santa claus 
in a grave tone the judge said he was drawing partly on legal 
precedent set in the old movie miracle on 34th street in which 
a new york court found for the defendant santa claus 
choppelas made his own ruling after a rollicking 90minute 
trial to consider the question is there really a santa 
claus some 150 spectators and journalists listened to the 
halfserious halfcomical testimony that talked about love and 
heart and spirit and an open hand 
the inquiry started with a radio announcers dramatic reading of 
clement moores a visit from st nicholas anticlaus lawyer 
frank winston objected to the poem 
proclaus lawyer wendy nelder a city supervisor then asked the 
spectators which of them had never written a letter to santa claus 
the request outraged winston who advised the audience take the 
fifth amendment 
winston poked fun at a santa claus doll which was introduced as 
evidence he flipped it upside down and said made in taiwan 
hah 
there is no proof santa claus was ever in san francisco he 
said noting that his fingerprints have never been found by police 
he drew a retort that santa was no criminal 
testifying for the proclaus side us post office 
communications specialist alan wald displayed a large drawing of the 
santa claus ind postmark and said firmly that none of the 
thousands of letters from children addressed to the gentleman were 
returned to sender 
winston said however that it was not possible for santa to be 
in zillions of places at once around the world 
he has helpers said nelder hes talented 
finally ho ho ho boomed out from behind a door and santa 
himself toting a sack with toys and a golf club appeared and sat 
down in the witness chair winston attacked him but santa quickly 
put him in his place 
santa reminded winston that i got a letter from you when you 
were 6 years old

the head of a department of energy scientific 
advisory committee said wednesday the panel is refusing to endorse 
the departments plan for restarting one of the three weapons 
production reactors currently shut down at the savannah river plant 
john f ahearne chairman of the advisory committee on nuclear 
facilities safety said of does proposed strategy for restarting 
the k reactor at the south carolina plant i think our main 
concern with it is that it is quite incomplete its only a 
first step 
the justcompleted doe report outlined more than 160 separate 
tasks for restarting the reactor calling for a complete overhaul of 
training safety management operating and inspection procedures 
it concluded that national security demands will require startup 
of the k reactor before longterm safety improvements are completed 
the three reactors at savannah river are the nations only source 
for tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the 
explosive power of modern nuclear warheads because tritium decays 
at a rate of 55 percent a year it needs to be replenished 
regularly 
in an interview ahearne said his committee was sending a letter 
to energy secretary john s herrington spelling out the panels 
concerns 
the overall gist of the letter is that were essentially 
declining to endorse the restart strategy we see a large set of 
problems we think it is insufficient to be used as the basis to 
go ahead and restart he said 
ahearne a former chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission 
voiced concerns in several areas including 
restart philosophy we didnt see represented in the document 
something that could be called an overall philosophy in other 
words what kind of safety standards is the department trying to 
achieve 
setting safety criteria we didnt really believe that the 
department had laid out clearly enough what must be done there are 
a number of descriptions in that document that have the character of 
improving safety but its not clear what would be an acceptance 
criterion so how would you know that youve met what must be done 
before restart 
ultrasonic testing of pipes and welds the doe report failed to 
specify use of hightech ultrasonic testing techniques to help find 
potentially dangerous cracks in piping 
seismic resistance we dont see in reading the seismic 
description any clear statement of what level of earthquake 
resistance the reactors must be brought to 
management we are concerned that the management approach that 
has been taken has now got too many people telling savannah river 
the plant people what to do its confusing to try to get a clear 
line of authority and that in the long run we thought would be a 
major problem

in what was already the deadliest year for dallas 
police a fifth slaying was added when an undercover police officer 
was fatally shot in a drug sting operation that went awry 
officer lawrence r cadena 43 was killed tuesday night while 
trying to buy drugs from several suspects at a convenience store to 
make a drugbuy arrest with his partner police spokesman ed spencer 
said another man was killed and two others wounded 
sgt james chandler described the departments mood as 
somber following the fifth shooting death of an officer this 
year 
four was unbelievable he said five was just i dont 
know you dont know what to say 
before 1988 the year with the most police killings was 1972 
when three officers died 
cadena shot in the abdomen chest and both arms was pronounced 
dead at baylor university medical center in dallas about 1030 pm 
tuesday about 30 minutes after the shootout 
hector rodriguez jocimino 36 of dallas died of gunshot wounds 
to the chest and back at parkland memorial hospital emergency room 
supervisor randy blanchard said 
javier suarez medina 20 was in serious condition wednesday at 
parkland with wounds to the chest and abdomen and fernando 
fernandez 17 was in serious condition with wounds to both legs 
officials said 
it is my understanding that it was a buybust situation a 
drug buy and we had more than one officer at the scene police 
chief mack vines said instead of the drug deal reaching fruition 
they were hijacked as they say shots were exchanged and our 
officer was fatally wounded 
chandler alleged that medina fired the shots that killed cadena 
while fernandez was definitely an active participant in this 
robbery attempt and murder 
both medina and fernandez have been charged with capital murder 
and fernandez also was charged with unlawful delivery of a 
controlled substance police said 
police at the scene of the shootout recovered 107 grams or about 
4 ounces of a white powder believed to be cocaine 
jacomino who was in a car across the street from the stopn go 
when he was shot to death drove medina to the store for the drug 
deal chandler said 
jacomino was fatally shot by bullets fired by backup police 
officer sgt david mccoy authorities said police said they do not 
know whether jacomino was armed 
cadena with 17 years as a police officer had been a narcotics 
officer since 1986 he also worked in that division from 197681 
the city council observed 30 seconds of silence wednesday in 
honor of the slain officer 
the other officers killed this year are james joe while he 
questioned two burglary suspects john glenn chase in a 
confrontation with a homeless person gary mccarthy during an 
attempted robbery in a grocery store and walter williams while 
answering a disturbance in an apartment complex 
the department has been criticized by some council members and 
community minority leaders who have accused police of being too 
triggerhappy 
in the chase shooting a mentally ill man grapped the officers 
gun in scuffle a witness told police that three men standing nearby 
urged the man to shoot chase 
that incident prompted former police chief billy prince to accuse 
council members of creating an antipolice sentiment that led to the 
attack

enter into a substantive dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization

dialogue our object is peace 
the israeli embassy in washington denounced the us decision in 
a statement we regret the united states decision to establish 
contact with the plo we do not consider that this step will advance 
the peace process in the middle east 
an israeli government official speaking early thursday in 
jerusalem on the condition he not be identified said neither shultz

arafat told reporters in response to a question i do expect 
and hope that the united states will drop its veto so that the 
middle east can be discussed referring to the earlier us 
refusal to talk with the plo 
shultz said wednesday night that the united states does not 
recognize the declaration of an independent palestinian state 
made by the plo in algeria last month but that it would be a 
subject of discussion 
shultz said the us channel for dialogue with the plo would be 
the american ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau jr in 
tunis tunisia the duty officer at the us embassy henry ensher 
said he had no immediate information 
the plos rahman watched shultz on tv with swedish foreign 
minister sten andersson andersson was instrumental in arranging for 
a delegation of american jews to meet arafat in geneva and was 
widely reported to have acted as gobetween in the past few days for 
americanpalestinian contacts in geneva 
andersson smiled broadly and nodded when shultz remarked during 
the telecast that presidentelect george bush was consulted on the 
proceedings in geneva 
rahman later told reporters i say that this is this american 
statement to open dialogue with the plo is a historic change in the 
struggle in the middle east with this american decision we can 
speak about an era of peace in the middle east peace for us and 
our enemies also 
he said in reference to israel they are isolated they are 
alone at this moment because of their unrealistic policies they 
should recognize the right of the palestinian state to exist like 
their state 
the un meeting in geneva scheduled to end thursday was held 
in switzerland after the united states refused to grant arafat a 
visa to speak at un headquarters in new york it had made little 
progress toward holding an international conference on middle east 
peace that arafat wants 
arafat began his news conference with a statement in english 
calling on european nations to play a greater role in bringing about 
middle east peace and insisting the palestinian desire for peace was 
real 
i repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce 
all forms of terrorism including individual terrorism group and 
the state terrorism he said 
but the israeli official in jerusalem said thursday that arafats 
remarks were insufficient because the plo did not rule out 
violence associated with the yearold palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip which has left more than 
320 palestinians and 13 israelis dead 
arafat said his speech to the general assembly made clear the plo 
accepts the right of all parties concerned in the middle east 
conflict to exist in peace and security and as i have mentioned 
including the state of palestine israel and other neighbors 
he said again that the plo accepts un resolutions 242 and 338 
which recognize the right of all middle eastern nations to safe and 
secure borders 
the acceptance is one of three conditions set by us law for 
dialogue with the plo the other are a clear recognition of israel 
and renunciation of terrorism by the plo 
speaking mostly in arabic and some english in answering 
questions he showed impatience with a question asking him to say 
yes or no on whether he accepts israel 
didnt you read my statement he asked referring to his 
tuesday speech its entirely clear what do you want do you want 
me to do a striptease it would be unseemly 
in a speech before the world body on wednesday us ambassador 
vernon walters said the world should tell israelis and arabs it is 
tired of their long conflict 
walters urged israel to face up to the need for withdrawal from 
occupied territories and the palestinians to accommodate the 
reality of israels existence 
diplomats from arab nations the soviet union china and sweden 
backed arafats call for an international peace conference 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar called arafats 
address a new and very important contribution to the peace 
process

president reagan in a stunning reversal said 
wednesday that he had authorized the state department to enter into 
a substantive dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization which the united states has long denounced as a 
terrorist organization 
the announcement came after plo chairman yasser arafat said in 
geneva that he was renouncing all forms of terrorism 
reagans decision put to an end decades of us isolation of the 
palestinian group which secretary of state george p shultz less 
than three weeks ago accused anew of terrorism 
the move shocked the israeli government even before the official 
announcement the israeli embassy called the decision regrettable 
and said it would not advance the cause of peace in the middle east 
israel will pursue its policy of searching for peaceful 
solutions to the conflict through direct negotiations with 
palestinian arabs and with jordan the israeli statement said 
hassah abdul rahman the plo spokesman said the decision to open 
a dialogue was the right thing to do 
asked whether it was a defeat for israel he told cbs its not 
a victory for one party over the other 
our object is not a dialogue our object is peace shultz 
told reporters simultaneous to the release of reagans statement 
when there will be a meeting i dont know 
asked if he had changed his mind about the plo and arafat shultz 
said i didnt change my mind they made their statements clear 
but shultz said the plo had issued a statement in which it met 
all three us conditions for a dialogue acceptance of un 
security council resolutions affirming the right of all states to 
live in peace recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism 
as a result the united states is prepared for a substantive 
dialogue with plo representatives the secretary of state said 
in geneva arafat spoke of the equally difficult question of plo 
involvement in terrorist activities i repeat for the record that 
we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism including 
individual terrorism group and the state terrorism 
in response to a question he said i do expect and hope that 
the united states will drop its veto so that the middle east can be 
discussed 
the israeli ambassador moshe arad said in an interview with the 
associated press that he did not detect anything new in what arafat 
said wednesday he said he hoped the us decision would not lead to 
recognition of the plo 
i am disappointed by this decision arad said i am not 
trying to minimize that but on the other hand i think we should 
keep a perspective on the overall relationship between the two 
countries 
arad said arafats remarks at a geneva news conference do not 
supersede the plos covenant which calls for israels destruction 
james zogby executive director of the arabamerican institute 
hailed the us decision calling it an important step forward in 
movement toward a real peace process 
the dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure of 
israel to say yes to the very issues that the plo has now acceded 
to our hope is that the dialogue is productive and that peace is 
now possible 
dr george e gruen director of middle east affairs of the 
american jewish committee called on the united states to insist 
that the plo match words with deeds specifically we call upon 
them to end their attacks on israeli civilians and all other forms 
of terrorism and formally to change the plos charter which 
still calls for the dissolution of the state of israel 
sen richard lugar rind a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee said in a statement that the opening offered by 
arafats statements may be a blind alley but an alley worth 
treading with eyes open this dialogue in no way mitigates our 
steadfast support of israel but i hope israel will at least be 
willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthy attempt 
the simon wiesenthal center said that by its decision the united 
states is taking a major risk for peace the center warned in a 
statement that the road reagan and shultz have chosen to embark 
upon is fraught with danger and may be sending the wrong message to 
the world that terrorism does pay 
shultz said the united states would not attempt to steer israel 
to make a similar decision its totally for israel to make its 
own decisions shultz said 
he said the united states does not recognize the declaration of 
an independent palestinian state but that it would be a subject 
of discussion he said the channel for the united states would be 
the american ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau jr 
shultz said he believes there should be direct negotiations 
between the parties in the middle east but that he knew of 
nothing to suggest this was imminent 
reagan in a written statement said the plo had accepted un 
security council resolutions 242 and 338 recognizing israels right 
to exist and had renounced terrorism 
these have long been our conditions for a substantive dialogue 
they have been met therefore i have authorized the state 
department to enter into a substantive dialogue with plo 
representatives reagan said 
the announcement represented a turnaround from the us position 
24 hours earlier when it said arafat had not made a clear acceptance 
of us conditions for talking to the plo 
now that we see a change in the posture of the plo all were 
doing is following through shultz told a hastily assembled news 
conference that was carried live in the united states on the evening 
newscasts 
he spoke cautiously picking each word with care and was quick to 
reaffirm the american commitment to israel and to stress that the 
action does not recognized the plo as an independent state 
he said the united states position had changed because arafat 
had declared explicitly that he recognized the right of israel to 
exist he said the us conditions had been well known since 1975 
when the united states last held serious talks with the plo 
arafat at his geneva news conference insisted his past 
statements mean he recognizes israels right to live in peace and 
security he spoke as presidentelect george bush was insisting on a 
clear unequivocal statement to clear the way for discussions 
bushs office said later that bush would have no statement on 
reagans decision 
shultz said he had discussed the decision with representatives of 
israel and he added our commitment to the security of israel 
remains unflinching 
shultz asked if bush was aware of reagans decision said the 
president and the vice president both have followed these 
developments closely and they have reviewed each of them this most 
recent development and they both agree that under these 
circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue that we have 
had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we 
are ready to undertake that dialogue 
bush and arafat spoke almost simultaneously and it was not clear 
whether he was aware of the plo chairmans statements during the 
news conference 
at his news conference bush vowed to maintain a tough stand on 
the plo and insisted that arafat make a definitive statement about 
israels right to exist and a clear renunciation of terrorism 
that means that the palestine national council the legislative 
arm of the plo must subscribe to the statement as well as arafat 
he said 
bush also called on israel to relinquish territory captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 sixday war but while saying that 
israel ought to be pulling back in compliance with two un 
security council resolutions the presidentelect placed much 
greater emphasis on the plo 
bush cited the resolutions assurance that all states by 
implication israel as well as the arabs have a right to live 
within secure boundaries 
if mr arafat takes a step that brings us a little closer to 
that fine were glad that happens bush said but he went on 
before we have a dialogue with the plo the signals have to be 
clear unmistakable unambiguous

yasser arafat and the plo launched a political offensive in the 
last month to convince washington and the world they are peaceful 
moderate and worthy of representing palestinians in the middle east 
peace process 
that campaign punctuated by three major statements ended 
wednesday with the united states agreeing to talk to the palestine 
liberation organization 
the first major move in the plo campaign came nov 15 in algiers 
algeria when the plos parliamentinexile proclaimed a palestinian 
state the palestine national council said the state would be 
established on territory now occupied by israel 
at the same time the council issued a political declaration 
accepting un security council resolution 242 which calls for 
secure borders for all the states in the region that statement 
amounted to implicit recognition of israel 
the declaration also rejected terrorism restricting plo 
guerrilla action to military targets in the israelioccupied 
territories 
on dec 6 arafat took the plo drive a step further when he 
elaborated on the palestine national councils action in his own 
meeting with a group of us jews in stockholm sweden 
he told the jews that his organization accepts israels right to 
exist and condemns all forms of terrorism including state 
terrorism the plo uses that term to refer to israeli military 
action in the occupied territories 
finally on tuesday in geneva before the un general assembly 
arafat made a direct appeal to israeli leaders to join peace talks 
he offered a threepoint peace plan calling for an international 
peace conference un supervision of israelioccupied territory and 
a comprehensive settlement involving all states in the region 
speaking to reporters wednesday in geneva arafat said again that 
he renounces all terrorism and recognizes israels right to live in 
peace and security 
he also made a direct appeal for the us to reverse its policy 
of refusing to talk to the plo i do expect and hope that the 
united states will drop its veto he said

barry minkow who once convinced wall street 
and talk show hosts that he was a teenage business genius was 
convicted wednesday on all counts in the zzzz best carpetcleaning 
securities fraud case 
the 22yearold minkow who was just 16 when he started his 
business was convicted on 57 federal counts of swindling investors 
in a phony restoration business he had contended he was the 
terrified puppet of mobsters but the jury believed prosecutors who 
said he was a canny youthful con man 
minkow was calm as the word guilty was pronounced in the 
courtroom 57 times once during the 40minute reading of the 
verdict he reached over and clutched the hand of his attorney 
david kenner 
the panelists came to their decision shortly after they concluded 
hearing a reading of the testimony of minkows codefendant norman 
rothberg an accountant who was charged with taking a bribe to cover 
up the zzzz best frauds 
the jurors who have been deliberating for five days said they 
had not yet reached a verdict on charges against minkows 
codefendant accountant norman rothberg after telling the judge 
they were too emotionally drained to continue discussions wednesday 
they recessed for the day and were to resume deliberations on 
rothberg on thursday 
the minkow case was among the most bizarre developments to rock 
the volatile money markets in recent years the zzzz best carpet 
cleaning company had been one of the hottest items on wall street 
before scandal erupted and the business collapsed 
large banks and brokerages lost millions along with small 
investors and it became clear that minkow once hailed as a 
business whiz kid was not the boy wonder he seemed 
true he was only 16 when he started a carpet cleaning business 
in his parents garage in the san fernando valley but he admitted 
during the fourmonth trial that his claim that zzzz best made a 
fortune on restoring fire and water damaged buildings was a lie 
he sold investors on a business that for the most part did not 
exist assistant us attorney james asperger told jurors in 
opening statements 
he said minkows manipulations cost investors more than 25 
million while the young entrepreneur lived in a 1 million house and 
drove a red ferrari 
sentencing for minkow was set for feb 21 and kenner said he 
hoped us district judge dickran tevrizian would be lenient 
theoretically minkow could draw up to 300 years in prison 
barry is a young man kenner said he never said he didnt 
do anything wrong i would hope barry will still be a young man 
when he is released 
kenner also confirmed that defense and prosecution lawyers had 
been nearing a possible plea bargain agreement at the time the 
jurors announced they had reached a verdict 
the prosecutors would say only that they were pleased with the 
verdict but would comment no further until rothbergs section of the 
case was resolved 
minkow who had captivated the press and public with the story of 
his youthful success openly admitted that he had defrauded 
investors out of millions but he insisted it wasnt his fault 
i was just a front man for the mob he told jurors as part of 
his risky defense of duress he claimed that mafia figures stock 
manipulators and thugs infiltrated his business threatened him with 
death and orchestrated the huge zzzz best fraud 
he named the late reputed mobster jack catain as a key figure in 
his intimidation and said others including a loan shark named dan 
krowpman used death threats to win his cooperation 
i didnt resist anymore he said i was just a puppet 
i was out of objecting strength it was over i just did as i was 
told 
but the prosecution portrayed minkow as a shrewd con man who 
defrauded others to satisfy his thirst for fame and fortune 
power prestige and money are the three things most important 
to barry minkow said assistant us attorney gordon greenberg 
he called minkow a pathological liar and said this defense 
of duress just doesnt fly 
ten of minkows former associates including krowpman have 
pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the zzzz best frauds

a large creche the state erected in front 
of the capitol can remain despite objections that it amounts to 
state sponsorship of religion a federal judge ruled wednesday 
but the state was ordered to meet several conditions by monday or 
remove the barnlike structure with its manger and animal pens us 
district judge william o bertelsman said the state must come up 
with private funding and post a large disclaimer stating that it is 
not endorsing any religion 
the american civil liberties union had sought to force the state 
to remove the creche which is without figurines of the infant jesus 
and other humans its request for an injunction was turned down 
suzy post director of the kentucky aclu said from her 
louisville office that she had not read the opinion 
what we would have liked obviously is for the thing to be 
taken down right now on the other hand what the judge has done 
is acknowledge that there has to be a separation between church and 
state she said 
the aclu wont decide until next week whether to appeal the 
ruling 
bertelsmans first condition was that all past and future 
expenditures of public funds be defrayed by private 
contributions 
the landscaped creche cost the state about 2400 including 
materials and the salaries of the state workers who put it up court 
papers showed 
kevin hable a lawyer for gov wallace wilkinson said he 
believed the state already had been offered enough money to recover 
what had been spent on the creche to date and to pay for its 
continued maintenance 
bertelsmans second condition was that the state erect a 
prominent disclaimer readable by anyone passing in a car 
he dictated this wording this display was not constructed with 
public funds and does not constitute an endorsement by the 
commonwealth of any religion or religious doctrine 
he also ordered the state to post a public notice that the area 
around the creche is a public forum available to all 
responsible citizens and civic and religious groups for holiday 
ceremonies pageants or displays 
finally bertelsman said the state must adopt a policy on the 
creches use 
pat abell another of wilkinsons lawyers said he believed 
bertelsmans conditions were just and equitable and that he 
would recommend the state accept them 
attorneys for wilkinson contended the creche was only part of a 
general christmas display a reminder of the holidays religious 
significance and therefore constitutional 
the 30foot state christmas tree was about 100 yards behind the 
creche 
elsewhere on the capitol grounds trees and lampposts have been 
decorated with lights ribbons and holly and the states large 
floral clock behind the capitol was decorated as a huge snowflake 
but the aclu said the creche was the dominant structure the 
first thing a visitor would see and had the primary effect of 
sponsoring religion 
the judge disagreed saying that the stable structure could be 
interpreted not as an endorsement of religion or any religious 
doctrine but merely as a reminder of the religious origins of 
christmas bertelsman said 
the creche although without traditional human figurines for 
legal reasons was staffed on some nights by members of area 
churches as a living nativity scene

schools should be open longer and allow their 
buildings to be used for community purposes such as alcohol and drug 
counseling a congressional panel recommended wednesday 
all american students should have access to early childhood 
education according to a report by the subcommittee on education 
and health of the joint economic committee 
in addition subcommittee chairman james scheuer dny said 
more students should have a chance to go to college so they can 
prepare to compete in todays complex work environment 
it seems obvious that kindergarten through grade 12 education 
which was adequate for the work force of a predominantly 
agricultural nation adapting to industrialization is simply 
obsolete in todays complex and sophisticated hightech 
environment scheuer said 
it is clear to me that we must assure a higher education 
opportunity for all eligible students just as we did for returning 
soldiers after world war ii he said 
the subcommittees report based on nine days of hearings 
proposed a longer school year and said schools should be kept open 
nights weekends holidays and summers 
schools should be viewed as capital investments in the 
communities and used for many civic needs such as drug and alcohol 
counseling adult literacy programs and job counseling the 
subcommittee recommended 
children should be taught higher order skills scheuer said 
not only reading writing and math but teaching children how to 
think and how to learn 
schools also should update vocational education programs and 
increase the availability and quality of onthejob training the 
subcommittee said

a us military team flew to vietnam 
thursday to receive 38 sets of remains believed to be those of 
missing americans in the largest such turnover since the vietnam war 
ended 
during the repatriation ceremony scheduled thursday at hanois 
noi bai airport the vietnamese also were to turn over information 
on 12 other cases of americans listed as missing in action or mias 
said lt col thomas j boyd a spokesman for the us pacific 
command 
at the ceremony a us military honor guard will solemnly load 
the remains each in metal caskets topped with a folded american 
flag onto a us air force plane for the flight to guam and then 
honolulu in honolulu the army central identification laboratory 
will analyze the remains to determine if they belong to any of the 
1747 mias still listed from the vietnam war 
vietnamese officials usually do preliminary analyses but the 
army laboratory sometimes finds among the remains those of 
vietnamese individuals 
the us government appreciates the initiative taken by vietnam 
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing 
cooperation to resolve this longstanding issue lt col keith 
schneider a pentagon spokesman said in washington on wednesday 
the pentagon said it had not received any information from 
vietnam on precisely where the latest remains to be exchanged had 
been recovered or the circumstances surrounding their discovery 
schneider added however that we understand the remains as 
well as the information are related to incidents that occurred 
during the war in the northern provinces 
most missing americans in the north were airmen shot down on 
bombing or reconnaissance missions 
all told the remains of 172 americans have been repatriated to 
the united states from vietnam and subsequently identified by the 
army laboratory since the end of the war 
the previous largest turnover of remains believed to be those of 
mias involved 27 sets handed over april 6 the most recent turnover 
involved 23 sets repatriated nov 3 
thursdays repatriation will be the seventh since retired gen 
john w vessey acting as a special us presidential envoy reached 
agreement with vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach to end 
months of deadlock on the mia issue in all 138 sets of remains 
have been returned since the august 1987 agreement in hanoi 
the first american combat troops in vietnam landed in danang 
then in south vietnam in march 1965 the paris peace accords in 
january 1973 halted us fighting in the conflict which killed 
about 58000 americans and ended in the communist victory over the 
usbacked south vietnamese government in april 1975 
bitter political bickering between hanoi and washington has often 
blocked accounting for the us missing since then the us 
government says it will not consider normalizing relations with 
vietnam until hanoi withdraws all its troops from cambodia and 
resolves the mia issue 
currently 2383 americans are listed as mia as a result of the 
war 1747 are missing in vietnam 547 in laos 83 in cambodia and 
six in china 
in laos us and laotian officials were continuing thursday a 
joint excavation in southern savannakhet province to try to 
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968 the excavation to 
be completed in a few days is the fourth such joint project in laos

airport it opened for eight performances here wednesday night at 
the beacon theater usually a rock venue a 38city american tour 
began sept 22 and will run through feb 28 
as m begins his story one wonders whether he is crazy dreaming 
on lsd getting shock treatments or the protagonist of a science 
fiction story once on a farm he says the heavens opened the 
sound came and alien beings took him away with them another time 
he grabbed a beehive thinking from beesting pain hed learn the 
meaning of life 
now in new york taking a walk with a girl his apartment house 
disappears he runs steps outside time looks into his own mind 
travels in a spaceship sees the face of an alien and understands 
why people seek soulmates coming to he remembers being told to 
deny his wayout and inner realizations or hell be an outcast he 
regretfully does that then really forgets but fears that a 
headache will start something again 
glasss music is enormously popular these days and one assumes it 
is a larger attraction even than the story symbolism and 
holographic scenery 
small bursts of melody repeat for a brief time often the 
opposite of indian music which has a drone underneath here the 
drone may be a soprano saxophone the stabs of rhythm and melody 
come in lower tones 
there are many different interesting melodies in 1000 
airplanes one doesnt feel as was the case sometimes in the 
past that the entire opera is repeating one melody with slight 
variations 
since imitation puccini and jagged unsingable intervals arent 
working in modern opera maybe glass has the answer

a jury wednesday convicted a selfdescribed 
neonazi skinhead of attempted seconddegree murder and malicious 
harassment for a knife attack on a black man last summer 
billy wayne worl 24 a transient from bartlesville okla had 
been charged with attempted firstdegree murder but was convicted of 
the lesser charge for attacking raymond hill 29 in a supermarket 
parking lot july 30 
the case was believed to be the first time a person has been 
prosecuted in washington state on a charge of malicious harassment 
which is defined as causing physical injury with the intent to 
harass or intimidate someone because of race color or ancestry 
after a week of testimony the superior court jury deliberated 
about four hours before returning its verdict 
worl had come to the spokane area a week before the attack 
because he said he was attracted by the aryan nations white 
supremacist church based in nearby hayden lake idaho 
the prosecution had argued that worls attack was unprovoked and 
motivated by racial hatred hill testified that worl approached him 
while he was sitting in his car and that worl stabbed and slashed 
him with a knife 
worl was the only witness in his own defense he testified 
tuesday that he approached hill to panhandle for money then rushed 
hill and slashed at him with a knife in selfdefense because he 
thought hill had a gun 
defense attorney maryann moreno attempted to counter the claim of 
racism in her closing arguments telling jurors that worls beliefs 
were not on trial 
skinheads arent on trial she said white supremacy isnt 
on trial the aryan nations isnt on trial racism is not on trial 
the skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in london in 
the 1960s segments of the movement later took on nazi overtones and 
since have been associated with the white supremacist groups 
no sentencing date was set a juvenile codefendant charged with 
attempted murder and malicious harassment is scheduled to stand 
trial next month in juvenile court

presidentelect bush recruiting again from the 
reagan administration named clayton yeutter as secretary of 
agriculture wednesday he also said it would surprise me if an 
fbi check had turned up anything to preclude john tower from being 
defense secretary 
bush said he was confident tower could do an excellent job if i 
decide to go that route the former texas senator met with bushs 
counsel c boyden gray to review material developed by the fbi 
during an extensive background check and bush officials said the 
investigation was at an end 
while bush has promised to bring in a new team of players when 
his administration takes office jan 20 yeutter is the fifth 
holdover from the reagan administration where he served three years 
in the cabinetlevel post of us trade representative 
yeutters selection delighted farmstate lawmakers and others 
clayton is a pro said sen max baucus dmont his experience 
and knowledge on trade issues will be a big plus american farm 
bureau federation spokesman john lewis said yeutter was an 
outstanding choice who understands agriculture and its problems 
bush in a news conference also said he expected to name a black 
to his cabinet louis sullivan president of morehouse college 
school of medicine in atlanta who is black has been touted as a 
leading candidate to head the department of health and human 
services 
the washington post reported in thursdays editions that another 
black julius w becton jr a retired threestar army general who 
now heads the federal emergency management agency is the leading 
candidate to head the department of veterans affairs the post also 
quoted sources as saying that federal trade commissioner patricia 
diaz dennis who is hispanic is a candidate to head the labor 
department 
bush press secretary sheila tate said she had no information on 
the possible appointments 
bushs freewheeling news conference focused heavily on foreign 
policy issues fielding questions he appeared relaxed and confident 
he hinted his administration would seek a delay in februarys 
resumption of arms control talks with the soviet union there is 
no way that we are going to have by feb 15 or 16 a detailed 
pointbypoint program on arms talks bush said were not going 
to have it 
we are going to start working vigorously and i will send 
whatever signal it takes to convey that message bush said i am 
interested in progress but i want it to be prudent i want whatever 
steps we take to be lasting 
bush said his advisers still have not completed assessing soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs announcement of a 500000 cutback in 
soviet forces a reduction of about 10 percent in red army troop 
strength 
on another matter bush said there was some movement forward 
toward moderation in palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafats speech this week but not enough to warrant direct 
dealings with the plo by the united states 
bush said he wants clear unmistakeable unambiguous 
declarations that the plo renounces terrorism recognizes israel and 
will work within key united nations resolutions 
on other issues bush 
said vice presidentelect dan quayles role would be very much 
like the reaganbush relationship he said quayle would be a key 
player in national security affairs if he wants to be and that 
there may be specific assignments in other areas 
said he has not considered how to pay for cleaning up us 
nuclear weapons production plants likewise bush said had not yet 
addressed the problem of the homeless in america which he called 
a national shame 
avoided commenting on whether there were ethical lapses among 
members of congress but said he would send ethics legislation to 
capitol hill very very early in his administration 
said he would not seek substantial cuts in existing farm 
programs but didnt say what he meant by substantial i do not 
believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of 
farmers 
bush spent part of his day meeting with labor leaders and also 
with women from inside and outside government he said he was 
determined to have an administration thats broadly 
representative of all groups 
that clearly means that there will be active women in high 
levels of the administration bush said 
he also conferred with lowell weicker jr a republican who lost 
his bid for a fourth senate term from connecticut weicker was a 
leading advocate on capitol hill for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration and environmentalists and others are 
promoting him as a possible head of the agency 
yeutter is bushs sixth cabinet nominee joining reagan 
administration veterans james a baker iii former treasury 
secretary named secretary of state nicholas brady picked to stay 
as treasury secretary dick thornburgh to stay as attorney general 
and lauro cavazos who will stay as education secretary the new 
commerce secretary longtime bush friend robert mosbacher is new to 
the cabinet 
officials say bush hopes to round out his cabinet by christmas 
by many accounts announcement could come soon on samuel skinner 
head of the chicagoarea regional transportation authority to be 
transportation secretary 
yeutter 58 a former nebraska farmer was chief executive 
officer of the chicago mercantile exchange and served in the 
agriculture department and as deputy trade representative in the 
administration of president ford 
tower has been considered a top prospect for defense secretary 
for years but his expected appointment by bush has been delayed by 
an extensive fbi investigation of his dealings with defense 
contractors and aspects of his personal life 
disagreeing with concerns raised in congress transition 
cochairman craig fuller said tower would be strengthened by the 
long background check because no stone has been left unturned 
several members of congress have said the uncertainty and delay 
has weakened tower politically after going through a difficult 
divorce tower has been questioned about allegations raised by his 
former wife as well as his ties with defense contractors sources 
say

gone bad on nbcs in the heat of the night will revive his 
television career 
ames stars in the drama series next tuesday as sheriff thompson 
an old friend of police chief bill gillespie carroll oconnor who 
undergoes a change for the worse after the death of his wife 
ames is best known to television audiences for playing mingo 
daniel boones oxfordeducated cherokee indian companion on daniel 
boone 20 years ago after he left the series in 1968 ames resumed 
his singing career in recent years he has worked mostly in regional 
theater and performed in concerts 
in the heat of the night stars oconnor as chief of police in 
fictional sparta miss and howard rollins as the chief of 
detectives the series was inspired by the oscarwinning 1967 movie 
of the same name that starred rod steiger as a southern sheriff 
forced to accept the help of a black detective played by sidney 
poitier to solve a murder case 
the series is in its second season 
ames plays a sheriff whose life kind of collapses he said 
he lets his personal problems influence his professional duties 
and he begins to abuse his prisoners hes chief gillespies oldest 
friend and they end up on opposite sides of the fence 
it starts when a black rookie policeman from sparta arrests 
an old friend whos fleeing thompsons jail he pleads not to be 
sent back when he is sent back and dies in thompsons jail the 
black policeman has himself arrested so he can investigate the 
charges 
the rookie officer wilson sweet is played by new cast member 
geoffrey thorne 
gillespie has a hard time believing all this about his old 
friend said ames but his young policeman gets badly beaten in 
my jail what i like is that none of this violence is shown on 
screen 
i liked this script because it deals with police brutality it 
takes another look at ethnic prisoners and the police it doesnt 
make the guy into a monster he was a man who had helped people but 
when he went bad there was no system in the community to deal with 
it 
ames has worked in regional theater in recent years appearing in 
such plays as fiddler on the roof man of la mancha and 
south pacific 
ive also been in shenandoah a musical adapted from the 
movie with james stewart he said he played charlie anderson a 
man who was indifferent to the civil war until his family became 
involved the plays a metaphor for whats happening in the world 
today hes the little guy on the farm whos caught between the two 
sides 
ames did a guest shot on murder she wrote a few years ago 
but otherwise had rarely appeared on television 
ive decided i want to come back and do television and films 
again he said i must confess that after daniel boone i 
wanted to do some theater i had a hit record come out and it 
started a whole new career for me again as a musical artist 
he had been a member of the ames brothers a popular singing 
group he sang with his brothers gene joe and vic 
after the group broke up he went to drama school and later played 
the schizophrenic indian in one flew over the cuckoos nest on 
broadway with kirk douglas the producers of daniel boone saw 
him in that and offered me the role of mingo 
ames also picked up two college degrees including one in 
directing from the ucla film school

direct too

what do you do when you tell your friends you 
cant have dinner with them because you have to watch a very brady 
christmas and they are thrilled and come over with takeout blinis 
to watch it with you 
you sit down and watch a very brady christmas 
the holiday movie isnt on until sunday but we had a review tape 
from cbs my friends were mightily impressed at getting to see a 
very brady christmas before anybody else in america 
yep its the same living room one friend remarked as the 
show began she recalled the earth tones of the original brady house 
and exactly where the furniture was same kitchen another 
friend noted the faucets different its a washerless faucet 
im glad they noticed all this i was never big on the brady 
bunch myself i preferred the partridge family 
my friends were just as quick to detect changes in the shows 
25yearold sensibility as they were to spot new upholstery on the 
dining room chairs 
theres definitely more sex in this one said one they 
never had sex in the old one just kids 
interesting observation might make a trend story 
as the movie opened we immediately learned that christmas was 
coming and carol brady florence henderson was planning to 
surprise mike brady robert reed with a trip to greece but mike 
was going to surprise carol with a trip to japan what a 
kneeslapper this had all the makings of an extremely brady 
christmas indeed 
what do the bradys do flip a coin armwrestle no way they use 
the money to send plane tickets to all the kids so christmas can be 
even bradier 
there are also subplots one is a towering inferno kind of 
thing in another alice the maid ann b davis is distraught 
because her husband sam the butcher has left her for a younger 
woman 
but we didnt especially care because our real goal in watching 
a very brady christmas was at hand what do the kids look like 
as adults 
greg the oldest boy is a doctor he has a moustache and is 
balding 
peter the middle one has turned into a yuppie 
bobby the youngest one is blond and races cars 
i remember when he and his sister tried to break the worlds 
record by going up and down on that thing in the backyard said 
one of my friends awash in sentiment whats that thing that goes 
up and down 
a teetertotter 
yeah the teetertotter 
yeesh these reunion movies really raise the conversation level 
anyway on to the girls 
marcia the oldest one looks pretty much the same 
jan the middle one looks pretty much the same 
cindy the little one looks remarkably the same considering 
shes played by a different actress 
well it turns out that every one of the brady bunch had a very 
secret reason for not wanting to come to a very brady christmas 
gregs wife had gone off to see her family instead jans husband 
had moved out of the house marcias husband has lost his job cindy 
was tired of being treated like a baby peter didnt want the family 
to know he was afraid of marrying his girlfriend because shes his 
boss bobby had dropped out of graduate school 
detecting a philosophical facet of the script lost on me one of 
my friends noted this is definitely what christmas reunions are 
about deception 
ok we were bradied out we had seen the kids and we had figured 
out all the subplots all that was left was for sam the butcher to 
show up 
i can see it a mile away snorted one of my friends 
theyll all decide its best to be honest 
in the end they all decided it was best to be honest and sam 
the butcher showed up

just one year ago there existed a widely held 
view that the feverish pace of mergers acquisitions and leveraged 
buyouts would begin fading like so many other fierce fads of 
business 
that assumption was no better than some of the economic forecasts 
made at the time which you will recall was just weeks after the 
great stock market shock of 1987 which some people thought was a 
forerunner of recession 
recession didnt come and neither did an end to the pace of 
takeovers the latter defied the stock market shock economic 
uncertainty poison pill takeover defenses and more in fact 
the pace actually quickened 
the new year had scarecely begun for example when a 4 billion 
takeover bid for sterling drug opened the flood gates for what now 
appears to be a record year for mergers and acquisitions 
figures compiled by wright investors service a bridgeport 
connbased international investment firm show that transactions in 
the first nine months amounted to 198 billion or 35 percent ahead 
of the 1987 pace 
with an estimated 72 billion worth of deals announced early in 
the fourth quarter this years activity should easily exceed the 
record 204 billion reached in 1986 
so will the pace decline in 1989 wright thinks so 
because of its sheer size says wright the recent 2453 billion 
rjr nabisco inc leveraged buyout deal received intense scrutiny 
the end result of which was overwhelmingly negative public 
opinion 
despite management assertions about increasing productivity and 
enhancing shareholder value it asserts that rjr has heightened 
the nearly universal perception that greed and not competitiveness 
is the prime motivation behind most leveraged buyouts 
greed is a sin to be sure but it is not officially a crime 
criminal fads run up against the law and meet their demise but 
nowhere in the past is there substantial evidence that mere sinful 
fads scored the conscience of the greedy 
the reason must lie elsewhere 
wright agrees that while the federal reserve board and congress 
are increasingly concerned about takeover activities debt 
financing the reduction in equities and lost taxes they are a long 
way from taking effective action 
that is it might take those two bodies more than the time 
alloted to the year 1989 to produce restraints on takeovers 
what then will slow the pace 
wright thinks the answer might lie in the realities of the 
marketplace the economics of takeovers are not what they were 
five years ago when the dow jones industrial average was 900 points 
lower it states 
when combined with higher interest rates and other unfavorable 
economic factors wright believes this relative lack of value argues 
for a slowdown of takeover activity in 1989 
it adds one more reason for such thinking suggesting that while 
the greed of managers hasnt necessarily lessened their 
selfinterest might have become intensified by activities in 1988 
specifically with the spectacular failure of managements bid 
in the rjr nabisco takeover corporate managers may now think twice 
before putting their companies into play it states

at a manhattan church this sunday that 
commemorated christmas pair mary and joseph will be portrayed in a 
modern mode a homeless couple hunting for shelter 
this has become the plight of hundreds of thousands of people 
across america today just as it was the plight of mary and joseph 
2000 years ago in bethlehem 
they also were homeless says the rev thomas f pike of 
calvaryst georges episcopal church whose annual candlelight 
service is presenting their situation as current rather than past 
they like many nowadays had no place to stay adds pike 
who also heads the board of new york citys interfaith partnership 
for the homeless that family also was wandering the streets 
they had to deliver the child in a backyard stable a cave 
then they faced persecution and had to flee they had to leave for 
another country they were refugees 
in a similar way he says the growing multitude of homeless 
americans is a crisis not just in the lives of individual victims 
but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation 
as chairman of an organization described as the nations largest 
private local program providing the homeless with food shelter and 
some permanent housing pike added in an interview 
the growing callousness and willingness of people to live 
sidebyside with this tragedy affects everyone what we see is the 
erosion of the worth of life of the dignity of the human person 
we see more and more tolerance of violence a depreciation of 
life our nation is really at a crossroads if we dont resolve the 
issue of homelessness every cherished institution in american life 
will be affected by cynicism and doubt 
estimates have placed the number of us homeless at up to 3 
million wandering the streets and byways of cities across the 
country crowding soup lines hunting temporary shelter by night 
pike said presidentelect bushs expressed hopes for a gentler 
quieter nation arent likely if he doesnt listen to the cries 
in the streets of the homeless 
theres no way american society can be deaf and blind to this 
crisis most people are hoping bush provides leadership in dealing 
with it 
pike said that while the spreading severity of the problem may 
represent the dark side of the picture the massive volunteer 
response to it represents the brighter side 
an incredible number of institutions are working on this 
crisis he said millions of volunteers of religious 
educational and philanthropic institutions are involved its a real 
sign of hope 
literally every community and town on the face of this nation 
through individuals and groups has mobilized support for hungry and 
homeless people if the president builds on that we can have hope 
that this terrible tragedy will be alleviated 
pike who estimates new york citys homeless at about 50000 
said the interorganizational partnership here has become a model 
for places all over the country hundreds of them have picked it 
up 
he said the the key to it is partnership not only among 
religious congregations protestant roman catholic and jewish but 
also with civic labor and other organizations as well as city and 
state agencies 
we present a united response cooperative and not 
confrontational that maximizes communication in dealing with the 
system he said 
pike 51 who twice has been nominated unsuccessfully for 
diocesan bishop in los angeles and new york said that 400 new 
york city churches and synagogues are involved in providing food and 
shelter to the homeless 
the congregations run 130 shelters that house about 2000 people 
per night totalling 400000 last winter with more than a million 
meals served about 24000 volunteers have served in the program 
since it began in 1982 
it started then with only two churches manhattans st josephs 
roman catholic church and calvaryst georges episcopal church but 
has since spread to a wide interreligious network 
besides the sheltering and feeding program the partnership also 
runs a permanent housing operation project domicile which has 
helped relocate 3700 homeless people from shelters and welfare 
hotels to permanent apartments 
pike also a director of the new york landmarks conservancy that 
helps fund restoration of historic sites said a criticial need in 
reducing homelessness is reform of the welfare system 
it is not supportive of family life he said it ought to 
support and encourage families to stay together and encourage 
stability 
under the circumstances he said some of the most heroic 
people in the country are women raising children 
describing a sick young woman with an eightmonthsold infant 
who fell into the subway tracks at manhattans union square and who 
was lifted out just before a train roared in he said 
thats the new york madonna

a jury of french citizens has acquitted king louis 
xvi of conspiring against public liberty and national security 
thus reversing one of the momentous events of french revolutionary 
history unfortunately for louis it came a bit late 
in a strange mixture of old and new of the 18th century and the 
modern the private tf1 television network and le figaro magazine 
retried louis capet using a combination of presentday lawyers 
and costumed actors then the french people were asked to judge 
this time around 196 years after the real louis went to the 
guillotine for treason the french of 1988 felt a little more 
sympathetic to the man who in his time was a symbol of despotism 
this time he also had a hotshot criminal lawyer 
the mock trial shown live for nearly 1 hours on prime time 
television is part of the runup to the bicentennial of the french 
revolution next july 14 
at the end of the television trial the viewers were given an 
hour to cast their votes by telephone for acquittal exile or death 
the result announced at the beginning of the evenings last 
newscast just before midnight was 55 percent for acquittal 275 
percent for death and 175 percent for sending the monarch into 
exile in actuality louis was condemned to death by a majority of 
one 
the real louis xvi unable to control the revolution or escape 
it first was reduced to a figurehead then finally put on trial by 
the convention which later became the national assembly he was 
convicted and beheaded jan 21 1793 his wife marie antoinette 
was guillotined the following october after her conviction of 
treason 
for the purposes of television however the king was retried in 
a courtroom by a threejudge panel wearing blue white and red 
revolutionary plumes costumed prosecutors and other court 
personnel the defense lawyer wore a dark business suit the 
audience was clearly amateur and 20th century 
i reject in advance your judgment the 39yearold king told 
the court before announcing he would not respond to questions 
only god can judge me 
the republic does not exist i remain king even from my jail 
cell he said showing the great dignity history says he showed 
during his actual trial 
the show seemed an awkward confusion of part text part 
improvisation bumbled lines and mixing of historical periods such 
as when one accuser called the king with great foresight 
frances first collaborator 
representing the king was jacques verges a defense lawyer who 
has made a career out of defending controversial figures including 
the nazi war criminal klaus barbie among the accusers was gilbert 
collard one of the french legal professions young golden boys 
the public prosecutor was played by writer jeanedern hallier 
whose role was mostly a matter of interjecting occasional demands 
for louis head 
the witnesses for the prosecution revolutionaries georges 
jacques danton jeannicolas villaudvarenne maximilien de 
robespierre and pierre daunou and thierry the kings valet were 
vague in their accusations but vehement in their beliefs 
weighing heavily against louis was the fact that he tried to run 
for it in june 1791 but was caught at varennes that was considered 
proof that he was off to get a foreign army to help restore him to 
power 
the only witness for the defense chretien de lamoignon de 
malesherbes a minister under louis who emigrated during the 
revolution praised the accomplishments of the reign 
he testified that louis was a man of peace who did well in war 
winning the only naval victory ever over england and successful in 
aiding the american revolution he said louis also took france to 
the heights of scientific advances fostered a tolerance that 
protected jews and restored the civil rights of protestants 
verges and collard battled in modernday courtroom style some of 
it obviously not programmed prompting the judge to warn them not to 
make it a personal duel 
louis xvi was guillotined said prosecutor antoine 
fouquiertinville slipping down the historical path prematurely 
you dont remake history you dont repair accidents of history 
louis capet you will be guillotined because you were guillotined 
verges in his reallife favorite tactic accused the accusers 
asking why they did not abolish royalty in 1789 and establish a 
republic 
if louis disappears his son becomes king will you kill his 
son too 
in the end reasonableness and mercy prevailed and when the 
acquittal was announced there were more than a few cries of vive 
le roi from the audience in the television theater

christmas week 20 years ago was 
transformed into a magic and memorable occasion by three american 
a had embarked on mans first visit to explore 
another world the riskiest and deepest penetration yet into the 
void of his universe 
apollo 8 was to circle the moon 10 times in 20 hours on christmas 
eve and christmas day gathering navigational photographic and 
spacecraft performance data vitally needed before americans could 
attempt to land on the moon in 1969 
the christmastime launch was a coincidence of orbital mechanics 
the constantlymoving moon is in position to receive visitors from 
earth only three or four days each month 
the spacecraft performed perfectly the men inside did not fare 
as well all three experienced slight motion sickness and borman 
suffered insomnia and 24hour intestinal flu the next day they felt 
fine and looking out the window they saw for the first time the 
earth in its entirety from 200000 miles away 
overwhelmed they transmitted to the television screens of 
millions of homes this spectacular view of a gleaming marblelike 
sphere of blues and greens and browns and whites 
youre looking at yourself radioed borman acting as a tour 
guide 
what youre seeing is the western hemisphere in the center 
just lower to the center is south america all the way down to cape 
horn i can see baja california and the southwestern part of the 
united states 
lovell continued describing royalblue waters bright white 
clouds and brownish land areas what i keep imagining is if im 
some lonely traveler from another planet what id think of the 
earth at this altitude whether i think it would be inhabited or 
not 
those television pictures had an overwhelming impact giving 
humans a new perspective of their planet many felt more than ever 
that earth was a beautiful planet worth working to save the 
picture of this lonely delicate celestial body became a rallying 
point for environmentalists worldwide 
minutes after the astronauts signed off the television show 
apollo 8 raced into the equigravisphere a twilight zone where 
the gravitational pull of earth and moon are equal now less than 
40000 miles from the moon borman lovell and anders did what no 
human had done before they came under the prime influence of the 
moons gravity 
the spacecraft its speed gradually falling during the outward 
journey was traveling only 2200 mph early on christmas eve day 
when mission control gave the goahead for lunar orbit the moons 
gravity tug had accelerated the speed to 5800 mph fast enough to 
swing the ship back toward earth if a braking rocket failed to slow 
the craft to orbital speed 
the spacecraft moved around to the moons backside cutting radio 
contact with ground control for 36 agonizing minutes the world 
waited was the engine firing a success not until the ship emerged 
around the moons edge was the answer known 
weve got it shouted a voice in mission control amid a 
bedlam of cheers apollo 8 is in lunar orbit 
lovell the first to expound on the moon from only 70 miles 
distant said it looks like plaster of paris a sort of grayish 
beach sand he had answered the first of many questions about that 
alien body that had awed humans since their beginning 
during the next 20 hours would come answers to many more 
throughout the day the astronauts snapped thousands of photographs 
and motion pictures in the first of two telecasts from lunar orbit 
they relayed pictures of a wild and wondrous landscape pitted with 
massive craters 
it looks like a vast lonely forbidding place an expanse of 
nothing clouds of pumice stone borman said 
lovell saw the distant earth as a grand oasis in the big 
vastness of space 
the moonmen surveyed and photographed all five of the prime sites 
being considered for the first apollo manned landing mission they 
practiced identifying and tracking lunar landmarks and discovered 
new ones by evening the astronauts were tired but so buoyed by 
their achievements that they expanded a telecast from a planned 15 
minutes to 37 minutes 
while their camera scanned the lunar desert blinding in the 
sunlight forbidding in the shadow and with an estimated half a 
billion people watching some already celebrating christmas anders 
said for all the people on earth the crew of apollo 8 has a 
message we would like to send you 
silence fell over many households as with the striking 
television pictures as a backdrop anders began reading the story of 
the creation from genesis 
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the 
earth was without form and void and darkness were upon the face of 
the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters 
and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw 
the light and it was good and god divided the light from darkness 
lovell continued and god called the light day and the 
darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the 
first day and god said let there be a firmament and god made 
the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament 
from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and 
god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning 
were the second day 
from borman and god said let the waters under the heaven be 
gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and 
it was so and god called the dry land earth and the gathering 
together of the waters he called seas and god saw that it was 
good 
then the emotion of the day in his voice borman ended the 
telecast saying and from the crew of apollo 8 we close with 
good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of you 
all of you on the good earth

dustin hoffman shuddered the screening room 
projector flickered with rushes of his first days work in 
rain man fighting off nausea hoffman knew his portrayal of an 
autistic man stank 
it was death hoffman recalled in an interview with the 
associated press it was the worst work i had ever done i 
said i cant do it defeated the academy awardwinning actor 
suggested the producers try richard dreyfuss instead 
hoffman whose past triumphs include playing a woman in 
tootsie was stumped by the part of raymond babbitt a 
middleaged autistic savant 
in rain man opening friday the longinstitutionalized 
raymond is largely incapable of basic human emotions and speech but 
gifted with superior mathematical and memorization skills 
its not an easy part having researched autism so intensively he 
was buried in documents and videocassettes hoffman 51 had to dump 
his notes and observations in his dressing room and well act no 
plot contrivances offered shelter 
as hoffman tells it all he could manage at first was a mishmash 
of his past work mixing bits of the timid nearsighted prisoner 
louis in 1973s papillon and the sickly ratzo rizzo in 
midnight cowboy from 1969 
then three weeks into filming hoffman and costar tom cruise 
were driving down a bleak highway near tiny cogar okla the 
temperature over 100 degrees was matched by the humidity in a 
sweatlaced improvisation hoffman started talking about how much 
raymond missed his hanes underwear and he just wouldnt stop 
with those cotton briefs hoffman figured it all out 
it looked like to me that you could have talked about your 
underwear forever hoffman said director barry levinson told him 
and i suddenly realized that yes this character is in the now 
and he is nowhere if hes not in the now 
and i suddenly realized that i was playing off myself because i 
know something about obsession and im comfortable being obsessive 
the rest of it just took care of itself 
rain man tracks raymonds brother charlie cruise a 
coldhearted schemer whose father dies leaving him none of the 
riches he so desperately wishes to inherit instead the 3 million 
falls into a mysterious trust account which charlie discovers 
benefits a brother he never knew he had 
in an attempt to filch the inheritance and save his 
bankruptcybound car business charlie abducts his newfound brother 
and the two set out crosscountry top down in a 1949 buick 
roadmaster convertible their fathers car 
in a series of minor incidents along the way the brothers reach 
a remote though improved understanding of kinship there are no 
triumphant scenes of blissful revelation rain man whose title 
comes from charlies earliest dreamy recollections of a shared 
childhood with raymond ends quietly some might say indifferently 
rain man survived not only hoffmans panic but also a year of 
screenplay revisions the replacement of three directors the 
scriptwriters strike and the meddlings of various entertainment 
industry knowitalls it emerges as a modest exploration of greed 
communication and familial understanding 
i didnt think an easy ending was the right way to go said 
levinson the movies fourth and final director there had been a 
bunch of endings where the brothers were going to live happily 
ever after but it didnt seem to apply 
added producer mark johnson what we ended up with was much 
more simple than anything else that existed in the scripts 
before 
it was precisely that intended lack of ornament that proved so 
elusive 
martin brest midnight run steven spielberg et the 
extraterrestrial and sydney pollack tootsie all were in 
line to direct rain man at one point or another for a variety 
of reasons some personal some professional the three came and 
went but all wanted to dress the story up 
one script called for gangsters and fbi agents another suggested 
a big snowstorm the role of charlies girlfriend played by valeria 
golino was either too big or not big enough raymond should be more 
retarded or maybe not retarded at all perhaps raymond and 
charlie could become really close at the end said some perhaps 
not responded others 
they the assorted kibitzers felt that there had to be a 
jeopardy in the story hoffman said in other words whats 
going to hold an audience if theres just two schmucks in a car 
levinson the director of good morning vietnam and diner 
suspected the audience could be held by just letting the schmucks be 
schmucks the final script turned in by ronald bass just as the 
fivemonth writers guild of america strike began cut most of what 
levinson considered superfluous 
i basically wanted to get it down to a conflict between two 
people on the road levinson said more and more of what we see 
in the movies are mechanical plots we pump them up instead of 
saying lets just deal with the people 
levinsons previous films have been marked by loosely organized 
stories and in rain man he predictably chose to let the 
characters carry the narrative rather than the other way around 
those familiar with cruises recent work cocktail top 
gun might wince at abandoning the 26yearold actor to his acting 
skills in such a dramatic role 
but cruise shrugs it off 
for myself it was a challenge for myself it was different 
for myself it was the best role that ive had in my career to 
date cruise said 
i do feel that i have a better sense of acting every time i 
go on from a picture you get more confidence not cocky like i 
know what im doing but a confidence of trying scenes different 
ways and not getting locked into one idea of how to play a scene 
hoffman as is his custom made story suggestions throughout 
filming on several occasions he checked with his autism experts to 
ensure the film did not violate the truth as hoffman put it 
when the script didnt withstand such challenges it was revised 
any behavior by raymond that might come across as stupid for 
instance was excised autism hoffman was told is a mental 
disorder not retardation 
whether or not such attention to detail will attract audiences 
remains to be seen 
you have no idea what the audience is going to think hoffman 
said underneath everything theres a desire to have an impact on 
the audience i dont want them to get up afterward 
arthur miller said to me when we were doing death of a 
salesman you want to know when the play is really working when 
the curtain comes down and you dont hear anything

amid the frozen farm fields of iowa judy shelly answered a cry 
for help from a small wooden garage huddled inside were a mother 
and three children theyd lost almost everything including their 
home 
they had blankets beds a few sticks of furniture and a hot 
plate but no bathroom or refrigerator no money either forced off 
their farm abandoned by husband and father the family was 
struggling to survive 
their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard 
times in the heartland as farmers lose their land smalltown 
factories shut their doors and housing costs rise growing numbers 
of rural folks are joining the ranks of the nations homeless 
rural homeless people are everywhere around us said louisa 
stark president of the national coalition for the homeless 
theyre living in barns and chicken coops theyre doubled and 
tripled up with families and friends theyre living under trees or 
in some cases sleeping in caves 
garages too the iowa family had rented a nearby house after 
losing their farm last winter but when the pipes burst and the 
landlord couldnt afford repairs they moved into the garage because 
it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater 
shelly who works for a farmersassistance group helped find 
them a place to stay they moved on shortly after 
people think rural america has been able to stand on its own 
two feet ever since the depression shelly said they think 
somehow theyll get by they think you have the white picket fence 
mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids thats not 
the way it is 
the reality is urban life and rural life are not much different 
anymore she added we have people going without food we have 
people going without heat 
and people going without roofs over their heads 
up to 3 million americans are homeless the national coalition 
says some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in rural 
areas but nobody knows for sure because they arent as conspicious 
as people panhandling on city streets or sleeping on grates 
everybody calls the rural homeless invisible in fact they 
are said melanie roth of the housing assistance council in 
washington dc which deals with rural lowincome housing needs 
they dont wander the streets of smalltown america said 
keith luebke codirector of the welcome inn transitional living 
center in mankato minn they leave or they somehow hide 
themselves or hide their problems they dont want anyone to know 
most of the newest rural homeless are working poor and farm 
families says a report by the institute of medicine part of the 
national academy of sciences compared with their urban 
counterparts the report says theyre younger families dependent on 
two incomes typically one wageearner loses a job and the 
remaining income isnt enough to pay the rent they most often live 
in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled 
industries 
these people face a hobsons choice of moving in with friends or 
relatives or pulling up roots and leaving the institutes report 
said some rural areas have a fiveyear waiting list for public 
housing 
though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities 
the rural homeless get much less help fewer shelters fewer soup 
kitchens less money from charities 
in short the faint voice that has recently been given to the 
homeless in urban america has been denied the homeless of rural 
america said a national coalition study on such problems in 
appalachia and the south 
several studies have examined rural homelessness among the 
findings 
more than threequarters of community agencies responding to a 
housing assistance council survey last year reported increases in 
rural homeless from 198182 to 198687 of those 38 percent said 
the increase was significant 
in ohio the proportion of women among the rural homeless was 
twice that of urban homeless populations according to a 1985 study 
thats partly due to the higher percentage of married people among 
the rural homeless 185 percent against 67 percent married among 
urban homeless 
in minnesota 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional 
living centers had jobs compared with 24 percent in urban 
minneapolis said a 1988 study by the minnesota coalition for the 
homeless 
in iowa a study found one of the larger groups in danger of 
losing homes was farm widows many of whom live on just a few 
hundred dollars a month 
the count of rural homeless should also include people who live 
in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family a common 
arrangement among downandout farmers the experts say it may be 
21 people living in one house nine children and three adults 
squeezed in a trailer or a family so crowded they sleep in shifts 
you have people living on top of each other those are the 
hidden homeless said luebke these people no longer have their 
own home or apartment they have a roof over their head but in real 
terms they should be considered homeless 
living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies 
say its tantamount to being homeless 
when people have a home where the roof is constantly leaking 
and the cold air can come in and theres no money to fix those 
things thats not a home said norma dell director of bethany 
house a kentucky social service center 
agencies around the country have files on people living in 
ratinfested shanties rotting houses without walls or shacks 
without heat water or toilets others describe a wheelchairbound 
man living under a bridge after being evicted an indian family 
sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough 
a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator 
stark said shes heard reports from california of farmworkers 
living in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves

much of rural homelessness is tied to economics the slump in the 
timber agriculture mining meat and energy industries the loss of 
manufacturing jobs farm foreclosures and the ripple effect on main 
street 
youre dealing with people four or five years ago who would 
have been middleclass citizens said keith swenson who works at 
a social service agency in mora minn theyre chronically 
underemployed theyre not much different than you and i 
the decades farm crisis has fueled the decline the government 
estimates 274000 farms disappeared from 1980 through this year and 
the number of people living on farms dropped from 6 million in 1980 
to 5 million last year 
rural poverty increased by a third from 1978 to 1986 said a 
report by public voice for food and health policy a 
washingtonbased consumer education and research group in 1986 97 
million rural people lived in poverty the group said 
one consequence people cant help themselves much less each 
other 
although communities very often try to band together to help a 
person its becoming more and more difficult because so many people 
are suffering stark said 
experts also say pride makes people reluctant to admit their 
troubles 
theres a real midwest ethic you dont get it unless you work 
for it said ane fitzgerald organizer for the des moines 
coalition for the homeless and she said if youre homeless or 
destitute in a big city you can be anonymous in a small town you 
cant 
often people hide their problems 
you try not to let anyone else in the community know just how 
hard it is said paula neumann who was homeless a decade ago in 
wisconsin if you talk about it its your personal failure 
thats what you believe youre of pioneer stock youre left 
with the feeling youve failed to do something thats worked 
before 
even if people acknowledge their problems help may be many miles 
away 
your survival in the city is easier said michelle budzek 
director of a kentucky shelter if youre hungry you can walk to 
the soup kitchen if you need medical attention there are shelters 
in almsot every city across the country in rural communities folks 
are isolated even getting to services is real difficult 
some places make an extra effort a program covering 10 
northwestern minnesota counties tries to ensure food stamps are 
available to the homeless and those in danger of losing their homes 
small towns in ohio and other states are setting up shelters and 
transitional centers 
but housing remains a major problem 
as far back as 1983 the department of housing and urban 
development estimated that 18 million members of very lowincome 
rural households were living in severely inadequate or inadequate 
housing 
the problems of rural homelessness have been building for years 
but only recently are gaining recognition 
people have already been working on solutions in urban areas 
the last eight years said barbara ferraro director of a west 
virgina center aiding the indigent theyve only begun to voice 
the fact that homelessness may be in rural areas 
what we see today as the problem of the urban homeless is 
probably the tip of the iceberg of what wed see if we look 
critically at the rural areas she added the solutions are not 
as easy to come by we cannot bandaid the rural problem at all 
we cannot just put people in shelters thats not a solution 
as we begin to undercover more and more youre going to see a 
crisis has been there for many years she said itll only get 
worse if we do not do something about it

dwaine vise rode the rails for years 
hopping off in tiny towns getting drunk by day going hungry and 
homeless at night he slept almost anywhere even a morgue then he 
found refuge 
it was on a farm the kind of place where he was raised when he 
arrived vise had no home no family and no future 
they say youve got to hit rock bottom said the ruddy 
55yearold vise i guess i was damn close i just found out i had 
to do something or i was going to die in the street or alleyway 
vise lives at terebinth farmstead 54 acres of solace and soil 
that offer temporary and permanent housing for a small group of men 
whove lived on the streets for years most are recovering 
alcoholics many also were rail riders sneaking onto freight 
trains living in box cars moving from town to town 
the western minnesota farm one of a small number of innovative 
programs serving the rural homeless is owned and operated by the 
dorothy day house a shortterm shelter in nearby moorhead named 
after the roman catholic activist and journalist who cofounded the 
catholic worker newspaper 
the farm which opened 17 months ago follows days philosophy 
treat the poor with dignity and respect 
terebinth has two purposes said barb martens the farms 
director 
for the longterm guest its their home a place they can 
live and die and not drink themselves to death she said for 
the shortterm guys its just a safe place to be she said 
shorttermers stay six months to two years 
the pastoral setting the farm has a barn lake cow rabbits 
cats and dogs was chosen to get the men many of whom have rural 
roots back to the land 
theres something about that place that is so healing 
martens said its not a place no one else wants its a place 
where were saying we think you deserve the best were going to 
give you the best it makes them something other than the least 
the waste of society 
the farm named after the tree in the bible under which abraham 
provided hospitality and shelter for the messengers of god holds up 
to 10 men all must live at the dorothy day house before moving to 
terebinth moorhead attracts rail riders because its on a freight 
train route 
all prospective terebinth residents with alcohol problems must 
undergo treatment before they come to the farm drinking is taboo 
there martens said the residents drinking problems were considered 
when choosing a location the nearest tavern is nine miles away 
you dont have the temptations you do in town vise said 
you feel like youre on your own not in some institution theres 
not someone standing over you you just do your own thing out here 
you can keep busy 
some men pick up work at nearby farms they have a garden can 
vegetables and care for the animals a dorothy day staffer lives 
there fulltime 
still the presence of homeless men a few have criminal records 
aroused fierce opposition martens said the program was rejected 
in three communities before the farm outside hawley was found 
the fivebedroom house replete with fireplace den and woodshop 
is alien to men whove spent years scrounging for food selling 
blood to survive and sleeping under bridges in sawdust piles or 
hotel bathrooms 
even now beds hot meals and a roof dont guarantee success 
andy de maio a terebinth resident who has been homeless many of 
his 52 years has never held a job an entire year a fifthgrade 
dropout he says he has trouble reading and making change 
it isnt as easy to turn your life around as people think de 
maio said some say all you do is get yourself a job itll cure 
your problems but you cant live on the streets and expect to go 
to work everyday you cant function well enough 
the farm gives you a good chance to get straightened out he 
added i hope i do i think its going to be mostly up to me 
although theres no followup program martens said about half of 
those whove left the farm have succeeded in getting on with their 
lives 
for vise who came to the farm last summer its a fresh start 
vise who was divorced before his wife died says hes been in 
alcohol treatment programs four or five times 
he said his life deteriorated when his drinking got out of 
control he couldnt hold a job and ended up on the streets he was 
too proud to panhandle and too embarrassed to let his three children 
see him 
when i got sober enough i realized there was nothing he 
said no family no home no nothing 
vise doesnt intend to drink again 
you never say thats it he said i wont say i wont but i 
doubt it i dont think ill be on the streets again ive learned a 
lot since then if you want to quit you can quit if you can get 
your selfrespect back then youve got a chance

when it opened it was a blue and white miracle in 
concrete and steel built in a civic frenzy to bring major league 
sports to the south 
twentythree years later atlantafulton county stadium finds 
itself a pariah among ballparks a place that both its tenants 
baseballs braves and footballs falcons are desperately trying to 
flee even before the mortgage is paid off 
grumbling about the stadium has gone on for years 
the round configuration isnt perfect for baseball and for 
football everyone agrees its worse when the rectangular field 
is fitted in beneath the circular stands the usually desirable 
50yardline seats are farthest away from the action 
dirty concourses and disgusting restrooms led some in recent 
years to dub it atlantafilthy county stadium the quality of 
the playing field has drawn complaints from atlanta players and 
opposing teams alike narrow concourses leave little room for modern 
concession areas 
still the downtown stadium is structurally sound repainted and 
looking pretty good although the restrooms can still get unpleasant 
but 1988 may be remembered as the beginning of the end for 
atlantafulton county stadium 
both the falcons and the braves insist they will not sign up for 
another hitch after their leases run out in 1990 it is now possible 
that within the next decade the city of atlanta once home to five 
majorleague sports franchises will be down to one its once proud 
stadium bulldozed and the land sold to pay off the debts 
i dont enjoy hearing things like that said ivan allen jr 
the dynamic mayor of atlanta from 196169 who still boasts of how he 
and his city built a major league ballpark on ground we didnt 
own with money we didnt have for a team we hadnt signed 
i walked around the stadium at the dec 4 falcons game and it 
was in excellent condition allen said recently it could be 
used and be in good shape for a long time 
but it appears it wont be 
in 1986 a civic panel recommended two new stadiums a domed 
football arena adjoining the georgia world congress center 
convention facility downtown by 1990 and a new baseball park at the 
present stadium site by 95 
in 1987 falcons owner rankin m smith sr long fed up with a 
lease that benefits the braves with a lack of luxury boxes and with 
the stadium itself said he would not renew it 
since then smith has at various times discussed playing in the 
proposed georgia dome building an openair stadium near the 
teams suburban gwinnett county training complex 30 miles from 
downtown atlanta and even moving the franchise to footballhungry 
jacksonville fla and its 80000seat gator bowl 
the falcons are gone concedes reggie williams the stadium 
authoritys executive director since april 1987 
id say so i can understand that the football people here 
need to leave to get into an environment where they can share in 
other revenues 
then earlier this month atlanta braves president stan kasten 
dropped a bombshell the braves arent staying either 
the braves he said are holding very serious discussions 
about moving to a proposed stateoftheart baseball stadium in 
gwinnett county 
kasten in a recent interview said detailing the problems with 
the stadium would take a laundry list he mentioned specifically 
the lack of modern amenities and the round configuration 
can you play baseball there sure you can kasten said can 
you play football there sure you can 
we just want a better place a place that is competitive with 
the modernday stadiums built only for baseball im not saying 
its unplayable but we can do better and if the braves can we 
certainly should pursue that 
kasten says the braves would consider other metro atlanta 
locations and would probably agree to stay in the current facility 
until that new downtown baseball stadium which we were promised 
really in the 1986 plans can be built in the mid90s 
but the proposed 159 million football dome remains tangled in 
financial and political haggling and the subsequent 60 million 
baseball stadium is not even under serious consideration yet 
were interested in getting a new facility kasten said 
they the city and fulton county dont want to talk about that 
so theres not much for us to discuss right now 
that leaves the braves in kastens words very close to 
getting into substantive detailtype conversations with gwinnett 
officials ive been very impressed with the enthusiasm and the 
spirit i see among the people in gwinnett he said 
the idea of the braves and falcons leaving atlanta has yet to 
spawn a great public outcry the two teams have made the playoffs in 
only five out of their 46 combined seasons in atlanta and cynics 
suggest the city wouldnt miss them 
and while most atlanta officials are backing the dome plan for 
the falcons they havent exactly scurried to keep the braves in the 
city limits atlanta city council president marvin arrington while 
accusing the braves of racism in wanting to move to the white 
suburbs said the city would welcome other municipalities within 
our community to shoulder more of the costs of pro sports 
both teams could be gone from the stadium by 1991 despite the 
fact that the debts wont be paid off until 2000 the city williams 
said might wind up selling the land just to pay off the stadium 
debts the question becomes whether the value of the property is 
equal to the amount of money owed 
all of this is a far cry from 1964 when sports in atlanta meant 
georgia tech or minor league baseballs atlanta crackers it was 
then that ground was broken for the stadium that would propel the 
city literally and figuratively into the big leagues 
atlanta stadium with ivan allen at the whip was built in just 
51 weeks with 14 million borrowed from boosterminded bankers the 
braves moved from milwaukee in 1966 the falcons came that fall 
within six years came basketballs atlanta hawks who play in the 
omni downtown and hockeys flames and soccers chiefs both since 
departed 
twentyfive years after that stadium was built its paid 
for itself handsomely with what its done for atlanta since then 
allen said i certainly would have hoped it would have gone on for 
a much longer time 
sports in the suburbs he said would be better than not having 
anything but allen thinks losing either team to the suburbs would 
be a blow to the city 
i think its preferable that they stay in the city of atlanta 
he said thats the core of everything

the higher cash costs of importing us grain 
and soybeans have caused grumbling among the soviet unions 
financial planners and are contributing to moscows huge economic 
problems says an agriculture department economist 
for example in the first nine months of 1988 about 12 billion 
worth of us grain was shipped to the soviet union in addition 
about 362 million worth of soybeans and soybean meal was shipped 
in all counting sales by other countries the soviets may spend 
around 165 billion on imports of agricultural products this 
calendar year up about 1 billion from 1987 says kathryn zeimetz 
of the departments economic research service 
the bill for grain the primary farm import for which the 
soviets pay hard currency will increase over 1 billion from 1987s 
26 billion mostly because import prices are up 35 percent she 
said 
it is this drain that disturbs moscows planners most the main 
source of hard currency for the soviet union is from petroleum 
sales but oil prices are down and grain prices are up 
energy sales to the west usually account for 60 percent of 
soviet hard currency receipts zeimetz said in a recent report 
soviet oil export prices in the first nine months of 1988 averaged 
below 1986 the 15 percent to 20 percent price increase in 1987 was 
more than lost in 1988 
zeimetz said soviet agricultural import volume in 1989 may be 
about at the same total level except that grain imports may be 
greater 
overall the cost of imports next year could rise substantially 
with grain prices rising by as much as 20 percent she said 
the cost of increased agricultural imports coupled with 
relatively low petroleum prices deteriorating terms of trade and 
continued need for nonagricuturl imports could make soviet 
traders even more exacting in 1989 zeimetz said 
much of the soviet unions economic problems stem from a lack of 
quality food and other consumer goods massive consumer subsidies 
for food and higher wages as a result she said there has been an 
excess of consumer demand and excess savings despite both open and 
hidden inflation 
the soviets have maintained the basic prices on most 
statedistributed foodstuffs at 1962 levels zeimetz said these 
have resulted in massive consumer subsidies as production 
processing and marketing costs have risen 
in 1987 the subsidies cost about 60 billion rubles or 94 
billion she said and they continue to rise 
although small cooperatives and individual enterprises are now 
encouraged their output of goods and services is not yet 
significant she said 
meanwhile the average soviets income during the first nine 
months of 1988 was reported up 9 percent from a year earlier when 
the corresponding increase was less than half as much deposits in 
the state savings bank rose 5 percent during the period 
zeimetz said the soviets have built modestly on the 1986 
breakthrough in agricultural production when output increased 7 
percent after years of stagnation or decline still per capita 
production has only regained its 197678 average 
currently she said the kremlins focus is on improving farming 
practices and management increasing competition and raising worker 
incentives by decentralizing management and financial control 
decentralizations newest aim is to establish lease 
collectives predominantly on state and collective farms but also 
on land outside the socialized farm system zeimetz said small 
groups can lease land from a farm a government agency or an 
industrial firm that controls it 
although leasing has produced phenomenal increases in 
production efficiency and cost savings zeimetz said the results 
may partly reflect the attention being given the few lease units in 
operation 
zeimetz said the potential for big gains from leasing is limited 
by a number of factors 
administrator and farm manager resistance to giving up control 
farm worker reluctance to take risks 
inadequacies of soviet farm supplies and infrastructure 
doubts about the permanence of the lease program 
lack of prices determined by market demands 
state reluctance to allow large income disparities 
a recent poll showed that only about 15 percent of the adult 
population favored cooperative and individual labor activities to 
which leasing is cl she said negative attitutes 
about income disparities have led to vandalismosely related and are 
limiting 
success not only for improved agricultural production but also for 
food processing and trade and other consumer goods and services 
on another front zeimetz said the kremlin has tried to improve 
the storage processing and distribution of farm commodities in 
order to improve the quality of food and reduce losses after 
harvest which soviet officials estimate may exceed 25 percent of 
the harvest 
recently 70 meat processing enterprises had no refrigerators 
and of the 850 refrigerators at other enterprises 42 percent had 
been in operation for 20 to 50 years she said less than 20 
percent of soviet processing machinery was up to world standards 
and 60 percent was virtually worn new york the 
instant she crosses the hudson river returned to la to do another 
sitcom 
a few weeks before cbs decided to take her show off the air 
moore was interviewed in her trailer parked outside stage 3 at the 
mtm studios the same trailer she used for the mary tyler moore 
show and was also once used by judy garland shes on a couch 
wearing a red warmup suit her light brown hair is cut stylishly 
short up close despite her diabetic condition and too many years 
spent exposing her skin to the california sun she looks as good as 
her bank account 
she credits this to a change in lifestyle she has quit smoking 
does light impact aerobics and has adopted a healthier diet 
in annie mcguire moore played a woman who works for the 
manhattan borough president has a teenage son and remarries a 
structural engineer with a son and daughter she has a mother 
eileen heckart whos an ultraliberal activist and her new 
husband denis arndt has a father john randolph whos a staunch 
conservative 
the stories were a little different from the usual sitcom fare 
in one show she was held up by a man in a wheelchair then felt 
obligated to find him a job 
in another her husband admited to having had an affair with his 
late wifes sister once she had to clear her fatherinlaws 
reputation from an old accusation that food poisoning in his 
restaurant cost thomas e dewey the presidency

things and conduct ourselves like adults having a great time

it was eighty eights year in 88 when 
the little farm town with the numerical name found its moment in the 
spotlight as calendars flipped to 8888 
but once aug 9 dawned eighty eight got back to the everyday 
life of 88 and as in thousands of small towns from coast to 
coast 1988 was a year for drought george bush and the timeless 
rhythms of rural america 
eighty eight has neat houses a grocery a tire company and two 
churches stretching about a mile along a twolane highway its 200 
residents have no local government no school not even a traffic 
light nothing in short that would be likely to attract attention 
but for a few heady days in august when the television networks 
and newspapers and magazines were dispatching reporters and 
photographers and thousands of tourists were trooping to town it 
seemed the whole world was peeking in on eighty eight 
that was a right exciting thing for this little area said 
david dickerson whose familys lumber mill is the largest local 
employer 
it was also a right unlikely thing 
local residents welcomed all comers with an 88 celebration on 
aug 7 and 8 they put on a parade with an 88yearold grand marshal 
and cut a cake 8 feet 8 inches long 
they crowded in front of rose mary mcphersons 88 market and 
shouted good morning america for abctv 
they staged the wedding of the century for a wyoming couple tom 
accardo and deborah muhlbeier at 808 pm on aug 8 
twentysix thousand pieces of mail got the 8888 postmark 
letters still arrive at the closetsize post office in one corner 
of the grocery but for the most part everything is just real 
quiet around here said donnie sue bacon the postmistress id 
say in a week everything got back pretty much to normal 
that is to say eighty eight got back to dairy and tobacco 
farming conservative politics and lunchhour crowds at the 88 
market where ms mcpherson still serves up hot meals or cold cuts 
to the dickerson lumber co gang and other regulars 
it remains a pleasant unpretentious community 
people still eat bologna sandwiches said dickerson i know 
i do 
before and after the tv cameras came and went eighty eight 
mirrored rural america 
in the spring crops were planted and herds were turned out and 
folks in surrounding barren county kentuckys no 1 dairy producer 
looked toward summer 
but the rains stopped the first of june pastures dried up and 
hay that had been stored for winter feeding had to be hauled out 
months early 
in the fall hopes rose with the excellence of the burley tobacco 
crop 
at the polls eighty eight belied its mostly democratic 
registration and helped elect george bush president it also sided 
with voters statewide in approving a constitutional amendment to 
allow a lottery although barren county as a whole voted it down 
deep in july arnold young accustomed to gambles throughout a 
lifetime of farming had to take another 
as a crippling drought dragged on and his cattle ate the hay he 
had planned to feed them in october young had to decide whether to 
follow some of his neighbors and dump his 57 head of dairy and beef 
cattle on the market 
i was beginning to think about it said young 51 but i 
didnt 
the gamble paid off 
the rains returned by the end of july early enough to coax 
another crop of hay from the ground and to get his burley a 
dryweather crop anyway off to a good start 
this year the tobacco crop has turned out a whole lot better 
said young who was in a decidely celebratory mood when he helped 
park cars at the 88 celebration 
i thought it was nice we got a whole lot of recognition he 
said it wont happen for another 100 years i dont think ill be 
parking cars at that one 
forty years ago voters in eighty eight were chronicled by 
ripleys believe it or not when they split in the presidential 
election 88 votes for president harry truman 88 votes for 
republican thomas dewey 
this year the eighty eight precinct cast 88 votes for larry 
freas a democrat from neighboring simpson county in a race for an 
open state senate seat 
democrats hold a 32 registration edge but republican walter 
baker from glasgow the barren county seat got 231 votes here and 
won the election districtwide 
nor was dickerson daunted by the democrats numbers as he lobbied 
locally for the gop ticket of bush and dan quayle which got 216 
votes to 147 for the democratic ticket of michael dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen 
its still a rural precinct and the best way to campaign for 
any candidate is just word of mouth dickerson said you have to 
do a selling job it was particularly easy this year

it was a meager year for musicals but a 
halfdozen deserving new plays and several old ones managed to make 
it to new york and flourish during 1988 
the phantom of the opera was the years biggest hit and its 
best musical deservedly so andrew lloyd webber produced his most 
accomplished score to date lush romantic and sweeping music that 
perfectly captured gaston lerouxs passionate tale of love denied 
michael crawford was a heartstopping and heartbreaking phantom 
harold princes direction was impeccable and maria bjornson 
provided some eyepopping costumes and scenery 
but after phantom which opened in january nothing else 
excited the musical theater for the rest of the year there were 
minor american musicals like the shortlived mail and the two 
oneact musicals about love operating under the title romance 
romance 
the inevitable turkeys also took to the stage particularly two 
british gobblers carrie and chess 
carrie in particular signaled that the british musical 
domination of broadway was over the show was an 8 million 
disaster broadways most expensive flop it was based on the 
stephen king horror novel about a dumpy awkward teenage girl with 
telekinetic powers betty buckley and 16yearold linzi hateley in 
the title role sang their hearts out but nothing could save this 
dud 
new york had better luck with plays particularly new works by 
american authors topping the list and also taking the tony award 
as best play was m butterfly david henry hwangs brilliant 
recreation of a spy scandal and love affair involving a french 
diplomat and a chinese opera singer who turns out to be a man david 
dukes now plays the diplomat and gives such a compelling 
ontheedge performance that the play seems even better than when it 
first opened last march 
other notable new works by established playwrights included joe 
turners come and gone august wilsons story of the search for 
identity among the children of slaves athol fugards the road to 
mecca a tale of one womans determination to remain independent 
speedtheplow david mamets scathing look at hollywood greed 
and glory and the cocktail hour ar gurneys comic 
examination of upperclass generational conflict 
lesserknown playwrights also had success offbroadways 
reckless by craig lucas was a biting black comedy about a 
womans escape from her family after her husband announces he plans 
to have her killed on christmas eve 
richard greenbergs eastern standard offered another 
fascinating evening it opens on broadway jan 5 direct from 
offbroadways manhattan theater club the play follows several 
yuppies as they try to grow up in new york during the late 1980s 
its a witty compassionate play about the most disliked group in 
america 
several actors gave memorable performances this year 
among the best bd wong whose gender switch in m 
butterfly was nothing less than astonishing robin bartlett the 
distraught wife in reckless yvonne bryceland the feisty 
independent sculptor in the road to mecca ron silver oozing an 
insincere charm as a smarmy wouldbe hollywood producer in 
speedtheplow and nancy marchand as a diplomatic and wise wasp 
matriarch in the cocktail hour 
but there were other performances that some actors might want to 
erase from their playbill biographies al pacino martin sheen and 
edward herrmann massacring julius caesar in more ways than one 
madonna sleepwalking through her role in speedtheplow and 
mariette hartley coming to grief as a griefstricken queen in 
shakespeares rarely produced king john 
most underrated performance sarah brightman in the phantom of 
the opera sure she isnt sarah bernhardt but the woman has a 
glorious pristine voice that would be terrific to hear in some 
classic musical comedy by rodgers and hart gershwin or porter and 
lloyd webber wrote the role of christine in phantom for her if 
theres any doubt listen to the singers who have followed her in 
the new york cast not even close 
most overrated performances four of the five performers in the 
revival of aint misbehavin the show should have been called 
are misbehavin considering the extra histrionics vocal and 
otherwise by nell carter ken page armelia mcqueen and charlaine 
woodard only andre de shields managed to rein in the theatrics 
the year produced three exceptional revivals peter brooks spare 
but satisfying version of chekhovs the cherry orchard done by 
the brooklyn academy of music at brooklyns majestic theater sean 
ocaseys juno and the paycock in an atmospheric production 
from the gate theater in dublin and the lincoln center theaters 
dark brooding version of thornton wilders our town 
not hitting the mark was the years most anticipated revival 
samuel becketts waiting for godot starring steve martin and 
robin williams and directed by mike nichols at lincoln center the 
ticket demand was enormous most people including some subscribers 
to the lincoln center theater couldnt get in but what they missed

furor over a film about christ corporate 
turmoil and a paralyzing strike troubled the movie world in 1988 
but it was a year of record prosperity and cautious optimism about 
the future 
major attractions in the holiday market guarantee that film 
grosses will pass last years record of 485 billion after a 
roaring summer and a slight dip after labor day ticket sales boomed 
over the thanksgiving weekend with such movies as scrooged 
oliver and company and the land before time 
two comedies the naked gun and twins the drama rain 
man and other december offerings will help swell the years total 
demonstrating anew that america has an almost insatiable appetite 
for movie entertainment 
but not everything in hollywood was coming up roses several film 
companies that expanded their output when movies started booming 
five years ago have now run into trouble 
delaurentiis entertainment group new world pictures and the 
cannon group suffered heavy losses and were struggling to survive 
after venturing disastrously into feature films lorimar 
telepictures hit the skids and merged into warner bros 
two of the greatest names of film history the merged mgmua 
underwent a turbulent year losing its production heads producers 
burt sugarman jon peters and peter guber tried to buy a portion of 
the company as did the sony corp both deals collapsed by years 
end the fate of mgmua was still in limbo 
the merger of tristar pictures and columbia pictures into a 
single entity columbia pictures entertainment was also in an 
unsettled state the company suffered a 104 million loss earlier 
this year mostly in movie writedowns losses from movies that are 
not released on schedule 
cocacola which owns 49 percent of the new company was rumored 
to be seeking an exit from the movie business 
the last temptation of christ martin scorseses film about 
what might have happened if jesus had survived the cross caused an 
uproar that is still being played out around the world religious 
fundamentalists staged a huge rally at universal studios urging the 
company to withdraw the film on grounds that it was sacrilege 
because the movie features a dream sequence in which jesus makes 
love to mary magdelene 
universal remained firm and the last temptation did fair 
business hampered by the refusal of some theater chains to book it 
the controversy continues as the film moves abroad greece is the 
latest country to ban it 
having barely avoided a directors strike last year hollywood 
producers were struck by the writers guild of america in 1988 the 
strike lasted 22 weeks and ended with a virtual standoff feature 
production did not seem slowed by the walkout but the opening of 
the 198889 television season was postponed 
the colorizing of blackandwhite vintage movies continued to 
rile movie buffs as well as the directors guild of america and its 
members but they could do nothing to stop the televising of tinted 
versions of casablanca boom town and other classics ted 
turner who owns the biggest supply of old movies even threatened 
to colorize orson welles 1941 classic citizen kane 
the last emperor was the big winner at the academy awards 
picking up oscars for best picture and for bernardo bertoluccis 
direction but for none of the actors the performance awards went 
to cher moonstruck michael douglas wall street sean 
connery the untouchables and olympia dukakis moonstruck 
the onceailing walt disney co proved to be the years success 
story with such attractions as three men and a baby good 
morning vietnam and who framed roger rabbit disney deposed 
paramount as the topgrossing studio capturing 20 percent of the 
market

science heightened the mystery surrounding the shroud of turin 
oct 13 when the roman catholic archbishop of turin announced that 
according to lab tests the cloth is no more than 728 years old and 
cannot be the burial cloth of christ 
the linen strip 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches 
wide bears the faded image of a scourged and crucified man 
scientists say they have determined the shroud was not the 
product of an artist but do not know how the haunting image was 
made those who believed it was christs burial cloth had attributed 
the image to a sudden blaze of light fitting biblical accounts of 
the resurrection others suspect radiation or an unexplained 
chemical reaction between body secretions and the cloth 
the bishop anastasio balestrero says carbon14 tests on tiny 
samples date the cloth to between 1260 and 1390 although critics 
are now quick to brand the linen a medieval fake the church says 
the cloth continues to be a venerated symbol of faith and the 
mystery of its origin remains

concluded was probably an act of sabotage 
the report ruled out accidental technical failure aboard the 
sturdy c130 transport and said investigators found no evidence of 
an antiaircraft missile or a powerful bomb but investigators 
discovered residues of chemicals that could be used in an explosive 
strong enough to cause a technical malfunction if it was sabotage 
suspects included agents of sovietallied afghanistan angered by 
zias support for afghan rebels pakistani ethnic or religious 
minorities or agents of india which has fought three wars with 
pakistan the soviet union and india have denied any involvement 
some published reports suggested that if the soviet union or

two governments deciding to deal won 
freedom for the last of their hostages in lebanon in 1988 
but 16 other westerners remained captive among them nine 
americans and late in the year president reagan acknowledged that 
the united states too may have to deal 
were looking at every channel that we can find to try and get 
them hostages and i imagine that the ultimate is going to have to 
be somehow a negotiation with iran because they have control of 
the kidnappers the us chief executive told a news conference 
political and military developments in the region brightened the 
outlook for the release of remaining hostages most of whom are 
believed held by lebanese shiite moslem groups under the influence 
of iran 
irans acceptance of a ceasefire in its 8yearold war with 
iraq iranian moves to improve diplomatic relations with the west 
and syrias moves to curb proiranian shiites in lebanon all 
combined to alter the backdrop to the longrunning hostage drama 
both france and west germany successfully negotiated with the 
tehran government over the past two years to free all 13 french and 
west german hostages in lebanon 
among those released in 1988 were frenchmen michel carton michel 
fontaine and jeanpaul kauffmann and west german rudolf cordes 
the french government denied it made any deals but informed 
sources in paris said france agreed to restore diplomatic relations 
and repay 400 million to iran final segment of a 1 billion loan 
made by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi the sources also said 
10 million channeled through an iranian businessman was paid to 
two terrorist factions in lebanon 
the west germans who have good contacts with tehran also denied 
they made any deals 
but informed arab sources said millions of dollars were paid into 
swiss bank accounts sanctioned either by the bonn government or the 
major firms employing two of the german captives to secure the 
mens release 
iranian leaders said several times recently that tehran would use 
its influence with the kidnappers in lebanon to free their american 
captives if washington released iranian assets worth several billion 
dollars assets frozen in 1979 
until his dec 8 news conference reagan had publicly rejected 
any linkage between the hostages and iranian assets and dismissed 
the notion of negotiation 
the longestheld of the nine americans is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press kidnapped march

if projections by the nations train air and 
bus lines are any indication more americans than ever will be 
traveling during the christmas and new years holidays in 1988 
greyhound the nations largest intercity bus line says it will 
carry 134 million passengers between dec 18 and jan 3 or 10 
percent more than the 12 million people transported during the 
holidays last year 
in part the bus line attributes the increase to a recent boost 
in air fares and the limited availability of discountpriced seats 
on the nations major airlines said greyhound chief executive 
officer fred g currey who was in cleveland on tuesday to meet with 
company employees 
airplane ticket prices are very substantially higher this year 
and they are a factor currey told reporters and bus fares are 
very moderately priced 
curreys contention was disputed by organizations representing 
airlines and the nations travel agents 
most people buying at christmas bought their tickets weeks and 
months ago before fares went up said philip g davidoff 
president of belair travel of bowie md presidentelect of the 
travel agents group 
whats going to happen next year i dont know if the 
increases are put into effect for january it probably will mean 
more people will take buses than ever before 
bill horn a spokesman for the air transport association which 
represents the nations largest airlines said a record 7 million 
americans traveled by air during the thanksgiving holiday weekend 
between dec 17 and jan 2 us airlines expect to transport at 
least 22 million people or about 500000 more than for the same 
period last year he said that would also be a record horn said 
the nations major airlines announced last month that they were 
boosting most of their lowest discount fares and eliminating the 
cheap fares that can be booked a few days before a flight but a 
week later eastern continental delta and northwest airlines 
announced reductions in some of their fares 
those fare increases that were announced just prior to 
thanksgiving affected a very small percentage of the travel 
market horn said in a telephone interview 
clifford black public relations manager for the national 
railroad passenger corp better known as amtrak said the railroad 
carried a record number of passengers in the fiscal year that ended 
sept 30 and it shows no signs of letting up 
but limited capacity makes it difficult for the railroad to set 
holiday records he said 
during the holiday seasons they tend to sell out making it 
impossible to improve from year to year and from one holiday season 
to the next black said 
denny yatteau greyhound regional manager in ohio said he 
expects 38300 greyhound tickets to be sold in the state for the 
christmasnew years season that would be an increase of 12 percent 
over a year ago 
black said space is limited on most amtrak trains traveling from 
cleveland canton and cincinnati this holiday season amtrak trains 
traveling from cleveland to boston on dec 23 already are sold out

million spent by rocky mountain resorts and 51 million in far west 
ski areas according to the national ski areas association in 1987 
northeast ski areas spent 921 million 2 times the 1985 level 
last year the eight states in the northeast reported about 15 
million skier visits compared with 17 million in the rockies in 
the 198485 season attendance was less than 12 million in the east 
the east has a basic topographic disadvantage because its tallest 
mountains are less than half the size of the 10000 to 12000foot 
peaks found in the rockies mount washington in new hampshire is the 
regions tallest mountain at 6200 feet 
the rockies also offer complete resort areas with open skiing in 
wide snowy fields in new england most trails are cut through 
woods and ski areas are typically limited to lodges and have few 
other recreational opportunities 
to meet the competition new england skiing associations have 
expanded on a national campaign lets go skiing america by 
pushing for vacations at local resorts and trying to broaden modest 
increases in attendance over the last two years 
its not because theyre losing market share to the caribbean 
or some nonski service said phil camp executive director of the 
new england ski areas council an industry group the rate of 
growth of the consumer market in skiing has not been rapid like it 
was 15 or 18 years ago 
in vermont ski areas are teaming up to make the states resorts 
a destination one new program allows interchangable lift tickets at 
smugglers jay peak bolton and sugarbush 
the vermont ski areas association this year also began 
coordinating flydrive packages from washington baltimore and 
philadelphia to build on the states traditional bases of boston and 
new york 
more manmade snow is being poured on slopes earlier than ever a 
2yearold eastman kodak inc product called snomax allows snow to 
be made at temperatures 4 degrees to 8 degrees warmer than before 
as high as freezing 
thanks to more sophisticated snowmaking camp said more than 50 
of the 72 public ski areas in the sixstate new england region were 
open last weekend a quantum leap over previous years 
said conniff the technology thats come along has taken a lot 
of the risk out of the business in the last three or four years 
the onset of cold weather also has encouraged area ski officials 
hopeful that singledigit temperatures will persuade city dwellers 
to head for the slopes 
the most important thing this cold weather has given us is an 
unprecedented jump on snowmaking efforts said david zemel 
general manager of the powder ridge ski resort in middlefield conn 
more slopes are opening faster than ive ever seen in the seven 
years ive been here

texaco inc is facing renewed pressure from 
financier carl c icahn who has raised his stake in the 
thirdbiggest us oil company and hasnt discouraged speculation he 
might resurrect a failed takeover bid 
icahn stoked the smoldering takeover speculation about texaco on 
tuesday disclosing he had increased his stock ownership to 158 
percent of the companys 240 million shares outstanding 
securities analysts said icahns move which helped boost 
texacos stock price evidently reflected his impatience at the pace 
of the companys postbankruptcy restructuring aimed at increasing 
the value of texaco stock 
some said icahn texacos largest shareholder probably had no 
interest in acquiring the company himself but might be attempting to 
induce another investor to make an offer 
i think ultimately hes looking for a way to cash in said 
george gaspar who follows texaco for the milwaukeebased investment 
firm robert w baird amp co i think hes trying to stir up the pond 
and attract some outside interest to take a look at texaco 
others did not rule out the possibility of a takeover attempt by 
icahn who began acquiring texaco stock while the company was under 
federal bankruptcy court protection a year ago 
icahn declined to comment on why he raised his stake texaco 
officials also declined to comment 
texaco stock rose 87 cents a share tuesday to 5162 in heavy 
trading on the new york stock exchange an indication that investors 
believe either icahn or someone else may try to win control of the 
company 
last spring icahn made an offer for texaco valued at 145 
billion or 60 a share as part of a shareholder proxy fight to 
oust the companys board but his strategy was defeated by 
shareholders loyal to the board which promised to boost texacos 
stock price through an aggressive restructuring 
but since then texaco stock has not risen significantly raising 
the possibility that more shareholders would align themselves with 
icahn if he undertook another takeover attempt moreover some 
analysts said the idea that icahn could raise the financing for 
such a takeover is not farfetched 
last spring nobody believed anybody could raise 14 or 15 
billion for an acquisition said jack n aydin an oil securities 
analyst at the clevelandbased investment firm mcdonald amp co this 
year its different 
the most notable example is the record 2453 billion acquisition 
of rjr nabisco inc by the buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
announced less than two weeks ago 
icahn said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission that he purchased 26 million shares of texaco between 
dec 7 and dec 12 for about 131 million or an average of 5037 
a share 
some texaco analysts and takeover attorneys thought icahns move 
signaled he was not interested in buying the company because it 
vaulted his stake over a 15 percent threshold that under some 
circumstances triggers the antitakeover laws of delaware where 
texaco is incorporated 
icahn would have to immediately raise his ownership to 85 percent 
or wait at least three years before attempting any hostile 
acquisition that would result in the companys breakup attorneys 
familiar with the delaware law said 
his latest move came against a background of resurgent rumors 
that he was growing exasperated with texacos multibillion dollar 
assetshedding program and the companys failure to specify the date 
of a promised 17 billion distribution to shareholders 
icahn is chairman of trans world airlines inc one of his 
successful acquisitions he widely is regarded as a shrewd financier 
and takeover investor and has gone after some of the biggest us 
corporations such as usx corp and phillips petroleum co 
he has been a thorn in the side of texaco management which has 
been preoccupied with restructuring the company since it emerged 
from bankruptcy protection several months ago after settling a 
multibillion dollar dispute with pennzoil co

international business machines corp is reducing 
its role in the telecommunications equipment business by selling 
part of its moneylosing rolm operation to west germanys siemens ag 
and putting the rest of rolm into a joint venture with siemens 
the deal announced tuesday marks another chapter in ibms mixed 
success with rolm a freewheeling silicon valley company that the 
computer giant bought four years ago for an estimated 15 billion 
to help it link computers through phone switches 
rolm is believed to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 
recent years but has grown into the nations biggest seller of 
office phone switches which route calls within buildings under 
ibms ownership 
the purchase would make siemens the worlds biggest seller of 
office phone switches siemens could consolidate its lead if it 
manages to buy italtel an italian phone company and britains 
plessey co for which it is making a 31 billion hostile offer in 
cooperation with britains general electric co 
the price siemens is paying was not disclosed but ibm said the 
deal would have no material effect on its income statement when it 
is completed early next year that was taken as positive news for 
ibm because there had been speculation the sale price would be so 
low that ibm would be forced to take a large writeoff 
john f akers ibms chairman and chief executive said i 
would absolutely not characterize it as a scaling back of ibms 
interests in telecommunications he said the combination with 
siemens would allow ibm to offer a wider range of products to its 
customers than before 
but analysts said ibm is turning over all responsibility for 
development and manufacture of rolmbranded products to siemens and 
is discontinuing work on a complex office switch for the european 
market 
for ibm its a very clean market exit said francis 
mcinerney of northern business informationdatapro in new york 
it is a graceful but not total retreat no matter how you cut 
it said frank barbetta a researcher for probe research inc in 
cedar knolls nj 
ibm will sell the development and manufacturing arm of rolm with 
its 2800 employees to siemens it will become rolm systems inc 
and include 700 employees now working for siemens 
ibm and siemens jointly will own a marketing and services 
company known simply as rolm that will offer telecommunications 
products for private networks in the united states it will have 
5500 employees who currently work for rolm and fewer than 100 now 
working for siemens 
ibm gradually will phase out a rolm manufacturing and development 
plant in colorado springs colo and offer jobs elsewhere in the 
company to the 550 affect employees those who do not accept 
transfers will be offered severance packages 
under ibms ownership rolm has lost money steadily but its 
share of the us market has risen to 181 percent from 142 percent 
in 1984 according to northern business informationdatapro 
ibm had bought rolm as insurance in case the trend in computers 
was to connect them through office phone switches according to 
kenneth bosomworth president of international resource development 
inc of new canaan conn instead most office computers are 
connected through special local area networks an area in which ibm 
is also strong 
rolm was vulnerable to competition because it does not make 
switches for the central offices of phone companies in contrast to 
competitors such as american telephone amp telegraph co and canadas 
northern telecom ltd bosomworth said 
siemens does make central office switches phone networks are 
being redesigned to handle computer data and video signals as well 
as voice traffic and companies that make central office switches 
are at the cutting edge of work in the field bosomworth said 
in a sign of the importance the companies attached to the deal 
it was announced jointly at a news conference by akers who rarely 
appears at press conferences and karlheinz kaske president and 
chief executive of siemens 
rolm has development and manufacturing operations in santa clara 
calif and austin texas siemens has telecommunications 
development operations in boca raton fla and manufacturing in 
cherry hill nj 
the companies said rolm systems inc would be headquartered in 
santa clara and would be expanded to include about 700 siemens 
employees based in boca raton and cherry hill 
rolm the marketing company will be based in the stamford 
conn area and will include fewer than 100 people now working for 
siemens in addition to the ibm employees

the chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone co 
the worlds biggest company resigned wednesday under fire for 
alleged involvement in a scandal that has spread wide tentacles 
through japans political and business world 
the minister of posts and telecommunications masaaki nakayama 
told a news conference he had accepted the resignation of hisashi 
shinto as ntt chairman 
nakayama said shinto had denied any personal involvement in 
dubious share trading but had accepted responsibility for actions by 
his personal secretary 
japanese press reports said prosecutors had traced some 10 
million japanese yen or around 81000 to shintos bank account 
from proceeds of the sale of shares in recruitcosmos co a real 
estate subsidiary of the recruit conglomerate 
shinto on tuesday had issued a statement denying involvement in 
the share transaction which was carried out by his personal 
secretary kozo murata in 1986 murata has since resigned as 
shintos aide 
the socalled recruit scandal last week brought the resignation 
of kiichi miyazawa as finance minister and deputy prime minister 
and has rocked the japanese political and business worlds with 
allegations that the recruit company was seeking favors by 
distributing shares in recruitcosmos with a guarantee of easy 
taxfree profits 
ntt ranked as the largest corporation in the world in terms of 
stock market capitalization had business links with recruit which 
bought two usmade supercomputers from ntt and leased data 
communications circuits from the telephone giant 
as a former telecommunications monopoly ntt has been partially 
privatized but shinto and all other officials of the utility remain 
under regulations which make it illegal for them to receive cash or 
shares from private companies that ntt does business with 
shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications 
giant since 1981 when ntt was still a governmentowned monopoly he 
oversaw the privatization which started in 1985 and then took the 
title of president he held that post until last june when he 
became chairman and chief executive and the title of president went 
to haruo yamaguchi 
shintos resignation would make him the most prominent victim in 
the business world of the recruit scandal which has also brought 
the resignation of news media executives and has broken several 
political careers in addition to that of miyazawa who a year ago 
was a major contender to be prime minister 
prime minister noboru takeshita is on a list of prominent 
politicians whose aides profited from owning recruitcosmos shares 
but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the 
transactions among the others are former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone and shintaro abe secretarygeneral of the governing 
liberal democratic party 
the roots of the scandal go back to 1986 when unlisted 
recruitcosmos shares were offered to the prominent figures or their 
aides often to be paid for with loans from a recruitlinked finance 
company the shares were listed for sale in the overthecounter 
market in october 1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value 
yielding taxfree profits when they were sold

the nations retailers lost nearly 2 billion last 
year to theft and errors including shoplifters whose top three 
lightfinger items were ladies apparel consumer electronics and 
recordings according to a new survey 
an ounce of prevention the 10th annual survey of us 
retailers by the arthur young amp co accounting firm said tuesday 
that jewelry shoes and mens clothing were at the bottom of the 
list 
our survey shows that many of the nations retailers have been 
hit hard by theft and other losses said gerald smith head of 
arthur youngs retail group in chicago a management consultant for 
the retail industry 
the survey found companies lost 18 billion through shoplifting 
theft by employees or vendors and errors in paperwork in 1987 
compared with 15 billion in losses in 1986 
the survey covered 119 retail companies operating in 47000 
locations around the country with combined total sales of 1275 
billion smith said the research was conducted last spring and 
summer 
companies participating in the survey included discount stores 
department stores and specialty stores the names of the firms were 
withheld 
discount stores were hit hardest last year losing 12 billion 
worth of merchandise while department stores lost 364 million and 
specialty shops lost 233 million worth of goods the survey said 
for the five years from 1982 through 1987 the survey found the 
following increases in shoplifting losses as a percentage of total 
sales 
discount stores from 15 percent to 21 percent 
specialty stores from 17 percent to 22 percent 
department stores from 2 percent to 21 percent 
the survey showed that 86 percent of department stores ranked 
ladies apparel as the first or second areas hardest hit by 
shoplifters 
there was a time when calculators were the hot items for 
shoplifters then it went to designer jeans now its designer 
lingerie said lewis shealy vice president of loss prevention for 
marshall fields a department store chain 
its the highest theft department in the company he said 
we began putting designer lingerie in the department about two 
years ago and this year most of the merchandise is designer 
since then inventory loss in the lingerie department nearly 
tripled shealy said declining to provide specific figures 
we have suede bras and panties costing more than 400 he 
said these designer items are gotta have but cant afford 
things and its easy for a shoplifter to put a dozen bras or panties 
in a large handbag 
its a combination of the designer label and the price that 
excites them he said

the premier smokeless cigarette is drawing 
less than rave reviews from some smokers and retailers but rjr 
nabisco inc is not ready to scrap a twostate test of the products 
popularity 
despite consumer complaints about everything from the cigarettes 
taste and smell to its price and unusual construction rjr claims 
premier had the highest initial trial rate of any brand in recent 
history probably due to the amount of publicity that it received 
rjr spokeswoman maura payne said there are no plans for ending 
the test run of the revolutionary hightech cigarette introduced two 
months ago in arizona and missouri 
but the company said it had no figures on sales or consumer 
acceptance of the device which heats tobacco to release the flavor 
but does not burn it 
negative consumer reaction is only one of the problems plaguing 
premiers test run public health advocates have called on the food 
and drug administration to regulate the product as a drug 
a still greater threat to the product may lie in kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp cos proposed 2453 billion leveraged buyout of rjr 
rjr chairman f ross johnson has said premier could cost 1 
billion from drawing board to nationwide distribution analysts 
believe that the high debt costs of the buyout puts premiers future 
in jeopardy if the testmarketing lags they say the new owners 
would be more likely to allow the product to go up in smoke 
stores in st louis phoenix and tucson ariz where premier was 
introduced in october say the smokeless cigarette is not catching on 
with consumers 
theyre terrible theyre nasty theyre beyond nasty said 
mark padgett an employee at a 711 store in phoenix 
i wouldnt have them here on a death wish said jeff meister 
manager of a south st louis tinder box shop my representative 
suggested them but people try them and they dont want them 
smokers who have tried premier are convinced the new product will 
attract few converts they say its not so much the higher price for 
premier 30 to 50 cents more per pack than regular cigarettes or 
the annoying fact that they burn themselves out if left unattended 
the worst reviews come from the taste 
but rjr officials say they are not discouraged 
new videos which promote the products lack of sidestream smoke 
are being sent to stores in the distribution chain ms payne said 
they are not part of a crash program to save premier but instead 
are one of several phases in the advertising campaign she said 
rjrs plan to testmarket vantage excel 100s a reducedsmoke 
cigarette in january also is unrelated to reports of premiers 
troubles ms payne said 
one of rjrs key marketing assumptions was that consumers would 
be so attracted to a lowtar cigarette that was less offensive to 
nonsmokers that they would take time to acquire a taste for the new 
product 
but people are not buying the two or three packs the company 
believes is needed to get used to the differences in taste aroma 
and experience 
don barnes regional marketing director for phoenixbased circle 
k said arizona sale figures through the chain of convenience stores 
were confidential but he characterized them as modest 
john spinck who manages a 711 store in downtown phoenix said 
he took on an inital inventory of 10 cartons and had sold three 
packs leaving 97 on the shelves 
ron purcell manager of a tinder box store in west st louis 
county said he stocked premier initially but wouldnt reorder them 
it seems like every sale is a oneshot deal he said

when the first congress convened in 1789 
members were paid 6 a day while in session lawmakers created a 
furor 27 years later when they decided to boost their pay to 1500 
a year a raise that was quickly repealed 
two centuries after the first session the debate continues with 
many in congress complaining that their 89500 salary is too small 
and president reagan considering whether to offer them a sizeable 
raise 
consumer advocates such as ralph nader were quick to criticize 
when a presidential commission on tuesday suggested a 50 percent pay 
hike for members of congress and other top federal officials but 
former rep elford a cederberg rmich was more sympathetic 
cederberg who is president of the association of former 
congressmen said nader and more importantly the folks back home 
often dont realize the high cost of maintaining households both at 
home and in washington where he estimated that lawmakers houses 
cost an average of 250000 
the average person back home just doesnt understand that if a 
man brings his family with him down here unless he has some 
personal wealth its difficult for him to take on that kind of a 
mortgage cederberg said especially in politics which is a 
rather unstable business 
when cederberg came to washington he was paid 12500 the 
annual salary had climbed to 57500 when he was voted out of office 
in 1978 after serving 13 terms he said he makes more money now as a 
consultant 
winning influence also takes a toll on congressional wallets 
cederberg said 
republicans belong to the capitol hill club and democrats 
belong to the democratic club he said and there are other 
people and things you have to be seen around if youre going to be 
influential and they cost money 
the new recommendations from a commission that weighs in with 
its views on congressional pay after every presidential election 
would raise the salaries to 135000 more than nine times the 
nations average personal income in 1987 
such comparisons are dismissed by proponents of pay hikes who 
point to washingtons high cost of living and just like the folks 
back home many members of congress have to worry about babysitters 
and tuition for their children they say 
i think some people think that congressmen and their wives go 
around in limousines and live in big houses and go to the white 
house said gretchen poston of washington inc a consulting firm 
for social events and conventions thats just not the daytoday 
life 
ms poston who was social secretary in the carter white house 
said members of congress and their spouses also are expected to 
entertain and attend formal functions 
they are supporting two households and worrying about 
babysitters and at the same time they are invited out and asked to 
do so many things she said they are expected to be all things 
to all people 
members of congress are reluctant to vote themselves a pay hike 
and wont necessarily have to if reagan accepts the commissions 
findings or recommends smaller raises if no vote is taken the 
raises take effect automatically 
youve got an electorate that loves to take a bite out of your 
leg former sen howard baker rtenn said last month as he 
nonetheless urged the commission to reward lawmakers with higher 
pay theres nothing closer to home than examining the pay of 
public officials 
critics such as nader scoff at the reasons listed by pay hike 
proponents 
money does not buy integrity dedication and agreement he 
says 
members of congress surely would agree but they might quickly 
add it does buy a house or two 
supporting the higher pay can also buy trouble a fact not lost 
on the lawmakers 
my appearance here kicks off my opponents next campaign 
whoever he or she is rep vic fazio dcalif joked last month 
when he urged the commission to recommend higher pay 
others argue that more money should come with the prestige of 
serving in congress rep william clay dmo complained during a 
1987 debate on congressional pay that his pipefitter brother made 
more money 
said clay i think something is amiss

here is a summary of the major recommendations 
of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries 
which will be formally forwarded to president reagan on thursday 
salaries for the top 2500 federal officials including the 
vice president members of congress judges cabinet members and 
other senior exectivebranch personnel should be increased by 
roughly 50 percent in 1989 that amount would restore purchasing 
power of those officials to 1969 levels a member of congress for 
example would go from a salary of 89500 to 135000 as would 
district judges the vice presidents salary would go from 115000 
to 175000 
congress should enact separate legislation to raise the 
presidents salary which has been frozen at 200000 since 1969 to 
about 350000 the increase could not take effect until jan 21 
1993 because of a constitutional ban on raising a presidents pay 
during his term 
congress should pass legislation to abolish honoraria the 
speaking and writing fees paid to lawmakers primarily by 
specialinterest groups the ban should go into effect at the same 
time the pay raise is effective 
the commissions report is only a recommendation reagan may 
adopt or modify it when he submits his budget to congress on jan 9

illinois has dropped administrative 
charges against chubb corp over the sale of drought insurance after 
the new jersey company agreed to pay a 50000 fine and the 100000 
cost of a state probe 
state insurance director john washburn announced the action 
tuesday four days after a federal judge in cincinnati approved a 
48 million drought insurance settlement for 8800 farmers in 10 
states including illinois 
chubb has acted very responsibly in agreeing to settle this

banking interest rates by 025 percentage points wednesday 
reflecting the growing trend toward higher rates in the 
international markets 
the belgian national bank wednesday said the discount rate was 
raised to 75 percent and the lombard rate to 775 percent

loans to member commercial banksthe lombard rate is what the banks 
are charged for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used 
as collateral 
the national bank had announced earlier it was raising one two 
and threemonth treasury bills 
the threemonth rate considered the most important in belgian 
banking was raised to 74 percent from 715 percent the onemonth 
rate to 735 from 71 percent and the twomonth rate to 74 from 
715 percent

the chairman of the worlds largest company resigned 
today becoming the most prominent business victim in a scandal that 
also has brought the downfall of japans finance minister 
hisashi shinto 78 head of the telecommunications giant nippon 
telegraph and telephone co since 1981 formally resigned to the 
minister for posts and telecommunications masaaki nakayama 
nakayama told a nationally televised news conference that shinto 
had said he hadnt personally been involved in dubious share trading 
but was resigning to take responsibility for transactions by his 
thenpersonal secretary 
on friday finance minister kiichi miyazawa resigned giving up 
the post of deputy prime minister as well because of a similar link 
to the scandal involving the recruit co an informationbased 
conglomerate that did business with nippon the national telephone 
utility 
shinto said in a brief statement i have decided to resign to 
take responsibility for causing trouble concerning ntt and the 
recruit affair and causing people to lose trust in ntt 
aides to shinto miyazawa and other prominent people in politics 
and business received unlisted shares in recruitcosmos co a 
subsidiary of recruit co at bargain prices or with recruitbacked 
loans 
they then sold the shares after they were offered to the public 
in october 1986 and the price more than doubled 
the transactions were not illegal but in the political cases 
they have brought stern criticism of the links between politics and 
big business 
haruo yamaguchi president of nippon telegraph and telephone co 
was visibly shaken at the news conference where he said shintos 
secretary had complete control of the bank account in question 
shinto said the transaction may have taken place but he could 
not confirm it because the secretarys whereabouts are unknown 
yamaguchi said prime minister noboru takeshita who also had a 
former aide on the list of recruits beneficiaries says he will 
launch political reforms to try to rebuild public trust in 
government 
japanese law forbids officials of a quasigovernmental 
corporation like ntt from receiving personal donations from private 
firms with which their company does business 
press reports quoted prosecutors as saying shintos secretary 
kozo murata made 179000 profit and that 73000 had been traced 
to the nippon chairmans personal account shinto has denied reports 
of his personal involvement 
japanese news media especially television have delighted in 
showing political and business leaders changing their statements on 
the recruit scandal 
miyazawa a contender for prime minister a year ago gave at 
least three differing versions of how a trusted aide had used the 
finance ministers name to hold recruitcosmos shares 
two other nippon figures also have acknowledged owning 
recruitcosmos shares one was ei shikiba former head of the 
utilitys integrated network service who has been demoted the 
other was hisako hasegawa former head of a nippon division who now 
is a recruit executive 
recruits links with the telephone utility included buying two 
usmade supercomputers from nippon and leasing data communications 
circuits 
meanwhile two business executives said they were resigning from 
prestigious advisory posts in the wake of press reports linking them 
to recruitcosmos shares 
ken morio chairman of chichibu cement co ltd and jiro ushio 
chairman of ushio ltd an electronics firm said they would leave 
senior positions with an advisory council called the japan committee 
for economic development 
the recruit scandal has tarnished numerous careers since it 
surfaced last summer 
three news media executives lost posts a socialist resigned his 
seat in parliament and a former vice minister of education kunio 
takaishi decided tuesday not to run in the next parliamentary 
election after their names were mentioned in connection with the 
investigation 
the scandal however hasnt hurt recruitcosmos business 
on monday it announced its unconsolidated pretax profit for six 
months through october was 57 percent higher than a year earlier at 
74 million the subsidiarys main business is selling condominiums

us automakers said they would spend more than 
47 billion this year insuring the health of their employees 
officials of general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp say rising health care costs and use of insurance plans have 
pushed up healthcare spending in 1988 
its the system in general costs are escalating on all 
sides ford spokeswoman linda becker said its not just coming 
from the auto companies 
becker estimated that ford would pay out more than 1 billion for 
health care in 1988 up from the 920 million it paid in 1987 
gm spokeswoman patricia molloy declined to estimate how much the 
no 1 automaker would spend in health care but said there is a 
trend toward increasing costs gm spent 29 billion on health care 
last year 
she said the price of the insurance and utilization of it ledto 
the upward trend in costs 
chryslers lloyd northard said comparing 1987 and 1988 costs was 
difficult because chrysler acquired american motors corp in august 
1987 
nevertheless he said such costs were rising about 15 percent 
annually and chrysler estimated it would spend more than 700 
million for employee health care this year

the us trade deficit declined to 1035 billion in october the 
smallest imbalance in three months the government reported today 
the commerce department said the merchandise trade gap between 
what the united states imports and what it sells overseas fell by 
31 percent from a september deficit of 1067 billion 
the decline the second consecutive improvement was slightly 
better than many economists had been predicting 
the dollar and bond prices were lower following todays 
announcement 
the october improvement came from a 17 percent drop in imports 
which declined to 3802 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis 
this decline offset a smaller 11 percent drop in us exports 
which edged down to 1175 billion 
in another report today the federal reserve board said the use 
of industrial capacity rose 02 percentage points to 842 percent 
last month the highest level since 843 percent in november 1979 
it was the seventh increase in eight months 
an accompanying fed report said industrial production climbed a 
brisk 05 percent in november following an identical 05 percent 
rise in october 
on tuesday the government reported that november retail sales 
jumped 11 percent giving rise to more worries about inflation 
while giving store owners more confidence about the outlook for the 
holiday shopping season 
it looks like the christmas season will be better than people 
feared and make an important contribution to growth commerce 
undersecretary robert ortner said tuesday in releasing the report 
christmas sales provide general merchandisers with about half of 
their annual profits retail sales are considered a key indicator of 
economic growth because consumer activity accounts for about 
twothirds of gross national product 
in other economic developments tuesday 
the commerce department said the deficit in the broadest measure 
of us trade shrank to 3089 billion from july through september 
the smallest imbalance in three years

members expect the economy to do better in 1989 than it has done 
this year with continued growth and slower inflation

us prosecutors are pressuring drexel burnham 
lambert inc to accept a pleabargain settlement that would include 
paying a 750 million fine and admitting guilt to at least five 
felony counts to avoid prosecution for racketeering and securities 
fraud the wall street journal said wednesday 
quoting sources it did not identify the newspaper said both 
sides were close to an agreement late tuesday that would end one of 
the most intensive criminal securities fraud investigations in 
history 
a 750 million fine for securities fraud would dwarf the record 
100 million in penalties paid two years ago by ivan f boesky the 
nowimprisoned stock speculator who turned states evidence and has 
been a key source of evidence against drexel 
the nations fifthlargest securities firm has maintained 
innocence throughout an investigation that has been colored by press 
leaks and speculation 
drexel executives have said they are interested in a settlement 
to avoid prosecution and a lengthy trial but admitting guilt would 
mark a stunning turnaround and open the firm to numerous civil 
lawsuits by investors who allege they were defrauded 
steven anreder drexels chief spokesman declined to comment on 
the journal story officials at the securities and exchange 
commission and manhattan us attorneys office who have been 
coordinating the drexel investigation also declined comment 
drexel is privately owned and is one of the most profitable wall 
street firms specializing in the market for highyield highrisk 
debt securities commonly called junk bonds 
it has played a major role in some of the biggest corporate 
takeovers of all time including the record 2453 billion 
acquisition of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
announced nov 30 
drexel is known to have set aside hundreds of millions of dollars 
for a potential settlement with the government the firm is eager to 
avoid a racketeering indictment which could seriously impair its 
business and involve enormous fines if a jury found drexel guilty 
three months ago sec filed a massive civil lawsuit that accused 
drexel its highyield bond financier michael milken and three other 
key employees of conspiring with boesky to profit on inside 
information manipulate stock defraud drexel clients keep phony 
books and other violations 
a federal grand jury has been expected to indict drexel on 
criminal charges as well but the indictments repeatedly have been 
delayed evidently as a pressure tactic to convince the potential 
defendants to reach pleabargain settlements instead 
while drexel has expressed interest in settling milken has not 
negotiated with government prosecutors and has vowed to vindicate 
himself at trial

the operating rate at us factories mines and 
utilities in november rose to the highest level in nine years the 
government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about 
inflation 
the federal reserve board said the use of industrial capacity 
rose 02 percentage points to 842 percent last month the highest 
since 843 percent in november 1979 it was the seventh increase in 
eight months 
as capacity use edges toward 85 percent economists fear 
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand 
leading to shortages and price increases 
in an accompanying report the federal reserve said industrial 
production climbed a brisk 05 percent in november following an 
identical 05 percent rise in october 
the feds industrial production index now stands at 1399 percent 
of its 1977 base reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and 
production of equipment for businesses 
the jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line 
with economists expectations most government statistics have 
portrayed a robust economy in october and november particularly in 
the manufacturing sector which has been bolstered by strong export 
sales caused by the lower value of the dollar which makes us 
goods more affordable on overseas markets 
at manufacturing plants the operating rate climbed to 845 
percent last month up from 843 percent in october producers of 
both durable goods big ticket items ranging from bicycles to 
battleships and nondurable goods reported higher rates 
the rate at durable goods plants was 831 percent in november up 
from 829 percent nondurable goods producers recorded a 01 
percentage point gain to 865 percent 
the fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries 
jumped to 924 percent the highest since december 1978 most of the 
increase was attributed to increases at steel mills 
use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for 
the fourth consecutive month to 854 percent reflecting gains in 
light truck production automobile plants a subcategory slipped to 
767 percent down from 770 percent 
the operating rate at utilities was 810 percent in november up 
from 808 percent it had hit a peak for the year in august of 839 
percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate increased to 822 percent last month it was 816 
percent in october 
the federal reserves production index has not declined since 
september 1987 a reflection of the exportdriven manufacturing 
boom a related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand 
and modernize factories has accompanied the boom 
production in the manufacturing sector rose 05 percent in 
november following an even stronger 06 percent gain in october 
the fed said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 76 
million units down slightly from october 
but production of business equipment rose 04 percent following a 
flat month in october and stood 88 percent higher than a year ago 
output at mines which includes oil and gas drilling rose 06 
percent in november after three consecutive declines production at 
utilities increased 04 percent on top of a 06 percent jump in 
october 
total output at factories mines and utilities was 51 percent 
higher than a year ago

world wheat production could reach a record 550 
million metric tons in the 198990 season the international wheat 
council said wednesday 
this would be 5 million tons more than expected consumption and 
would allow world stocks to rebuild said the council the 
commoditys leading forecasting body 
a decline in stocks after the estimated fall of 37 million tons 
this season would leave an uncomfortably narrow margin of security 
between world supply and demand the council said 
stocks built up during the wheat glut of the mid1980s are being 
depleted this season because of the sharp drop in 198889 wheat 
production caused by droughts in the united states and canada 
world wheat production for 198889 now is forecast by the council 
at 500 million tons 13 million below the previous seasons figure 
and 37 million down on the 198687 record 
tighter supplies this season have led to higher world prices 
which are encouraging growers to increase plantings for 198990 the 
council said 
world production of coarse grains principally corn now is 
estimated at 718 million tons for 198889 compared with 712 million 
forecast in october and the 198788 output of 804 million the 
council said 
the council has raised by 2 million tons to 33 million tons its 
estimate of 198889 soviet grain import needs thats up from 32 
million tons in 198788 its estimates of soviet wheat production 
remained unchanged at 200 million tons compared with 211 million in

editors note with the makeit or breakit season in full swing 
for the nations retailers the associated press takes an inside 
look at how two stores are handling the holiday rush in sidebyside 
stories from new york city and grand rapids mich 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
marcia massa used to buy 280 sweaters to stock 
her small manhattan boutique osidi but her expectations about 
holiday sales this year are slightly less ambitious 
id shake if i took that in said the store owner explaining 
how the long slump in apparel sales has colored her inventory 
decisions for the season 
while she did order a handful of 400 outfits with customers 
shopping for new years eve in mind the shops fashion statement 
this christmas is stylish yet inexpensive 
i think theres a big economic problem in the city said mrs 
massa during a reporters visit to osidi in gramercy park south and 
to the east of midtown manhattan 
but she also predicted the season is going to be ok i have 
no doubt about that 
when you think of shopping in manhattan big stores like macys 
or bloomingdales come to mind or on a smaller scale the scores of 
trendy shops on madison and columbus avenues 
osidi is nothing like any of those retailers it is a small 
neighborhood store that caters to women who live in what is a 
largely middleclass area 
the bulk of mrs massas business comes from regular customers 
many of whom she knows on a firstname basis and who dont like the 
big stores 
they periodically stop by just to see whats new and maybe chat 
and have a cup of coffee with the owner an outgoing woman who 
obviously loves what shes doing 
the store sells casual clothing and outfits that could be worn to 
work or to parties sweaters at osidi go for 48 to 70 and two 
and threepiece wool jersey outfits range from about 220 to the low 
300s at this time of the year there are a number of party dresses 
for about 200 
osidi does a lot of business in accessories silver antique and 
costume jewelry scarves lingerie belts and pocketbooks these 
lowticket items have been the boutiques biggest sellers so far 
this season 
holiday sales at osidi the stores name comes from the nickname 
of one of mrs massas friends have been erratic this year 
the friday after thanksgiving in contrast to the mob scene 
uptown at macys bloomingdales and other big stores osidi was 
quiet but mrs massa was unperturbed although that day was the 
traditional start of the christmas shopping season it has never 
been a big day at her store 
business picked up over the following weekend but sales have 
ebbed and flowed since then along with mrs massas outlook 
when volume picked up several days into december she was pleased 
but realistic its nothing like it should be 
like most other stores across the country osidi has had to lower 
its expectations because of the nearly 2yearold slump in retail 
spending mrs massa who has been a clothing retailer or 
manufacturer for more than 20 years said the 14 months since 
october 1987 have been the worst retail season shes seen 
she remembers painfully well oct 19 of last year the day of 
the stock market crash osidi took in 30 in sales 
since then her business has changed drastically some of osidis 
customers who included stockbrokers lost their jobs others 
became very wary they think twice is the way mrs massa puts 
it 
that customers not there any longer she said of the women 
who used to spend freely 
these days she says it is her regular customers who thank god 
keep me in business 
she knows shes not alone that other retailers have had the same

editors note with the makeit or breakit season in full swing 
for the nations retailers the associated press takes an inside 
look at how two stores are handling the holiday rush in sidebyside 
stories from new york city and grand rapids mich 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
back in february just weeks after 
holiday decorations were taken down lazarus department store 
executives began designing the look for christmas 1988 seahorse 
planters surrounded by a redandgold decor 
now 10 months later theres anxious optimism that the perpetual 
planning for the holiday season has helped shoppers get into the 
spending mood and will translate into another color green 
were way ahead of last year and im exceeding expectations for 
this year says a beaming jean hougard manager for michigans two 
lazarus stores in downtown grand rapids and the suburb of wyoming 
and for retailers those are the magic words 
in the month between thanksgiving and christmas many retailers 
make about half their annual profit and to make the most of the 
profit potential department store chains such as cincinnatibased 
lazarus are thinking christmas almost yearround 
the planning begins in february the promotional calendar the 
merchandise we expect to introduce how the stores are going to 
look says jerry gafford senior vice president of corporate 
affairs for lazarus which operates 43 stores in ohio indiana 
michigan kentucky and west virginia 
when the stores get the planning diagrams merchandise schedules 
and props from corporate headquarters they make adjustments for 
their individuals stores and begin the physical transition about two 
months before thanksgiving 
i spend about a week on 12foot ladders says jane mauchmar 
visuals manager for both stores 
mauchmar figures shes trimmed nearly 100 trees hung scores of 
9foot lengths of garland along with countless for someone 
special signs from the ceiling positioned thousands of 
poinsettias and set up numerous special displays many of which she 
guesses ultimately will be altered by rambunctious youngsters shes 
worked many 11hour days and sixday weeks to prepare 
its also up to mauchmer to make those stacks of heated ice 
scrapers for car windshields and golf ball monogrammers reach out 
and grab the shoppers attention 
its my job to make that gift look appealing to make it look 
irresistible she says with an exhausted laugh 
weather plays an important part too hougard was happy with the 
warmerthannormal temperatures and sunny skies on the day after 
thanksgiving traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year 
but she was even happier when it snowed dec 12 less than two weeks 
before the holiday 
people feel like shopping for christmas presents when it looks 
like christmas outside she says 
mood is important not just for the customers but for employees 
as well at a recent meeting the chains top corporate executives 
and the 42 store managers dressed up in santa claus beards and hats 
for a group photograph 
though the hours are longer and the work more tiring nearly 
every level of lazarus employee says the brisk business is uplifting 
everyones spirits are high when its busy like this the days 
just fly by said ruth alman a sales manager in the wyoming store 
the mood in both stores is in sharp contrast to the past 2 
years when employees were uncertain about their futures and 
headspinning takeovers became a topic of everyday conversation 
the two stores used to be known as herpolscheimers a 
117yearold fixture that was part of allied stores corp but in 
december 1986 allied was acquired in a hostile takeover by campeau 
corp 
the following month the two grand rapidsarea stores were 
incorporated into blocks a sister allied division that was sold to 
federated department stores inc in april 1987 
federated which owned the lazarus chain changed the blocks 
name to lazarus and in november 1987 the herpolscheimers signs 
came down and the bronzeandwhite lazarus signs went up 
but the stores which were changed from home stores with 
houseware departments to apparelandcosmetics only were far from 
ready for the christmas season 
people didnt know who we were stock levels were poor and we 
didnt have the right merchandise hougard said it took some 
time for us to build up our reputation and get lazarized 
the changes were traumatic but they werent over in may 1988 
campeau bought federated and its department store chains including 
lazarus 
this year there is upgraded merchandise plenty of stock and 
customers are responding there are also plenty of incentives 
including such giveaways as a free stuffed teddy bear that other 
department stores sell for up to 1750 with a purchase 
i see people walking in with gift lists and walking out with 
bags galore said ann vankoevering a sales supervisor in the 
downtown store its a challenge to keep the stock out 
what are they buying such nonnecessities as silk mens pajamas 
and boxer shorts at 24 a piece victorianstyle lingerie and 
adultstyle fashions for children 
instead of things they need like warm socks and coats theyre 
buying holiday sweaters with holly leaves vankoevering said i 
havent seen that before and i think its a good sign

us automakers said they would spend more than 
47 billion this year insuring the health of their employees 
officials of general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp say rising health care costs and use of insurance plans have 
pushed up healthcare spending in 1988 
its the system in general costs are escalating on all 
sides ford spokeswoman linda becker said its not just coming 
from the auto companies 
becker estimated that ford would pay out more than 1 billion for 
health care in 1988 up from the 920 million it paid in 1987 
gm spokeswoman patricia molloy declined to estimate how much the 
no 1 automaker would spend in health care but said there is a 
trend toward increasing costs gm spent 29 billion on health care 
last year 
she said the price of the insurance and utilization of it led to 
the upward trend in costs 
chryslers lloyd northard said comparing 1987 and 1988 costs was 
difficult because chrysler acquired american motors corp in august 
1987 
nevertheless he said such costs were rising about 15 percent 
annually and chrysler estimated it would spend more than 700 
million for employee health care this year

the united states will prevail in its fight 
with europe over agricultural subsidies because its position is on 
the side of the angels us trade representative clayton yeutter 
said wednesday 
yeutter who is being considered for the post of agriculture 
secretary in the bush administration also said the united states 
will retaliate against the european economic community if it 
implements a jan 1 ban on importing hormonetreated meat 
the united states has already decided it will strike against some 
european imports yeutter told the us chamber of commerce and 
that decision stands 
he said the united states has not found any evidence that 
hormonetreated animals endanger consumers health and therefore 
this is an illegal trade barrier the ball is now in europes 
court and time is getting short he said 
the 12nation eec said last week it intends to implement the ban 
which had already been put off for one year at the request of the 
united states the measure would affect some 170 million worth of 
us meat 
one possible compromise offered by the eec would exempt meat 
which is used for pet food and which accounts for about 50 percent 
of the imports eec officials have said the americans rejected that 
solution because they are determined to hold out for all or nothing 
as a matter of principle 
prospects for a compromise appeared to dim last week as relations 
between the two trading giants soured over an unrelated dispute 
about government support for farmers 
the impasse blocked other progress at an international trade 
meeting of 100 nations in montreal and left residues of bitterness 
on both sides of the atlantic to avert collapse of the montreal 
meeting which was a midterm review of the fouryear uruguay round 
of trade negotiations participants agreed to meet again in the 
first week of april in geneva 
lets hope reason will prevail in geneva yeutter said if 
the agriculture issue is not solved he warned theres obviously 
jeopardy to the entire uruguay round 
the controversy stems from a us demand that all members of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt abolish their farm 
supports which distort trade on the world market the eec under 
strong pressure from its large rural population advocates reduction 
in subsidies but not elimination 
were on the side of the angels on this issue yeutter said 
and everyone including our european allies knows this 
the united states contends that elimination of farm supports will 
lower government expenditure and ease the burden on consumers and 
taxpayers around the world 
yeutter predicted political pressure on the europeans would mount 
between now and april and political pressure can generate 
political will to change positions the pressure is expected to 
come from agricultural exporters such as argentina and australia 
whose farmers are having trouble competing against the subsidized 
european and american farm exports

grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed 
today on the chicago board of trade with little fresh news in the 
markets to influence prices 
the quiet opening in the corn and wheat pits suggested traders 
were still holding to expectations for largescale export sales of 
us grain to the soviet union analysts said 
reports of a pickup in soybean meal exports last week lent some 
support to the soybean complex but buying interest was limited by a 
change to wetter weather in the south american soybean belt where 
planting continues 
we saw some reasonably good shower activity in brazil yesterday 
and over the next few days it looks like scattered light showers 
said dale gustafson a grainmarket analyst with drexel burnham 
lambert inc in chicago thats keeping the market from getting 
too strong here at the moment 
in early trading wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 427 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cent lower with december at 265 a bushel oats were 
unchanged across the board with march at 220 a bushel soybeans 
were unchanged to 2 cents higher with january at 765 a bushel 
cattle futures were slightly higher while pork futures were mixed 
in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 20 cent to 35 cent higher with decem the socalled 
montgomery amendment was passed by congress after 
governors in some states began objecting and blocking deployment 
of their national guard units on training assignments to central 
america 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss who wrote the provision 
last week condemned the 8th circuit ruling 
if 50 governors are allowed to veto guard missions because they 
dont like the way our foreign policy is administered it would have 
an adverse impact on training and would raise questions about the 
availability of the guard to meet its considerable defense 
responsibilities he said 
pending the results of any appeal the only states affected by 
the ruling at those in the 8th circuit arkansas iowa minnesota 
missouri nebraska north dakota and south dakota

new plant probably in the gorky area

on such acquisitions made before jan 1 when some tax benefits now

millions cars and light trucks be sold in the united states

developer donald trump has notified 
the federal government that he wants to buy 15 percent or more of 
caesars world inc stock and that he may seek controlling interest 
the hotel and casino company says 
in a statement issued late tuesday caesars officials said they 
were notified that trump has asked the government for a ruling on 
whether his investment in caesars would violate federal antitrust 
laws 
the disclosure sent caesars common stock sharply higher today 
in midday trading on the new york stock exchange caesars was up 4 
a share to 2925 
but gaming analysts said trump who already owns two casinos in 
atlantic city and is building a third would face regulatory 
obstacles to a move on caesars in both nevada where caesars is 
based and new jersey which prohibits single ownership of no more 
than three casinos 
the los angelesbased caesars owns the highly profitable caesars 
hotel casino here and the caesars palace and caesars tahoe casino 
hotels in nevada 
neither trumps filing nor caesars statement indicated how much 
caesars stock trump may already own tuesdays filing was made under 
the hartscottrodino act which requires companies or individuals 
to seek such a ruling once they have acquired 15 million worth of 
stock in a company 
at tuesdays closing price of 2525 per share that would 
translate to about 590000 shares or about 24 percent of caesars 
245 million common shares outstanding 
susan heilbron executive vice president of the turmp 
organization said trump had no comment on the filing other than to 
confirm that it was made she declined to say how much caesars 
stock if any trump already owns 
according to the caesars statement trump indicated he has the 
good faith intention subject to price availability and necessary 
approvals if any to acquire 15 percent of caesars stock 
trumps filing also said he may decide to seek control of 
caesars through the acquisition of 50 percent or more of the 
outstanding voting securities 
due to the confusing content of this notice caesars is 
unable to ascertain mr trumps plans at this time and has no 
further comment the company said in its release 
one gaming analyst marvin roffman of janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia said he doubts that trump is serious about 
making a move to acquire caesars and said any such move would face 
serious regulatory opposition in new jersey and nevada 
the gaming board in nevada has come out and said it does not 
particularly relish hostile takeovers and i can tell you that this 
would be a hostile takeover because the company will vigorously 
defend its independence he said 
new jersey gaming regulators have also strongly opposed hostile 
takeovers of casino companies 
trump now owns trump plaza and trump castle casino hotels in 
atlantic city and is building the massive taj mahal casino hotel 
which should be complete in 15 months

in its second rescue of a troubled texas retailer 
an australian property and retail company has signed a letter of 
intent to buy the frost bros chain for an undisclosed sum 
hooker corp ltd bought 80 percent of the houstonbased sakowitz 
inc in november 1987 bringing it out of bankruptcy robert t 
sakowitz the chains chairman and a member of its founding family 
held the remaining 20 percent 
on tuesday hooker announced that lj hooker group its wholly 
owned subsidiary would fold the san antoniobased frost chain into 
sakowitz operate all the stores under the sakowitz name and put 
robert sakowitz in charge of the combined operation 
both chains are highpriced merchandisers catering to wealthy 
customers and emphasizing upscale womens apparel both also operate 
four stores all the sakowitz outlets are in houston while frosts 
are in houston san antonio and austin 
in a prepared statement hooker executive chairman george herscu 
said the proposed expansion of sakowitz inc is a rare 
opportunity to bring together two of the finest names in texas 
specialty retailing targeted to the upscale and qualityconscious 
customer 
frost bros filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 
11 of federal bankruptcy laws in new york in april the financially 
troubled retailer had gone public in an effort to improve its 
financial picture but that plan fell through with the stock market 
crash of oct 19 1987 
sam wyly and his wife torie steele wyly of dallas had bought 
the chain from manhatten industries of new york for an estimated 50 
million in august 1986 and wyly said at the time he would 
concentrate on the mercedes benz niche in retailing 
between the purchase date and the bankruptcy filing the number 
of stores was cut from 13 to nine more stores were closed after 
filing including two in houston at the galleria and memorial city 
shopping centers frost continues to operate its third houston store 
near the exclusive river oaks neighborhood 
the company had 1985 revenue of 120 million more recent figures 
were not available 
hooker based in sydney australia is an aggressive buyer of 
us retailers and a real estate developer in the united states and 
australia 
it bought 80 percent of sakowitz in 1987 for 75 million under 
an amended plan of reorganization filed in federal bankruptcy court 
sakowitz was the nations last remaining highfashion speciality 
retailer controlled by a founding family member it filed for 
chapter 11 reorganization protection in the wake of financial 
troubles stemming partly from the economic slump in the southwest 
at the time of the filing in 1985 sakowitz had 17 stores and six 
boutiques in texas oklahoma and arkansas a number of which since 
have been sold 
other hooker corp holdings include b altman and co the new 
yorkbased department store chain which it acquired in october 1987 
for an undisclosed price and parisian inc the birmingham ala 
specialty retailer which it acquired along with parisians major 
shareholders in september 1987 in a 252 million buyout 
hooker also is developing four regional shopping malls in the 
united states averaging 15 million square feet each

the us trade deficit narrowed to 1035 
billion in october the smallest imbalance in three months the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said that the merchandise trade gap 
between what the united states imports and what it sells overseas 
fell by 31 percent from a september deficit of 1067 billion 
the decline represented the second consecutive monthly 
improvement but many analysts were unimpressed saying after 
monthly fluctuations the deficit has been essentially flat for 
several months 
i think the improvement in the trade deficit has stalled out 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co we still have 
a very heavy flow of imported goods especially on the manufacturing 
side 
the reagan administration was more optimistic commerce secretary 
c william verity cited the progress made so far noting that 
exports have climbed by 28 percent over the past 10 months 
while the trend continues to be favorable our trade deficit is 
still very large eliminating it which is our goal poses a major 
challenge verity said in a statement 
financial markets which in the past have reacted violently to 
disappointing trade figures for the most part shrugged off todays 
report the dow jones industrial average had fallen by about 5 
points shortly before midday 
in a separate report the federal reserve board said that the 
operating rate at us factories mines and utilities rose 02 
percentage point last month to 842 percent its highest level in 
nine years 
that report which was in line with economists predictions is 
likely to intensify cononcern about inflation as capacity use edges 
toward 85 percent economists fear factories will have trouble 
producing enough goods to meet demand leading to shortages and 
price increases 
the october trade improvement came from a 17 percent drop in 
imports which declined to 3802 billion on a seasonally adjusted 
basis 
this decline offset a smaller 11 percent drop in us exports 
which edged down to 2767 billion 
even with the small setback in exports us overseas sales 
remained near record high levels for the first 10 months of this 
year export sales are running 283 percent above the same period in 
1987 
this remarkable surge in export sales has been responsible for 
almost half of americas overall economic growth this year as 
american manufacturers have hired workers and stepped up output to 
meet demand 
through october the overall merchendise trade deficit has been 
running at an annual rate of 1361 billion 20 percent below the 
alltime high imbalance of 1703 billion recorded last year 
presidentelect bush cited this improvement during the 
presidential campaign as proof that the reagan administrations 
policies of solving the countrys trade woes were working 
the administration launched an effort in september 1985 to drive 
the value of the dollar lower to make american goods more 
competitive on overseas markets while driving up the price of 
imports 
the effort took far longer to bear fruit than many had expected 
and has to this day failed to halt the steady increase in imports 
which are running 83 percent higher so far this year over 1987 
the 1035 billion october deficit was the lowest since a 947 
billion july imbalance that had been the smallest deficit since 
december 1984 
the trade report us trade representative clayton yeutter said 
was good news on which to close out 1988 he added that the 
deficit was now falling at a satisfactory pace 
todays good news on trade followed a report tuesday showing that 
the deficit in the broadest measure of trade the current account 
fell to 3089 billion in the julyseptember quarter the lowest 
level in three years 
the current account method adds the value of investments and 
services to the value of goods reflected in todays report 
many economists are worried that despite the dramatic declines in 
the trade deficit this year the improvement is in danger of 
stalling next year a development that could push the country into a 
recession 
some economists contend that the dollar must fall further to make 
us goods even more competitive and dampen americans appetite for 
imports other analysts are urging the bush administrative to waste 
no time in launching an aggressive effort to open more foreign 
markets to american products 
the october report is likely to provide ammunition to these 
critics because of a 341 percent jump in the trade deficit with 
japan the trade imbalance with japan the largest with any country 
surged to 55 billion in october the highest it has been in a year 
the deficit with taiwan was unchanged at 14 billion while the 
deficit with western europe rose to 11 billion 200 million 
higher than in october 
the deficits with individual countries are not adjusted to take 
into account normal monthly variations in trade flows before the 
seasonal adjustment the overall deficit would have been 1175 
billion reflecting the fact that october is a big import month as 
retailers stock up for the christmas season

dow jones amp co inc the publisher of the wall 
street journal said wednesday it expects its profit for 1988 will 
be up 11 percent to 14 percent from last year due principally to 
nonrecurring gains 
but warren h phillips dow jones chairman and chief executive 
officer said that if nonrecurring items were excluded the 
companys earnings would be down 6 percent to 10 percent from a year 
earlier

advertising linage and revenue at its business publications in the

revenue of 131 billion 
the company expects nonrecurring gains of 68 million or 70 
cents a share this year compared with 294 million or 30 cents a 
share a year earlier 
excluding those gains phillips said dow jones earnings for the 
year would have fallen to between 158 million or 163 a share

the carnage in the financial community and among the investing 
public that followed last years market crash he said

soybean meal linked to speculation about increased export sales 
analysts said 
corn prices also closed higher while wheat futures finished 
narrowly mixed 
soybean meal traders noted recent purchases of us meal by 
venezuela and there were rumors of soviet interest as well and 
that seemed to be the driving force said dale gustafson a 
grainmarket analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the strength in meal allowed the beans to rally and was 
successful in bringing up soybean oil as well he said 
meal for delivery in january closed 510 higher at 25020 per 
metric ton soybeans gained as much as 14 cents a bushel 
corn also was supported by rumors of soviet buying interest but 
wheat trading was light amid a lack of fresh news affecting that

british petroleum co plc said wednesday it is 
negotiating to sell its minerals operations to rtz corp plc a deal 
that analysts said could generate 3 billion to 4 billion for bp 
bp said the talks were exclusively with rtz a british mining 
company with interests worldwide and exclude any minerals 
businesses of bp canada 
rumors of the talks have circulated for the last week and have 
helped drive british petroleums shares up and rtzs down 
british petroleum did not elaborate on the statement except to 
say that a further announcement will be made in due course 
its minerals interests include activities in gold silver copper 
and uranium mines in the united states australia papua new guinea 
mexico and south africa 
british petroleum has considered selling off its gold operations 
for some time in september it postponed indefinitely the pricing 
date for an initial public offering of about 15 percent of the gold 
subsidiary 
as speculation about the talks mounted last week some analysts 
said british petroleum would use the proceeds of the sale to buy 
into existing businesses possibly even including a bid for unocal 
corp of the united states 
other analysts noted that it could use the cash earned either to 
reduce debt or buy back shares held by the kuwait investment office 
the kuwaiti government body currently owns 2168 percent of british 
petroleum and has been told by the british government to reduce its 
holding to 99 percent within a provisional timetable of a year 
the money could give british petroleum flexibility in bargaining 
with kuwait over a sale price for some of the 700 million shares 
which at current market prices have a total value of about 18 
billion pounds equaling about 33 billion at current exchange 
rates 
british petroleum shares closed wednesday at the equivalent of 
474 a share up 11 cents rtzs shares fell 11 cents to finish at 
701 a share 
analysts said it could take weeks to complete negotiations over 
the sale of the minerals businesses

the board of montedison on wednesday approved 
a joint venture with italys stateowned enichem to create a 
chemical company that is among the 10 largest in the world with 
annual sales equaling about 10 billion 
the approval was the final hurdle for creating the new company 
enimont which is scheduled to begin operations jan 1 
montedison chairman raul gardini told a news conference that 
enimont will have an initial sixmonth transitory regime that could 
be phased out earlier if parliament approves a legislation designed 
to give montedison a major tax break 
enichem the chemical unit of italys energy group ente nazionale 
idrocarburi eni and montedison each will own 40 percent of 
enimont the balance will be held privately 
the merger of montedisons bulk chemical interests with enichem 
into enimont will play a key role in cutting montedisons level of 
consolidated debt the private group which is 42 percent owned by 
feruzzi finanziaria of the ferruzzi family will transfer around 
29 billion of its debt to enimont 
at the same time the proposed new tax legislation will cut to

regarded president and chief executive officer and bernard j 
morgan a vice chairman and chief executive of fidelity bank in 
philadelphia late tuesday

executive vice president and head of its international department 
based in london 
robert r ferguson jr first fidelitys chairman will assume 
potes duties

between 145 million and 190 million in the fourth quarter due to 
problem loans the company earned about 210 million or 362 per 
share for the first nine months of 1988

doubledose of negative news by issuing a statement promising our 
business and that of our constituent institutions is sound

that

in closing trading wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
first fidelitys stock fell 850 per share to 27 in active trading

management in the firm that people perceive as a real problem 
theres no way to prevent all the activity novek said of 
wednesdays trading there are a lot of people who are looking at 
this as a very good buy right now and a lot who are washing their 
hands of the company 
the projected fourthquarter loss was attributed to certain 
commercial real estate loans and loans made to some international 
commercial customers said fidelity spokesman paul j levine 
the losses in commercial and real estate projects were 
concentrated among a small number of borrowers at fidelity bank the 
companys philadelphia branch with a large proportion of the 
problem loans made to a single borrower the company said 
in its wednesday editions the wall street journal identified the 
borrower as historic landmarks for living inc a major renovator 
and syndicator of landmark buildings that is based in philadelphia 
neither historic landmarks spokeswoman deb addis nor levine would 
comment on the report wednesday 
the journal said the loans in question predated the 13 billion 
merger completed in february 1988 of newarkbased first fidelity 
inc and philadelphiabased fidelcor inc 
the merger created one of the 20 largest bank holding companies 
in the nation with assets of 30 billion

petroleum imports rose sharply in november and 
domestic crude oil production took its biggest monthly dip this 
year the american petroleum institute reported wednesday 
imports jumped 141 percent to an average 795 million barrels a 
day from 697 million barrels in november 1987 with imports of 
gasoline and other refined products reaching their highest level 
since 1974 according to apis monthly statistical report 
daily domestic crude oil production fell 43 percent the 
biggest decline this year to an average of 804 million barrels a 
day due mainly to a slowdown in output in the lower 48 states 
alaska production remained steady at around 2 million barrels a day 
the report said 
analysts said strong demand in november continued to consume the 
growing imports as total supplies of crude oil and refined products 
declined 36 percent compared with the same time last year 
the institute said lower world crude prices helped boost imports 
for the first 11 months of 1988 to their highest level since 1980 as 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries continued its 
runaway production 
however opec members agreed last month to lower cartel 
production in the first six months of 1989 world crude prices have 
firmed slightly since the accord in anticipation of a cutback 
in november crude oil imports averaged 53 million barrels a 
day up 78 percent from november 1987 the report said 
product imports rose 29 percent to an average 27 million barrels 
a day daily gasoline imports reached a new high of 630000 barrels 
for the month up 80000 barrels a day from a year ago distillate 
and residual fuel oil imports also were strong 
in the past three years daily imports are up by 22 million 
barrels with increasing demand accounting for about twothirds of 
the increase and declining domestic production accounting for most 
of the remainder the api said 
but despite high imports total inventories fell by 5 million 
barrels in november api said inventories have fallen about 18 
million barrels since july or more than 50 million barrels after 
accounting for seasonal factors 
combined deliveries surged more than 13 million barrels a day 
an 81 percent increase from the yearago period 
gasoline deliveries rose 36 percent or nearly 5 million 
barrels even as motorists began cutting back on travel gasoline 
production rose 15 percent while gasoline stocks declined 6 million 
barrels from last november 
distillate deliveries rose 73 percent despite continued mild 
weather analysts said the rise probably reflected investors taking 
advantage of weak prices 
the report also said utilization of the nations refineries 
increased to 832 percent from 823 percent last november

the dollar retreated wednesday hurt by what 
money dealers called rumors of a hike in west german interest rates 
and a negative market reaction to the monthly us trade report 
gold prices rose slightly in us trading after easing marginally 
abroad republic national bank quoted bullion at 421 a troy ounce 
as of 4 pm est up from 41950 at the same time tuesday 
foreignexchange strategists said speculation that the west 
german central bank would tighten domestic credit conditions on 
thursday raised demand for the west german mark and consequently 
increased the supply of dollars in the market pushing down the us 
currencys value 
pressure on the dollar intensified after the commerce department 
said the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 1035 billion 
in october from 1067 billion the month before although the 
shortfall was the smallest in three months the market had 
anticipated an imbalance of about 105 billion 
the figures came out in line with expectations and since 
theres overriding bearish sentiment to the dollar people just 
resumed selling it said stuart yannalfo a trader at the new york 
commodities futures firm refco inc the only thing that could have 
prevented it would have been a really good number like 7 or 8 
billion 
the monthly trade figures vary widely but have enormous potential 
to affect the dollars value because they are considered one of the 
most visible indicators of us competitiveness and economic 
strength 
a widening deficit suggests exports are weakening and the dollar 
will fall while a narrowing shortfall suggests exports are 
strengthening and the dollar will rise 
in tokyo where markets closed before the trade report was 
released the dollar rose 029 japanese yen to 12335 yen later in 
london the dollar dropped to 12260 yen by the time trading ended

million to 157 million the industry record of 163 million in 
sales was set in 1986 
he said the 154 million estimate for the 1989 calendar year 
would be down from this year but still a good industry 
id be worried when our market share begins to run into 
problems he said fords us market share for cars is 217 
percent he said 
during the meeting poling also said 
buyer incentives would continue during the coming year but i 
dont see us leading the charge he said ford would remain 
competitive when other automakers offer incentives 
discussions are under way for assembly of a car probably 
modeled on fords west germanmade scorpio in the soviet union the 
car probably would be made in an existing or new plant in the gorky 
area 
poling also said fords north american earnings likely will be 
down from last year resulting in smaller profitsharing payments to 
ford employees early in 1989 
earlier this week general motors corp announced profitsharing 
payments of about 200 for each hourly and salaried worker the 
first time since 1985 that the nations no 1 automaker has made 
such payments 
i think it fords profitsharing payment will be more than 
200 poling said smiling 
poling said a proposal for a 15centpergallon gasoline tax 
increase should be considered by the incoming bush administration 
only if other deficit reduction measures especially federal 
spending cuts prove unsuccessful 
he said a 5centayear phasein of such a tax increase would 
soften the blow on the auto industry and provisions such as tax 
credits could be made for lowincome taxpayers

when there also were nine selling days 
car sales fell 105 percent and light truck sales dropped 117 
percent in early december

read she said its not surprising that theyre down a little 
bit given that december is bad for auto sales anyway 
in any recent 10day period youve had so much noise in the 
period that its hard to make a comparison sudol added that 
noise is incentives

healthy as the calendar year draws to a close the companies are 
looking forward to what could be the secondbest sales year in 
history behind the 163 million vehicles sold in 1986

yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange as a dockworkers strike in 
brazil ignited speculation about shriveling supplies 
on other markets prices of copper precious metals energy and 
most agricultural futures also rose while stockindex futures 
retreated

december contract at 135 a pound and the heavily traded march

contract since july 25 
analysts said the brazilian dockworkers strike which began 
tuesday and halted shipments from the key coffee port of santos was 
not expected to last long 
but the strike focused the markets attention on dwindling 
warehouse stocks of coffee just as consumption approaches its annual 
peak and on the steadily deteriorating cropproduction outlook in 
brazil due to a drought in that countrys major coffeegrowing 
regions 
ruiz said supplies that ordinarily arrive in the united states 
from central america at this time of year have been delayed by heavy 
rains and another 1 million bags of coffee recently authorized for 
release onto the market by the international coffee organizations 
pricesupport formula has not yet occurred he said 
since june brazils coffeegrowing regions have received normal 
monthly precipitation in only one month october said kim 
badenhop an analyst wiht merrill lynch capital markets inc for the 
year to date precipitation in most of those areas is less than 50 
percent of normal he said 
the dry weather has lessened the quality of the 198889 brazilian 
crop now being harvested and reduced projections for the 198990 
crop from original estimates of more than 40 million bags to about 
25 million bags 
copper futures rallied strongly on new yorks commodity exchange

mercantile exchange with january at 60450 a troy ounce on the 
commodity exchange gold was 160 to 180 higher with february at

steel imports rose 71 percent to 176 million 
tons for the first 10 months of 1988 but strong domestic demand 
held foreigners share of the market near the goal of the us quota 
program according to figures released wednesday 
over 10 months of 1988 imports accounted for 204 percent of the 
market practically the goal set by the reagan administration when 
it introduced import quotas in 1984 
imports in october declined to 15 million tons from 164 million 
tons in september and 161 million tons in october 1987 
the figures based on commerce department data were released in 
washington dc by the american iron and steel institute 
the rival american institute for imported steel said that after 
deducting 25 million tons of steel imports bought by domestic mills 
for further processing 10month imports totaled 15 million tons or 
175 percent of the market the percentage figure is well below the 
185 percent target set for finished steel products 
with quotas expiring in nine months and much being heard for 
and against renewal overriding factors in any decision in addition 
to interest of domestic steel producers must also be those of 
domestic steel users fabricators and manufacturers of 
steelintensive products whose very existence creates the market for 
both domestic steel producers and importers said erwin l klein 
president of the importers institute and vice chairman of the 
importing firm steelinter usa

mexico is asking its creditors to reduce its 
annual foreign debt payments to the equivalent of 3 percent of its 
gross national product from the present 5 percent according to 
treasury secretary pedro aspe 
aspe told federal senators and deputies on tuesday that the new 
administration of president carlos salinas de gortari had outlined 
the proposal to creditor banks in europe and the united states 
aspe did not disclose details of the mexican proposal but the 
mexico city financial daily el financiero on wednesday said the 
proposal would nearly halve mexicos anticipated 16 billion debt 
service bill in 1989 
the mexico city newspaper el universal on wednesday reported the 
proposal won a sympathetic response from european bankers but has 
encountered obstacles and resistance in the united states because of 
the change of government there 
the newspaper said us bankers have adopted a waitandsee 
attitude toward the mexican proposal at least until presidentelect 
george bush is inaugurated on jan 20 
salinas who was sworn in dec 1 repeatedly has warned that 
mexico cannot continue to devote 5 percent of its gross national 
product each year to service its 102 billion foreign debt the 
developing worlds secondhighest after brazil 
mexico will pay an estimated 14 billion in interest and 
principal on the debt in 1988 
el financiero said aspe told a meeting of labor leaders on monday 
that salinas negotiating team wants a debt restructuring agreement 
that would target a greater proportion of mexican payments toward 
debt principal 
salinas also wants creditor banks to acknowledge the real value 
of mexican debt paper as determined by the secondary market and to 
reschedule mexicos servicing payments accordingly the newspaper 
said 
the secondary market has valued mexicos debt at 50 cents on the 
dollar 
mexico city newspapers on wednesday reported that aspe plans to 
visit washington in the next few days to take up the proposal with 
mexicos creditors 
creditor banks have balked this year on moves toward mexican 
debtreduction proposals 
mexico did reduce its debt principal by 11 billion through a 
usbacked bond auction earlier this year but the reduction was 
far less than officials originally hoped for 
aspes disclosure of the new reduction target came after salinas 
named former treasury secretary gustavo petricioli as the mexican 
ambassador to washington yet another sign of the presidents 
eagerness to achieve rapid progress in restructuring negotiations

texas air corp parent of continental and eastern 
airlines said wednesday it was withholding payment of preferred 
stock dividends because its subsidiaries were not meeting earnings 
objectives 
the dividends which texas air said would amount to about 52 
million affect 65 percent depository preferred stock 12 percent 
depository preferred stock 6 percent cumulative convertible junior 
preferred stock and 15 percent 20 cumulative preferred stock 
depending on the stock dividends would have been payable between 
dec 31 1988 and jan 31 1989 
in a statement texas air said its cash levels have been 
substantial throughout the year and now exceed 700 million but 
provisions of the companys unsecured debt indentures incorporate 
overall earnings objectives that have not been met 
texas air singled out eastern airlines which it said continues 
to experience serious operating losses 
texas air said the dividends would be paid later when profits 
offset the cumulative effects of recent losses the proposed sale of 
assets such as the eastern shuttle also could aid in the resumption 
of the dividend the company said 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo is proposing that the shuttle 
one of the airlines few profitable divisions be sold to new york 
real estate developer donald trump for 365 million the deal is 
being fought by easterns unions which have been at odds with 
lorenzo 
eastern has lost 1 billion in the last decade including a 113 
million loss in the third quarter 
texas air lost 494 million in the first nine months of 1988 
more than double the 200 million in losses amassed during the same 
period a year ago

cbs a failure last month in its bid for the 
barcelona olympics shocked baseball and the television industry 
wednesday by winning network rights for 1 billion over four years 
nbc which has prided itself as beig the baseball network 
since 1947 said it was outbid by a substantial margin and accused 
its rival of irresponsibility 
the new contract is the largest ever awarded one network for 
sports it gives cbs the world series in 1990 along with both league 
playoffs the allstar game and a 12game package during the season 
brent musburger who hosts the networks coverage of major 
events was beaming 
today was like having an early christmas and a dream come 
true said musburger who umpired in the midwest league in 1959 
ive worked for cbs for 20 years and its the one sport we never 
covered never in my wildest dreams did i think wed get it all 
baseball will award a contract for cable rights next month and 
expects to earn an additional 75 million to 100 million a year 
nbc and abc which have shared baseball since 1975 will televise 
games next season for 240 million under the final year of the 
current sixyear 11 billion pact 
nbc did not release details of its bid and arthur watson 
president of nbc sports criticized cbs 
we made every effort to keep it watson said regretfully 
someone bid far more than was responsible everybody evaluates 
things differently that bid was beyond our reach let them explain 
that bid 
on the new york stock exchange cbs closed at 16925 up 137 
from tuesday general electric nbcs parent dropped 87 cents to 
45 
neal pilson president of cbs sports said losing the barcelona 
rights had nothing to do with his networks desire to wrest baseball 
from nbc 
pilson and watson continued a public squabble that began after 
cbs spent 243 million for the barcelona rights 
watson at the time said cbs overbid but after nbc won the 
barcelona rights for 401 million watson implied his earlier 
comments were intended to trick cbs into lowering its bid for the 
summer games 
asked if he thought watsons remarks were uncalled for pilson 
said wednesday art watson can run his business and ill run mine 
you can ask him what happened to nbcs bid on major league baseball 
looking at the numbers i think were better off spending a 
billion dollars over four years than half a billion over two weeks 
although wednesdays agreement was approved unanimously in a 
conference call of the 26 club owners many details have not been 
completed commissioner peter ueberroth who wants to increase the 
number of day world series games said that matter still had to be 
negotiated 
cbs officials said day games would be considered but they also 
said they were counting on baseball to improve the networks 
lastplace primetime schedule 
ueberroth said that on monday he sent the three networks a form 
listing the different events they could bid for the networks were 
offered the playoffs world series allstar game and regularseason 
packages of 12 and 30 games cbs and abc bid for the 12game package 
and nbc bid for 30 games 
the networks individually came to ueberroths office with their 
bids on tuesday pilson said he was asked back to explain details 
and on wednesday cbs learned it had won 
meanwhile ueberroth said he had narrowed the cable bidders to 
four espn turner broadcastings tnt network usa network and 
sportschannel america 
phil jones general manager of kctv in kansas city mo and a 
former chairman of the cbs affiliates board said the baseball 
contract bolstered his confidence in laurence a tisch president 
and ceo of cbs inc 
it demonstrates that larry tisch is in this business to win and 
people ought to quit speculating about whether he will go after 
premier events jones said 
thomas winner director of media at the campbellmithunesty 
advertising agency was unsure cbs could make money on the deal 
the important fact from their point of view is they have 12 
months of quality sports programming he said they are 
therefore the only network that can talk in that fashion 
cbs already has rights to broadcast the national football league 
the national basketball association the ncaa basketball tournament 
and the us open tennis tournament

the price of caesars world inc stock 
surged wednesday after developer donald trump surprised the gaming 
industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he 
could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company 
without violating antitrust laws 
trump filed notice on tuesday with the us justice department 
and the federal trade commission of his desire to possibly purchase 
more than 50 percent of caesars world common stock 
although neither trump nor caesars will say how much trump 
already owns the filing was made under the hartscottrodino act 
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once 
they have acquired at least 15 million worth of stock in a company 
the filing was disclosed after the markets closed on tuesday but 
caesars wolrld stock rose sharply in active trading on wednesday 
in consolidated new york stock exchange trading caesars world 
rose 425 to 2950 a share at that price its 245 million shares 
are worth about 723 million 
caesars world officials refused comment on trumps notice which 
it disclosed in a statement late tuesday 
the los angelesbased company said in the statement that due to 
the confusing content of this notice it is unable to ascertain 
trumps plans 
trump also declined comment such filings are very confidential 
and hes been advised not to comment said susan heilbron a 
spokeswoman for trump 
caesars world owns three gaming halls caesars hotel casino in 
atlantic city and caesars palace and caesars tahoe in nevada 
in the filing trump said he has the good faith intention 
subject to price availability and necessary approvals if any to 
acquire such number of shares to hold in excess of 15 percent of 
the outstanding voting securities of caesars world 
but he went on in the filing to say it is possible that he 
may decide to seek control of caesars by buying 50 percent or 
more of its stock 
gaming analysts spent a good part of wednesday pondering trumps 
latest move 
marvin roffman of the investment firm janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia said caesars is one of the bestmanaged 
companies in the industry and we felt it was worth up to 40 a 
share 
but roffman said new jersey gaming regulators would probably 
block any highlyleveraged hostile effort to acquire caesars world 
donald trumps style is not cash its to borrow roffman 
said 
under new jersey law trump can own only three gaming halls so 
far he is licensed for two trump plaza and trump castle casino 
hotels a third the massive taj mahal is under construction and 
expected to be completed in 1990 
i think hell sell one anyway in the future because it doesnt 
make sense to market three in atlantic city roffman said but 
the bottom line with this caesars notice is that donald trump is 
interested in making money not owning another casino he simply 
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a 
profit 
this is not the first time that trump has invested in a rival 
casino company 
he made a 30 million profit in holiday corp stock and a 24 
million profit on bally manufacturing corp stock he also purchased 
a small amount of stock in the golden nugget corp a move that his 
competitor golden nugget chairman steve wynn called a publicity 
stunt

the environmental protection agency said 
wednesday it plans to crack down on stations that sell leaded 
gasoline at far cheaper prices and allow motorists to put it in 
nolead cars 
lead disables pollution control equipment causing increases of 
up to 80 percent in emissions of pollutants the epa says 
the agency said it had written refiners and marketers warning 
that inspectors would pay close attention to stations where leaded 
gasoline is priced significantly below unleaded regular 
there are no federal penalties against individual motorists who 
use the wrong fuel but epa may impose civil fines of up to 10000 
on stations that permit it some states however make it an offense 
for individuals too 
there really isnt any excuse for pricing unleaded above 
leaded since leaded now costs more to make said richard wilson 
head of the mobile sources division in epas air pollution program 
the agency has only 20 inspectors of its own but hires an 
unspecified number through contractors these inspectors for years 
have been checking station tanks and in cooperation with local 
police deparments making spot checks of cars on the road 
those checks consistently show that one car in five has used the 
wrong fuel or had its pollution control devices tampered with at 
some time at present epa estimates that 6 percent of cars 
requiring nolead are using leaded gasoline down from more than 10 
percent a few years ago 
lead compounds have been added to gasoline since the 1920s 
because they are the cheapest antiknock additive by far until the 
1970s car engines also relied on the compounds for valve seat 
lubrication some heavy duty engines did until the mid1980s 
concern over pollution as well as lead toxicity led epa in 1985 
to order maximum permissible lead reduced by more than 90 percent 
from 11 gram per gallon to 01 gram 
this means higher refining costs to produce a given octane 
platts oilgram a trade publication on monday reported wholesale 
prices for leaded up to 2 cents a gallon higher than regular 
unleaded except in the rocky mountains and farther west where the 
two grades generally were the same 
energy department figures show leaded gasoline sold retail at 47 
cents per gallon cheaper than regular unleaded for the first nine 
months of 1988 
currently leaded gasoline is 15 percent of the market compared 
with 21 percent a year ago 
joe koach executive director of the service station dealers of 
america said epas threats to fine dealers 10000 are 
assinine 
koach complained its difficult for dealers to control 
misfueling weve had reports of dealers threatened with violence 
for trying to stop customers from buying leaded 
independent dealers he said are pressured to adhere to retail 
prices their suppliers decide on why is leaded gasoline still 
cheaper its the oil companies policy koach said 
ralph stow of amoco a major national brand that has stopped all 
leaded sales except in alcohol blends in five midwestern states 
said our dealers set their own prices 
in ashland ky dan lacy of ashland oil co a midwestern 
marketer with 2000 outlets said leaded gasoline had been priced at 
or above unleaded regular for several months now at stations his 
company serves 
the american petroleum institute the largest industry trade 
group said in a statement that misfueling was declining and would 
continue to do so and epa should ensure that both the service 
station operator and the individual motorist are prevented from 
engaging in this practice

liggett group inc announced wednesday that 
it is introducing a new cigarette called pyramid which will be 
available to retailers at carton prices comparable to those of 1980 
liggett executives say pyramid represents a new lowprice 
category that is a departure from the direction the tobacco industry 
has been taking 
cigarette prices have climbed fairly steadily since 1981 with 
the primary reason being the major excise tax increase by 
congress said hal a grant senior vice president of liggett 
group 
the difference between the price of generic cigarettes and 
fullprice cigarettes is narrowing he said and the company felt 
the time was right to establish a third tier of cigarettes 
what were going to offer smokers who are showing this clear 
preference for brandedpricevalue cigarettes is the ability to buy 
a quality product using their 1988 purchasing power at early 1980 
prices thats what the pyramid is all about grant said 
he said the savings to consumers could range from 250 to 5 per 
carton depending on the state in which it is bought or the price of 
the brand that it is being compared against 
the cigarette industry today is as competitive as it was in the 
early 1980s grant said and liggett the smallest of the six major 
cigarette manufacturers has to be innovative 
when faced with growing marketing pressures we began looking 
for nonconventional ways to counter bigspending efforts by the 
majors he said 
we cant outspend them so we try and outinnovate them with 
another new category 
the company began shipping pyramid cigarettes on monday
